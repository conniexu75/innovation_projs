https://openalex.org/W2098163379,"Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG expansion that results in expansion of a polyglutamine tract at the extreme N terminus of huntingtin (htt). htt with polyglutamine expansion is proapoptotic in different cell types. Here, we show that caspase inhibitors diminish the toxicity of htt. Additionally, we define htt itself as an important caspase substrate by generating a site-directed htt mutant that is resistant to caspase-3 cleavage at positions 513 and 530 and to caspase-6 cleavage at position 586. In contrast to cleavable htt, caspase-resistant htt with an expanded polyglutamine tract has reduced toxicity in apoptotically stressed neuronal and nonneuronal cells and forms aggregates at a much reduced frequency. These results suggest that inhibiting caspase cleavage of htt may therefore be of potential therapeutic benefit in Huntington's disease.

The cardinal neuropathological feature of HD is the selective neuronal loss of Î³-aminobutyric acid-ergic medium spiny neostriatal neurons and large projection neurons in cortical layers V and VI (2.Hedreen J.C.

Caspases are cysteine aspartic acid proteases that cleave specific target proteins during apoptotic death (8.Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M.

We have previously shown that huntingtin is cleaved in apoptotic cells and by recombinant caspase-3 (9.Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M.

These observations led to the development of the toxic fragment hypothesis (15.Wellington C.L. Hayden M.R. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1997; 10: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which postulates that proteolytic cleavage of htt liberates toxic fragments containing the expanded polyglutamine tract that are neurotoxic and that stimulate additional proteolytic activity. Evidence of htt cleavage in HD includes the presence of N-terminal htt fragments in patient brains (16.DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N. Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar) as well as in yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice that express full-length, expanded human htt (17.Hodgson J.G.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). htt cleavage in the yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice occurs in the cytoplasm, after which the N-terminal fragments are imported into the nucleus (17.Hodgson J.G.

In vitro, htt is cleaved by caspase-3 at two sites yielding N-terminal fragments of 70 and 80 kDa for htt with 15 glutamines and 90 and 100 kDa for htt with 138 glutamines (9.Goldberg Y.P.

Genet. 1996; 5: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that caspase-3 is likely to contribute to the generation of N-terminal htt fragments. Further support for the toxic fragment hypothesis can be obtained by testing whether preventing the formation of N-terminal htt fragments lessens the toxicity of htt. Here we show abrogation of htt cleavage and diminishment of overall cytotoxicity in the presence of caspase inhibitors. This reduction in toxicity in the presence of caspase inhibitors could be due to general inhibition of proapoptotic caspase activity or by specifically preventing the caspase cleavage of htt. To test whether specifically inhibiting htt cleavage reduces toxicity, we first identified two caspase-3 sites at aa positions Asp513and Asp552 and one novel caspase-6 site at aa position Asp586 and then generated mutated forms of htt that are resistant to caspase cleavage and contain either a normal or expanded polyglutamine tract. Neuronal and nonneuronal cells expressing caspase-resistant htt have reduced caspase activation during an apoptotic challenge and are less prone to aggregate formation compared with caspase-cleavable huntingtin. These results support the hypothesis that N-terminal cleavage products of htt enhance apoptotic death by accelerating the rate of caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, these observations also suggest the possibility of novel therapeutic approaches for HD aimed at specifically blocking htt cleavage. Full-length htt expression constructs (pRC-CMV10366-15 or -138) have been described (20.Goldberg Y.P. Kalchman M.A. Metzler M. Nasir J. Zeisler J. Graham R. Koide H.B. O'Kusky J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Jirik F. Hayden M.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids truncated at htt nucleotide 3949 were prepared by digesting full-length pRC-CMV10366 containing 15 or 138 glutamines with XbaI followed by religation to create pRC-CMV3949-15 and pRC-CMV3949-138. pCMVlacZ and pRSV-lacZ were kindly provided by Drs. Paul Orban and Ite Laird-Offringa, respectively. The P1 aspartate of each caspase site in htt was changed to alanine by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis using the following primers: constant 5â², CTG CTC ACC CTG AGG TAT TTG; constant 3â², CTG TTC CTC AGG GTA TTC CGT G; 1854F, CGG ACT CAG TGG CTC TGG CCA GCT G; 1854R, CAG CTG GCC AGA GCC ACT GAG TCC G; 1904F, GAT GAG GAG GCT ATC TTG AGC CAC AG; 1904R, CTG TGG CTC AAG ATA GCC TCC TCA TC; 1970F, GGA CCT GAA TGC TGG GAC CCA GGC C; 1970R, GGC CTG GGT CCC AGC ATT CAG GTC C; 2081F, GAC GGT ACC GCC AAC CAG TAT TTG GG; 2081R, CCC AAA TAC TGG TTG GCG GTA CCG TC; 2072F, GAA ATT GTG TTA GCC GGT ACC GAC AAC; and 2072R, GTT GTC GGT ACC GGC TAA CAC AAT TTC. Two mutagenic polymerase chain reactions were performed containing 10 ng of DNA, 1.5 Î¼l of 1.25 mm dNTPs (Canadian Life Technologies), 5.0 Î¼l of 10Ã Pfu polymerase buffer (Stratagene), 1.0 Î¼l of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), one mutagenic and one constant primer in 50 Î¼l at 94 Â°C for 3 min, 30 cycles at 94 Â°C for 30 s, 65 Â°C for 30 s, and 72 Â°C for 45 s, and 7 min at 72 Â°C. Purified products were pooled and further amplified using the constant primers, digested withBsu36I and ligated to Bsu36I-digested pRC-CMV3949-15 or pRC-CMV3949â128. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Full-length mutagenized constructs were generated by reinserting the previously deleted XbaI fragment. HEK 293T cells were cultured and transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described previously (21.Chen N. Luo T. Wellington C. Metzler M. McCutcheon K. Hayden M.R. Raymond L.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1820-1898Google Scholar) to an efficiency of 80â95% as determined by Î²-galactosidase staining. After 24 h, cells were treated with 35 Î¼m tamoxifen (Sigma). At time intervals after tamoxifen addition, cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 10 Î¼g/ml benzamidine, and 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin. For experiments with z-VAD-fmk or z-DEVD-fmk (Calbiochem), cells were preincubated with 50 Î¼m of the desired inhibitor for 60 min prior to transfection until harvest. HN33 hippocampal cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Canadian Life Technologies) with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate and transfected at 60% confluency in 6-well dishes using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions to an efficiency of 40% as determined by Î²-galactosidase staining. 24 h later, the medium was aspirated and replaced with serum-free growth medium for an additional 24 h. Cells were collected and resuspended in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (CLONTECH), incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 Ã g for 5 min. Immortalized rat striatal cells (ST14A) were cultured at 33 Â°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were plated onto coverslips and transfected at 60% confluency in 6-well dishes using LipofectAMINE (Canadian Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions to an efficiency of 30% as determined by Î²-galactosidase staining. 24 h later, the medium was replaced with serum-free growth medium for 30â45 min, after which coverslips were processed for immunofluoresence. Equal amounts of protein were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, electophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore), and probed with the N-terminal anti-htt antibody BKP1 directed against htt aa 1â17 (22.Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B.

Transfected 293T or ST14A cells were processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (10.Martindale D. Hackam A.S. Wieczorek A. Ellerby L. Wellington C.L. McCutcheon K. Singaraja R.

Immunofluorescence was viewed with a Zeiss Axioscope microscope and digitally captured with a charge coupled device camera (Princeton Instrument Inc.), and the images were colorized and overlapped using Eclipse (Empix Imaging Inc.). Control experiments in which the primary antibody was omitted did not show immunofluorescence. A sufficiently dilute concentration of primary antibody (1:1000) was used so that only transfected cells stained positively with the primary antibody. Aggregates were scored by examining transfected cells for the presence of aggregates, ensuring that at least 200 (for 293T) or 100 (for ST14A) transfected cells were scored per repetition of the experiment. Aggregate frequency was defined as the percentage of total transfected cells containing an aggregate of any size. Aggregates were defined as a clearly demarcated region of dense staining that was specific for the htt primary antibody, and aggregate frequency was calculated according to the following formula: aggregate frequency = (number of transfected cells containing an aggregate/total number of transfected cells) Ã 100%. Although we did not accurately measure the size of aggregates in 293T or ST14A cells, we noted that the moderate-to-large aggregates formed in 293T cells were roughly the size of the nucleoli and the small-to-moderate aggregates formed in ST14A cells tended to be between approximately 10â40% the size of the nucleoli. Toxicity of the transfected htt constructs was measured using the WST assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described (11.Hackam A.S. Singaraja R. Wellington C.L. Metzler M. McCutcheon K. Zhang T. Kalchman M. Hayden M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 5 Ã 104 cells into 96-well plates and transfected with htt or control constructs. At 24 h after transfection, 35 Î¼m tamoxifen was added to the cells for 3 h, after which time a 1:10 dilution of the WST-1 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added and the incubation was continued for an additional hour. Following a total of 4 h of exposure to tamoxifen, release of formazan from mitochondria was quantified at 450 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Dynatech Laboratories, Cantilly, VA), taking readings at 15-min intervals for 60 min to ensure linearity of the response. DEVD-ase assays were performed with the ApoAlert fluorometric kit as specified (CLONTECH). 24 h after transfection, cells were apoptotically stressed by treatment with 35 Î¼mtamoxifen for 2â12 h for 293T cells or exposure to serum-free medium for 24 h for HN33 cells. Cells were harvested by scraping and centrifugation followed by lysis in Cell Lysis Buffer (CLONTECH). Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation to pellet cell debris. The protein concentration in the resulting supernatants was determined by Lowry assay, and DEVD-ase activity was quantitated by incubation with a reaction mix containing DEVD-AMC as specified (CLONTECH). Reactions were incubated at 37 Â°C and read at intervals at an excitation of 385 nm and emission of 510 nm. The rate of change in fluorescence within the linear range was normalized to protein concentration and expressed as relative levels. We observed in all experiments that the rate of change of fluorescence remained linear for at least one h, and the level of fluorescence at 1 h was used for analyses. In vitro translation was performed using the TNT quick coupled rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega) as described (18.Wellington C.L. Ellerby L.M. Hackam A.S. Margolis R.L. Trifiro M.A. Singaraja R.

All statistical analyses were performed using one way analysis of variance with a Neuman-Keuls post test. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with full-length htt containing 15 or 138 glutamines (pRC-CMV10366-15 or pRC-CMV10366-138) and were harvested at intervals after treatment with 35 Î¼m tamoxifen, which has previously been shown to result in apoptotic death of htt-expressing cells in a polyglutamine-dependent manner (25.Ellerby L.M.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for the first 17 aa of htt (BKP1) shows a 350-kDa band that represents intact htt as well as a 230-kDa processed fragment in untreated transfected cells (Fig.1, A and B, 0 h of tamoxifen) that likely results from transfection or overexpression stress. Two major htt cleavage products (70 and 80 kDa for htt with 15 glutamines and 90 and 100 kDa for htt with 138 glutamines) are specifically generated 4â6 h after tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 1,A and B). Because similar products are generated from endogenous htt in apoptotic COS cells (19.Nasir J. Goldberg Y.P. Hayden M.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and when htt is cleaved with purified caspase-3 (18.Wellington C.L. Ellerby L.M. Hackam A.S. Margolis R.L. Trifiro M.A. Singaraja R.

To facilitate further manipulations of the large htt cDNA (10366 base pairs encoding a 3144-aa protein), htt constructs truncated at aa 1212 (nucleotide 3949) that contained 15 or 138 glutamines were generated. These truncated 3949 constructs, like full-length htt, yield two major products consistent with N-terminal caspase cleavage 4â6 h after tamoxifen addition, as well as minor products that may represent proteolytic intermediates at earlier times (Fig. 1, C andD). htt cleavage during a tamoxifen challenge was eliminated by either 50 Î¼m z-VAD-fmk or 50 Î¼m z-DEVD-fmk (Fig.2 A), demonstrating that htt cleavage is caspase-dependent in this model. In contrast, the Me2SO-only diluent control was ineffective in preventing tamoxifen-induced htt cleavage. htt has previously been shown to be toxic in this model system (11.Hackam A.S. Singaraja R.

As well, z-DEVD-fmk eliminated the transfection-associated toxicity of pRSV-lacZ, reducing toxicity from 21.4 + 0.8% to 0.1 Â± 0.01%, (n = 6,p < 0.001) and had a protective effect in cells expressing 3949-15 or 3949-138, reducing toxicity from 47.4 Â± 1.4% to 30.7 Â± 1.5% for 3949-15 (n = 6,p < 0.001) and from 78.1 Â± 1.4% to 31.4 Â± 1.4% for 3949-138 (n = 6, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2 C). Because both inhibitors are irreversible and have different cellular permeabilities, it is not possible to conclude which caspases are relevant for toxicity in this system. htt contains four potential caspase-3 sites (510DSVD513,527DEED530, 549DLND552, and 586DGTD589; Fig.3 A), yet only two products are observed (Fig. 1). Caspase-3 has been shown to cleave htt at510DSVD513 (after the underlined P1 aspartate residue) but not at 527DEED530, at least in the context of htt truncated at aa 548 (18.Wellington C.L.

To identify the second caspase-3 site in htt and to confirm cleavage at510DSVD513 in the context of a larger htt fragment (extending to aa 1212), we generated double P1 aspartate to alanine mutations in 3949-15 and 3949-138, where one mutation was constant at D513A and the second mutation was generated at D530A, D552A, or D589A. Cleavage assays using radiolabeled proteins containing the wild type sequence and each of these double mutants showed that one combination (Asp513 and Asp552) was not cleaved by purified caspase-3, whereas the other combinations were (Fig.3 B), indicating that htt is cleaved in vitro by caspase-3 solely at positions Asp513 and Asp552. These results were reproducible for 3949-138 (not shown), indicating that polyglutamine expansion did not change the caspase cleavage profile of htt. Because purified caspase-3 did not cleave the double mutant D513A,D552A, we expected that it would also be resistant to cleavage in transfected cells. However, a novel tamoxifen-induced band was observed in cells expressing this double mutant that migrated at 90 or 115 kDa for htt with 15 or 138 glutamines, respectively (Fig.4 B, lanes 1â4), suggesting the existence of a cleavage event downstream of aa 552 by caspase-3 or a distinct protease. To test for caspase-3 cleavage at an alternative site, we evaluated constructs with mutations at each of the four caspase-3 consensus sites in htt (510DSVD513,527DEED530, 549DLND552, and 586DGTD589). Transfection with the quadruple mutant generated cleavage products that were indistinguishable from those of the double mutant (Fig. 4 B,lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that activation of a cryptic caspase-3 site is not a likely explanation for the origin of the 90- or 115-kDa fragments in cells expressing htt with 15 or 138 glutamines, respectively. A group III caspase consensus site, 583IVLD586 (Fig. 4 A) was then identified in htt. To determine whether cleavage at583IVLD586 generated the 90- or 115-kDa products, quintuple mutants with modifications of all four caspase-3 sites as well as the group III site (D513A, D530A, D552A, D586A, and D589A), each with 15 or 138 glutamines, were generated. Cleavage products were essentially undetectable in 293T cells expressing these quintuple mutants after tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 4 B,lanes 7 and 8), showing that htt is also cleaved at 583IVLD586, possibly by a group III caspase, during an apoptotic challenge. In addition, full-length huntingtin bearing mutations at aa 513, 530, 552, 586, and 589 also failed to be cleaved in transfected 293T cells during an apoptotic challenge, demonstrating that there are no caspase sites within the htt C-terminal region that are recognized or accessible when htt is expressed in cells (Fig. 4 C). Additional experiments confirmed cleavage of htt by caspases other than caspase-3. Three products were observed when radiolabeled full-length htt is incubated in apoptotic Jurkat extracts, two of which result from caspase-3 cleavage because they are inhibited by preincubation with 10 nm Ac-DEVD-CHO and comigrate with caspase-3-specific 70- and 80-kDa products (Fig. 5 A). The 90-kDa product, however, is not inhibited either by Ac-DEVD-CHO or 10 nm Ac-YVAD-CHO (Fig. 5 A). Analyses of the htt mutants in Jurkat extracts confirms that the double and quadruple mutations eliminate the Ac-DEVD-CHO-inhibitable products but fail to prevent formation of the 90-kDa band (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, Jurkat apoptotic extracts fail to cleave the quintuple mutant, confirming that the D586A mutation identifies a non-caspase-3 site in htt. These results were confirmed using htt with 138 glutamines (not shown). Caspases-6, -8, -9, and -10 cleave at (I/V/L)XXD sites (8.Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T.

https://openalex.org/W1508211596,"Î²-Arrestins are cytosolic proteins that regulate the signaling and the internalization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although termination of receptor coupling requires Î²-arrestin binding to agonist-activated receptors, GPCR endocytosis involves the coordinate interactions between receptor-Î²-arrestin complexes and other endocytic proteins such as adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) and clathrin. Clathrin interacts with a conserved motif in the Î²-arrestin C-terminal tail; however, the specific molecular determinants in Î²-arrestin that bind AP-2 have not been identified. Moreover, the respective contributions of the interactions of Î²-arrestin with AP-2 and clathrin toward the targeting of GPCRs to clathrin-coated vesicles have not been established. Here, we identify specific arginine residues (Arg394 and Arg396) in the Î²-arrestin 2 C terminus that mediate Î²-arrestin binding to AP-2 and show, in vitro, that these domains in Î²-arrestin 1 and 2 interact equally well with AP-2 independently of clathrin binding. We demonstrate in HEK 293 cells by fluorescence microscopy that Î²2-adrenergic receptor-Î²-arrestin complexes lacking the Î²-arrestin-clathrin binding motif are still targeted to clathrin-coated pits. In marked contrast, receptor-Î²-arrestin complexes lacking the Î²-arrestin/AP-2 interactions are not effectively compartmentalized in punctated areas of the plasma membrane. These results reveal that the binding of a receptor-Î²-arrestin complex to AP-2, not to clathrin, is necessary for the initial targeting of Î²2-adrenergic receptor to clathrin-coated pits."

Cytochrome c, a mediator of these two aspects of mitochondrial function, thus represents an important potential target of ONOOâ during conditions involving accelerated rates of oxygen radical and Â·NO generation. Horse heart cytochromec 3+ was nitrated by ONOOâ, as indicated by spectral changes, Western blot analysis, and mass spectrometry. A dose-dependent loss of cytochromec 3+ 695 nm absorption occurred, inferring that nitration of a critical heme-vicinal tyrosine (Tyr-67) promoted a conformational change, displacing the Met-80 heme ligand. Nitration was confirmed by cross-reactivity with a specific antibody against 3-nitrotyrosine and by increased molecular mass compatible with the addition of a nitro-(-NO2) group. Mass analysis of tryptic digests indicated the preferential nitration of Tyr-67 among the four conserved tyrosine residues in cytochrome c. Cytochromec 3+ was more extensively nitrated than cytochrome c 2+ because of the preferential oxidation of the reduced heme by ONOOâ. Similar protein nitration patterns were obtained by ONOOâ reaction in the presence of carbon dioxide, whereupon secondary nitrating species arise from the decomposition of the nitroso-peroxocarboxylate (ONOOCO2â) intermediate. Peroxynitrite-nitrated cytochrome c displayed significant changes in redox properties, including (a) increased peroxidatic activity, (b) resistance to reduction by ascorbate, and (c) impaired support of state 4-dependent respiration in intact rat heart mitochondria. These results indicate that cytochrome c nitration may represent both oxidative and signaling events occurring during Â·NO- and ONOOâ-mediated cell injury."

These studies identified a family of antagonists, spiropiperidines. One of the more potent compounds blocks MCP-1 binding to CCR2 with a K d of 60 nm, but it is unable to block binding to CXCR1, CCR1, or CCR3. These compounds were effective inhibitors of chemotaxis toward MCP-1 but were very poor inhibitors of CCR1-mediated chemotaxis. The compounds are effective blockers of MCP-1-driven inhibition of adenylate cyclase and MCP-1- and MCP-3-driven cytosolic calcium influx; the compounds are not agonists for these pathways. We showed that glutamate 291 (Glu291) of CCR2 is a critical residue for high affinity binding and that this residue contributes little to MCP-1 binding to CCR2. The basic nitrogen present in the spiropiperidine compounds may be the interaction partner for Glu291, because the basicity of this nitrogen was essential for affinity; furthermore, a different class of antagonists, a class that does not have a basic nitrogen (2-carboxypyrroles), were not affected by mutations of Glu291. In addition to the CCR2 receptor, spiropiperidine compounds have affinity for several biogenic amine receptors. Receptor models indicate that the acidic residue, Glu291, from transmembrane-7 of CCR2 is in a position similar to the acidic residue contributed from transmembrane-3 of biogenic amine receptors, which may account for the shared affinity of spiropiperidines for these two receptor classes. The models suggest that the acid-base pair, Glu291 to piperidine nitrogen, anchors the spiropiperidine compound within the transmembrane ovoid bundle. This binding site may overlap with the space required by MCP-1 during binding and signaling; thus the small molecule ligands act as antagonists. An acidic residue in transmembrane region 7 is found in most chemokine receptors and is rare in other serpentine receptors. The model of the binding site may suggest ways to make new small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists, and it may rationalize the design of more potent and selective antagonists.

These findings also demonstrate that modulation of MCP-1 expression or activity will be beneficial in treating inflammatory diseases. Because of the involvement of MCP-1 in pathophysiological inflammatory diseases, we initiated a program to discover small molecule antagonists of the MCP-1 receptor. These efforts lead to the identification of several classes of compounds that inhibited MCP-1 binding to its receptor with affinities between 1 and 15 Î¼m; this report details the properties of one class of inhibitors. We examined several of these compounds in detail with regard to binding affinity and antagonist function at several receptor sites. One class, the spiropiperidines, has affinities that range from 60 nm to inactive and has distinct structure activity relationships; we wished to understand the mechanism of action for these compounds and model their interaction with CCR2 receptor. Using several types of function studies, we examined the effect of the compounds on several post-receptor signaling pathways simulated by MCP-1 and another CCR2 ligand, MCP-3. We also examined the effect of certain site-directed receptor mutations on the binding affinity of MCP-1 and several compounds. These studies revealed an unappreciated similarity between binding of compounds to biogenic-amine receptors and their binding to MCP-1 receptor. We have built models of the CCR2 receptor incorporating the mutagenesis data, the spiropiperidine structure activity relationships, and ligand binding and signaling models that we have previously presented (27Pebay-Peyroula E.

Yields averaged 60% after chromatography. Subsequent deprotection of thetert-butoxycarbonyl-protected spirobenzoxazinones using standard procedure (20 eq of trifluoroacetic acid in CH2Cl2) followed by alkylation with the appropriate alkyl bromide yielded the desired compounds (5 eq of Hunig's base and 1.2 eq of the bromide in acetonitrile at reflux, 5 h. The compounds were purified by column chromatography or by preparative thin layer chromatography using 5:4:1 hexanes/CH2Cl2/MeOH mixtures. Each sample was >98% pure. For preparation of 3-chlorobenzyl 2-pyrrole carboxylic acid, 2-trifluoroacetylpyrrole (25 g, 0.12 mol) was combined with sodium hydride (6.2 g, 015 mol) in dimethylformamide (300 ml) at 0 Â°C. 3-Chlorobenzylbromide was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred for about 15 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with water followed by dilute sodium hydroxide (3 m, 80 ml) and stirred for 2 h. Additional sodium hydroxide was added, and the water layer was washed with ether. Addition of 6 m HCl to the aqueous phase until the pH was 2 resulted in the precipitation of the desired carboxylic acid (RS-136270). The compound was filtered and washed with cold water. The crude acid was dissolved in CH2Cl2, and decolorizing charcoal was added. The mixture was stirred on a steam bath and concentrated to 800 ml. The solution was filtered and placed in a refrigerator for 10 days. Filtration and washing with cold ether then afforded 18 g of the pure carboxylic acid (>95%). All compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy (1H and 13C), IR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, melting point, and elemental analysis; the data were consistent with the desired structure. A detailed description of the binding assay is described in a previous manuscript (30Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M.

Briefly, binding was measured using membranes prepared from two cell lines, THP-1 and CCR2-CHL cells. Each competition assay (TableI) was composed of cell membranes, 50 pm125I-MCP, MCP buffer, protease inhibitors, and test compound. Equilibrium was achieved by incubation at 28 Â°C for 90 min. Membrane-bound 125I-MCP was collected by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in polyethyleneimine and bovine serum albumin, followed by four rapid washes with approximately 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4.

The other binding assays reported in Table I were performed as described above with appropriate changes in radioligand, buffer, temperature, and cell or tissue source. Thus, CCR1 and CXCR1 binding assays used 50 pm125I-MIP1a or125I-interleukin-8, a buffer composed of 50 mmHEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and a pH of 7.4, a temperature of 28 Â°C and 100,000 CHO-CCR1 cells or CHO-CXCR1 cells. These are transformed CHO lines containing the pSW104 vector containing the human CCR1 cDNA or the human CXCR1 cDNA. The Î±1a or Î±1b binding assay used 300 pm [3H]prazosin a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, a temperature of 28 Â°C, and 50,000 CHO-Î±1a or CHO-Î±1dmembranes from transformed CHO cell lines containing the pSW104 vector containing the human Î±1a or Î±1d adrenergic receptor. The 5HT1a binding assay used 300 pm[3H]8-hydroxyaminopropylaminotetralin, a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, a temperature of 32 Â°C, and rat cortex membranes containing 0.25 mg/ml protein. All the binding buffers also contained 100 Î¼m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 Î¼mleupeptin. The biogenic amine binding assays used 0.1 mNaCl to wash the glass fiber filters, and the chemokine assay filters were washed as for the CCR2 assay. The cell lines bearing biogenic amine receptors were a kind gift from David Chang and Rick Salazar (Roche Bioscience). Freeze-thaw lysed L1.2 cell clones bearing the wild type receptor and mutant receptors were used for saturation binding experiments with MCP-1 (Table I) and for competition experiments with MCP-1 and various compounds (Table II). Freeze-thaw lysed cells were prepared from washed centrifuge-packed cell pellets, which had been stored at -80 Â°C prior to binding analysis. These cells were thawed at room temperature and refrozen once. Between 1 Ã 106 and 1 Ã 105 freeze thawed cells were used for saturation binding experiments. These experiments used125I-MCP-1 at 440 Ci/mmol and varied the MCP-1 concentration between 3 and 0.023 nm. Data analysis for these saturation experiments was performed as described previously (31Jarnagin K. Bhakta S. Zuppan P. Yee C. Ho T. Phan T. Tahilramani R. Pease J.H.B. Miller A. Freedman R. J. Biol.

Competition experiments using the L1.2 cell bearing mutant receptors also used freeze-thaw lysed cells; 1 Ã 105wild type bearing cells and 5 Ã 105 mutation bearing cells were used for the competition experiments. These experiments used125I-MCP-1 at 440 Ci/mmol and MCP-1 concentrations of 50 pm for wild type bearing cells and 100 pm for cells bearing mutations. Data analysis of these type of competition was performed as described by Jarnagin et al. (31Jarnagin K. Bhakta S. Zuppan P. Yee C. Ho T. Phan T. Tahilramani R. Pease J.H.B. Miller A. Freedman R. J.

The methods for measurement of intracellular signaling and chemotaxis have been described in detail in our previous paper (32Jarnagin K. Grunberger D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Diehl F. Freedman R. McCarley D. Polsky I. Ping-Tsou A. Kosaka A. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16167-16177Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytosolic calcium influx was measured in CCR2-CHL cells loaded with the fluorescent dye Fura-2-AM. Quantitation of signal intensity used the integrated signal intensity for 82 s after the addition of chemokine and thus has units of mÂ·s. Antagonism by various compounds of calcium influx was measured using an approximate ED50 dose of MCP-1 (3 nm) and an approximate ED25 dose for MCP-3 (5 nm). Chemotaxis was measured over 1 h using THP-1â5X cells in a 96-well Boyden chamber apparatus. Cell migration through the polycarbonate filter was quantified by fluorescent staining using propidium iodide in 0.1% Triton X-100. These assays typically gave stimulated to unstimulated migration of 6-fold, range 4â10-fold, using a maximally effective concentration of MCP-1. Chemotaxis antagonist measurements used 3 nm MCP-1 or RANTES; these concentrations are near the ED95 attractant concentration for MCP-1 and for RANTES as agonists. The data are expressed by normalization to the uninhibited migration caused by the agonist chemokine. The antagonist was present in both chambers of the Boyden apparatus. Adenylate cyclase inhibition was measured using a reporter linked gene transcription assay; in which firefly luciferase was attached 3â² to a cyclic-AMP response enhancer, CREB; these elements were contained within the cell clone, CHO-K1-CCR2b-cAMP-Luc-neo-22. The assay measured adenylate cyclase inhibition after 6 h of exposure to the appropriate compounds in the presence of 2.0 Î¼m forskolin and 5 nm MCP-1. This assay reflects biochemical measurements of cAMP production with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 (32Jarnagin K. Grunberger D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S.

Mutations were introduced into a pcDNA3.1 vector containing an amino-terminal FLAG-tagged hCCR2 receptor (33Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23186-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using a polymerase chain reaction method similar to that of Jarnagin et al. (31Jarnagin K. Bhakta S. Zuppan P. Yee C. Ho T. Phan T. Tahilramani R. Pease J.H.B. Miller A. Freedman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28277-28286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This method amplifies the region of receptor sequence immediately surrounding the target mutation site; thus it avoids amplification of the whole receptor. The region of the plasmid DNA amplified during the mutagenesis procedure was completely sequenced to verify the presence of the mutation and confirm the absence of unintended mutations. Clones of L1.2 cells bearing a single mutant receptor were further checked after cloning to confirm that each isolated cell line contained DNA encoding the desired mutation. Genomic DNA from the clone was isolated using a QIAamp blood DNA isolation kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden Germany). The genomic DNA was used as the template in polymerase chain reaction reactions using primers encoded by the T7 region of the pCDNA3.1 vector and a 3â² primer within pCDNA3.1 vector, 5â²-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG. The polymerase chain reaction product was further purified using Geneclean columns (Bio101, La Jolla, CA) and then sequenced. The mutations in the third extracellular loop and at the top of the seventh transmembrane domain were sequenced using a primer that included the receptor stop codon, 5â²-CTA CGC GTC GAC TTA TAA ACC AGC CGA G. These sequences confirmed that all of the clonal lines reported contained the desired mutant receptor. L1.2 cells were a gift from E. Butcher (Stanford University, CA). Untransfected L1.2 cells were grown at 37 Â°C in humidified 5% CO2 and in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan UT), 2 mmminimal essential medium sodium-pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 55 Î¼m Î²-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected stable L1.2 cells were grown under the same conditions with additional 400 Î¼g/ml GeneticinÂ® (G-418, Life Technologies, Inc). L1.2 cells were transfected for 4 h at 37 Â°C using 30 Î¼g of LipofectAMINE and 5 Î¼g of plasmid DNA/2 Ã 106 cells in Opti-MEM serum-free medium. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in RPMI medium containing 15% fetal calf serum. After a washing, the cells were cultured for 6 days in RPMI medium containing 1000 Î¼g/ml G-418. Cells were maintained for two passages in 400 Î¼g/ml G-418 prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorter-based cell cloning. L1.2 cells express chemokine receptors more efficiently following incubation of the cells for 5.5 h with 2 mm sodium butyrate in RPMI medium at a density of 1 Ã 105cells/ml. The treatment was performed prior to all receptor quantitation, affinity determinations, and cell cloning steps. This treatment increased the cell surface receptor expression by 6.9-fold as measured by epitope tag-specific fluorescent antibody staining; the treatment increased MCP-1 binding to total cell membranes by 4.1-fold, from 5100 receptors/cell to 21,000 receptors/cell.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2585-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the resting cell, phospholipid asymmetry is relatively stable with slow exchange of phospholipids between the bilayers. Escape of PS or PE to the outer leaflet is quickly corrected by the action of an aminophospholipid translocase (APLT) (2Zachowski A. Favre E. Cribier S. Herve P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2585-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) that selectively transports aminophospholipids such as PS, and to a lesser extent PE, from the outer leaflet back to the inner leaflet. In contrast, calcium-dependent bidirectional movement of phospholipids across the membrane, termed âscrambling,â shows no selectivity for the phospholipid species or the direction of movement (3Bratton D.L.

Low baseline phospholipid scramblase activity is hypothesized to account for the slow exchange of phospholipids observed in resting cells. When activated, it is hypothesized that this protein induces enhanced exchange in cell activation and apoptosis. Enhanced scramblase activity is an important feature during apoptosis and cell stimulation. Apoptosis, a fundamental process occurring in virtually all cell types, is characterized by distinct and separable biochemical and morphological changes. The most prominent feature typically occurs at the level of the nucleus and includes chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Cell surface alterations are critical for apoptotic cell removal and include exposure of PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. We have previously shown that PS exposure serves as at least one important and necessary signal for their quiescent removal by phagocytes (8Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Frasch S.C. Warner M.L. Henson P.M.

Bratton D. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A.B. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Activation of phospholipid scramblase is also a feature of activated cells and can be observed in neutrophils stimulated with fMLP or in platelets stimulated with thrombin plus collagen (3Bratton D.L.

Stimulation of platelets results in the externalization of PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This externalized PS serves as a catalytic surface for the assembly of coagulation factors, therefore, initiating the coagulation cascade. Although the physiological role of the membrane randomization that occurs in activated leukocytes is less clear, it has been shown to allow release of platelet-activating factor and lyso- and oxidized phospholipids and may play a role in membrane protein function (3Bratton D.L.

During apoptosis and with some stimuli, loss of transbilayer asymmetry appears to result from both enhanced phospholipid scramblase activity as well as a loss in APLT (18Verhoven B. Krahling S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Middelkoop E. Lubin B.H. Bevers E.M. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Comfurius P. Chiu D.T.-Y.

However, loss of APLT alone is not sufficient for surface exposure of PS and requires a concomitant increase in scramblase activity (18Verhoven B. Krahling S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 20Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). How scramblase activity is regulated in stimulated cells or during apoptosis is unknown at this time. The deduced amino acid sequence of a recently cloned candidate scramblase from human erythrocytes, however, reveals a putative protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site, suggesting that phosphorylation by PKC may be one mechanism by which scramblase activity is modulated (7Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). PKC isoforms belong to a large family of serine/threonine protein kinases containing at least 12 members (for review, see Ref. 21Rodriquez-Tarducy G. Lopez-Rivas A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Each member shows a high degree of homology in the catalytic region, but varies with regard to tissue distribution and activation requirements. Although the presence of intracellular PS is necessary for activation of all PKC isoforms, the requirement for additional activation cofactors can divide the family into three major groups. The conventional group, which includes Î±, Î²I, Î²II, and Î³, is Ca2+-dependent, and members are activated by phorbol esters. The novel group, which includes Îµ, Î´, Î¸, and Î·, is Ca2+-independent, but members are activated by phorbol esters. The atypical group includes, Î¶, Î», Î¹, and Î¼, and all are insensitive to Ca2+ and activation by phorbol esters. The functional response elicited by PKC depends largely on the isoform and initial signal as well as the cell type. PKCs have been suggested to play an important role in a variety of cellular functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation. There are conflicting reports regarding the role of PKCs during apoptosis, complicated by the cell type used and the initial stimulus, as well as the PKC isoform investigated. Several studies have suggested a protective role for PKCs based upon experiments in which apoptosis is inhibited in cells pretreated with PMA (22Iseki R. Mukai M. Iwata M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 4286PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, in some cell types, treatment with PMA induces apoptosis (23Reyland M.E. Anderson S.M. Matassa A.A. Barzen K.A. Quissell D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19115-19123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether PKC will induce or protect from apoptosis may vary with cell type, stimulation conditions, and PKC activated. Recently it has been demonstrated that both PKCÎ´ and PKCÎ¸ are cleaved during apoptosis by the interleukin-1-Î²-converting enzyme-like protease caspase 3 (CPP32) (24Pongracz J. Webb P. Want K. Deacon E. Lunn O.J. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37329-37334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 25Emoto Y. Kisaki H. Manome Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1990-1996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Datta R. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar). Cleavage by caspase 3 generates a 45-kDa catalytic fragment and results in an increase in enzymatic activity, suggesting an active role for either PKCÎ´ or PKCÎ¸ during apoptosis. Accordingly, we have investigated a potential role for PKCÎ´ in the regulation of scramblase activity in stimulated cells and in those undergoing apoptosis. Endotoxin free agents and plastic dishes were used throughout this study. Jurkat cells were maintained at 1 Ã 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 Â°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Human neutrophils were isolated by the plasma Percoll method as described previously (28An B. Cou Q.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 438-442PubMed Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Î±-minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 Â°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Reagents were purchased from the following sources. Anti-protein kinase C isoform antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphothreonine antibody was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Anti-Fas IgM (CH-11) and PKC activity assay kit were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Protein A-Sepharose was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Rottlerin, GoÌ6976, phosphatase inhibitors, dioctanoylglycerol, PKCÎµ peptide substrate, and recombinant PKCÎ±, PKCÎ´, and PKCÎ¶ were from Calbiochem. DEVD-fmk was from Enzyme Systems Inc. Phosphatidylserine, NBD-PC, and NBD-PS were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). FITC-annexin V was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rat PKCÎ´ cloned into pTB was a generous gift from Dr. Yoshitaka Ono. RNA isolated from Jurkat cells was synthesized to cDNA using a reverse transcriptase for PCR kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was used as a template to amplify full length scramblase using the forward primer 5â²-GGCAGCCAGAGAACTGTTTTA-3â² and reverse primer 5â²-GCAGTTTTTCAAAGGAAGTTTCA-3â². PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned directly into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Positive colonies were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion with EcoRI and sequencing to confirm the presence of the correct insert. Full-length scramblase was then subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1. Antibodies to the amino-terminal peptide CESTGSQEQKSGVW were made by Peptide Express (Fort Collins, CO). The peptide was synthesized and linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used as an immunogen to innoculate two rabbits. At 3, 6, and 9 weeks, the rabbits were bled and serum was collected and tested by Western immunoblot analysis. Human scramblase cloned into pcDNA3.1 was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis of threonine 161 to alanine using an overlap extension PCR-based method as described (29Gschwendt M. MuÌller H-J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Basically, two fragments were generated by PCR. Fragment AB was generated using primer A (5â²-GGCAGCCAGAGAACTGTTTTA-3â²), which corresponds to the 5â² end of scramblase open reading frame; primer B (5â²-TCCTCAAGGCAAAAGGTCTAG-3â²), which corresponds to the PKC phosphorylation site and incorporates a threonine to alanine change at position 161 (bold letter); primer C, 5â²-CTAGACCTTTTGCCTTGAGGA-3â², which is complementary to primer B and incorporates the threonine to alanine change at position 161 (bold letter); and primer D, 5â²-GCAGTTTTTCAAAGGAAGTTTCA- 3â², which corresponds to the 3â² end of scramblase. To generate full-length scramblase mutant sequence, fragments AB and CD were gel-purified and quantitated, and 20 ng of each fragment was used as a template for the full-length fragment using primers A and D. The full-length PCR product was cloned directly into pCR2.1 (CLONTECH) sequenced to verify the incorporation of the mutation and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pTB and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Jurkat cells were harvested and resuspended to 10 Ã 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum and plated in a 12-well tissue culture plate at 1 ml/well. Anti-Fas IgM was added at 400 ng/ml and incubated at 37 Â°C for the indicated times. Percentage of apoptosis was determined by binding of FITC-labeled annexin V or morphologically by analysis of nuclear condensation by stained cytospin preparations. For cell activation, neutrophils were resuspended at 5 Ã 106 cells/ml in KRPD supplemented with 0.25% lipopolysaccharide-free human serum albumin and stimulated with 100 nm fMLP at 37 Â°C for the indicated times. Transfected CHO cells were stimulated with 2 ng/ml PMA plus 0.5 Î¼mcalcium ionophore for 15 min. Cells bearing PS in the plasma membrane outer leaflet were identified as those binding FITC-labeled annexin V (Caltag, Burlingame, CA). The binding of FITC-labeled annexin V to phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells correlates with the appearance of nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation by light microscopy. For staining, 105 cells were pelleted, then resuspended in 100 Î¼l of HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) with 2.5 mm CaCl2. The cells were transferred to a staining tube containing 400 ng of FITC-labeled annexin V and 500 ng of propidium iodide. The cells were incubated 15 min at room temperature, and then the samples were transferred to ice and the sample volume brought to 0.5 ml. The cells were examined on a Coulter XL (Miami Fl) flow cytometer, and the results analyzed with PC Lysys software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Annexin-positive cells were determined by setting quadrants to separate viable cells from PI-permeant cells (annexin+/PIâ), and non-apoptotic cells from those staining highly for the FITC-labeled annexin V probe. Percentage of annexin-positive cells was determined from the cells staining greater than the control population threshold. Mean fluorescence of the PI impermeant cells was simultaneously determined. Phospholipid uptake was examined to measure phospholipid scramblase activity as described previously (3Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3364-3373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bratton D.L. Dreyer E. Kailey J.M. Fadok V.A. Clay K.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 514-523PubMed Google Scholar, 18Verhoven B. Krahling S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Cell Death Diff. 1999; 6: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). NBD-labeled phosphatidylcholine was prepared by drying 1 Î¼g of 1-palmitoyl-1-[6-[(7- nitro-2â1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-PC) in a glass tube. Previous studies have shown that these NBD-labeled probe lipids are readily solubilized in aqueous media containing albumin and will partition into the plasma membrane outer leaflet. Following the incubation period, 5 Ã 105cells were harvested, washed once, and then resuspended in 50 Î¼l of HBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 1 mm CaCl2. The cells were then transferred to a staining tube containing 1 ml of the lipid suspension and 5 Î¼l of 50 Î¼g/ml propidium iodide to check for plasma membrane integrity. These were allowed to incubate for 10 min at room temperature, after which unincorporated PC was back-extracted with 50 Î¼l of 1% BSA in HBS for an additional 5 min. This back-extraction has been shown to remove NBD-labeled lipid from the surface of the cell membrane, leaving only that which has flipped to the interior leaflet of the membrane. The samples were then transferred to an ice bath, diluted to a final volume of 600 Î¼l of HBS and run on a Coulter XL (Miami, FL) flow cytometer, and the results were analyzed with PC Lysys software. The mean fluorescence values of the phospholipid uptakes were determined by setting quadrants in such a manner as to separate cells staining positively for propidium iodide (dead or highly permeant cells) from viable cell populations. Mean fluorescence was determined by taking the weighted mean fluorescence of the PI-impermeant cells. Uptake of radiolabeled carbamyl-platelet-activating factor ([3H]cPAF) was carried out as described previously (4Bratton D.L. Dreyer E. Kailey J.M. Fadok V.A. Clay K.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 514-523PubMed Google Scholar). Basically, cells were harvested and resuspended at 10 Ã 106/ml in KRPD supplemented with 0.25% lipopolysaccharide-free BSA. Uptake of [3H]cPAF (0.35 mCi) took place over 15 min with simultaneous stimulation with 100 nm fMLP at 37 Â°C. Samples were washed with two volumes of 2% BSA in KRPD at 4 Â°C and sedimented at 16,000 Ã g for 1 min to remove labeled lipid present on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 500 Î¼l of 1% Triton X-100. Uptake of labeled lipid was determined by scintillation counting. To test inhibitors, cells were preincubated with the inhibitor for 30 min prior to stimulation and addition of [3H]cPAF. PKCÎ±, PKCÎ´, and PKCÎ¶ activities were measured in an in vitro kinase assay following immunoprecipitation from Jurkat cells. Following stimulation, Jurkat cells (80 Ã 106) were harvested and resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 15 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 500 Î¼m AEBSF) and disrupted by nitrogen cavitation at 350 p.s.i. for 8 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C to remove insoluble material and unbroken cells. For immunoprecipitation, 500 Î¼l of 4Ã immunoprecipitation buffer (560 mm NaCl, 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 4% Triton X-100) was added to 1.5 ml of cell lysate containing equal amounts of protein as determined by the Bradford protein assay, and 500 Î¼l was used for immunoprecipitation. PKCÎ±, PKCÎ´, and PKCÎ¶ were immunoprecipitated with 1 Î¼g/ml amount of the appropriate antibody. For PKCÎ± activity, protein A-Sepharose beads with bound antibody were resuspended in 50 Î¼l of PKCÎ± reaction mix containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 25 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 Î¼m PKC substrate, 5 Î¼g of PS, 0.5 Î¼g of dioctanoylglycerol, 100 Î¼m ATP, 25 mm MgCl2, 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 Â°C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by centrifugation of the beads and spotting 25 Î¼l of the supernatant onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper, followed by washing in 0.5% phosphoric acid. The amount of phosphorylated substrate was quantitated by scintillation counting. Laemmli sample buffer was added to the remaining reaction mix, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose membrane, and the amount of immunoprecipitated PKC determined by Western immunoblotting. PKCÎ´ activity was measured as for PKCÎ± except that the reaction mix contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mmMgCl2, 100 Î¼m EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 6 Î¼g of PKCÎµ peptide, 20 Î¼g of PS, 2 Î¼g of dioctanoylglycerol, 200 Î¼m ATP, 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP. PKCÎ¶ activity was measured as for PKCÎ± and PKCÎ´, except that the reaction mix contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 Î¼m EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 Î¼m ATP, 10 Î¼g of PKCÎ± peptide, 10 Î¼g of PS, 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP. Jurkat cells (20 Ã 106) were lysed in 500 Î¼l of radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% DOC, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 15 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 15 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 500 Î¼m AEBSF), followed by centrifugation at 12,000 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C to remove insoluble material. Scramblase was immunoprecipitated with 5 Î¼l of anti-scramblase rabbit serum. Protein A-Sepharose beads with bound antibody were resuspended in 40 Î¼l of PKC reaction buffer as above except PKC peptide substrate was eliminated. Recombinant-active PKCÎ±, PKCÎ´, or PKCÎ¶ were diluted 1:100, 1:10, and 1:10, respectively, in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 2 Î¼l of the diluted enzyme was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for the indicated times at 30 Â°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4Ã Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylation of scramblase was visualized by autoradiography. Equal loading of scramblase was confirmed by Western immunoblotting. Transfection of PKCÎ´ and scramblase into CHO cells was done by using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer. CHO cells were plated at a density of 0.4 Ã 106 cells/well in a six-well dish 24 h prior to transfection. Transfected cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection for scramblase activity and protein expression by uptake of radiolabeled cPAF and Western immunoblotting, respectively. Jurkat cells were harvested and resuspended at 20 Ã 106 cells/ml in phosphate-free RPMI withl-glutamine supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25% BSA, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin and starved for 1 h at 37 Â°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were washed once and resuspended at 20 Ã 106 cells/ml in phosphate-free media as above, and 100 Î¼ Ci of [32P]orthophosphoric acid was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 Â°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, after which time anti-Fas IgM was added at 400 ng/ml. Cells were harvested at the indicated times after anti-Fas stimulation, washed five times with PBS, and lysed in 500 Î¼l of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EGTA. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The cell lysate was precleared with 15 Î¼l of protein A-Sepharose bead slurry for 30 min at 4 Â°C, and then scramblase was immunoprecipitated as above. Protein A-Sepharose beads were washed five times with PBS, resuspended in sample buffer, and heated to 100 Â°C for 5 min. Phosphorylated scramblase was separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and visualized by autoradiography. Equal loading of immunoprecipitated scramblase was confirmed by Western immunoblot analysis. Radioactive scramblase bands were excised and hydrolyzed in 6n HCl at 110o for 1 h and washed three times with dH2O in a SpeedVac centrifuge and resuspended in 5 Î¼l of dH2O with 1 Î¼g each of cold Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P) as internal standards. Hydrolyzed phosphoamino acids were separated on two-dimensional electrophoresis in 2.5% formic acid, 7.8% acetic acid, pH 1.9 at 1.9 kV for 20 min in the first direction and 20 min at 1.3 kV in the second direction in 5% acetic acid, 0.5% pyridine, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 3.5. Radioactive spots were visualized by autoradiography, and location of standards were visualized by ninhydrin staining. Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were resuspended to 5 Ã 106/ml in PBS and divided into 100-Î¼l aliquots of 5 Ã 105 cells. PMNs were treated with or without 100 nm fMLP for the times indicated before being fixed for 10 min at 37 Â°C with 2% paraformaldehyde in 15% sucrose/PBS. Following fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.02% Tween 20/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in 100 Î¼l of PBS containing 0.5 Î¼g of mouse anti-human CD16 and 0.5 Î¼g of mouse anti-human CD32 (PharMingen) for 15 min at room temperature to block Fc receptors. Cells were then blocked in PBS plus 10% normal goat serum overnight at 4 Â°C, after which cells were incubated with 5 Î¼g/ml anti-PKCÎ´ rabbit polyclonal antibody for 90 min at 37 Â°C, washed five times in blocking buffer, and resuspended in a 1:500 dilution of goat anti-rabbit Cy3-F(ab)â²2 (H + L-specific; Jackson Immunochemicals) for 30 min at room temperature. Before use, primary and secondary diluted antibodies were sonicated for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 Ã g for 15 min at 4 Â°C. To stain for F-actin, cells were washed five times in PBS and sedimented before resuspension in PBS containing a 1:5 dilution of FITC-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). PMNs were incubated with F-actin label for 30 min at 37 Â°C in the dark. Cells were washed three times in PBS and sedimented before resuspension in 10 Î¼l of PBS. PMNs were mounted in âgel/mountâ (1:4; Biomeda Corp.) and viewed with a fluorescence microscope using a 63Ã Zeiss water objective. Labeled PKCÎ´ and F-actin were exposed in the Cy3 channel and the FITC channel, respectively. Confocal images were achieved using Slidebook version 2.6 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.). As shown previously, phospholipid scramblase function is enhanced during both cell stimulation and apoptosis (3Bratton D.L. J. Biol.

A time course of its activity was investigated in neutrophils stimulated with 100 nm fMLP, and in Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas IgM to induce apoptosis. Although scramblase activity was induced with both treatments, the time course appeared to be quite different. Fig.1 A shows that, during cell activation, phospholipid scrambling peaked early at 15 min, returning to background levels at later times. In contrast, scramblase activity during apoptosis did not occur until 2 h, peaking at 3 h, and remaining persistent out to 4 h following stimulation with anti-Fas IgM. Similar results were obtained in apoptotic neutrophils stimulated with UV irradiation or in non-apoptotic Jurkat cells stimulated w"
https://openalex.org/W2099516468,"TRAIL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of cytokines which induces apoptotic cell death in a variety of tumor cell lines. It mediates its apoptotic effects through one of two receptors, DR4 and DR5, which are members of of the TNF receptor family, and whose cytoplasmic regions contain death domains. In addition, TRAIL also binds to 3 âdecoyâ receptors, DcR2, a receptor with a truncated death domain, DcR1, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptor, and OPG a secreted protein which is also known to bind to another member of the TNF family, RANKL. However, although apoptosis depends on the expression of one or both of the death domain containing receptors DR4 and/or DR5, resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis does not correlate with the expression of the âdecoyâ receptors. Previously, TRAIL has been described to bind to all its receptors with equivalent high affinities. In the present work, we show, by isothermal titration calorimetry and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, that the rank order of affinities of TRAIL for the recombinant soluble forms of its receptors is strongly temperature dependent. Although DR4, DR5, DcR1, and OPG show similar affinities for TRAIL at 4 Â°C, their rank-ordered affinities are substantially different at 37 Â°C, with DR5 having the highest affinity (KD â¤ 2 nm) and OPG having the weakest (KD = 400 nm). Preferentially enhanced binding of TRAIL to DR5 was also observed at the cell surface. These results reveal that the rank ordering of affinities for protein-protein interactions in general can be a strong function of temperature, and indicate that sizeable, but hitherto unobserved, TRAIL affinity differences exist at physiological temperature, and should be taken into account in order to understand the complex physiological and/or pathological roles of TRAIL.

OPG, the least related of the TRAIL receptor genes, by its sequence homology, structure, and ligand recognition patterns, including its high affinity for another ligand, RANKL, has been mapped to the other end of the same chromosome, to 8q24 (3Tan K.B. Harrop J. Reddy M. Young P. Terrett J. Emery J. Moore G. Truneh A. Gene (Amst .). 1997; 204: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). TRAIL itself has been mapped to 3q26 (1Wiley S.R.

TRAIL-induced apoptosis appears to require expression of one or both of its death domain containing receptors DR4 or DR5 (15Griffith T.S. Lynch D.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and is mediated via a Fas-associated death domain-dependent pathway (7Schneider P. Thome M. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Hofmann K. Kataoka T. Holler N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 1997; 7: 831-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). However, the expression patterns of DR4 and DR5 mRNA had suggested that DR4 and/or DR5 expression is necessary but not sufficient for TRAIL-induced apoptosis (15Griffith T.S. Lynch D.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The explanation for this latter observation was thought to be due to the expression of the âdecoyâ TRAIL receptors DcR1 and/or DcR2. Although ectopic expression, through transfection, of either of these two receptors into reporter cell lines (Refs. 5Pan G.H. Ni J. Wei Y.F., Yu, G.L. Gentz R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 277: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar and 12Degliesposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G.

Rauch C.T. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Boiani N. Lynch D.H. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Kubin M.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2597-2605PubMed Google Scholar) expression patterns of these two receptors did not support the hypothesis on their anti-apoptotic roles with respect to transformed cell lines, since both sensitive and resistant cell lines have been shown to express DcR1 and/or DcR2 mRNA. More recent data using mAbs for detection of TRAIL receptors on the cell surface corroborate the earlier mRNA data and show that the expression of the decoy receptors does not correlate with sensitivity or resistance of tumor cell lines to TRAIL-induced cell death (16Griffith T.S. Rauch C.T. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Boiani N. Lynch D.H. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Kubin M.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2597-2605PubMed Google Scholar). Possible explanations which have been invoked to account for the discrepancy between the expression patterns of the TRAIL death and decoy receptors and sensitivity to TRAIL-induced cell death include intracellular regulation of caspase activation or the ability of DcR2 to provide intracellular anti-apoptotic signals, possibly through transcriptional regulation of other anti-apoptotic genes (15Griffith T.S. Lynch D.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 17Griffith T.S. Chin W.A. Jackson G.C. Lynch D.H. Kubin M.Z. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2833-2840PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite these early indicators, other additional mechanisms are likely, and the protective mechanisms involved in the DR4 and DR5 apoptotic pathways, as well as the role of the decoy receptors in normal physiology or in pathological conditions remain to be elucidated. One potential mechanism by which apoptotic responses to TRAIL may be regulated is by the expression levels of these receptors. In addition, the possibility that TRAIL may cross-link different receptors to form heteromeric complexes cannot be ruled out. In these cases, the affinity of TRAIL for the different receptors may be important to determine the cellular consequences of ligand binding. DR4, DR5, DcR1, and DcR2 have been shown to exhibit high affinity binding to TRAIL with comparable, subnanomolar KD (12Degliesposti M.A. Dougall W.C. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G.

As has been common practice for these types of studies, all these experiments were conducted at subphysiological temperatures. We have re-examined the affinities of recombinantly expressed DR4, DR5, DcR1, and DcR2 for recombinant TRAIL, using isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) at 37 Â°C, and by standard competition ELISA at 4 and 37 Â°C. Here, we report, substantial temperature-sensitive differences in the relative affinities of these receptors for TRAIL which likely have important physiological implications. These findings are discussed in the context of the sequence and structural similarities and differences of these receptors.

Briefly, the cDNA sequence coding for the leader and extracellular domains of the receptors were amplified by PCR and cloned upstream of a Factor Xa cleavage site and the Fc region of a human IgÎ³1 heavy chain in plasmid COSFclink (22Johanson K.

The vector constructs were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and stable transfectants were selected in nucleotide-free media. For purification, the CHO expressed Ig-fusion proteins were captured from 10 or 30 liters of cell media on a 2.5 Ã 11-cm Protein A column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7 (PBS). The columns were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and the eluates neutralized immediately with 1 m Tris, pH 8, yielding Ig-fusion proteins at >95% purity. The recovered proteins were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on 1 Ã 30-cm Superdex 200 analytical columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequencing. Expression of the soluble form of TRAIL in CHO cells, with N-terminal peptide tags for affinity purification and detection, has previously been described (19Emery J.G. McDonnell P. Burke M.B.

Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.P. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G.

For expression in P. pastoris, the region spanning amino acid residues 114â281 was subcloned from this plasmid by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5â²-AAAGAATTCCATCATCACCATCATCATATTGAAGGTAGAGTGAGAGAAAGAGGTCCTCAG-3â² and 5â²-AAAGGTACCTTATTAGCCAACTAAAAAGGCCCCG-3â² which inserted an N-terminal His6 tag (a tag consisting of 6 consecutive histidine residues) and Factor Xa cleavage site (IEGR) adjacent to residue 114 and 5â² EcoRI and 3â² Asp718I sites (underlined) for subcloning. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1TOPO (Invitrogen), confirmed by sequence analysis, and subsequently subcloned into the EcoRI and Asp718I sites of pPICZÎ±A (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid, pPICZÎ±A-TRAIL, has sTRAIL expression under the control of the methanol-inducible AOX1 promoter (24Ellis S.B. Brust P.F. Koutz P.J. Waters A.F. Harpols M.M. Gingeras T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and secretion under the control of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Î±-factor signal sequence. This plasmid was digested with SstI, electroporated intoP. pastoris strain KM71 (aox1Î::SARG4, his4, arg4) (25Tschopp J.F. Brust P.F. Cregg J.M. Stillman C.A. Gingeras T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3859-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected according to protocols provided by Invitrogen. Strain MM49 was selected as the highest expressing strain as estimated by immunblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody specific for the hexa-histidine tag (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Production was carried out in shaker flasks with a yield of about 25 mg/liter. TRAIL was then purified by capturing the protein from 1 liter of Pichia-conditioned media on a 10-ml Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) equilibrated in PBS, pH 7. The column was washed with 30 mm imidazole (Calbiochem) in PBS and eluted with 300 mm imidazole in PBS. 30 mg of His6 TRAIL was recovered. The solution affinities of TRAIL for various receptors were measured by ITC (26Doyle M.L. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Protein Science: Quantitative Analysis of Protein-Protein Interactions. John Wiley & Sons, New York1999: 20.4.1-20.4.24Google Scholar, 27Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar), which detects the extent of binding from the intrinsic binding heat of the interaction. ITC is a quantitative method for measuring binding constants because it enables unmodified, native forms of proteins to be characterized in solution phase. ITC also measures binding at equilibrium and does not involve separation steps to quantitate bound and unbound species. Reactant concentrations were determined from molar extinction coefficients calculated from amino acid sequences (28Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Titrations were conducted in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 37 Â°C. Phosphate buffer was chosen by virtue of its small ionization enthalpy change of approximately 1 kcal/mol (26Doyle M.L. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Protein Science: Quantitative Analysis of Protein-Protein Interactions. John Wiley & Sons, New York1999: 20.4.1-20.4.24Google Scholar). The observed TRAIL-receptor binding enthalpy changes therefore closely approximate the molecular binding enthalpy changes, regardless of whether binding is coupled to changes in protonation. Circular dichroism thermal melting experiments demonstrated that TRAIL and the receptor constructs were stable against thermal unfolding up to at least 50 Â°C. ELISAs were performed according to standard techniques. Nunc MaxiSorp Flat-bottomed plates were coated overnight at 4 Â°C with either DR5-Ig or OPG-Ig (20 ng/well, 100 Î¼l/well) in 0.05 m carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.5â9.6. After washing with PBS-Tween (0.05% Tween 20) four times and blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h, serial dilutions of DR5-Ig/OPG-Ig/DcR1-Ig/DR4-Ig (800 to 6.25 ng/well, 100 Î¼l/well) and TRAIL-biotin (25 ng/well, 100 Î¼l/well), in pre-equilibrated assay buffers (0.01% Tween 20 in PBS pre-equilibrated at 37 or 4 Â°C) were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 or 4 Â°C. The plates were washed four times with PBS-Tween buffer and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000, 100 Î¼l/well) for 30 min at room temperature. The ELISA plates were washed five times and p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt (pNPP Tablets, Pierce, Rockford, IL) (100 Î¼l/well) was added according to the manufacturer's instructions for 15 min. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm on a microtiter plate reader (MRX, Dynatech Laboratories). The full-length cDNA clones of DR5, DR4, without their death domains (DR5ÎDD residues 1 to 268, DR4ÎDD residues 86 to 351), and DcR2 (residues 55â386) were generated by PCR and cloned into modified pcDNA3 vector that allowed in-frame fusion with a Flag epitope tag (8Macfarlane M.

DcR1 (residues â63 to 217) was cloned into mammalian double expression vector without any tag (8Macfarlane M. Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Fernandesalnemri T. Cohen G.M. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

The level of receptor expression was measured by flow cytometry using biotin-labeled affinity purified goat antibodies to the TRAIL receptor (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) with streptavidin-FITC (Sigma) as the secondary staining reagent. Both 0.1 and 1 Î¼g/ml antibodies produced similar results and so only data with 1 Î¼g/ml is reported in this study. The data was analyzed as relative mean fluoresence intensity representing the receptor density of the positive cells (% positive Ã mean fluoresence intensity of positive cells) as described previously (31Truneh A.

Twenty-four hours after transfection with the expression plasmids, the HEK293 transfectants were harvested, washed three times with PBS, and plated in presaturated (with PBS) 96-well U-bottom polypropylene plates (Costar, Corning Inc.) at 4 Ã 105 cells/well. After blocking with PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with 0, 1, and 10 Î¼g/ml TRAIL-biotin in PBS at 37 Â°C for 1 h. After incubation, the plates were washed three times with PBS and incubated with europium-labeled streptavidin (100 dilution) (DELFIA, Wallac Oy, Finland) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 100 Î¼l of enhancement solution (DELFIA, Wallac Oy, Finland) according to the manufacturer's instruction. A parallel experiment with alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin, instead of europium, produced similar results. In the present investigations, we used the CHO expression system to produce the soluble TRAIL receptors DR5, DR4, DcR1, and OPG as Ig-fusion proteins (19Emery J.G. McDonnell P. Burke M.B. Deen K.C.

The purified proteins were characterized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), analytical size exclusion chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequence analysis. The key properties are summarized in TableI. The heterogeneous appearance of SDS-PAGE bands and the disparity between the observed molecular weights and those calculated from the amino acid sequences (Table I) are indicative of glycoforms of the expressed proteins.Table ISummary of the biochemical characterization of CHO-expressed TRAIL receptorsReceptorTNF nomenclatureAliasesN terminusMW of Ig-fusion protein by MALDI-MSPredicted MW of unglycosylated dimerkDaDaDR5TNFRSF10BKILLER, TRICK2A, TRAIL-R2, TRICKBALITQQDLAP11183,452DR4TNFRSF10AApo2, TRAIL-R1ATIKLHDQSI9182,334DcR1TNFRSF10CTRAIL-R3, LIT, TRIDATTARQEEVPND1-aND, not done, or for DcR1, no signal detected by MALDI-MS.99,126DcR2TNFRSF10DTRUNDD, TRAIL-R4ND1-aND, not done, or for DcR1, no signal detected by MALDI-MS.NDNAOPGTNFRSF11BOCIF, TR1ETFPPKYLHY161141,0421-a ND, not done, or for DcR1, no signal detected by MALDI-MS.

In conjunction with the overall identity for these proteins, where DR5 shows 59, 58, and 52% identity within the first 126 amino acids of the extracellular domains of DR5, DcR1, and DcR2, respectively, this data provides further evidence for the closer evolutionary relationship of these 4 TRAIL receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2011975218,"The tumor suppressor SMAD4, also known as DPC4, deleted in pancreatic cancer, is a central mediator of TGF-beta signaling. It was previously shown that mice homozygous for a null mutation of Smad4 (Smad4-/-) died prior to gastrulation displaying impaired extraembryonic membrane formation and endoderm differentiation. Here we show that Smad4+/- mice began to develop polyposis in the fundus and antrum when they were over 6 - 12 months old, and in the duodenum and cecum in older animals at a lower frequency. With increasing age, polyps in the antrum show sequential changes from hyperplasia, to dysplasia, in-situ carcinoma, and finally invasion. These alterations are initiated by a dramatic expansion of the gastric epithelium where Smad4 is expressed. However, loss of the remaining Smad4 wild-type allele was detected only in later stages of tumor progression, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of Smad4 is sufficient for tumor initiation. Our data also showed that overexpression of TGF-beta1 and Cyclin D1 was associated with increased proliferation of gastric polyps and tumors. These studies demonstrate that Smad4 functions as a tumor suppressor in the gastrointestinal tract and also provide a valuable model for screening factors that promote or prevent gastric tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1999488656,"Liver injury during cholestasis reflects a balance between the effects of toxic and nontoxic bile acids. However, the critical distinction between a toxic and nontoxic bile acid remains subtle and unclear. For example, the glycine conjugate of chenodeoxycholate (GCDC) induces hepatocyte apoptosis, whereas the taurine conjugate (TCDC) does not. We hypothesized that the dissimilar cellular responses may reflect differential activation of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling pathway. In the bile acid-transporting McNtcp.24 rat hepatoma cell line, TCDC, but not GCDC, stimulated PI3K activity. Consistent with this observation, inhibition of PI3K rendered TCDC cytotoxic, and constitutive activation of PI3K rendered GCDC nontoxic. Both Akt and the atypical protein kinase C isoform Î¶ (PKCÎ¶) have been implicated in PI3K-dependent survival signaling. However, TCDC activated PKCÎ¶, but not Akt. Moreover, inhibition of PKCÎ¶ converted TCDC into a cytotoxic agent, whereas overexpression of wild-type PKCÎ¶ blocked GCDC-induced apoptosis. We also demonstrate that TCDC activated nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) in a PI3K- and PKCÎ¶-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition of NF-ÎºB by an IÎºB super-repressor rendered TCDC cytotoxic, suggesting that NF-ÎºB is also necessary to prevent the cytotoxic effects of TCDC. Collectively, these data suggest that some hydrophobic bile acids such as TCDC activate PI3K-dependent survival pathways, which prevent their otherwise inherent toxicity. Liver injury during cholestasis reflects a balance between the effects of toxic and nontoxic bile acids. However, the critical distinction between a toxic and nontoxic bile acid remains subtle and unclear. For example, the glycine conjugate of chenodeoxycholate (GCDC) induces hepatocyte apoptosis, whereas the taurine conjugate (TCDC) does not. We hypothesized that the dissimilar cellular responses may reflect differential activation of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling pathway. In the bile acid-transporting McNtcp.24 rat hepatoma cell line, TCDC, but not GCDC, stimulated PI3K activity. Consistent with this observation, inhibition of PI3K rendered TCDC cytotoxic, and constitutive activation of PI3K rendered GCDC nontoxic. Both Akt and the atypical protein kinase C isoform Î¶ (PKCÎ¶) have been implicated in PI3K-dependent survival signaling. However, TCDC activated PKCÎ¶, but not Akt. Moreover, inhibition of PKCÎ¶ converted TCDC into a cytotoxic agent, whereas overexpression of wild-type PKCÎ¶ blocked GCDC-induced apoptosis. We also demonstrate that TCDC activated nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) in a PI3K- and PKCÎ¶-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition of NF-ÎºB by an IÎºB super-repressor rendered TCDC cytotoxic, suggesting that NF-ÎºB is also necessary to prevent the cytotoxic effects of TCDC. Collectively, these data suggest that some hydrophobic bile acids such as TCDC activate PI3K-dependent survival pathways, which prevent their otherwise inherent toxicity. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein kinase C nuclear factor ÎºB taurochenodeoxycholate glycochenodeoxycholate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium green fluorescent protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay hemagglutinin tumor necrosis factor Bile acids are hydrophobic, potentially cytotoxic compounds synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and secreted into the bile canaliculus, where they promote bile flow. In man, bile acids are conjugated to glycine or taurine, with the glycine conjugates predominating (1.Hofmann A.F. Hepatology. 1984; 4, (suppl.): 4S-14SCrossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The conjugation decreases their hydrophobicity and renders the molecules less cytotoxic at physiologic concentrations. However, hepatic accumulation of bile acids is a salient pathophysiologic consequence of cholestasis (a syndrome of bile flow impairment) due to the failure to secrete these compounds into the bile canaliculus (2.Greim H. Trulzsch D. Czygan P. Rudick J. Hutterer F. Schaffner F. Popper H. Gastroenterology. 1972; 63: 846-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated concentrations of bile acids within the liver promote liver injury and the development of liver cirrhosis and liver failure. For example, children lacking the canalicular transport protein for bile acid secretion develop a progressive liver disease due to the inability to excrete bile acids from the hepatocyte (3.Strautnieks S.S. Bull L.N. Knisely A.S. Kocoshis S.A. Dahl N. Arnell H. Sokal E. Dahan K. Childs S. Ling V. Tanner M.S. Kagalwalla A.F. Nemeth A. Pawlowska J. Baker A. Mieli-Vergani G. Freimer N.B. Gardiner R.M. Thompson R.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have now shown that bile acid concentrations that occur during cholestasis induce hepatocyte apoptosis, thus providing a cellular mechanism for bile acid-mediated liver injury (4.Patel T. Roberts L.R. Jones B.A. Gores G.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Not all bile acids are toxic, however, and minor changes in bile acid structure dramatically alter their potential cytotoxicity. For example, the glycine conjugate of chenodeoxycholate induces hepatocyte apoptosisin vitro, whereas the taurine conjugate does not (5.Patel T. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2183-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Previous concepts suggested that bile acid toxicity correlated with relative hydrophobicity, with hydrophobic bile acids being cytotoxic and hydrophilic bile acids being nontoxic. However, we could not establish a relationship between bile acid-induced apoptosis and relative hydrophobicity (5.Patel T. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2183-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that bile acids activate cytoplasmic protein kinase cascades and function as ligands for the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (6.Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may mediate their effects by altering cell signaling pathways. Indeed, the nontoxic bile acid taurocholate has been found to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1 (7.Misra S. UjhaÌzy P. Gatmaitan Z. Varticovski L. Arias I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26638-26644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), a potent activator of survival signals (8.Yao R. Cooper G. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that nontoxic, yet hydrophobic bile acids do not trigger apoptosis because they activate a PI3K-dependent survival signaling pathway. Downstream effectors of PI3K-dependent survival signals include Akt and the atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, especially PKCÎ¶ (9.Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J.

One substrate for Akt is BAD, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Akt phosphorylates BAD, thereby blocking it from binding and inactivating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, two anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (14.Datta S. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar). Another substrate for Akt is the transcription factor NF-ÎºB, a potent regulator of a number of anti-apoptotic gene products (15.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 16.Stehlik C. de Martin R. Kumabashiri I. Schmid J.A. Binder B.R. Lipp J. J. Exp.

Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Active IÎºB kinase-Î± then phosphorylates IÎºB, resulting in dissociation from NF-ÎºB, allowing this transcription factor to enter the nucleus. PKCÎ¶ is another downstream effector of PI3K (19.Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and can also mediate activation of NF-ÎºB (20.Folgueira L. McElhinny J.A. Bren G.D. MacMorran W.S.

Alcami J. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4770-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of NF-ÎºB by PKCÎ¶ also involves IÎºB phosphorylation (22.Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the nontoxic bile acid taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC) activates PI3K, whereas the toxic glycine conjugate (GCDC) does not activate this lipid kinase. Moreover, we show that genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K converts TCDC to a cytotoxic bile acid and that constitutive activation of PI3K blocks GCDC-induced apoptosis. PI3K mediated its anti-apoptotic effects by activating PKCÎ¶ and NF-ÎºB. Correspondingly, inhibition of PKCÎ¶ and NF-ÎºB converted TCDC to a potent inducer of apoptosis. Thus, the present data suggest that TCDC is not cytotoxic because it activates PI3K-dependent cell survival signaling pathways. The McNtcp.24 rat hepatoma cell line, which is stably transfected with the sodium taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide and undergoes bile acid-mediated apoptosis, was used for all experiments (23.Torchia E.C. Shapiro R.J. Agellon L.B. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 206-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% bovine calf serum, 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 100 Î¼g/liter streptomycin, 100 Î¼g/liter gentamycin, and 200 Î¼g/liter G418. Cells were grown to 50â75% confluence in 60-mm dishes and made quiescent by culture in serum-free DMEM for 8â12 h. PI3K activity was measured using modifications of a published technique (24.Koh J.S. Lieberthal W. Heydrick S. Levine J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 716-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). After serum deprivation, cells were treated with diluent, 50 Î¼m GCDC, or 50 Î¼m TCDC for 15 min. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1% Nonidet P-40 and rocked for 20 min on ice. Clarified protein (1.5 mg/sample) was incubated with 5 Î¼l of anti-PI3K p85 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) overnight at 4 Â°C. Immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with 60 Î¼l of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (pH 7.4); three times with buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 5 mm LiCl, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4; and twice with buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4. Assays were then performed in a reaction mixture containing 0.88 mm ATP, 100 mm MgCl2, 30 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP, and 20 Î¼g of phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) and incubated with agitation for 15 min at 37 Â°C. The reactions were stopped with 20 Î¼l of 6 m HCl. The organic layer was extracted with 160 Î¼l of CH3OH/MeOH (1:1) and separated on a silica gel thin-layer chromatography plate (J. T. Baker Inc.). Thin-layer chromatography plates were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2) and dried. Radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol phosphates were visualized by autoradiography on X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). PKCÎ¶ activity was measured using modifications of a published technique (25.Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Frutos S. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum-deprived for 12 h and stimulated with diluent, 250 nm insulin, or 200 Î¼m TCDC for 90 min. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by rocking for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged (14,000 Ãg) for 15 min at 4 Â°C, and 1 mg of the cytosolic protein was incubated with 10 Î¼l of anti-PKCÎ¶ antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 Â°C. Immune complexes were precipitated with 100 Î¼l of protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) overnight at 4 Â°C and then washed seven times with lysis buffer modified to contain 500 mm NaCl. Washed immunoprecipitates were incubated with 2 Î¼g of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and 10 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 Â°C in 35 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm phenyl phosphate. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Radiolabeled myelin basic protein was detected by autoradiography on BiomaxMR film (Kodak). At least three independent experiments of all PI3K and PKCÎ¶ assays were performed. Apoptosis was quantitated by assessing the characteristic nuclear changes of apoptosis using the DNA-binding dye 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride and fluorescence microscopy (26.Que F.G. Gores G.J. LaRusso N.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G106-G115PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids for constitutively activated PI3K (pEF-BOSÎRI-ISH2-CAAX), dominant-negative PI3K (pEF-BOSÎRI-Îp85), constitutively activated Akt (pCMV6-Myr-Akt-HA), and wild-type PKCÎ¶ (pcDNA3HA-Î¶PKC), dominant-negative PKCÎ¶ (pcDNA3HA-Î¶PKC-D/N) and luciferase reporter plasmids p105 (cona-luc) and p106 (ÎºB-cona-luc) have been previously described (27.Hedin K.E.

The TK-Renilla-CMV plasmid was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and used to normalize for transfection efficiency in luciferase assays. GFP (pEGFP-N1) was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). McNtcp.24 cells (1.5 Ã 105 cells/ml) were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (30.Roberts L.R. Kurosawa H. Bronk S.F. Fesmier P.J. Agellon L.B. Leung W.Y. Mao F. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1714-1726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and used 48 h after transfection. Cells were stimulated with diluent (DMEM) or different concentrations of TCDC and GCDC. Nuclear protein extracts were then prepared as described by Dignam et al. (31.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and used immediately or stored at â80 Â°C. For EMSA, 6 Î¼g of nuclear proteins and 3 Î¼g of the nonspecific competitor poly(dIÂ·dC) were incubated in binding buffer (100 mm HEPES, 300 mm KCl, 20% Ficoll, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with 3.5 pmol of double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide containing an NF-ÎºB consensus binding sequence (5â²-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3â²) that was labeled with [Î³-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Binding reactions were performed by incubating the samples for 15 min at 22 Â°C. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from the unbound DNA probe by electrophoresis through 5% native polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5Ã Tris borate/EDTA. The gel was dried and exposed to BiomaxMR films. Specificity of binding was certified by competition with a 40-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded consensus oligonucleotide and by supershifting with 1 Î¼l of anti-NF-ÎºB p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). At least three independent experiments of all EMSAs were performed. McNtcp.24 cells were cotransfected with 0.2 Î¼g of TK-Renilla-CMV and 1.5 Î¼g of either p105 or p106. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 18â24 h. Both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantitated using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Background expression of luciferase, as determined in cells transfected with the p105 vector, was substracted from p106 values. The recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus Ad5-IÎºB, containing an IÎºB in which serines 32 and 36 are mutated to alanine (generous gift of D. A. Brenner, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), and Ad-ÎE1, an empty adenovirus for control experiments, were grown and purified by banding twice in CsCl gradients as described previously (32.Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). For adenoviral infection, McNtcp.24 cells were grown to 50â75% confluence. The medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum, and Ad5-IÎºB or Ad-ÎE1 viral stock solutions were added at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Culture dishes were rocked every 15 min for 2 h, and the culture medium was supplemented with 20% serum. Cells were then cultured for an additional 12â16 h before they were used for experiments. Immunoblot analysis of Akt was performed on McNtcp.24 whole cell lysates. Cells were lysed in 100 Î¼l of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5%) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 7.0) for 60 min and then incubated overnight with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-Akt or rabbit anti-phospho-Akt(Ser473) antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). After washing, membranes were incubated for 60 min with a 1:3000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (New England Biolabs) and washed again. Bound antibody was visualized using chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to X-Omat film. Membranes were then stripped of antibodies in 100 mmmercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris, and 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 Â°C and reblotted overnight with a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to demonstrate equal protein loading. Blots were washed as described above, incubated for 60 min with a 1:5000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-goat IgG (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), and visualized as described above. Antibodies against HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in a 1:1000 dilution for immunoblots demonstrating expression of transfected Akt and wild-type and dominant-negative PKCÎ¶, which all have an HA tag. Blots were washed as described above, incubated for 60 min with a 1:10000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (BIOSOURCE), and visualized as described above. At least three independent experiments of Akt immunoblots and anti-HA immunoblots were performed. The PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 were obtained from Calbiochem. The NF-ÎºB consensus oligonucleotide was purchased from Promega. GCDC, TCDC, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, and all other reagents were from Sigma. To ascertain a putative role for PI3K in modulating bile acid cytotoxicity, we first asked if toxic and nontoxic bile salts activate PI3K. Serum-deprived McNtcp.24 cells were stimulated with 50 Î¼m TCDC, 50 Î¼m GCDC, or diluent for 15 min. PI3K was immunoprecipitated, and the activity of the immunopurified protein was measured. The nontoxic bile acid TCDC readily activated PI3K, whereas no kinase activity was observed in quiescent cells (Fig.1 A). Wortmannin, a potent PI3K inhibitor (33.Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), blocked the TCDC-induced stimulation of PI3K, demonstrating the specificity of the assay. In marked contrast, the cytotoxic glycine conjugate of chenodeoxycholate did not stimulate PI3K activity, demonstrating that PI3K is differentially activated by structurally similar, but not identical bile acids. Because the nontoxic bile acid TCDC activated PI3K and the cytotoxic bile acid GCDC did not, we next tested the possibility that PI3K activity might be protective in this setting. McNtcp.24 cells were pretreated with wortmannin or LY294002 and then incubated with 50 Î¼m TCDC for 4 h. Neither PI3K inhibitor alone caused cell death. Additionally, as a single agent, TCDC also did not kill cells. However, TCDC effectively induced apoptosis in cells pretreated with the PI3K inhibitors (Fig. 1 B). To further confirm that PI3K activity protected the cells from TCDC-induced cell death, we transiently expressed dominant-negative PI3K and treated the cells with TCDC (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with the results seen with the pharmacologic inhibitors, genetic blockade of PI3K activation also sensitized the cells to TCDC-induced apoptosis. These findings predicted that constitutive activation of PI3K would prevent normally toxic bile salts from killing cells. We tested this possibility by expressing constitutively active PI3K, which effectively blocked apoptosis induced by the cytotoxic bile salt GCDC (Fig. 1 D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that bile acid-induced PI3K activation can modulate bile acid cytotoxicity. Additionally, they suggest that TCDC is inherently toxic; however, its cytotoxicity is blocked by activation of a PI3K-dependent survival signal. Both Akt and PKCÎ¶ are downstream PI3K effectors that, in some settings, prevent apoptosis. Therefore, we next investigated if these two kinases are involved in downstream signaling of PI3K-mediated survival signaling. Akt activation was investigated by immunoblot analysis in whole cell lysates using a phospho-specific anti-Akt antibody to identify active Akt (34.Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Although Akt was expressed in the McNtcp.24 cells, activated Akt was detected only in cells stimulated with insulin (a positive control), but not in those stimulated with TCDC (Fig.2 A). To demonstrate that Akt does not participate in preventing bile acid-induced cell death, we overexpressed a constitutively active form of Akt in McNtcp.24 cells. Overexpression of active Akt did not decrease GCDC-induced apoptosis compared with control transfected cells; however, staurosporine-induced apoptosis was reduced in cells overexpressing Akt (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating that constitutively active Akt was functional in these cells. Collectively, these results suggest that TCDC-mediated PI3K survival signals are unlikely to involve Akt activation. We next determined if PKCÎ¶, another downstream effector of PI3K, participates in mediating TCDC-induced activation of cell survival signaling. Analogous to the experimental approach used above for PI3K, McNtcp.24 cells were treated with TCDC or insulin, and PKCÎ¶ activity was measured. As demonstrated in Fig.3 A, TCDC activated PKCÎ¶ in a wortmannin-dependent manner, suggesting that PKCÎ¶ activation requires a PI3K-generated signal. This TCDC-induced activation of PKCÎ¶ was concentration-dependent (Fig.3 B). We next asked whether PKCÎ¶ is also required for the survival response. To demonstrate that we could manipulate PKCÎ¶ activity, McNtcp.24 cells were transfected with empty vector, dominant-negative mutant PKCÎ¶, or wild-type PKCÎ¶. Transfection of dominant-negative PKCÎ¶ markedly reduced PKCÎ¶ activity, whereas overexpression of wild-type PKCÎ¶ increased total PKCÎ¶ activity (Fig. 3 C). We then used this dominant-negative PKCÎ¶ construct to assess whether PKCÎ¶ participates in the survival response. Correspondingly, expression of dominant-negative PKCÎ¶ increased TCDC-induced apoptosis â¼4-fold compared with cells transfected with an empty plasmid (Fig. 3 D). To further assess the possible protective effect of PKCÎ¶ in bile acid-induced apoptosis, McNtcp.24 cells were transfected with either a control expression vector or wild-type PKCÎ¶. Cells were then treated with the toxic bile acid GCDC, and apoptosis was quantitated. In cells expressing wild-type PKCÎ¶, GCDC-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced (Fig. 3 E). Collectively, our data suggest that PKCÎ¶ is a critical downstream effector in a TCDC-activated, PI3K-dependent survival signaling pathway. We noted that pretreatment of McNtcp.24 cells with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D also converted nontoxic TCDC into a cytotoxic bile acid (Fig. 4). This result reminded us of the effects of actinomycin D in TNF-Î± treated cells (35.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Verma I.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), where the coincident transcriptional activation of anti-apoptotic NF-ÎºB target genes prevented TNF-Î± from killing cells. Additionally, PI3K and PKCÎ¶, both of which are activated by TCDC, can activate NF-ÎºB. Taken together, these observations suggest that the anti-apoptotic pathway activated by TCDC might include NF-ÎºB. Activation of NF-ÎºB was first assessed by EMSA. Nuclear proteins were extracted from McNtcp.24 cells after treatment with 0â200 Î¼m TCDC or with 28 ng/ml TNF-Î± as a positive control for 1 h (Fig. 5 A). TCDC induced a concentration-dependent accumulation of an activity that bound to the NF-ÎºB consensus oligonucleotide. This TCDC-induced NF-ÎºB activation was maximal at 200 Î¼m(data not shown). To demonstrate that the binding activity was due to NF-ÎºB, we incubated binding reactions with a supershifting antibody to the p65 subunit of NF-ÎºB and with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 B, TCDC-induced activation of NF-ÎºB was also time-dependent, starting at 30 min with a maximum at 60â90 min. Thus, treatment of hepatocytes with TCDC, but not GCDC (Fig. 5 D), activates NF-ÎºB-DNA binding in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Next, we determined if TCDC-induced NF-ÎºB activation requires PI3K activity. McNtcp.24 cells were treated with 200 Î¼m TCDC in the absence or presence of the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin (Fig. 5 C). Both of these structurally dissimilar PI3K inhibitors markedly reduced NF-ÎºB activation by TCDC, demonstrating that TCDC activates NF-ÎºB by a mechanism dependent upon and downstream of PI3K activity. To confirm that TCDC transcriptionally activates NF-ÎºB, we transfected McNtcp.24 cells with a luciferase reporter construct and stimulated the cells with the bile acids TCDC and GCDC. To normalize for transfection efficiency, a control Renilla luciferase construct was cotransfected into the cells. Consistent with the EMSA results, TCDC, but not GCDC, increased expression of the luciferase construct (Fig. 5 E). Moreover, the TCDC-induced transcriptional response was blocked by LY294002, whereas LY294002 did not reduce luciferase activity in control cells (data not shown). Thus, both the EMSA and luciferase assays demonstrated that TCDC activated NF-ÎºB in a PI3K-dependent manner. PKCÎ¶ mediates NF-ÎºB activation in several cell types. To determine the role of PKCÎ¶ in NF-ÎºB activation in our model, we performed NF-ÎºB reporter gene assays in cells that were transfected with wild-type or dominant-negative PKCÎ¶ and stimulated with diluent or 100 Î¼m TCDC. As shown in Fig. 5 F, luciferase activity was markedly increased in TCDC-stimulated cells expressing wild-type PKCÎ¶, whereas only a minimal increase was observed in cells expressing dominant-negative PKCÎ¶. These data strongly suggest that PKCÎ¶ regulates NF-ÎºB activation in the proposed TCDC-induced survival signaling cascade. Unless NF-ÎºB is inhibited, TNF-Î±-induced apoptosis usually does not occur in many cell types because the simultaneous activation of NF-ÎºB blocks this cell death signaling pathway. To determine the role of NF-ÎºB in TCDC-induced survival signaling, McNtcp.24 cells were transfected with an adenovirus that expresses the super-repressor of IÎºB (Ad5-IÎºB) or an empty control virus (Ad-ÎE1). Ad5-IÎºB contains an IÎºB that cannot be phosphorylated because serines 32 and 36 have been mutated to alanines (32.Iimuro Y. Nishiura T. Hellerbrand C. Behrns K.E. Schoonhoven R. Grisham J.W. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). At a multiplicity of infection of 100, nearly all cells were infected under these conditions as confirmed by demonstrating a 95% rate of apoptosis in transfected cells treated with 28 ng/ml TNF-Î± for 4 h (data not shown). Control experiments also showed that Ad5-IÎºB effectively blocked TNF-Î±-induced activation of NF-ÎºB as demonstrated by EMSA, whereas Ad-ÎE1 had no effect on NF-ÎºB activation compared with uninfected cells (data not shown). Following infection with Ad5-IÎºB, TCDC-induced apoptosis increased â¼8-fold compared with cells infected with the empty virus (Fig. 6), thus demonstrating that NF-ÎºB plays a key role in the transduction of a TCDC-activated survival signal. In this study, we have demonstrated that the nontoxic bile acid TCDC, but not the toxic bile salt GCDC, activated PI3K and initiated an anti-apoptotic signaling cascade in hepatocytes. Consistent with this observation, inhibition of PI3K transformed TCDC into a cytotoxic agent. Our data also suggest that the PI3K-dependent survival signal is mediated by the atypical PKC isoform PKCÎ¶, but not by the protein kinase Akt, which is implicated in many PI3K-dependent survival signaling pathways. We also showed that TCDC activated NF-ÎºB in a PKCÎ¶-dependent manner and that NF-ÎºB was a key participant in the anti-apoptotic response. Thus, these data demonstrate that some bile acids prevent their inherent cytotoxicity by simultaneously activating intrinsic cell survival signals. These observations are relevant to liver injury in cholestasis and suggest that liver injury can be attenuated by activation of PI3K-dependent survival pathways. Accumulating evidence suggests that bile acids modulate signal transduction pathways in hepatocytes (36.Bouscarel B. Kroll S.D. Fromm H. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 433-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, signaling pathways affected by bile acids include protein kinase A-, protein kinase C-, and calcium-dependent signal transduction cascades (36.Bouscarel B. Kroll S.D. Fromm H. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 433-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, the bile acid taurocholate was recently identified as an activator of PI3K. However, these studies did not address the impact of PI3K activation on hepatocyte survival (7.Misra S. UjhaÌzy P. Gatmaitan Z. Varticovski L. Arias I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26638-26644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that a nontoxic bile acid selectively activates PI3K-dependent survival signals in hepatocytes. However, the mechanisms by which bile acids activate PI3K remain to be elucidated. Misra et al. (7.Misra S. UjhaÌzy P. Gatmaitan Z. Varticovski L. Arias I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26638-26644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) could not identify a direct effect of bile acids on PI3K activity, suggesting an indirect mechanism for activation. Bile acids likely stimulate PI3K activity by facilitating its association with receptor complexes known to activate this lipid kinase. PI3K is implicated as an activator of a variety of anti-apoptotic signaling effectors, including Akt and the atypical isoforms of PKC (PKCÎ¶ and PKCÎ»/Î¹) (9.Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 37.Franke T. Kaplan D. Cantley L. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). We could not find evidence for Akt activation in cells treated with TCDC. This was surprising, as Akt is activated by the PI3K product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (38.Shimoke K. Yamada M. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Perhaps, bile acids alter the lipid-binding site of Akt, its cellular distribution, or other events necessary for Akt activation by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Our data did, however, implicate PKCÎ¶ as a critical component of a PI3K-induced signaling cascade. This interpretation is supported by the observation that the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin blocked TCDC-induced activation of PKCÎ¶. Furthermore, a dominant-negative PKCÎ¶ mutant blocked the PI3K-dependent survival pathway and transformed TCDC to a cytotoxic bile acid. Others have shown that PKCÎ¶ activation resulted in NF-ÎºB-dependent transcriptional activity (39.Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13594-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and we confirmed this observation in our model. Two mechanisms have been proposed for PKCÎ¶ regulation of NF-ÎºB activity. PKCÎ¶ may activate IÎºB kinase-Î², the kinase that phosphorylates IÎºBÎ±, resulting in the dissociation of NF-ÎºB from its inhibitor and subsequent nuclear translocation of the transcriptionally active subunits (22.Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Bren G. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, PKCÎ¶ activation promotes phosphorylation of the RelA subunit of NF-ÎºB, leading to enhanced transcriptional activity (39.Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13594-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The two mechanisms may also act in concert to promote NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity. Collectively, our studies implicate PKCÎ¶ as a likely link between TCDC-induced PI3K activation and NF-ÎºB activation in bile acid-treated hepatocytes. We have previously shown that bile salt cytotoxicity both in vivo and in vitro is mediated by the death receptor Fas (40.Faubion W. Guicciardi M. Miyoshi H. Bronk S. Roberts P. Svingen P. Kaufmann S. Gores G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 41.Miyoshi H. Rust C. Roberts P. Burghart L. Gores G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 669-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Toxic bile acids induce Fas oligomerization and activate caspase-8, resulting in apoptosis (40.Faubion W. Guicciardi M. Miyoshi H. Bronk S. Roberts P. Svingen P. Kaufmann S. Gores G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that enhanced PI3K activity inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis (42.Di Cristofano A. Kotsi P. Peng Y.F. Cordon-Cardo C. Elkon K.B. Pandolfi P.P. Science. 1999; 285: 2122-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus, bile acid-induced Fas activation appears to be inhibited by the simultaneous activation of a kinase-dependent, anti-apoptotic signaling pathway that blocks bile acid cytotoxicity. We identified the transcription factor NF-ÎºB as one of the downstream targets of the TCDC-stimulated PI3K activity. NF-ÎºB regulates expression of a large number of potential anti-apoptotic genes, including cIAP-1, XIAP, and IEX-IL(15.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 16.Stehlik C. de Martin R. Kumabashiri I. Schmid J.A. Binder B.R. Lipp J. J. Exp.

A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cIAP-1 inhibits apoptosis by suppressing activation of an apical caspase, most likely caspase-8 (15.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Thus, NF-ÎºB may suppress bile acid-mediated Fas/caspase-8 activation by up-regulating cIAP-1 expression. Our observations of TCDC stimulation of both pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling processes are reminiscent of signaling by TNF receptor-1 (35.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Verma I.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Although TNF receptor-1 signaling has been shown to activate PI3K (18.Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar), we observed TCDC-mediated activation of NF-ÎºB by EMSA in mouse hepatocytes obtained from TNF receptor-1 knockout animals (data not shown). These data exclude a role for TNF receptor-1 in TCDC-associated activation of NF-ÎºB. The observations presented in this study have significant implications for human liver diseases. Hepatic retention of toxic bile acids is thought to play a key role in liver injury during cholestasis (43.Javitt J. Nature. 1966; 210: 1262-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and is, in part, caused by hepatocyte apoptosis (44.Patel T. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1725-1741PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that some bile acids attenuate their inherent cytotoxic effects by activating a PI3K-dependent survival signal that is mediated by PKCÎ¶ and NF-ÎºB. This concept suggests that the net effect of bile acids in mediating liver injury reflects a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic processes. Thus, factors that positively modulate the PI3K-dependent survival signaling cascade may attenuate liver injury. Administration of modified bile acids that activate survival pathways might represent a rational therapy for cholestatic liver injury. Such pharmacologic agents could also be useful in other liver diseases associated with Fas-mediated liver injury (e.g. viral hepatitis and alcohol-associated liver disease). Because bile acids can be administered orally and taken up by the liver with a high first pass clearance, these concepts deserve further investigation."

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). For example, platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)1 stimulate cell proliferation and survival by activating their receptor tyrosine kinases, which recruit nucleotide exchange factors that activate Ras by converting it to its GTP-bound state. Once activated, Ras triggers a complex set of signal transduction pathways. These include the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway believed to be critical for cell survival and the Raf/Mek/Erk kinase cascade that has been implicated in cell proliferation (1.McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 363: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 2.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In addition to its involvement in regulating proliferation and survival, Ras also plays a pivotal role in malignant transformation. In about 30% of all human cancers, Ras is found mutated to a GTPase-deficient form that leads to constitutive activation of the above signaling pathways, uncontrolled proliferation, and survival of human tumors (4.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar, 5.Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). Closely related family members to Ras, such as RhoA and Rac1, have also been shown to be intimately involved in proliferation and transformation (3.Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). For example both RhoA and Rac1 are required for the G1 to S phase transition during the cell division cycle (6.Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GTP-locked RhoA and Rac1 are transforming, and dominant negative forms of these GTPases inhibit Ras-induced malignant transformation (7.Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 8.Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Unlike RhoA and Rac1, less is known about the involvement of the RhoB GTPase in proliferation and transformation. There are several features that distinguish RhoB from other Rho proteins. First, its cellular localization in early endosomes and prelysosomal compartment is different from other members (9.Mellor H. Flynn P. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4811-4814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, RhoB is an immediate early response gene that is induced by platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-Î±, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase v-Src, and ultraviolet irradiation (3.Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 10.Jahner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,11.Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, these studies were performed in fibroblasts mainly, and whether RhoB is also an immediate early response gene in human cancer cells of epithelial origin is not known. Finally, RhoB mRNA and protein levels are turned over much more rapidly (half-lives of 20 and 120 min, respectively) than other GTPases, which typically have half-lives on the order of 24 h (2.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 3.Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Therefore, although RhoA and RhoB share 90% amino acid sequence homology, their physiological functions are predicted to be distinct. Low molecular weight GTPases require prenylation, a lipid post-translational modification, for their biological activity (12.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). The two enzymes that catalyze these modifications for Ras and Rho GTPases are farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I). The enzymes recognize the C-terminal sequence CAAX (C = cysteine, A = aliphatic amino acid, andX = any amino acid) and covalently attach a farnesyl or a geranylgeranyl to the cysteine. FTase prefers a methionine or a serine whereas GGTase I prefers a leucine at the X position. Ras proteins (e.g. Ha-, Ki-, and N-Ras) are farnesylated, whereas RhoA and Rac1 are geranylgeranylated (12.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Although RhoB has a C-terminal leucine, which would be predicted to dictate only geranylgeranylation, it is both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated in cells (12.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Because Ras is found constitutively activated in 30% of human cancers (4.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar, 5.Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar) and Ras farnesylation is required for its malignant transforming activity (13.Lebowitz P.F. Casey P.J. Prendergast G.C. Thissen J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15591-15594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), FTase inhibitors (FTIs) were designed as novel anticancer drugs (14.Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15.Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 16.Cox A.D. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F51-F71Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). FTIs have shown impressive antitumor activity and lack of toxicity in preclinical models and are presently being used in various human clinical trial phases (14.Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15.Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 16.Cox A.D. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F51-F71Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Although initially FTIs were hypothesized to inhibit tumor growth by targeting Ras, recent evidence suggests that other farnesylated proteins may be involved (17.Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). RhoB has been suggested as a potential candidate for several reasons. First it is a substrate for FTase, and FTIs inhibit its farnesylation resulting in decreased RhoB-F and increased RhoB-GG. Second, the short half-life of RhoB coincides better than that of Ras with regard to the kinetics of the reversal of transformation of FTI (17.Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Third, a RhoB/RhoA chimeric protein that is exclusively geranylgeranylated was shown to be growth-inhibitory. Finally, a myristylated form of RhoB that is not prenylated was shown to prevent the ability of FTIs to inhibit Ras transformation (17.Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical properties of myristylated RhoB are not the same as wild type RhoB making it difficult to interpret the data. Furthermore, RhoB has been shown to be farnesylated by FTase as well as by GGTase I. Finally, most of the studies carried out so far were in murine fibroblasts (17.Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, although there is some evidence suggesting the involvement of RhoB in the antitumor activity of FTIs, direct evidence implicating RhoB in the mechanism of action of FTIs in human tumors is lacking. One way to directly address this important issue is to design RhoB mutants with CAAX boxes that are either exclusively farnesylated or geranylgeranylated and to determine whether RhoB-F is transforming and RhoB-GG is anti-transforming in human cancer cells. In this manuscript we describe a novel function for RhoB(WT) as a potent inhibitor of malignant transformation and a suppressor of human tumor growth. Furthermore, both RhoB-F and RhoB-GG induce apoptosis, inhibit oncogenic signaling, and suppress transformation in vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate the tumor-suppressing activity of RhoB and strongly suggest that RhoB-F is not a target for FTIs in human cancer cells. Wild type RhoB-WT, which has a CKVL sequence for a CAAX box and which is both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated, was used to make the following CAAX box mutants: RhoB-CAIM (F) designed to be only farnesylated and RhoB-CLLL (GG) designed to be only geranylgeranylated. All mutants were sequenced and found to have correct mutations. Also, all mutants were shown to have the correct prenylation status by transfecting each construct into COS7 cells, immunoprecipitating RhoB, cleaving the prenyl group, and analyzing the nature of the prenyl by high performance liquid chromatography. 2R.

Wild type RhoA was obtained from Dr. Channing Der (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) and subcloned into pCDNA3. Panc-1 and Saos-2 cell lines (ATCC) were derived from human pancreatic and osteosarcoma, respectively. HeLa and C-33A (ATCC) were derived from human cervical carcinoma. Panc-1, Saos-2, C-33A, and HeLa were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. One day prior to transfection, 2 Ã 105 cells were seeded into 60-mm plates. Cells were transfected with 1 Î¼g of each expression vector using Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's recommendation. Two days post-transfection cells were collected with trypsin, counted, and seeded into 100-mm plates at a density of 5 Ã 104 per plate. RhoA and p53 are expressed from pcDNA3/neo vector (Invitrogen) whereas RhoB-wt, RhoB-F, and RhoB-GG are expressed from pCMV-IRES/Zeo vector.2 Zeocin (Invitrogen) was used as a selection drug for cells transfected with RhoB expression vectors, and G418 (Mediatech, Inc.) was used for cells transfected with RhoA and p53. Zeocin was used at a concentration of 300 Î¼g/ml for Panc1 and 150 Î¼g/ml for HeLa, Saos-2, and C-33A, whereas G418 was used at a concentration of 800 Î¼g/ml for Panc-1 and 400 Î¼g/ml for HeLa, Saos-2, and C-33A. Cells were cultured in the presence of selection drug for 2 weeks before being fixed and stained with KaryoMax Giemsa stain (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, the medium was discarded, and cells were washed once with PBS and once with PBS/methanol (1:1). 50% of the methanol/PBS mixture was replaced with fresh methanol and left for 10 min. The mixture was discarded, and cells were washed with fresh anhydrous methanol. The monolayer was then covered with Giemsa stain for 2 min. Finally, the stain was displaced with water. Panc-1 cells were grown in DMEM, 10% FBS. Different RhoB constructs (RhoB-F, RhoB-GG, RhoB-F/GG) and the corresponding empty vector were transfected to Panc-1 cells by using the calcium phosphate method. At day 0, Panc-1 cells were plated (1.7 Ã 105 cells/plate), RhoB mutant constructs were transfected (day 1), and growth medium was changed (day 2). Cells were split (day 3), and fresh growth medium containing selection marker, Zeocin (300 Î¼g/ml), was changed every 3â4 days, until colonies formed 2 weeks later. Stably transfected cell lines were expanded and frozen in liquid nitrogen for future use. Soft agar assay was carried out at described previously (18.Sun J. Blaskovich M.A. Knowles D. Qian Y. Ohkanda J. Bailey R.D. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4919-4926PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected Panc-1 cells expressing the different RhoB mutants were plated in 10% FBS. The number of cells in each dish was counted on days 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Cells were counted by hemacytometer. To analyze cells undergoing apoptosis, the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase digoxygenin nick end-labeling with the ApopTag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis detection kit was used. Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After cytospin and washes with PBS, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme was applied to the cells followed by anti-digoxigenin-fluorescein. Mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was used to counterstain the nuclei. The cells were viewed by fluorescent microscopy. Panc-1 cells stably expressing different RhoB constructs were grown in DMEM, 0.5% FBS for 48 h, treated with or without IGF-1 (50 ng/ml), and processed for Western blotting as described previously (18.Sun J. Blaskovich M.A. Knowles D. Qian Y. Ohkanda J. Bailey R.D. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4919-4926PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-Akt was analyzed by using anti-phospho-Akt antibody (New England Biolabs). Phospho-Erk was detected by anti-phospho-Erk1/Erk2 antibody (New England Biolabs). Nonphosphorylated Akt and Erk2 were detected by anti-Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Erk2 (Upstate Biotechnology). RhoB protein was detected by mouse monoclonal anti-RhoB antibody (Santa Cruz). For phospho-Akt and phospho-Erk2, bands were quantified by using a scanning densitometer Model IGS-700 (Bio-Rad). Nude mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were maintained in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) procedures and guidelines. Panc-1 cells stably expressing RhoB-WT, RhoB-GG, RhoB-F, and empty vector were harvested, resuspended in PBS, and implanted subcutaneously into the right and left flank (10 Ã 106 cells/flank) of 8-week-old female nude mice, and the tumors were measured as described previously (18.Sun J. Blaskovich M.A. Knowles D. Qian Y. Ohkanda J. Bailey R.D. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4919-4926PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical significance between empty vector and different stably transfected RhoB mutants was evaluated by using Student's t test (p < 0.05). To test the hypothesis that RhoB-F is transforming and that RhoB-GG is anti-transforming, we have generated CAAX box mutants of RhoB that are either exclusively farnesylated or geranylgeranylated. The biochemical demonstration that in whole cells RhoB-F and RhoB-GG are exclusively farnesylated and geranylgeranylated, respectively, and RhoB-WT is farnesylated and geranylgeranylated was provided elsewhere.2 To determine the effects of the RhoB mutants on transformation of human cancer cells we used several in vitro and in vivo assays. We first determined the effects of the RhoB mutants on the ability of human cancer cells to grow foci in a focus formation assay. We transfected several human cancer cell lines with the RhoB mutant DNAs, and the foci that formed were scored 14 days later as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Control transfections were also performed with the tumor suppressor p53 and the GTPase RhoA, a closely related RhoB family member that shares 90% amino acid homology and that was previously shown to be transforming (3.Zohn I.M.

Fig.1 A and TableI show that the human pancreatic cancer cell line, Panc-1, transfected with empty vector DNA, pCMV, formed numerous foci (155â233 foci). In contrast, Panc-1 cells transfected with wild-type RhoB grew only 23â39 foci. Furthermore, RhoA-transfected Panc-1 cells grew more foci (over 346â409) than pcDNA3 empty vector-transfected cells (163â211 foci) (Fig.1 A and Table I). In contrast, Panc-1 cells transfected with p53 formed much fewer foci (21â27 foci). These data show that whereas RhoA promotes, RhoB suppresses foci formation suggesting that RhoB is capable of antagonizing transformation of Panc-1 cells. The prenylation status of RhoB did not affect its ability to inhibit foci formation of Panc-1 cells. Fig. 1 A and Table I show that RhoB-F and RhoB-GG were also potent inhibitors of Panc-1 foci formation. We next determined whether this inhibition of foci formation by RhoB could be extended to human cancer cells without Ras mutations. Table I shows that RhoB-F, RhoB-GG, and RhoB-WT were potent inhibitors of foci formation of C-33A and HeLa (cervical carcinomas) and Saos-2 (osteosarcoma), none of which expresses mutated Ras. In all of these cell lines, p53 inhibited whereas RhoA promoted foci formation (TableI).Table IRhoB-WT, RhoB-F, RhoB-GG, and p53, but not RhoA, inhibit focus formation of several human cancer cell linesHuman cancer cell linepCMVRhoB-WTRhoB-GGRhoB-FpcDNA3RhoAp53Panc-115523273016334621Panc-123339434921140927HeLa2610231460HeLa5743765892C-33A732172319126314C-33A61591622128721Saos-22600246611Panc-1, C-33A, HeLa, and Saos-2 human cancer cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors. Cells were maintained under drug selection for 2 weeks before foci were fixed, stained, and counted as described under âExperimental Procedures.â pCMV was the control vector for RhoB-WT, RhoB-F, and RhoB-GG whereas pcDNA3 was the control vector for RhoA and p53. Data are representative of two independent experiments, each carried out in duplicate except for Saos-2. Open table in a new tab Panc-1, C-33A, HeLa, and Saos-2 human cancer cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors. Cells were maintained under drug selection for 2 weeks before foci were fixed, stained, and counted as described under âExperimental Procedures.â pCMV was the control vector for RhoB-WT, RhoB-F, and RhoB-GG whereas pcDNA3 was the control vector for RhoA and p53. Data are representative of two independent experiments, each carried out in duplicate except for Saos-2. To confirm the effects of the RhoB mutants on malignant transformation, we transfected Panc-1 cells with the above constructs and isolated several stable clones as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Expression of RhoB was controlled by Western blotting using several clones picked from each construction (Fig.1 B). Representative clones with expression levels similar to each other were selected for further studies. The clones picked for further study were RhoB-WT clone 2 (W2), RhoB-F clone 2 (F2), and Rho-GG clone 2 (G2) (Fig. 1 B). We next determined the effects of the different RhoB mutants on the ability of Panc-1 cells to grow on soft agar. Panc-1 cells stably transfected with either empty vector, RhoB-F, RhoB-GG, or RhoB-WT were plated on soft agar plates and developed 3 weeks later as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Fig. 1 C shows that Panc-1 cells transfected with empty vector grew numerous and large colonies. In contrast, Panc-1 cells expressing RhoB-WT, RhoB-F, and RhoB-GG show little growth on soft agar. RhoB wild type was very potent at inhibiting Panc-1 soft agar growth, and no colonies could be detected (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the results of Fig. 1 C are in agreement with those of Fig. 1 A and Table I and demonstrate that RhoB antagonizes tumor growth and suggest that RhoB-F is not a target for the antitumor activity of FTIs in human cancer cells. Anchorage-dependent and -independent growth in Panc-1 cells could be regulated by different mechanisms. We therefore determined the effect of the RhoB mutants on the anchorage-dependent growth of Panc-1 cells. The different Panc-1 cell lines were plated on plastic dishes, and the growth rate of each cell line was determined by counting cells for 7 days as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Fig. 2 A shows that empty vector Panc-1 cells grew the fastest and reached 1.34 Ã 106 cells over 7 days. In contrast, RhoB-WT cells grew the least and reached only 0.43 Ã 106 cells over the same period of time. RhoB-F and RhoB-GG also grew slower reaching 0.64 Ã 106 and 0.93 Ã 106 cells over 7 days. Thus, RhoB inhibits both anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of Panc-1 cells, but the effect on anchorage-independent growth was more pronounced for all mutants. The ability of RhoB mutants to inhibit anchorage-dependent and -independent growth could be due to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. We determined the ability of RhoB mutants to alter cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry and found that RhoB mutants have little effect on cell cycle distribution (data not shown). We next evaluated whether or not the RhoB mutants affect programmed cell death of Panc-1 cells using ApopTag DNA fragmentation assays as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Fig.2 B shows that only 7% Panc-1 cells transfected with empty vector were undergoing apoptosis. In contrast, 21, 14, and 13% of RhoB-WT, RhoB-F, and Rho-GG cells, respectively, were apoptotic. Thus, RhoB mutants enhanced the ability of Panc-1 cells to undergo apoptosis by 2- to 3-fold. RhoB wild type was most potent at inducing apoptosis. A possible mechanism by which RhoB would enhance the ability of Panc-1 cells to undergo apoptosis is by inhibiting a survival pathway. One of the major signal transduction pathways that contributes to cell survival and prevention of cell death is the growth factor-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway where the Ser/Thr kinase Akt plays a pivotal role (2.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). We, therefore, determined the effects of the various RhoB mutants on the ability of one of the major survival growth factors, IGF-1, to stimulate Akt by Western immunoblotting with an antibody specific for activated (phosphorylated) Akt as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Fig. 3 shows that IGF-1 treatment of serum-starved Panc-1 cells transfected with empty vector resulted in potent activation of Akt. In contrast, in Panc-1 cells overexpressing RhoB-F, RhoB-GG, and RhoB-WT, the ability of IGF-1 to stimulate AKT phosphorylation/activation was inhibited by 50% (Â± 16%), 50% (Â± 18%), and 65% (Â± 15%), respectively. None of the RhoB mutants affected the expression levels of Akt (Fig. 3). We next evaluated the effects of the RhoB mutants on the activation of Erk1 and Erk2, two mitogen-activated protein kinases that have been shown to play a pivotal role in transformation (2.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 3.Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). These experiments were carried out in parallel with the experiments described above for Akt except that activation of Erk1/Erk2 was determined by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for activated (phosphorylated) Erk1/Erk2 as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Unlike Akt, treatment with IGF-1 did not further stimulate Erk1 and Erk2 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, in Panc-1 cells Erk2, but not Erk1, is constitutively activated as is apparent from the strong hyperphosphorylated band. Fig. 3 shows that RhoB-WT, RhoB-GG, and RhoB-F inhibited Erk2 constitutive activation by 75%, 70%, and 60%, respectively. None of the RhoB mutants affected the expression levels of Erk2 (Fig. 3). The results described above demonstrate that RhoB inhibits proliferation, foci formation, and soft agar growth, induces apoptosis, and inhibits signal transduction pathways involved in survival and transformation. The data indicate that RhoB is a potent suppressor of malignant transformation in Panc-1 cells in vitro. We next evaluated the ability of the RhoB mutants to suppress malignant transformation in an in vivo environment by evaluating their effects on the growth of Panc-1 cells in nude mice. Panc-1 cells expressing the different RhoB mutants (107cells/flank) were implanted subcutaneously under the right and left flank of nude mice. The tumor growth of the different Panc-1 cells was then followed by caliper measurements of the tumor sizes over time as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Fig.4 shows that within 5 days of cell implantation under the skin of nude mice, empty vector Panc-1 cells had an average tumor size of 116 Â± 10. In contrast, cells stably expressing RhoB-GG, RhoB-WT, or RhoB-F were smaller and flatter in appearance and had an average tumor size of 67 Â± 6, 91 Â± 9, and 95 Â± 8 mm3, respectively. Fig. 4 also shows that empty vector cells grew whereas RhoB-WT-, RhoB-F-, and RhoB-GG-expressing Panc-1 cells regressed. Tumor regression was the fastest with Panc-1 cells stably expressing RhoB-WT, and within 15 days of tumor implantation, all tumors disappeared. Panc-1 cells stably expressing RhoB-F and RhoB-GG took longer to disappear (43 and 56 days, respectively). Over a 75-day period since tumor cell implantation, empty vector cells grew to an average size of 455 Â± 197 whereas RhoB-F, RhoB-GG, and RhoB-WT remained undetectable (Fig. 4). Thus, RhoB-F, RhoB-GG, and RhoB-WT are all potent suppressors of Panc-1 tumor growth in nude mice. The ability of RhoB to suppress Panc-1 cell tumor growth in nude mice requires prenylation by either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl because a RhoB mutant that lacks a CAAX box did not inhibit tumor growth (Fig. 4). In this manuscript we provided strong evidence for a growth-inhibitory and tumor suppressor activity of the small GTPase RhoB. Little is known about the role of RhoB in proliferation and transformation of human cancer cells. In Rat1 fibroblasts, a dominant negative form of RhoB was shown to weakly inhibit focus formation induced by oncogenic Ras (19.Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). However, activated (GTPase-deficient Val-14-RhoB) itself lacked focus formation activity arguing against a transforming role for RhoB (19.Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated in human cancer cells that RhoB was a potent inhibitor of tumor growth of these cells in nude mice. Furthermore, RhoB was also a potent inhibitor of human tumor growthin vitro as shown in both anchorage-dependent (proliferation) and -independent (transformation) assays in vitro. RhoB is as potent as p53 in suppressing foci formation in several human cancer cell lines. In the same in vitrotransformation assay RhoA enhances foci formation. The ability of RhoB to inhibit focus formation is not dependent on the Ras mutation status of the human cancer cell lines. Indeed, RhoB was a potent inhibitor in cancer cells where Ras is mutated (Panc-1) as well as those where Ras is wild type (HeLa, C-33A, and Saos-2). The tumor growth suppressor activity of RhoB was also p53-independent because some of the human cancer cell lines used have nonfunctional p53. Furthermore, RhoB disrupted two major signaling pathways by inhibiting IGF-1 stimulation of Akt and constitutive activation of Erk2. This is consistent with its ability to inhibit proliferation and transformation. Thus, the ability of RhoB to block two signaling pathways that are involved in tumor survival and transformation may be pivotal to the tumor-suppressive activity of Panc-1 cells in nude mice. The ability of RhoB to potently antagonize transformation in vitro and in vivo suggested that it is most likely not a target for the antitumor activity of FTI in human cancer cells. However, considering that RhoB is both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated in cells (12.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 13.Lebowitz P.F. Casey P.J. Prendergast G.C. Thissen J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15591-15594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the antitransforming activity of RhoB is mainly due to its geranylgeranylated form and that in its farnesylated state RhoB is transforming. Indeed it was recently suggested that RhoB-F induces tumor survival and that RhoB-GG inhibits tumor growth (17.Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It was further suggested that FTI treatment would result in loss of the survival function of RhoB-F (apoptosis/cytotoxic effects) and gain of the growth-inhibitory function of RhoB-GG (cell cycle/cytostatic effects) (17.Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1439-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis is based on evidence derived from results obtained mainly from studies undertaken in Ras-transformed fibroblasts. Although in fibroblasts this may be the case, our results argue against this hypothesis in human cancer cells. RhoB-F was just as potent as RhoB-GG at inhibiting human tumor growth in vitroand IGF-1 stimulation of Akt and constitutive activation of Erk2 as well as inducing apoptosis and inhibiting tumor growth in nude mice. Thus, the work described in this manuscript identifies the potent antitransforming activity and tumor suppressor activity of RhoB and provides strong evidence that in human cancer cells, inhibition of the farnesylation of RhoB does not contribute to the mechanism by which FTIs inhibit tumor growth.

(1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 1554â1559).

As a rule, the mineralized structure has mechanical properties far superior to each of its constituent components. A well known example is mother-of-pearl or nacre. Its micron-sized compact brick wall texture is more than 1000 times tougher than the chemically precipitated counterpart, aragonite (4.Jackson A. Vincent J. Turner R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1988; 234: 415-425Crossref Google Scholar). A complex biochemical machinery is required for the production of these highly ordered biominerals. Specialized microenvironments must be created to accommodate the growing minerals (1.Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization.

The constituent ions as well as macromolecules capable of directing and fine-tuning the crystallization must be supplied, while waste products of crystallization have to be removed and deleterious precipitations avoided. The actual biomineralization process follows as a remarkable case of self-organization, with the densely packed organic-inorganic composite emerging as the final product. Furthermore, the organisms must deploy upstream the calcification, signal transmitters (6.Rosen V. Thies R.S.

Despite its complexity, it would appear as though the skeleton-forming machinery evolved with remarkable facility. The skeletons of many animal phyla were installed in less than 30 million years, since the beginning of the Cambrian, 544 million years ago (10.Lowenstam H.A. Margulis L.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1992: 397-411Google Scholar). Phylogenetic evidence derived from fossils and morphology and DNA-sequencing of extant animals indicate that major steps in animal diversification had already been made prior to the âCambrian explosionâ (12.Ayala F.J.

To explain how a function as complex as skeleton formation could emerge in many independent stocks almost simultaneously, we suggested that components of the mineralizing machinery were already available in the soft bodied ancestors but that they served other functions than calcification. Subsequently, during the Cambrian explosion, they only had to be co-opted for organized biomineralization (17.Marin F. Smith M. Isa Y. Muyzer G. Westbroek P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18.Westbroek P. Marin F. Nature. 1998; 392: 861-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). One indication supporting this âpreadaptationâ hypothesis came from the observations by Lopez and collaborators that molluscan nacre can induce bone production in human osteoblasts (18.Westbroek P. Marin F. Nature. 1998; 392: 861-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19.Lopez E. Vidal B. Berland S. Camprasse S. Camprasse G. Silve C.

III. 1997; 320: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest a common Precambrian ancestry for the responsible signaling system in both taxa. Another point to mention was our finding that secreted muci and soluble shell matrix strongly cross-reacted with antisera against these two antigens in various molluscs as well as in the coral Galaxea fascicularis (17.Marin F. Smith M. Isa Y. Muyzer G. Westbroek P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both the freshly extracted muci, which were secreted by noncalcifying epithelia into the ambient seawater, and the matrix fractions were shown to inhibit the in vitrocrystallization of calcium carbonate. We explained these observations by assuming that the âanticalcifyingâ mucous secretions protected the soft bodied ancestors from spontaneous incrustrations in the highly supersaturated Precambrian ocean waters (17.Marin F. Smith M. Isa Y. Muyzer G. Westbroek P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At the onset of calcification, the same inhibitory molecules could then be incorporated into the calcifying machinery to fine-tune the crystallization process. Clearly, this âanticalcification hypothesisâ calls for a more detailed study of the macromolecular fractions in the mucous secretions and the mineralized matrix. In this paper, we report the isolation of a new gene encoding a water-soluble protein of the nacroprismatic shell of the protected mollusc Pinna nobilis, the largest bivalve in the Mediterranean. The protein that we identified is acidic and enriched in serine and proline residues. It is further characterized by the presence of 13 tandem repeats with 31 amino acid residues and a C terminus containing three unique cysteine residues. The presence of tandem repeats, the enrichment in serine residues, and its consequent potential of high glycosylation strongly suggest that this protein is a mucin. The protein is localized in the nacre but not in the prisms ofP. nobilis. We chose to name it mucoperlin, and we believe that its skeletal association is important evidence in support of our anticalcification hypothesis. Mantle tissue fragments from actively calcifying, juvenile P. nobilis, grown in aquaria, were obtained. Tissue collection was performed according to the European directive 92-43-CEE concerning protected species (91.European Economic CommunityOff. J. E. C. 1992; L206: 22.7.1992Google Scholar). This operation did not affect the viability and filtration capacity of the animal. The isolated tissue (about 0.5 g) was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Shell material was collected from two different batches of juvenile specimens at CERAM (Centres d'Etudes des Ressources Animales Marines). The two layers of the shells (i.e. outer prismatic calcitic layer and inner aragonitic mother-of-pearl) were separated by abrasion and by dissociation of the calcitic prisms in dilute sodium hypochlorite. Total RNA was extracted from 0.5 g of mantle tissue using the RNAgentsÂ® Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). The extraction yielded about 70 Î¼g of RNA. Poly(A)-mRNA was subsequently isolated with Oligotexâ¢ Resin (Qiagen). Approximately 1.5 Î¼g mRNA was obtained and immediately processed using the ZAPâ¢ Express cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene), eventually yielding double-strandedXhoIâEcoRI cDNA fragments. Approximately 70 ng of cDNA was ligated to 1 Î¼g ofXhoI/EcoRI-predigested dephosphorylated ZAP Express vector. Subsequent packaging of recombinant phages was performed with GigapackÂ® II Gold Packaging Extract (Stratagene). The resulting phage library consisted of 350,000 clones, of which at least 95% were found to be recombinant. Prior to the antibody screening, the library was amplified. The amplified library was screened with antibodies raised against acetic acid-soluble extracts of the nacreous layer of P. nobilis(21.Marin F. Muyzer G. Dauphin Y. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Ser. III. 1994; 318: 1653-1659Google Scholar). About 500,000 phages were used in the initial screening. After infection of Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRFâ², cells were plated and grown for 4 h at 42 Â°C. The plates were covered with isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside-saturated nitrocellulose membranes (BA85; Schleicher & Schuell) and incubated at 37 Â°C for an additional 5 h. Membranes were first blocked in 1% gelatin/Tris-buffered saline/Tween solution and then incubated in blocking solution containing the antiserum (diluted 1:3000), NaN3 (500 Î¼g/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 Î¼g/ml). An E. coli extract (1 mg/ml) was added to decrease background staining. The membranes were then incubated with the conjugated antibody GAR/AP (Sigma) and subsequently with the chemoluminescent substrate CSPDÂ® (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) before being exposed to X-Omat films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Eleven positive clones were identified, and three of them were rescreened to purity. In a two-step in vivoexcision, the pBK-CMV phagemids (Stratagene) with their cDNA inserts were excised from the purified ZAP Express phage clones and converted into the plasmids pPNC1âpPNC3. Enzyme restriction analysis of plasmids pPNC1â3 showed similar PstI and XhoI restriction patterns consisting of a 2100-base pair (bp)1 PstI and a <100-bp PstIâXhoI fragment. Partial nucleotide sequences determined from the 5â²- and 3â²-termini further confirmed that the three clones contained identical inserts. The sequence of the cDNA insert of pPCN1 was determined using 5â²-deletions made with the Erase-a-BaseÂ® System (Promega). Sequences were compiled and analyzed with the Wisconsin Package (version 9.0) of the Genetics Computer Group. The GenBankâ¢ accession number for the sequence of the cDNA insert of pPNC1 is AF 145215. The cDNA insert of pPNC1 was cloned as aBamHIâKpnI fragment in vector pQE-32 (QIAexpressÂ® Expression System; Qiagen). In the resulting construct, pPNC4, the putative start codon on the cDNA insert is cloned in frame with the start codon of the T5 promoter transcription-translation system of pQE-32. Cloning in ZAP Express (pBK-CMV) and the above described subcloning in pQE-32 resulted in the addition of an extra fragment of 33 bp to the 5â²-end of the original cDNA. This fragment encoded a 11-amino acid peptide (MRGSHHHHHHG) with a molecular mass of 1.5 kDa. The His-tagged recombinant protein was expressed from pPNC4 inE. coli M15 and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (Qiagen). A complete purification of the recombinant protein was achieved by using a preparative electrophoresis (Bio-Rad; 491 Prep Cell, 7% acrylamide). On denaturing gels (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), the fusion protein migrated as an 80-kDa band, in good agreement with the molecular weight as deduced from the sequence (Fig. 1). Recombinant mucoperlin was desalted by ultrafiltration (Amicon, YM10 membrane), lyophilized, and used to generate polyclonal antibodies in a rabbit. To investigate whether native mucoperlin is present in either the nacreous or in the prismatic layer of P. nobilis shell or in both, â¼100-mg portions of both cleaned shell materials (batch 1) were powdered and dissolved overnight in 6 ml of 20% (w/v) EDTA, pH 8.0. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (5 min, 13,000 rpm). Demineralization with EDTA instead of acetic acid permitted direct analysis of the supernatant by ELISA and dot-blot (22.Collins M.J. Curry G.B. Muyzer G. Quinn R. Zomerdijk T. Westbroek P. Hist. Biol. (Paris). 1988; 1: 207-224Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), using anti-mucoperlin. To study the intimacy of association between the native mucoperlin and the mineral phase (23.Crenshaw M.A. Biomineralization. 1972; 6: 6-11Google Scholar) and possible contamination of shell matrix by soft tissues (24.Gaffey S. Bronnimann C.E. J. Sediment. Petrol. 1993; 63: 752-754Crossref Google Scholar), nacre powder was submitted to a pretreatment with sodium hypochlorite (2 g of active chlorine/liter) for 70 h, washed with water, dried, and dissolved in EDTA. The resulting extract was compared with EDTA-extracts of nonpretreated material in ELISA assays. For electrophoretic analysis, 3 g of hypochlorite-treated powders from juvenile nacre and prisms was decalcified overnight at 4 Â°C with 5% (v/v) acetic acid, pH 4. Acid decalcification precluded the formation of aggregates during the subsequent purification steps, a phenomenon often observed when EDTA is used (25.Wheeler A.P. Rusenko K.W. George J.W. Sikes C.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1987; 87: 953-960Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The solutions were centrifuged, and the supernatants were desalted by ultrafiltration (Amicon, YM10) and lyophilized. The pellets were thoroughly rinsed with water and lyophilized. The lyophilized preparations were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min at 100 Â°C (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After a short centrifugation, the denatured samples were applied on 12% acrylamide gels. Gels were either stained with silver (27.Myers J.M. Veis A. Sabsay B. Wheeler A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 300-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or electroblotted on ImmobilonTM-P (Millipore Corp.) (28.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of blotted proteins with anti-mucoperlin was performed using the chemoluminescent substrate Luminol (Sigma catalog no. A4685) (29.Leong M.M.L. Milstein C. Pannell R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 1645-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The second batch of shell material was used to determine the degree of glycosylation of nacre matrix. Because the amount of this batch was limited, only a few assays could be performed. Part of the acetic acid-soluble extract of hypochlorite-treated nacre was run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently blotted as described above. The blot was stained with the Immun-Blot kit for glycoproteins (Bio-Rad catalog no. 170-6490). The procedure involves periodate oxidation, labeling with biotin, incubation with streptavidin-AP, and staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. In one sample of nacre matrix, the periodate oxidation was omitted to ascertain the specificity of the staining (negative control). Fetuin was used as a positive control. The other part of the acid-soluble matrix was submitted to chemical deglycosylation with TFMS (Sigma catalog no. T 1394) for 5 h, as described by Edge et al. (30.Edge A.S.B. Faltynek C.R. Hof L. Reichert Jr., L.E. Weber P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). To prevent peptide bond hydrolysis, all procedures were performed at 0 Â°C under N2. The deglycosylated matrix was desalted and concentrated by ultrafiltration and lyophilized. The matrix was then analyzed on Western blots with anti-mucoperlin as described above. Fetuin was deglycosylated by the same method to check the efficiency of the procedure. Acetic acid-soluble nacre matrix extracted from the second batch was also tested for 45Ca binding capacity, according to a standard protocol (31.Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The assays were performed after dot-blotting the whole matrix on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at various concentrations as indicated in the legend of Fig. 7. GPA, a calcium-binding protein from a unicellular calcifying alga (32.Corstjens P.L.A.M. van der Kooij A. Linschooten C. Brouwers G.J. Westbroek P. deVrind-de Jong E. J. Phycol. 1998; 34: 622-630Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. Furthermore, the capacity of the nacre matrix to inhibit calcium carbonate precipitation in vitrowas also tested (33.Wheeler A.P. George J.W. Evans C.A. Science. 1981; 212: 1397-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Juvenile and adult P. nobilis cleaned shell fragments were polished with micropolish powder (0.05 Î¼m), thoroughly rinsed with water, and slightly etched with EDTA 1% (w/v) during 15 min, to expose antigenic determinants. The material was then immunostained as described previously (17.Marin F. Smith M. Isa Y. Muyzer G. Westbroek P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34.Muyzer G. Westbroek P. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta. 1989; 53: 1699-1702Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and viewed by microscope under incident light. Clone PNC1 was isolated from a P. nobilis cDNA library using antibodies against the soluble matrix of Pinna nacre. Analysis of its insert gave a nucleotide sequence of 2138 bp (Fig.1). We assume the ATG at positions 208â210 to be the start codon of an open reading frame of 1908 bp, encoding a gene referred to as mcp. The cDNA contains a 5â²-untranslated region of 208 bp and a truncated 3â²-untranslated region of only 23 bp. A poly(A) tail is missing at the 3â²-end. This is probably due to an internal XhoI restriction recognition site in the original mRNA. Themcp-encoded protein mucoperlin (Fig. 1) encompasses 636 amino acid residues and has a calculated molecular mass of 66.7 kDa and a pI of 4.8 (Table I). The two most abundant amino acids are proline and serine (Table I). Mucoperlin comprises three distinct regions (schematically presented in Fig.2): a short N-terminal part (11 amino acids), a tandem repeat region (403 amino acids), and a C-terminal part (222 amino acids). The tandem-repeat region consists of 13 repeats (Fig. 2). They all contain 31 amino acids, 12 of which are invariant through the repeats. Only few substitutions occur, mostly in the second half of each repeat.Table IAmino acid composition of mcp-deduced mucoperlinAmino acidnMole%Amino acidnMole%Ala274.25(8.3)Met365.66(2.4)Cys30.47(1.7)Asn132.04(4.4)Asp304.72(5.3)Pro8413.21(5.1)Glu294.56(6.2)Gln385.98(4.0)Phe30.47(3.9)Arg81.26(5.7)Gly426.60(7.2)Ser9314.62(6.9)His10.16(2.2)Thr345.35(5.8)Ile467.23(5.2)Val467.23(6.6)Lys386.00(5.7)Trp10.16(1.3)Leu599.28(9.0)Tyr50.79(3.2)n, number of residues.

Proteins. 1988; 4: 99-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) (636 total amino acid residues; pI = 4.87; theoretical mass = 66.7 kDa). The primary structure of mucoperlin (Figs. 1 and 2) indicates that the natural molecule may be heavily glycosylated, particularly in the tandem repeat region. Four possible N-glycosylation sites, characterized by NX(S/T) (where X may be any amino acid except proline), occur in this region. The tandem repeat region also exhibits many potential O-glycosylation sites, as suggested by its high serine and threonine content. A search performed with the NetOGlyc 2.0 program (35.Hansen J.E. Lund O. Tolstrup N. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Brunak S. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) predicts that 27 serines are glycosylated in that region (i.e. one to three serines per repeat) (Figs. 1 and 2). Prosite analysis and a search made with NetPhos 2.0 (36.Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar) suggested that some of the serine and threonine residues may be phosphorylated, a feature commonly found with proteins associated with mineralized tissues (1.Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization. Oxford University Press, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). A high content of proline (17% of the residues) is another characteristic feature of the tandem repeat region, suggesting that this part of the molecule has a rigid, rodlike conformation (37.Jentoft N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 291-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 38.Hilkens J. Ligtenberg M.J.L. Vos H.L. Litinov S.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 359-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of mucoperlin has different characteristics than the repeat region. Glycosylation appears to be less densely distributed (Fig. 1), potentially with only one N-glycosylation site at position 625 and three O-glycosylation sites through threonine residues at positions 418, 465, and 472. On the other hand, phosphorylation sites may be more densely distributed, according to both Prosite and NetPhos 2.0 analysis. Proline and serine are less common (8 and 10%, respectively, of the C-terminal amino acids), although their abundance is relatively high as compared with values of 5.1 and 6.9% for proteins in general (39.McCaldon P. Argos P. Proteins. 1988; 4: 99-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the only three cysteine residues in mucoperlin occur in the C-terminal region, at positions 596, 604, and 631, respectively. Finally, the C-terminal region contains also the five tyrosine residues of the protein, two of them (at positions 482 and 517) showing all of the requirements for tyrosine sulfation (40.Huttner W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 361-363Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). BLAST searches (41.Pearson W. Lipman W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar) in protein and DNA-translated data bases showed limited homology of mucoperlin with any other known protein. The highest homology was found with PGM, an incompletely characterized pig gastric mucin (42.Turner B.S. Bhaskar K.R. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Specian R.D. Lamont J.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that exhibits serine-rich tandem repeats of 16 amino acid residues (Fig. 3 A). The C terminus of mucoperlin did not exhibit any homology with a mucin. A striking homology was observed between a set of 24 residues (positions 425â448) and the N terminus of a chicken homeobox protein Hox-A9 (Ref.43.Gaunt S.J. Strachan L. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar; Fig. 3 B). The results of immunodetection of mucoperlin in EDTA extracts of nacreous and prismatic shell material (batch 1) of P. nobilis are shown in Fig. 4, A andB. The reactions were performed using ELISA and dot-blotting with the antiserum directed against His-tagged recombinant mucoperlin. Mucoperlin was only detected in the nacre and not in the prisms. ELISA analysis on hypochlorite-treated nacre did not affect the reactivity of the antibody with the extract (Fig. 4 C). We conclude that the immunological signals did not originate from soft tissue contamination. Furthermore, this result suggests that mucoperlin is either strongly adsorbed on the mineral surface or that it occupies an âintracrystallineâ position (23.Crenshaw M.A. Biomineralization. 1972; 6: 6-11Google Scholar). The nacre specificity of anti-mucoperlin as determined with ELISA and dot-blot analysis was verified with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting on acetic acid-soluble extracts from juvenile aragonitic nacre and calcitic prisms (Fig.5). Laemmli-soluble extracts of the two acetic acid-insoluble fractions were also included in the analysis. Silver staining of the gels showed the presence of numerous discrete thin bands in a background smear (Fig. 5 A). All extracts showed distinctively different patterns. Western blot analysis proved that mucoperlin was only present in the nacre matrices (Fig.5 B). Neither the acetic acid- nor the Laemmli-soluble fractions of the prisms showed any reaction with anti-mucoperlin. In the acetic acid-soluble fraction of the nacre, a prominent anti-mucoperlin-positive band with an apparent molecular mass around 55 kDa was detected. We assumed this band to represent native mucoperlin. The diffuse smear below this band may indicate degradation or differences in glycosylation of the native protein. The 55-kDa protein is also visible as a major discrete band on silver-stained gels (Fig. 5 A). In Laemmli extracts of the insoluble nacre matrix, two closely apposed anti-mucoperlin positive bands are visible with apparent molecular masses around 30 kDa. This indicates that mucoperlin-related proteins remain associated with the insoluble matrix after acid extraction of the nacre. These positive bands may represent breakdown products of mucoperlin, generated by the combined hypochlorite and Laemmli treatments, or different proteins closely resembling mucoperlin. The apparent molecular mass of native mucoperlin (55 kDa, Fig.5 A) is smaller than of the mcp deduced protein (66.7 kDa). Heavily glycosylated proteins, like mucins, are known to behave anomalously upon electrophoresis (44.Tytgat K.M.A.J. Swallow D.M. Van Klinken B.J.W. BuÌller H.A. Einerhand A.W.C. Dekker J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1053-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); their mobility is influenced by their intrinsic negative charge but also by the fact that they bind very little SDS (45.Van Klinken B.J.W. Einerhand A.W. BuÌller H.A. Dekker J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is also likely that mucoperlin undergoes specific cleavage when incorporated into the nacre or undergoes degradation due to aging of the nacre layer (see below). The amino acid sequence of mucoperlin suggests that the native molecule is heavily glycosylated. In general,"

The simultaneous expression of all six of the Mcm proteins, as well as different combinations of these proteins, yielded several stable complexes that included the heterohexamer of Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7, the Mcm2/4/6/7 heterotetramer, the dimer of the Mcm4/6/7 heterotrimer, and the Mcm3/5 heterodimer.

Consistent with these results, the interaction of either Mcm2 or Mcm3/5 with the Mcm4/6/7 complex resulted in the disassembly of the dimeric complex of Mcm4/6/7 and the loss of DNA helicase activity.

Although the role of these complexes in DNA replication is not fully understood, in vitro studies showed that the dimeric complex of the human and mouse Mcm4/6/7, as well as the dodecameric complex of the single archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (mth) Mcm protein, contained DNA helicase, single stranded (ss) DNA binding, and DNA-dependent ATPase activities (27.Ishimi Y.

It has been also demonstrated that Mcm2 interacted with the Mcm4/6/7 complex and inhibited the helicase activity of this complex (41.Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These biochemical properties, taken together with the genetic data obtained from yeast, suggest that the Mcm proteins may play a role as the replicative helicase in eukaryotes, similar to that of the bacterial DnaB protein or the large T antigen (T Ag) of simian virus 40 (SV40) (42.Baker T.A.

In this study, various complexes of the Mcm proteins of S. pombe containing different Mcm subunits were reconstituted and purified to near homogeneity using the baculovirus expression system. The characterization of the biochemical properties of these complexes showed that only the Mcm4/6/7 complex contained activities similar to the human and mouse Mcm4/6/7 complex and the mthMcm protein (multimer complex). We also describe the direct interaction between the S. pombe Mcm4/6/7 complex and Mcm2 or the Mcm3/5 heterodimer. Such interactions resulted in the alteration of the dimeric structure of the Mcm4/6/7 complex and the loss of DNA helicase activity. Labeled and unlabeled dNTPs and rNTPs were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Single stranded M13mp18 and Ïx174 DNAs and pUC19 plasmid DNA were from New England Biolabs. Anti-FLAG M2 Ab-agarose and FLAG peptide were from Sigma.Escherichia coli ssDNA-binding protein (SSB) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and recombinant S. pombe SSB was purified from E. coli cells as described previously (45.Ishiai M.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). DNAs containing spmcm2 + (nda1 + , cdc19 +) (pREP1-nda1), spmcm5 +(nda4 +) (pREP1-nda4), spmcm6 + (mis5 +) (p268-1) (kindly provided by Dr. M. Yanagida, Kyoto University, Japan) (46.Okishio N.

Van Assendelft G.B. Kearsey S.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), were used for the preparation of baculovirus transfer vectors for Mcm2, 5, 6, and 4, respectively. The DNA linker containing theBssHII (5â²-TATTGGCGCGCCAA-3â²) site was added to theNdeI site of pREP1-nda1 or pREP1-nda4, andBssHII-SmaI fragments containing the spmcm2 + or the spmcm5 +gene were subcloned into the BssHII and StuI sites of pFastBac1 plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.). To remove the intron from the spmcm5 + gene, theEcoRI-MluI fragment was replaced with the cDNA fragment obtained by PCR. The constructs encoding the spmcm2 + or spmcm5 + genes that contain six histidines and FLAG (His6/FLAG) tags at the N terminus were made as above except for the use ofBssHII linker encoding the His6/FLAG epitope (5â²-TAGCGCGCCACCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAGGG-3â² and 5â²-TACCCTTGTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCATGGTGGCGCGC-3â²). The construct containing spmcm4 +(cdc21 +) was made by subcloning theXhoI-SacI fragment of pREP3X-cdc21 intoSalI and SacI sites of the pFastBac1 plasmid. The cDNA fragment encoding spMcm6 (Mis5) was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), p268-1 plasmid DNA as a template, and oligonucleotides 5â²-GTCAGCGCGCACTACACTTGAAGATGTC-3â² and 5â²-GTTTCTGCGGTATGCAGTG-3â² as primers. After digestion withBssHII, this DNA fragment was subcloned into theBssHII and StuI sites of pFastBac1 plasmid. The spmcm3 + and spmcm7 +genes were obtained by PCR amplification from an S. pombecDNA library. Oligonucleotides 5â²-GTCAGCGCGCTGAAAAGCATGGCACTTCC-3â² and 5â²-CAGAAAAGTAGTTTGACGTC-3â² were used for the amplification of spmcm7 + gene and oligonucleotides 5â²-GTCAGCGCGCAGCAAAATGACTGAGCTGTTAGCAG-3â² and 5â²-GTGAACCAGGAACCACGATATG-3â² were used for the amplification of the spmcm3 + gene. The PCR products were digested with BssHII and subcloned into the BssHII andStuI sites of pFastBacI plasmid. To construct the spmcm7 + gene containing the FLAG/His6-tag at the C terminus, the PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS(â) and the linker containing the FLAG/His6 coding sequences (5â²-CCGGATTTACATATGGAGAATGGTGATTATAAAGATGACGATGACAAGCATCACCATCACCATCACTAA-3â² and 5â²-CCGGTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCTTGTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCACCATTCTCCATATGTAAAT-3â²) was inserted into the BspEI site, and theBssHII-SmaI fragment containing the modified spmcm7 + gene was transferred into the pFastBac1 plasmid. The nucleotide sequences of the PCR products and linker regions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All recombinant viruses were produced according to the manufacturer's protocols (BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression Systems, Life Technologies, Inc.). Sf9 insect cells were cultured at 27 Â°C in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the expression of various Mcm complexes, Sf9 cells (2 Ã 106 cells/ml) were co-infected with various combinations of recombinant baculoviruses expressing each Mcm subunit at a multiplicity of infection of 5, and incubated at 27 Â°C for 48 h. To facilitate the purification of the Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7 and Mcm3/5 complexes, baculovirus containing themcm5 + gene that was tagged with His6/FLAG at its N terminus was used with other recombinant viruses harboring wild-type mcm genes. For the purification of the Mcm4/6/7 and Mcm2/4/6/7 complexes, recombinant viruses carrying either the C-terminal FLAG/His6-taggedmcm7 + gene or N-terminal His6/FLAG-tagged mcm2 + were used, respectively. The recombinant Mcm complexes in infected Sf9 cell lysates were purified by the consecutive steps involving nickel-agarose affinity chromatography, anti-FLAG M2 Ab-agarose affinity chromatography, and glycerol gradient sedimentation. Sf9 cells (2 Ã 106 cells/ml, 1 liter) were infected simultaneously with various combinations of recombinant viruses and incubated at 27 Â°C for 48 h to produce the Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7, Mcm4/6/7, Mcm2/4/6/7, and Mcm3/5 complexes. The cells were harvested, washed once with 100 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sodium glutamate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 10 Î¼g/ml pepstatin A, 10 Î¼g/ml aprotinin) containing 10 mm imidazole and 0.25% Triton X-100. After incubation on ice for 20 min, the supernatant solutions were collected by centrifugation at 35,000 Ã g at 4 Â°C for 30 min and then mixed with 1.5 ml of Ni2+-agarose beads (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The mixtures were incubated at 4 Â°C for 2 h on a rocking platform. The beads were collected, washed four times with 40 ml of buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, and packed in a column (0.7 Ã 4 cm). Bound protein was eluted five times each with an equal bead volume of buffer A containing 150 mm imidazole. The eluted fraction was mixed with anti-FLAG M2 Ab-agarose beads (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer A (about 0.5-ml beads/mg of protein) and incubated at 4 Â°C for 1 h on a rocking platform. After washing four times with 10 bead volumes of buffer A, bound protein was eluted three times by incubation at 4 Â°C for 30 min with an equal bead volume of buffer A containing 0.2 mg/ml of the FLAG peptide. From 2 Ã 109 infected Sf9 cells, this step yielded 0.43 mg of Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7, 0.14 mg of Mcm2/4/6/7, 1.8 mg of Mcm4/6/7, 0.48 mg of Mcm3/5, and 2.5 mg of Mcm2. A portion of each of the anti-FLAG M2 Ab affinity column eluates was further purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation (as described below). During the purification, the presence of various Mcm complexes was monitored by Western blotting or by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. A portion of the fraction isolated after anti-FLAG Ab affinity column chromatography (0.2 ml) was applied to a 5-ml 15â35% glycerol gradient in buffer B (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm sodium glutamate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). After centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 13 h in a Beckmam SW 50.1 rotor at 4 Â°C, fractions (250 Î¼l) were collected from the bottom of the tube. The distribution of the Mcm protein was determined after SDS-8% PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). A portion of the purified fraction (anti-FLAG Ab affinity column eluate, 20â40 Î¼g) was applied to a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (HR10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol) containing 50 mm sodium acetate. Fractions (250 Î¼l) were collected and analyzed for the Mcm complex by SDS-8% PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). For the preparation of substrates used for the assay of helicase activity, a 17-mer oligonucleotide (5â²-GTTTTCCAGTCACGAC-3â², â40 sequencing primer for M13) was synthesized and annealed to M13mp18 ssDNA. After labeling of the 3â²-end of the annealed 17-mer DNA with [Î±-32P]dGTP and the Klenow fragment, the labeled 18-mer/M13mp18 ssDNA was purified by Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. The substrates used to determine the direction of translocation of the helicase were prepared as follows. For the preparation of the 3â²-tailed substrate, a 36-mer oligonucleotide (5â²-GACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTC-3â²) was synthesized, labeled at its 5â²-end with [Î³-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and annealed to M13mp18 ssDNA. After digestion of this annealed DNA with SmaI, DNA was purified by Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. For the preparation of the 5â²-tailed substrate, a 36-mer oligonucleotide was annealed to M13mp18 ssDNA and labeled at its 3â²-end with [Î±-32P]dGTP and Klenow fragment. This DNA was digested with SmaI and purified by Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. To determine the maximal length of duplex DNA displaced by the Mcm4/6/7 helicase, a substrate containing longer duplex regions was prepared by elongating singly primed M13mp18 ssDNA using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For this purpose, the M13 forward sequencing primer was annealed to M13mp18 ssDNA and the 3â² end of this oligomer was labeled with [Î±-32P]dGTP and [Î±-32P]dTTP in the presence of Sequenase, and then elongated in the presence of ddCTP and all four dNTPs according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA product was purified by Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. The resulting substrate (25,000 cpm/fmol) contained duplex regions that varied in length between 22 and 600 base pairs. DNA helicase activity was measured in reaction mixtures (15 Î¼l) containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 25 mmsodium acetate, 12.5 mm magnesium acetate, 4 mmATP, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5 fmol of32P-labeled substrate (4,000 cpm/fmol), and enzyme fraction. After incubation at 32 Â°C for 1 h, 4 Î¼l of 5 Ã loading buffer (100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 25% glycerol) was added, and 7-Î¼l aliquots were loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS in 1 Ã TBE (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) and electrophoresed for 1 h at 150 V. The 41-mer oligonucleotide (5â²-AATCATAGATAGTATCTCCGTGCAAGATAATCACGAGTATC-3â²) or oligo(dT)50 was labeled at the 5â²-end with 32P by using [Î³-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and used as the substrate for gel mobility shift assays. Enzyme fractions were incubated at 25 Â°C for 20 min in reaction mixtures (15 Î¼l) containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mmsodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmDTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 20 fmol of 5â²-labeled 41-mer ssDNA (4,000 cpm/fmol), in the presence or absence of ATP or ATP analogues. After addition of 2 Î¼l of 50% glycerol, aliquots of reaction mixtures were electrophoresed for 3 h at 120 V through a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 mm magnesium acetate and 5% glycerol in 0.5 Ã TBE at 4 Â°C. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were carried out in reaction mixtures (15 Î¼l) containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mmsodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmDTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 20 fmol of 5â²-labeled 41-mer ssDNA (4,000 cpm/fmol), and enzyme fractions in the presence or absence of ATP or ATP analogues. After incubation at 25 Â°C for 20 min, mixtures were filtered through an alkaline-washed nitrocellulose filter (Millipore, HA 0.45 Î¼m) (49.McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and then washed with buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm DTT. The radioactivity adsorbed to the filter was determined by liquid scintillation counting. ATPase activity was measured in reaction mixtures (15 Î¼l) containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1.5 nmol of [Î³-32P]ATP (1.5 Ã 104 cpm/pmol), indicated amounts of polynucleotide, and the enzyme fraction. After incubation at 30 Â°C for 1 h, aliquots (1 Î¼l) were spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin-layer plate, and ATP and Pi were separated by chromatography in 1 mformic acid, 0.5 m LiCl. The extent of ATP hydrolysis was quantitated by PhosphorImager (Fuji) analysis. The 25-mer oligonucleotide used in this study contained the sequence 5â²-GCAAGCACATCACCTTGAATGCCAC-3â². For the preparation of polyclonal antibodies against the different Mcm proteins, regions of themcm genes (encoding amino acids 22 to 460 formcm2, 3 to 399 for mcm6, 4 to 371 formcm4, 3 to 313 for mcm3, 520 to 758 formcm7, and 77 to 350 for mcm5) were cloned into the BamHI site of pET28-a (Novagen), expressed, and purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by Ni2+-agarose chromatography using denaturing conditions as described by the manufacturer's protocols (Novagen). After SDS-10% PAGE, protein bands were excised from the gel and used for immunization of rabbits. In order to determine the interactions between the different Mcm complexes, polyclonal antibodies against Mcm4 or Mcm2 (0.5 Î¼l of serum) were added to various mixtures of Mcm complexes in buffer C (150 Î¼l) containing 0.1 m sodium glutamate and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. After incubation at 4 Â°C for 30 min, protein A-agarose beads (15 Î¼l) were added and the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer C containing 0.1 m sodium glutamate and 0.1 mg/ml BSA and then once with buffer C containing 0.1 m sodium glutamate. Proteins bound to the beads were then analyzed by SDS-8% PAGE followed by staining with silver. In order to determine the biochemical properties of S. pombe Mcm protein complexes containing various subunits, Mcm complexes were reconstituted using the baculovirus expression system. To facilitate the purification of proteins and complexes, a His6/FLAG-tag was added to the N terminus of the Mcm2 or Mcm5 proteins, or to the C terminus of the Mcm7 protein. The addition of the His6/FLAG-tag at the N terminus of Mcm2 or Mcm5 proteins did not appear to affect their biological activity. The expression of these tagged proteins under the control of nmt1 promoter in the presence of thiamine complemented the cold-sensitive phenotypes of nda1â376(mcm2) or nda4â108 (mcm5) mutant strain. After co-infection of baculoviruses encoding each of the Mcm proteins in various combinations, we obtained stable complexes that included Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7, Mcm2/4/6/7, Mcm4/6/7, Mcm3/5, as well as Mcm2. These proteins were purified to near homogeneity by Ni2+-agarose chromatography, anti-FLAG M2 Ab-agarose chromatography, and glycerol gradient centrifugation as described under âMaterials and Methods.â All of the purified Mcm complexes were more than 80% homogeneous after the anti-FLAG Ab affinity-peptide elution step. The purity and stoichiometry of the various subunits present in the different complexes were examined following glycerol gradient sedimentation followed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The peak glycerol gradient fractions included each protein expected in the complex (Fig. 1, A-D, and Fig.2 A) and contained subunits that stained with similar intensity. This suggests that the subunits that constituted each complex were present in stoichiometric amounts.Figure 2Glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis of the Mcm4/6/7 complex. A, the purified Mcm4/6/7 complex (200 Î¼l, 80 Î¼g of protein), isolated after anti-FLAG Ab affinity column chromatography, was loaded onto a 5-ml 15â35% glycerol gradient and centrifuged for 13 h at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 4 Â°C. After collection of 20 fractions from the bottom of the gradient, aliquots (15 Î¼l) of each fraction were subjected to SDS-10% PAGE analysis and stained with Coomassie Blue.B, distribution of DNA-dependent ATPase activity in glycerol gradient fractions after sedimentation.

The molecular masses (in kDa) of these complexes were calculated by the method of Siegel and Monty (50.Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), using the Stokes radii, the S values, and assuming a partial specific volume of 0.725 ml/g for each preparation. The deduced molecular masses of Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7, Mcm2/4/6/7, Mcm3/5, and Mcm2 are in fair agreement with the molecular weights calculated by summing the molecular weights of the protein subunits of the complexes (Table I). These results suggest that Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7, Mcm2/4/6/7, Mcm3/5, and Mcm2 were monomeric in structure. In contrast, the molecular mass of the Mcm4/6/7 complex (542 kDa) was about 2-fold greater than the calculated molecular mass of the heterotrimeric complex (284 kDa), suggesting that the structure of this complex was a dimer of the heterotrimer.Table ISummary of the hydrodynamic properties of various Mcm preparationsMcm complexStokes radiusSedimentation coefficientMolecular massaThe molecular masses were derived from the determined Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients using the methods of Siegel and Monty (50).Calculated molecular weightbThe calculated molecular weights were derived from the known amino acid s"
https://openalex.org/W2054306942,"Collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) is a member of the CRMP/TOAD/Ulip/DRP family of cytosolic phosphoproteins involved in neuronal differentiation and axonal guidance. CRMP-2 mediates the intracellular response to collapsin 1/semaphorin 3A, a repulsive extracellular guidance cue for axonal outgrowth. The mutation of UNC-33, a Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of CRMP-2, results in abnormality of microtubules in neurites, but the mechanism of CRMP-2 action remains to be clarified. Here, we report that overexpression of human CRMP-2 in Neuro2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, results in blebbing of the cytoplasm. Furthermore, some cells exhibited intranuclear inclusions, which were labeled with antibodies to CRMP-2 and tubulin. CRMP-2 was found to be associated with microtubule bundles in the spindles at the metaphase and in the midbodies at the late telophase in mitotic cells. Thus, it is most likely that failure of complete disassembly of the spindle microtubules during mitosis is responsible for the formation of these intranuclear inclusions. We suggest that CRMP-2 functions by regulating the dynamics of microtubules.

The mutation of UNC-33, a Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of CRMP-2, results in abnormality of microtubules in neurites, but the mechanism of CRMP-2 action remains to be clarified. Here, we report that overexpression of human CRMP-2 in Neuro2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, results in blebbing of the cytoplasm. Furthermore, some cells exhibited intranuclear inclusions, which were labeled with antibodies to CRMP-2 and tubulin. CRMP-2 was found to be associated with microtubule bundles in the spindles at the metaphase and in the midbodies at the late telophase in mitotic cells. Thus, it is most likely that failure of complete disassembly of the spindle microtubules during mitosis is responsible for the formation of these intranuclear inclusions. We suggest that CRMP-2 functions by regulating the dynamics of microtubules. collapsin response mediator protein human CRMP-2 phosphate-buffered saline N 6,2â²-O-dibutyryladenosine-3â²:5â²-cyclic monophosphate 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide fluorescein isothiocyanate Neuro2a cells The development of the nervous system requires the growth of neuritic processes and their guidance toward the appropriate targets with which they must establish accurate synaptic contacts. Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs)1 are a family of cytosolic phosphoproteins involved in neurite outgrowth and axonal guidance (1.Quinn C.C. Gray G.E. Hockfield S. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 41: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Their expression and phosphorylation are spatially and temporally regulated during development (2.Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J.

Immunocytochemical studies showed that CRMPs are distributed in the lamellipodia and filopodia of the growth cone, the shaft of axons, and the neuronal cell body (2.Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J.

CRMP-2 (also referred to as TOAD-64, Turned onafter Division, 64 kDa (2.Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J.

Gene. 1996; 180: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar)) is the member most widely expressed within the nervous system. The protein has been reported to mediate semaphorin III/D-induced growth cone collapse through a signal transduction cascade involving G-protein (5.Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). CRMP-2 has a sequence homologous to the product of unc-33, a nematode gene required for appropriately directed axonal extension (7.Li W. Herman R.K. Shaw J.E. Genetics. 1992; 132: 675-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations of unc-33 result in abnormal outgrowth of axons, leading to severely uncoordinated movements in Caenorhabditis elegans (8.Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Thomson J.N. Perkins L.A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 111: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Neurites in the mutant showed significant defects in microtubule organization; a superabundance of microtubules was found in sensory dendrites, and some of these microtubules were larger than normal in diameter, and some formed hooks or multiple tubules. These findings suggest that the axonal guidance defects are a consequence of cytoskeletal, in particular, microtubular, abnormalities and that the product of unc-33 should be involved in appropriate organization of microtubules in neurites. A straightforward interpretation is that UNC-33 is a microtubule-associated protein that should control the assembly or stability of microtubules in vivo. However, no distinct cytoskeletal association of CRMP-2 has thus far been recognized. CRMP-2 may also be involved in the process of neurodegeneration. Highly phosphorylated forms of CRMP-2 were shown to be associated with neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease brains (9.Yoshida H. Watanabe A. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9761-9768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 10.Gu Y. Hamajima N. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Semaphorin III/D and CRMP-2 have also been reported to mediate neuronal death in a dopamine-induced apoptotic cell model (11.Shirvan A. Ziv I. Fleminger G. Shina R. He Z. Brudo I. Melamed E. Barzilai A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To study the functions of CRMP-2, especially its possible effects on the cytoskeleton, we established a regulable expression system for hCRMP-2 in Neuro2a (N2a) cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, using the ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression system. In this system, the extent of CRMP-2 expression can be regulated by varying the dose of the inducer, ponasterone A. The potential toxic effects of overproduced CRMP-2 may thus be avoided, and changes attributable to CRMP-2 itself may be assessed more accurately. Here, we show evidence suggesting that CRMP-2 affects microtubule dynamics: overexpression of hCRMP-2 in N2a cells induced blebbing of the cytoplasm (and subsequent apoptosis of the cells); acetylated tubulin and CRMP-2 were occasionally deposited as intranuclear inclusions; and CRMP-2 was associated with microtubule bundles in the spindles at the metaphase and in the midbodies at the late telophase in mitotic cells. A pTARGET-hCRMP-2 construct expressing hCRMP-2 was prepared by polymerase chain reaction as described before (10.Gu Y. Hamajima N. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment encoding the complete sequence for hCRMP-2 was then cut with EcoRI and NotI from the plasmid and inserted into the pIND(SP1) vector. The new construct was named pIND(SP1)-hCRMP-2. A founder N2a cell line stably transfected with pVgRXR (Zeocin-resistant), which constitutively expresses a functional ecdysone receptor, was established as described (12.Wang G.H. Mitsui K. Kotliarova S. Yamashita A. Nagao Y. Tokuhiro S. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The founder cells were then transfected with pIND(SP1)-hCRMP-2 to generate double-stable transfectants expressing hCRMP-2. Pooled clones were established by selection using 0.4 mg/ml Zeocin and 1.0 mg/ml G418. Monoclones were then screened for CRMP-2 expression in response to ponasterone A by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence observation using C4G, a monoclonal antibody to CRMP-2 (10.Gu Y. Hamajima N. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Clones with the highest expression and tightest regulation were selected for further study. The multiple independent expression lines obtained yielded similar experimental results. For the negative control, the founder N2a cell line with the vector pIND(SP1) was mock-transfected. Stable cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.4 mg/ml Zeocin, and 0.4 mg/ml G418. Cells were cultured in 6-well plates and treated with ponasterone A as indicated. They were then rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized on ice with a lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Î¼g/mlN Î± -p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin, and 1 Î¼g/ml antipain). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 Ãg for 15 min, and the supernatants were saved. The protein concentration in each sample was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein (2.5 Î¼g/lane) were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting using a mixture of monoclonal antibodies to CRMP-2 (C4G and N3E) as described previously (10.Gu Y. Hamajima N. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The relative expression levels of CRMP-2 were quantitated using a GS700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad). Cell viability was determined by MTT assay or trypan blue exclusion assay as described (12.Wang G.H. Mitsui K. Kotliarova S. Yamashita A. Nagao Y. Tokuhiro S. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For the MTT assay, aliquots (150 Î¼l) of the cell suspension (6 Ã 104 cells/ml) were subcultured in the wells of a 96-well plate. For the neuron-like phenotype, cells were differentiated with 5 mm Bt2cAMP (Sigma) and CRMP-2 expression was induced with ponasterone A. After 3 days, 50 Î¼l of MTT (2 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well, and the plate was further incubated for 2 h. The reaction was then stopped by replacing 100 Î¼l of the culture medium with an equal volume of 0.05 n HCl in isopropanol, and the cells were disrupted by pipetting. The cell viability was determined colorimetrically using an automated 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and the SOFTmax software to measure the absorbance at 570â650 nm. 100% cell killing was set as that caused by the addition of Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.5% 30 min prior to the addition of MTT. For the trypan blue exclusion assay, aliquots (1 ml) of the cell suspension (7.5 Ã 104 cells/ml) were added to the wells of a 24-well plate (Falcon) and treated with 5 mmBt2cAMP and 5 Î¼m ponasterone A, and the cells were counted every day after trypan blue staining. At least 200 cells were scored for each experiment. For immunofluorescence microscopy, the cells were plated onto 15-mm round coverslips in a 12-well plate (2 Ã 104 cells in 1 ml of medium) and treated with ponasterone A for the indicated periods. After a brief rinse in PBS, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, blocked with 10% calf serum in PBS for 30 min, and then incubated overnight with each primary antibody. The primary antibodies used in this study were: N356, a mouse monoclonal antibody to Î±-tubulin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); a mouse monoclonal antibody to acetylated tubulin (clone 6-11B-1, Sigma); mouse monoclonal antibodies to CRMP-2, C4G, and N3E; and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to CRMP-2, A667 (10.Gu Y. Hamajima N. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As the secondary antibodies, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) was used. Nuclei were visualized by staining with 5 Î¼g/ml Hoechst 33258 for 20 min after second antibody binding. Rhodamine-phalloidin (R-415, Molecular Probes, Inc.) was used at this step for F-actin labeling when necessary. Specimens were examined under either a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss Co., Tokyo) or an attached Bio-Rad laser scanning confocal imaging system (Microradiance R2000/AG-2) equipped with the Lasersharp2000 software (Bio-Rad). Images were processed using the Lasersharp2000 post-processing software and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). To study the biological functions of CRMP-2 in the cell, we employed an ecdysone-inducible system to obtain regulable expression of hCRMP-2 in N2a cells. To assess inducible CRMP-2 expression, the lysate of a representative clone was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.1, expression of CRMP-2 was induced by ponasterone A in a dose-dependent manner. Very low levels of CRMP-2 were found to be expressed in N2a cells in the absence of ponasterone A. This level of expression was the same as that in nontransfected cells and was thus considered representative of the level of endogenous CRMP-2. With increasing dose of ponasterone A, the expression levels of CRMP-2 increased, but with >1 Î¼mponasterone A the expression became saturated at a level that was about 7-fold that of the endogenous level. In the case of tau, a microtubule-associated protein, no saturation of inducible expression was observed up to 5 Î¼m ponasterone A (data not shown), probably because high levels of CRMP-2 are toxic to the cell; the cells expressing higher levels of CRMP-2 started to die (see below). The effects of CRMP-2 overexpression in N2a cells were first examined under a phase-contrast microscope. After 10â12 h of induction with 5 Î¼mponasterone A, some cells became rounded and detached from the tissue culture plate. Blebbing of the cytoplasm could be observed in some cells at this stage, and cell death occurred after prolonged induction with ponasterone A. About 15% of the cells died after 24 h of induction with 5 Î¼m ponasterone A, as judged by trypan blue staining. Immunostaining using antibodies to CRMP-2 showed that blebbing of the cytoplasm appeared only in those cells that expressed higher levels of CRMP-2 (Fig. 2 A). The levels of inducibly expressed CRMP-2 varied even among the cells of a monoclonal origin, and its levels in the dying cells were well above those in the morphologically normal ones. If the mean level of CRMP-2 induced by 2 Î¼m ponasterone A is assumed to be about 7-fold that of the endogenous levels, much higher levels must have been expressed in the dying cells. Most of the cells showing cytoplasmic blebbing had intact nuclei, suggesting that alteration of the cytoskeleton occurred before the condensation of nuclei (Fig.2 B). Cell death was demonstrated by MTT assay and trypan blue exclusion. The cell viability decreased depending on the dose of ponasterone A, becoming significant with >2 Î¼m ponasterone A (Fig.2 C). Although differentiated N2a cells were used in these studies, in our hands, only about 80% of the cells were differentiated by treatment with 5 mm Bt2cAMP for 24 h, as judged by generation of neurite-like processes. The remaining undifferentiated cells still underwent division, and the cell numbers increased significantly after 2 days (Fig. 2 D). Trypan blue staining showed no obvious effect of Bt2cAMP treatment on survival of N2a cells, as reported by others (12.Wang G.H. Mitsui K. Kotliarova S. Yamashita A. Nagao Y. Tokuhiro S. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, the fraction of cells that did not exclude trypan blue increased significantly upon treatment with ponasterone A, reaching 50â60% after 5 days of treatment. Thus, the decreased cell viability was largely due to cell death, although inhibition of cell proliferation by CRMP-2 might also contribute to some extent. There was no significant change in the viability of mock-transfected cells by ponasterone A treatment (data not shown). The distribution of CRMP-2 in N2a cells was examined by immunofluorescence before and after induction by ponasterone A, using C4G, a monoclonal antibody to CRMP-2. As reported by others, CRMP-2 was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. This distribution was distinct from that of microtubules, actin filaments (Fig.3 A), or neurofilaments (data not shown) in N2a cells. However, in some N2a cells overexpressing CRMP-2, the monoclonal antibody also labeled some distinct structures,i.e. the spindles at the metaphase and the midbodies at the late telophase in mitotic cells. These structures are characterized by the presence of microtubule bundles. Colocalization was confirmed by double labeling with the antibodies to Î±-tubulin and CRMP-2 (Fig.3 B). We found that intranuclear inclusions were formed in a small proportion of N2a cells (â¼2%) overexpressing CRMP-2. In such cells, stronger immunostaining of CRMP-2 was found in the inclusions than in the cytoplasm. These inclusions had a regular outline, and most appeared globular and were 1â2 Î¼m in diameter (Fig.4 A). An antibody to Î±-tubulin strongly stained these intranuclear inclusions (Fig.4 B). The inclusions were quite compact and replaced the chromatin, as seen in Hoechst dye-negative areas in the nucleus (Fig.4 C). No correlation was observed between the formation of intranuclear inclusion and the blebbing of cytoplasm or the condensation of chromatin. Sometimes the inclusions appeared as tapered to curly thick fibers continuous with the cytoplasmic microtubules (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that they originate from the microtubule bundles formed during mitosis. This view was further supported by an observation that very few inclusions appeared in the N2a cells differentiated by Bt2cAMP. An antibody to acetylated-tubulin weakly stained the microtubules in the cytoplasm. However, it strongly labeled the intranuclear inclusions, suggesting that the deposits are composed mainly of the mature form of tubulin (Fig. 4 C). The CRMP/TOAD/Ulip/DRP family of cytosolic proteins play important roles in neuronal differentiation and axonal guidance. The lack of sequence homology between the CRMP/UNC-33 family and other proteins in data bases indicates that CRMPs may have a unique and as yet poorly understood molecular mechanism of action. Our results point to the involvement of CRMP-2 in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. First, CRMP-2 was associated with bundled microtubules in N2a cells. In this respect, CRMP-2 differs from classical microtubule-associated proteins, which are associated with individual microtubules. In vitro assembly/disassembly cycles of microtubules revealed no direct association of CRMP-2 (data not shown). CRMP-2 may be involved in the interaction between microtubules or may help link the microtubules to other cellular components. All members of the CRMP family have a basic region, adjacent to a differentially phosphorylated region, in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the molecule (10.Gu Y. Hamajima N. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The basic region may be responsible for direct or indirect binding to the microtubules, which is likely regulated by phosphorylation of the adjacent region. It has been reported that CRMPs exist as (hetero)tetramers (13.Wang L.H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a good candidate for a cross-linker of individual microtubules. Second, overexpression of CRMP-2 led to blebbing of the cytoplasm of N2a cells. This event is believed to be due to cytoskeletal alterations affecting the dynamics of actin or defective interactions between microfilaments and microtubules. Finally, overexpression of CRMP-2 in N2a cells induced deposition of tubulin, in particular, its stable form, as intranuclear inclusions. Acetylation of Î±-tubulin is a relatively slow enzymatic reaction that occurs only on microtubules and not on free tubulin molecules. The reaction is rapidly reversed when tubulin molecule depolymerizes (14.Greer K. Rosenbaum J.L. Warner F.D. McIntosh J.R. Kinesin, Dynein, and Microtubule Dynamics. 2. Wiley-Liss, New York1989: 47-66Google Scholar). Thus, the presence in abundance of acetylated tubulin in the intranuclear inclusions indicates that they originate from stable microtubules. The stabilizing effect of overexpressed CRMP-2 on bundles of microtubule structures likely results in the failure of disassembly of spindles during cell division. The present finding may thus explain, in part, some observations in theunc-33 mutant of C. elegans, in which the neurites contain a great abundance of microtubules (8.Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G. Thomson J.N. Perkins L.A. Dev. Biol. 1985; 111: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). CRMP-2 has been reported to be necessary for G-protein-mediated transduction of an extracellular collapsin signal into growth cone collapse (5.Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). However, the observed G-protein-independent effects of pertussis toxin on neurite growth and growth cone morphology (15.Kindt R.M. Lander A.D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 79-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) suggest that CRMP might also be a component of a non-G-protein-dependent signaling pathway. Alterations of the cytoskeletal network have been proposed to be involved in changes of the growth cone morphology in response to extracellular cues. The actively extended tips of the growth cone are filled with a population of dynamic actin filaments. Microtubules are found in abundance in the central domain of the growth cone, with some of them extending to the base of the filopodia at the leading edge; they play important roles in the maintenance and regulation of the growth cone remodeling by forming highly stable cross-linked bundles (16.Tanaka E. Kirschner M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 345-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 17.Challacombe J.F. Snow D.M. Letourneau P.C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3085-3095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In N2a cells, CRMP-2 partially overlaps with filamentous actin in the spreading cytoplasm (see Fig. 3 A). However, no apparent change of organization of actin filaments was found in the cells overexpressing CRMP-2. We suggest that one pathway of CRMP-2 mediated-collapsing activity is through its regulation of microtubule reorganization. A cascade of kinase activities may be involved in the collapsin signaling pathway, in which Rac1 regulates the organization of actin filaments (18.Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of CRMP-2 may destabilize microtubule bundles in the growth cone. On the other hand, the stabilizing effect of CRMP-2 on the specific microtubule arrangements in the axon shaft contributes to its maintenance. In support of this assumption, the phosphorylation level of CRMP-2 in the brain under development is much greater than that of inducibly expressed CRMP-2 in N2a cells (9.Yoshida H. Watanabe A. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9761-9768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 10.Gu Y. Hamajima N. Ihara Y.

Additional evidence supporting a role for c-Abl in apoptosis has been provided by the findings that cells deficient in c-Abl or expressing a dominant-negative c-Abl mutant exhibit an attenuated apoptotic response to genotoxic agents (18.Yuan Z.M.

Recent work has shown that c-Abl phosphorylates protein kinase C (PKC) Î´ in cells treated with H2O2 (20.Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that the cytoplasmic, and not the nuclear, form of c-Abl is activated in the cellular response to H2O2. We also show that H2O2 induces mitochondrial cytochromec release and apoptosis by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism. COS7 cells and MEFs derived from wild-type and c-Ablâ/â mice (21.Tybulewicz V.L.J.

DLD1 cells were grown as described (7.Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with H2O2 (Sigma), 30 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC; Sigma), or 10 Î¼m cis-platinum (Sigma). Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Î¼g/ml leupeptin) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described (22.Kharbanda S.

Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) with anti-c-Abl (sc-23; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse IgG (Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2) containing 2.5 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP and GST-Crk (120â225) or GST-Crk (120â212) for 20 min at 30 Â°C. Anti-PKCÎ´ (sc-937; Santa Cruz) and anti-ERK1 (sc-93; Santa Cruz) immunoprecipitates were analyzed by using histone H1 (23.Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11223-11237Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), respectively, as substrates. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cells were disrupted in lysis buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described (24.Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Yuan Z.-M. Kraeft S. Weichselbaum R. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3617-3621PubMed Google Scholar). Enucleated cells were prepared by density centrifugation as described (25.Gudas J.M. Karenlampi S.O. Hankinson O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in 21 Î¼m cytochalasin B for 1 h at 37 Â°C, layered over a discontinuous Ficoll gradient, and centrifuged at 80,000 Ãg for 1 h. Cytoplasts were collected at the 12.5â15% Ficoll interface. Cytoplast purity was assessed by staining with 0.5 Î¼g/ml 4â²,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and was greater than 95% free of whole cells. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-c-Abl, anti-IÎºBÎ± (sc-847; Santa Cruz) or anti-cytochrome c(26.Kirken R.A. Lincoln A.J. Fink P.S. Prochaska L.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by FACScan (Becton-Dickinson). To determine whether c-Abl is activated by ROS, lysates from COS7 cells exposed to H2O2 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse IgG, as a control, or anti-c-Abl antibody. The precipitates were assayed for phosphorylation of a GST-Crk (120â225) fusion protein (27.Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 28.Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). There was no detectable phosphorylation of GST-Crk (120â225) with the control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 a,left). A low level of GST-Crk (120â225) phosphorylation was detectable when assaying anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates from control cells, whereas exposure to H2O2 resulted in stimulation (4â5-fold) of the Crk kinase activity (Fig. 1 a,right, first 2 lanes). By contrast, there was no detectable H2O2-induced phosphorylation of a GST-Crk (120â212) fusion protein that lacks the c-Abl phosphorylation site at Tyr-221 (Fig. 1 a, right, last 2 lanes). The results also show that H2O2treatment is not associated with increases in the level of c-Abl protein (Fig. 1 a, right). To confirm involvement of ROS in c-Abl activation, cells were treated with NAC, a scavenger of reactive oxygen intermediates and precursor of glutathione (29.Roederer M. Staal F.J. Raju P.A. Ela S.W. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1990; 87: 4884-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 30.Staal F.J. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). NAC treatment inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of GST-Crk (120â225) by c-Abl (Fig. 1 b). The induction of c-Abl activity was dependent on H2O2 concentration, with 5-fold increases upon exposure to 1 mm H2O2 (Fig. 1 c,left). In addition, maximal induction of c-Abl activity was observed at 30â60 min (Fig. 1 c, right). The finding that human DLD1 cells respond to H2O2with activation of c-Abl further indicated that the results are not restricted to certain cell types (Fig. 1 d). To extend the analysis of H2O2-induced activation of c-Abl to other pathways involved in the ROS response, we studied mouse embryo fibroblasts that are null for c-Abl expression (c-Ablâ/â MEFs) (21.Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). There was no detectable c-Abl activity in control or H2O2-treated c-Ablâ/â cells (Fig.2 a). By contrast, wild-type MEFs responded to H2O2 with induction of c-Abl activity. Recent studies have demonstrated that c-Abl interacts with PKCÎ´ in the response to oxidative stress (20.Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Abl is required for activation of PKCÎ´, we assayed anti-PKCÎ´ immunoprecipitates from c-Ablâ/â and wild-type MEFs. The results demonstrate that, whereas PKCÎ´ is required for activation of c-Abl (20.Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), c-Abl is dispensable for activation of PKCÎ´ in the ROS response (Fig. 2 b). Other studies have demonstrated that ERK1 is activated in cells exposed to H2O2(31.Guyton K. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Analysis of anti-ERK1 immunoprecipitates from H2O2-treated c-Ablâ/â and wild-type MEFs demonstrated activation of ERK1 by a c-Abl-independent mechanism (Fig. 2 c). These findings demonstrate that activation of c-Abl in the ROS response is not functional in the induction of PKCÎ´ or ERK1 activities. As nuclear c-Abl is activated in the stress response to DNA damage (9.Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), studies were performed to define the subcellular localization of ROS-induced c-Abl activation. Cells were treated with H2O2 before preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Analysis of cytoplasmic anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates demonstrated increased phosphorylation of GST-Crk (120â225) (Fig. 3 a). By contrast, there was no detectable activation of c-Abl in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3 a). Oxygen radicals induce lesions in nuclear DNA (32.Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 33.Imlay J.A. Chin S.M. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 640-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar), and nuclear c-Abl is activated by DNA damage (9.Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). To determine whether a nuclear signal is required for H2O2-induced activation of cytoplasmic c-Abl, we assayed cytoplasts devoid of nuclei. Treatment of the cytoplasts with H2O2 was associated with induction of c-Abl activity (Fig. 2 b). By contrast, cisplatin treatment, which activates nuclear c-Abl (9.Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), had no detectable effect on c-Abl activity in cytoplasts (data not shown). These findings indicate that cytoplasmic c-Abl is activated in the response to oxidative stress by a mechanism independent of nuclear signals. The cellular response to genotoxic stress includes release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and the induction of apoptosis (34.Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To determine whether oxidative stress induces cytochromec release, cytoplasmic lysates from wild-type and c-Ablâ/â cells treated with H2O2were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c. The results demonstrate that H2O2 treatment of wild-type MEFs is associated with increased levels of cytochromec (Fig. 4 a). By contrast, cytochrome c release was not detectable in c-Ablâ/â MEFs treated with H2O2(Fig. 4 a). To determine whether c-Abl contributes to the induction of apoptosis by oxidative stress, H2O2-treated MEFs were assayed for the appearance of sub-G1 DNA. The results demonstrate that, compared with wild-type MEFs, the c-Ablâ/â MEFs exhibit an attenuated apoptotic response to H2O2exposure (Fig. 4 b). Analysis at 3 to 24 h of H2O2 exposure confirmed that cells deficient in c-Abl expression exhibit a defective apoptotic response (Fig.4 c). The finding that H2O2-induced release of cytochrome c is completely abrogated in c-Ablâ/â cells indicates that the attenuated induction of apoptosis in response to H2O2 is mediated by a cytochrome c-independent pathway (Fig. 4 b). These results collectively demonstrate that cytoplasmic H2O2 induces cytochrome c release and apoptosis by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism. Oxidative cellular damage contributes to aging (5.Migliaccio E.

Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that the nuclear c-Abl kinase is activated in the apoptotic response of cells to genotoxic stress (12.Yuan Z.M. Shioya H. Ishiko T. Sun X. Huang Y. Lu H. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 13.Gong J. Costanzo A. Yang H.-Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.J.

Conversely, the present studies demonstrate that cytoplasmic, and not nuclear, c-Abl is activated in the apoptotic response to oxidative stress. Whereas DNA damage-induced apoptosis is mediated by activation of c-Abl and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (34.Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), less is known about involvement of mitochondrial signals in H2O2-induced cell death. The present results demonstrate that cytochrome c release is also induced in response to oxidative stress and that this event is c-Abl-dependent. These findings support a model in which c-Abl functions in determining cell fate by conferring stress-induced signals to the release of cytochrome c and thereby apoptosis. The findings further indicate that the subcellular distribution of c-Abl determines localization of the specific response to apparently diverse environmental stresses. However, ROS induce damage to DNA (1.Croteau D. Bohr V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25409-25412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), as well as other cellular components (2.Berlett S. Stadtman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar), and thus it is conceivable that cells have evolved with conservation of a similar response to both genotoxic and oxidative stress. The present findings demonstrate that, analogous to activation of nuclear c-Abl by DNA-damaging agents (9.Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), cytoplasmic c-Abl is activated by ROS-induced stress."

The family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) is involved in the regulation of cardiac myocyte growth and apoptosis. Here we show that Î²-AR stimulation activates p38 kinase, c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) in ARVMs. Inhibition of p38 kinase with SB-202190 (10 Î¼m) potentiated Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis as measured by flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. SB-202190 at this concentration specifically blocked Î²-AR-stimulated activation of p38 kinase and its downstream substrate MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2). Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi/Go proteins, blocked the activation of p38 kinase and potentiated Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis. Activation of Gi protein with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol protected against Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis. Carbachol also activated p38 kinase, and the protective effect of carbachol was abolished by SB-202190. PD-98059 (10 Î¼m), an inhibitor of ERK1/2 pathway, blocked Î²-AR-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 but had no effect on apoptosis. These data suggest that 1) Î²-AR stimulation activates p38 kinase, JNKs, and ERK1/2; 2) activation of p38 kinase plays a protective role in Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis in cardiac myocytes; and 3) the protective effects of Gi are mediated via the activation of p38 kinase.

We further demonstrated that activation of Gi inhibits Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis in ARVMs (7.Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.S. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), a large family of serine-threonine kinases, have important functions as mediators of signal transduction and are activated by a variety extracellular stimuli (8.Force T.

Three subgroups of MAPKs have clearly been identified: the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), the p38 kinase, and the c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). ERK1/2 respond to mitogenic stimuli, whereas p38 kinase and JNKs respond predominantly to cellular stresses or inflammatory cytokines (9.Force T. Bonventre J.V.

In PC12 cells, activation of p38 and JNKs with concurrent inhibition of ERK1/2 was found to induce apoptosis (19.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). In cardiac cells, p38 kinase and JNKs appear to be involved in mediating growth and apoptosis (20.Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P.

The molecular mechanisms involved in Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis in adult cardiac myocytes are largely unknown. This study was undertaken to define the role of MAPKs in Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis and to test the hypothesis that the antiapoptotic effects of Gi are mediated via the activation of MAPKs. Calcium-tolerant ARVMs were isolated from the hearts of adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200â220 g) as described by Singhet al. (23.Singh K. Balligand J.L. Fischer T.A. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28471-28478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were perfused retrogradely with nominally Ca2+-free Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer and were minced and dissociated in the same buffer containing 0.02 mg/ml trypsin and 0.02 mg/ml deoxyribonuclease. The cell mixture was filtered and sedimented through 60 Î¼g/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) to separate ventricular myocytes from nonmyocyte cells. The cell pellet was resuspended in ACCT medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mml-carnitine, 5 mm creatine, 5 mmtaurine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. The ARVMs were then plated in ACCT medium at a density of 30â50 cells/mm2 on 100-mm culture dishes (Fisher Scientific) or glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific) precoated with laminin (1 Î¼g/cm2, Becton-Dickinson). After 1 h, the dishes were washed with ACCT to remove the nonadherent cells. Experiments were performed following 16 h of culture. The cells were pretreated with prazosin (PZ; 0.1 Î¼m, Sigma), followed by treatment with l-norepinephrine (NE; 10 Î¼m, Sigma) for 24 h to measure apoptosis or 15 min to assess MAPK activities. In some experiments propranolol (2 Î¼m, Sigma), carbachol (30 Î¼m, Sigma), PD-98059 (PD; 10 Î¼m, Calbiochem), SB-202190 (SB; 10 Î¼m, Calbiochem), or CGP-20712A (0.3 Î¼m, Research Biochemicals International) were added 30 min prior to the addition of NE. Cells were also treated with xamoterol (1 or 10 Î¼m, Tocris) or clenbuterol (1 or 10 Î¼m, Tocris) to selectively activate Î²1- or Î²2-AR subtypes, respectively. Pertussis toxin (PTX; 1 Î¼g/ml, Sigma) was added 3 h prior to the addition of NE (7.Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.S. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 24.Xiao R.P. Ji X. Lakatta E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). All dishes were supplemented with ascorbic acid (0.1 mm). The cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and total protein contents were measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 400 Î¼g of total proteins was immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK1 (Santa Cruz) or anti-p38 kinase (Santa Cruz), anti-ERK1 (Transduction Laboratory), or anti-MAPKAPK2 (Santa Cruz) antibodies as described (25.Singh K. Balligand J.L. Fischer T.A. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Immune complexes collected on protein A/G-Sepharose beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and once with the kinase buffer A (30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2). The assays were performed in kinase buffer A containing 50 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), 2 Î¼m ATP, and specific substrate for each MAPKs. Myelin basic protein (MBP; 10 Î¼g), glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun (2 Î¼g), GST-ATF2 (2 Î¼g), and heat shock protein 27 (hsp 27; 7.5 Î¼g) served as substrates for ERK1/2, JNKs, p38, and MAPKAPK2, respectively. In some experiments, p38 kinase inhibitor SB (10 Î¼m) was added during the immune complex kinase reaction. Radiolabeled substrates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), detected by autoradiography, and quantified by laser densitometer (Bio-Rad). To confirm the activation of MAPKs, in-gel kinase assays were performed as described previously (25.Singh K. Balligand J.L. Fischer T.A. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The immune complexes, as prepared above, were washed three times with lysis buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE polymerized with 0.5 mg/ml MBP. The gel was rinsed twice with 20% isopropanol in 100 mmTris HCl, pH 8.0 (20 min each), followed by two washes (30 min each) in buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mmÎ²-mercaptoethanol). The gel was denatured in buffer B containing 6m guanidine HCl for 1 h followed by renaturation in buffer B containing 0.04% Tween 40 at 4 Â°C for 16 h, with four to five changes with this buffer over the time period. The gel was then incubated in a kinase buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 3 mmÎ²-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min, followed by another incubation in the kinase buffer C containing 50 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and 50 Î¼m ATP at room temperature for 1 h. The gel was then washed several times with 1% sodium pyrophosphate in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Radiolabeled MBP was detected by autoradiography and quantified using laser densitometer (Bio-Rad). Activation of p38 kinase was also studied using phospho-specific antibodies (New England BioLabs). Total cell lysates (70 Î¼g) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with phospho-specific p38 kinase antibodies and analyzed as described previously (25.Singh K. Balligand J.L. Fischer T.A. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis) was performed on a FACS Star Plus using Lysis II software (Becton-Dickinson) as described previously (5.Communal C. Singh K. Pimentel D.R. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 7.Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.S. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were trypsinized, fixed/porated in 70% ethanol at 4 Â°C for 30 min, and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 Î¼g/ml RNase A (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50 Î¼g/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Apoptotic cells stained with propidium iodide exhibit reduced DNA content with a peak in the hypodiploid region. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined as fraction of cells with hypodiploid DNA content. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed on cells plated on glass coverslips using a Roche Molecular Biochemicalsin situ death detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of TUNEL-positive myocytes (relative to total myocytes) was determined by counting 400â500 cells in 20 randomly chosen fields per coverslip on each of three coverslips for each experiment. All data are expressed as mean Â± S.E. Comparisons between control and treatments were performed using Student's unpairedt tests. Statistical significance of multiple treatments was determined by analysis of variance and a post hoc Tukey's test. Probability (p) values of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. To elucidate the effect of Î²-AR stimulation on MAPK signaling, the activities of ERK1/2, p38 kinase, and JNKs were measured in ARVMs treated with NE in the presence of the Î±1-AR antagonist prazosin (NE/PZ). Initial characterization of the time course using the immune complex kinase assay indicated that activation of p38 kinase and JNKs was maximal at 15 min (data not shown), whereas activation of ERK1/2 was not evident until 60 min, and therefore subsequent experiments were performed at 15 (JNKs and p38) or 60 (ERK1/2) min after Î²-AR stimulation. Î²-AR stimulation increased the activities of p38 kinase and JNKs by 2.3 Â± 0.3- and 3.5 Â± 0.2-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 A), and these effects were fully blocked by the Î²-AR antagonist propranolol (data not shown). ERK1/2 activity was increased 2.6 Â± 0.4-fold at 60 min (Fig. 1 A). MAPK activation was then confirmed by in-gel kinase assay, using MBP as substrate (21.Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 26.Fischer T.A. Singh K. O'Hara D.S. Kaye D.M. Kelly R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H906-H916PubMed Google Scholar), which showed that Î²-AR stimulation increased p38 kinase and JNKs activities by approximately 2- and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The activity of MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2), a downstream substrate of p38 kinase (27.Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), was measured by immune complex kinase assay using hsp 27 as a substrate. MAPKAPK2 activity was increased 3.6 Â± 0.3-fold at 30 min of Î²-AR stimulation (Fig.2 A). Pretreatment with p38 kinase inhibitor SB-202190 (SB; 10 Î¼m) completely blocked Î²-AR-stimulated MAPKAPK2 activity. SB alone also reduced the basal MAPKAPK2 activity (Fig. 2 A). Pretreatment with the ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor PD-98059 (PD; 10 Î¼m) blocked the Î²-AR-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 at 60 min (Fig.2 B). As reported previously (5.Communal C. Singh K. Pimentel D.R. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 7.Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.S. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), incubation with NE/PZ for 24 h increased the number of apoptotic ARVMs by 1.8 Â± 0.1-fold as measured by flow cytometry (Fig.3 A). After pretreatment with SB (10 Î¼m, 30 min), Î²-AR stimulation increased the number of apoptotic ARVMs by 3.4 Â± 0.1-fold, which was greater than the effect of Î²-AR stimulation alone (p < 0.05). Î²-AR stimulation also increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells by 1.8 Â± 0.2-fold (Fig. 3 B). After pretreatment with SB, Î²-AR stimulation increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells by 3.4 Â± 0.5-fold, which was greater than the effect of Î²-AR stimulation alone (p < 0.05). Treatment with SB alone had no effect on the number of apoptotic cells measured by flow cytometry or TUNEL staining. Inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway by pretreatment with PD (10 Î¼m, 30 min) had no effect on Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis. The number of apoptotic ARVMs (as measured by flow cytometry) was unchanged (NE/PZ, 1.8 Â± 0.1-fold; PD + NE/PZ, 1.6 Â± 0.1-fold; p = NS). Treatment with PD alone also had no effect on the number of apoptotic cells (Fig.4). The pyridinyl imidazole compound SB has been shown to inhibit JNKs activity at concentrations â¥ 10 Î¼m (28.Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H. Su M.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 29.Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To elucidate the pharmacology of SB-202190 in ARVMs, we tested the effect of SB (10 Î¼m; a concentration that increases Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis) on Î²-AR-stimulated p38 kinase and JNKs activation. Due to the reversible nature of this compound, it was added during the immune complex kinase reaction. SB completely inhibited Î²-AR-stimulated p38 kinase activity (Fig.5 A) but caused only minimal inhibition of JNKs activation (Fig. 5 B). To determine whether Gi is involved in the Î²-AR stimulation of p38 kinase, ARVMs were pretreated with pertussis toxin (PTX; 1 Î¼g/ml, 3 h) to inactivate Gi (6.Iwai-Kanai E. Hasegawa K. Araki M. Kakita T. Morimoto T. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24.Xiao R.P. Ji X. Lakatta E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). PTX alone had no effect on p38 kinase activity (Fig.6 A) but completely blocked the Î²-AR-stimulated activation of p38 kinase (NE/PZ, 2.1 Â± 0.1-fold; PTX + NE/PZ, 1.0 Â± 0.2-fold; p < 0.05). To further assess the role of Gi, cells were pretreated with carbachol (CARB; 30 Î¼m, 30 min) to activate Gi. CARB alone increased p38 kinase activity, and concurrent Î²-AR stimulation caused no further increase in p38 kinase activity (CARB, 2.6 Â± 0.7-fold; CARB + NE/PZ, 2.5 Â± 0.2-fold; p = NS; Fig. 6 B). As reported previously (7.Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.S. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), pretreatment with CARB (30 Î¼m, 30 min) abolished Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis (Fig.7). Pretreatment with SB (10 Î¼m) completely blocked the protective effect of carbachol (as measured by flow cytometry). The combination of CARB and SB had no effect on apoptosis. We have shown previously (7.Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.S. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) that stimulation of Î²1-AR increases apoptosis, whereas stimulation of Î²2-AR inhibits apoptosis. To study the involvement of Î²1- or Î²2-AR in the activation of p38 kinase, ARVM were treated with different concentrations of xamoterol (1 and 10 Î¼m) and clenbuterol (1 and 10 Î¼m). Xamoterol is a partial agonist for Î²1-AR (30.Nuttall A. Snow H.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 77: 381-388Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), whereas clenbuterol is a selective agonist for Î²2-AR (31.Andre C. Couton D. Gaston J. Erraji L. Renia L. Varlet P. Briand P. Guillet J.-G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G647-G654PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of p38 was evaluated by Western blot using phospho-specific p38 kinase antibodies and by immune complex kinase assays. Using phospho-specific p38 kinase antibodies, we found that xamoterol increased phosphorylation of p38 kinase by 2.0- and 1.5-fold at 1 and 10 Î¼m concentrations, respectively (Fig.8). This activation of p38 was inhibited 40â90% by Î²1-AR antagonist CGP-20712A. Clenbuterol increased p38 kinase activity by 1.3- and 2.2-fold at 1 and 10 Î¼m concentrations, respectively. Likewise, the immune complex kinase assay using MBP as substrate showed 4.0 Â± 1.7- and 6.7 Â± 2.3-fold increase in p38 kinase activity following a 15-min exposure to xamoterol (1 Î¼m) or clenbuterol (1 Î¼m), respectively. These data suggest that both Î²1- and Î²2-AR subtypes can couple to the activation of p38 kinase. Stimulation of Î²-AR induces apoptosis in cardiac myocytes. This phenomenon has been shown to occur both in vitro in adult and neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (5.Communal C. Singh K. Pimentel D.R. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 6.Iwai-Kanai E. Hasegawa K. Araki M. Kakita T. Morimoto T. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and in vivo in rat myocardium following infusion of isoproterenol (32.Shizukuda Y. Buttrick P.M. Geenen D.L. Borczuk A.C. Kitsis R.N. Sonnenblick E.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H961-H968PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we found that stimulation of Gi protein opposes Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis (7.Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.S. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that Î²-AR stimulation activates three members of the MAPKs family, ERK1/2, JNKs, and p38 kinase and that the activation of p38 kinase plays a protective role in Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis. Furthermore, the data suggest that the protective effects of Gi stimulation are mediated via the activation of p38 kinase. We found that activation of p38 kinase protects against Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis. The p38 kinase pathway has been shown to either stimulate or inhibit apoptosis in various cell types (19.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar, 21.Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol.

Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 kinase was shown to protect Jurkat cells against Fas ligation and UV irradiation induced apoptosis (35.Mackay K. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6272-6279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Likewise, overexpression of MAPK kinase 6, a selective activator of p38 kinase, protected neonatal cardiac myocytes from either anisomysin- or constitutively active MAPK kinase kinase 1-induced apoptosis (22.Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In contrast, in neonatal cardiac myocytes, pharmacological inhibition of p38 kinase protected against ischemia-induced apoptosis (35.Mackay K. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6272-6279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and overexpression of p38Î± exerted a proapoptotic action (21.Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Six isoforms for p38 kinase have been identified, of which heart muscle expresses predominantly the Î± and Î² isoforms (36.Jiang Y. Gram H. Xhao M. New L. Feng L. Di Padava F. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30122-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). SB is a potent inhibitor of both the Î± and Î²2 isoforms of p38 kinase (29.Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, the differential effects of p38 inhibition on apoptosis in various cell types may reflect heterogeneity in the expression and/or activation of various p38 kinase isoforms. PD-98059 at a concentration of 10 Î¼m fully inhibited Î²-AR-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 but had no effect on apoptosis. Thus, it seems unlikely that ERK1/2 played a major role in opposing the apoptotic action of Î²-AR stimulation (18.Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These findings are in contrast to data in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, where ERK1/2 has been shown to play an antiapoptotic role. For example, in neonatal myocytes, the ability of cardiotropin-1 to protect against serum deprivation-stimulated apoptosis was blocked by inhibition of ERK1/2 (18.Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Similarly, concurrent Î±1-AR stimulation was found to oppose Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, and this protective effect was blocked by inhibition of ERK1/2 (6.Iwai-Kanai E. Hasegawa K. Araki M. Kakita T. Morimoto T. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Both cardiotropin-1 and Î±1-AR agonists activate ERK1/2 within 10â15 min of stimulation, and the activity returns to basal levels in 30 min (18.Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 37.Bogoyevitch M.A. Andersson M.B. Gillespie-Brown J. Clerk A. Glennon P.E. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas Î²-AR-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 was not detected until 60 min in ARVM. Thus, the different roles of ERK1/2 in modulating apoptosis in ARVM versus neonatal rat myocytes may reflect differences in the kinetics of activation and/or coupling. Î²-AR stimulation caused the activation of JNKs in ARVM. SB had only a minimal effect on the Î²-AR-stimulated activation of JNKs. Therefore, it is unlikely that JNKs contributed to the proapoptotic effect of SB that we observed. However, because there are no specific pharmacological inhibitors for JNKs, we can not exclude a possible role for JNKs in Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis. We provide evidence for the involvement of Gi proteins in the Î²-AR-stimulated activation of p38 kinase in ARVMs. PTX, which inhibits Gi and potentiates Î²-AR-mediated apoptosis (7.Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.S. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2210-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), abolished the Î²-AR-stimulated activation of p38 kinase. Likewise, treatment with carbachol, which stimulates Gi in ARVMs via the activation of M2 muscarinic receptors and inhibits Î²-AR-mediated apoptosis, activated p38 kinase. These findings are consistent with the demonstration that activation of p38 kinase by endothelin-1 or epinephrine is PTX-sensitive in smooth muscle cells and osteoblasts (38.Husain S. Abdel-Latif A.A. Biochem J. 1999; 342: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39.Suzuki A. Palmer G. Bonjour J.P. Caverzasio J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3177-3182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, p38 kinase and JNKs, but not ERK1/2, were activated in transgenic mice that overexpress a constitutively active mutant of GÎ±i-2 (17.Guo J.H. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16487-16493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The precise link between Î²-AR stimulation, Gi, and p38 activation requires further investigation. Xamoterol and clenbuterol each stimulated p38 kinase activity, suggesting that both Î²1- and Î²2-AR subtypes can couple p38 kinase. There is evidence that Î²2-AR (40.Xiao R.P. Avdonin P. Zhou Y. Cheng H. Akhter S.A. Eschenhagen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and Î²1-AR (41.Kompa A.R. Summers R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42.Taimor G. Schulter K.-D. Schafer M. Piper M. Circulation. 1998; 98 (I-623 (abstr.))Google Scholar) can couple to Gi, and thus might participate in the activation of p38 kinase with Î²-AR stimulation. The ability of Î²1-AR to activate p38 kinase suggests that this subtype can activate both apoptotic and antiapoptotic pathways. Î²1-AR may stimulate apoptosis via a PKA-calcium-dependent mechanism (5.Communal C. Singh K. Pimentel D.R. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), and oppose apoptosis via the activation of p38 kinase. Simultaneous activation of apoptotic and antiapoptotic pathways in cardiac myocytes has been observed with daunomycin (43.Zhu W. Zou Y. Aikawa R. Harada K. Kudoh S. Uozumi H. Hayashi D. Gu Y. Yamazaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2100-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible that the apparent ability of both Î²1- and Î²2-AR subtypes to activate p38 kinase may reflect differential activation of p38 kinase isoforms, which may exert opposing effects on apoptosis in cardiac myocytes (21.Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which activation of p38 kinase protects against Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis is not yet clear. MAPKAPK2, a downstream target of p38 kinase that is activated by Î²-AR stimulation in ARVMs, is one candidate to exert an antiapoptotic action. Support for this thesis comes from the observation that MAPKAPK2 can phosphorylate several other proteins, including heat shock proteins that have been shown to protect cells from apoptosis (44.Parratt J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 19-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 45.Sharma H.S. Stahl J. Weisensee D. Low-Friedrich I. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of p38 kinase may regulate the activities of Akt and/or caspases. Activation of Akt (47.Fujio Y. Gou K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and inhibition of caspases (34.Nemato S. Xiang J. Huang S. Lin A. J.

Res. 1999; 84: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) are shown to have antiapoptotic effects. Further studies aimed at determining the molecular mechanisms by which p38 kinase opposes Î²-AR-stimulated apoptosis in cardiac myocytes may have important implications for the regulation of myocyte survival.

Syntenin-syndecan binding involves the C-terminal part of syntenin that contains a tandem of PDZ domains. Here we provide evidence that each PDZ domain of syntenin can interact with a syndecan. Isolated or combined mutations of the carboxylate binding lysines in the inter-Î²AÎ²B loops and of the Î±B1 residues in either one or both the PDZ domains of syntenin all reduce syntenin-syndecan binding in yeast two-hybrid, blot-overlay, and surface plasmon resonance assays.

Yet, unlike a tandem of two PDZ2 domains and a reconstituted PDZ1+PDZ2 tandem, a tandem of two PDZ1 domains and isolated PDZ1 or PDZ2 domains do not interact with syndecan bait.

They function as versatile co-receptors, as there is a growing list of examples where the heparan sulfate chains of these membrane proteins are involved in the docking of heparin binding molecules (e.g. growth factors and adhesion molecules) to cell surfaces and facilitate the interactions of these molecules with specific cognate signaling receptors (1.Bernfield M. GoÌtte M. Woo Park P. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). The strict evolutionary conservation of the structures of the cytoplasmic domains of the syndecans implies that the biological functions of these membrane proteins may also depend on highly specific cytoplasmic interactions and associations. Recently, the cytoplasmic domains of the syndecans were shown to interact with syntenin (2.Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and CASK (3.Cohen A.R. Woods D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Wood D.F. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), two proteins that belong to the larger family of proteins that contain one or several PDZ domains (PDZ proteins). PDZ domains are structural motifs of about 80 amino acids that were initially found in the post synaptic density-95,disc-large, and zonulin-1 proteins but occur in a large variety of proteins (5.Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). PDZ domains interact with the C termini of specific peptide structures. X-ray structures (6.Cabral J.H.

Biol. 2000; 295: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) show that PDZ domains are compact Î± + Î² modules containing five to six Î² strands (labeled Î²A to Î²E) and two Î± helices (Î±A and Î±B). The binding peptide fits into a hydrophobic pocket created by the principal Î±-helix (Î±B), the second Î²-strand (Î²B), and the âcarboxylate bindingâ loop that connects the Î²A and Î²B strands. The terminal carboxylate of the peptide interacts with a cradle of amide nitrogens from the inter-Î²AÎ²B loop, but an arginine or lysine at the start of this loop also contributes to the stabilization of this carboxylate via a bound water molecule. The C-terminal four residues of the peptide are stabilized by main chain hydrogen bonds with Î²B, whereby peptide binding represents the augmentation of the PDZ Î²-sheet by an anti-parallel strand. PDZ domains are selective. This binding specificity is achieved by domain interactions with the residue at the â2 position of the bound peptide. Type-I PDZ domains bind to peptides with the terminal-(S/T)XV consensus motif, whereby the Ser or Thr hydrogen bonds a relatively well conserved histidine residue near the start of the Î±B helix (7.Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Type-II PDZ domains, in contrast, bind to peptides with hydrophobic or aromatic amino acids in the â2 position and feature a non-basic residue as the first residue of the Î±B helix (9.Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Most often a PDZ domain occurs in association with other functional protein-protein interaction modules, including other PDZ domains (5.Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The specific associations and most often multiple binding interactions of PDZ proteins implicate many of these proteins in the localization of receptors and cytosolic effectors to specific membrane sites and in linking extracellular signals to the cytoskeleton and intracellular signaling pathways. Syntenin contains two PDZ domains, which occur as a direct repeat and compose the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein. Conforming to a PDZ-mediated interaction, the interaction of syntenin with syndecans depends on the integrity of the C-terminal FYA sequence that is common to all syndecans and qualifies as a class II PDZ-interacting peptide (10.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Yet, the syndecan cytoplasmic domain in solution does not bind syntenin or not as strongly as syntenin binds to immobilized syndecans, and the only part of syntenin that appears dispensable for the interaction is the N-terminal domain. This suggests that both PDZ domains might be needed in a two-pronged (socket-plug) attachment of syntenin to di- or oligomerized syndecans (2.Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Syntenin is not unique is this respect. In GRIP, which contains two clusters of three adjacent PDZ domains, the minimal region required for binding to the AMPA receptor spans two complete PDZ domains (11.Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), and also in the case of the human Dlg protein, two adjacent PDZ domains are needed for interaction with protein 4.1. (12.Lue R.A. Brandin E. Chan E.P. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there are many more examples of PDZ domains that do work in isolation, and several proteins with single PDZ domains have been identified. CASK, originally identified as a membrane-associated guanylate kinase homolog that binds to the t-YYV sequence of neurexin (13.Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and recently shown to also bind to syndecans (3.Cohen A.R. Woods D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Wood D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 4.Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), is one of these proteins with single PDZ domains that work in isolation. This singles out the PDZ domains of syntenin and several other proteins as peculiar or suggests trivial explanations for this need for paired domains. Conceivably, incorrect folding of PDZ domains that were isolated from their structural contexts may complicate binding assignments. Moreover, some PDZ domains have been shown to form dimers with other PDZ domains (14.Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 15.Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), further complicating the identification of the peptide-binding sites in those instances where binding would be based on co-operative PDZ domain interactions. To resolve this issue for the interaction between syntenin and the syndecan cytoplasmic domain, we have introduced point mutations in the two PDZ domains of syntenin, separately or in combination, using the crystal structures of peptide bound to PDZ3 of human Dlg and PSD-95 as a guide. The mutants were used as prey for syndecan bait in yeast two-hybrid reporter assays and expressed as glutathioneS-transferase (GST)1 fusion proteins for use in blotting and surface plasmon resonance experiments. Collectively, the results indicate that both PDZ domains of syntenin bind syndecans, but with unequal strengths, and that only their co-operative binding results in stable syntenin-syndecan interactions. Syntenin does not discriminate between the various syndecans. Syntenin binds also to neurexins and B-class ephrins, with a similar requirement of coupled functional PDZ domains. These data suggest that in vivo syntenin may be recruited to the membrane by the assembly and mixed assemblies of syndecans and other suitable partners, such as neurexins and ephrins. Mutant syndecan and syntenin cDNAs were generated with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). cDNAs encoding syntenin-PDZ1 (amino acid Gly-102 to Pro-194) or PDZ2 (amino acid Phe-195 to Pro-271) were constructed by PCR with the indicated primer pairs (5â²-GGGATCCTGTTTGAACGGACGATTACCATG and 5â²-TCAGATCTTAGGCATGATTGTAATAGTAAC for PDZ1; 5â²-GGGATCCGTAGAGCAGAAATTAAGCAAG and 5â²-TCAGATCTTGGGCGTGTCACGAATGG for PDZ2) and ligated to one another (using the BamHI andBglII restriction sites) to encode tandems of PDZ1-PDZ1, PDZ1-PDZ2, or PDZ2-PDZ2 (verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing). cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain of neurexin was constructed by PCR using the primers 5â²-AGGATCCCCATGTATAAGTACCGCAATCG and 5â²-TGCGAATTCCGTAAGAGAAGCTCTTGAGGC. The cDNA encoding the ephrin-B1 cytoplasmic domain was constructed by PCR using the primers 5â²-GGAATTCGCAAGCGCCATCGCAAGC and 5â²-ACTCGAGGGAGAAGAGAGCGGCCGATCCA. The syndecan, neurexin, and B-ephrin cDNAs were cloned into the pGEX-5x-2 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to create fusion proteins between GST and the cytoplasmic domains of these membrane proteins. An expression vector encoding glutathione S-transferase extended by an myc tag was constructed by annealing 5â²-GATCTCCGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGGG to 5â²-GATCCCCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCGGA and inserting the annealed oligonucleotides into the BamHI site of pGEX-5x-2. Vectors encoding fusion proteins between GST-myc and wild-type syntenin or paired syntenin-PDZ domains were constructed by inserting the corresponding cDNAs in the BamHI site of this modified vector. Syntenin mutants were constructed as non-myc-tagged fusion proteins in pGEX-5x-2. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli BL21 or ER2566 cells were used as host cells to express the GST fusion proteins. Expression was induced by adding 0.4 mm isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactoside to the medium when the culture reached an A 550of 0.6. After induction, the cultures were allowed to grow for another 3 h at 30 Â°C. Induced cells were collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 8000 Ã g at 4 Â°C. All the medium was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of TEN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0). Aprotinin (3 Î¼m), benzamidine (5 mm), leupeptin (20 Î¼m), pepstatin (3 Î¼m), 6-aminohexanoic acid (5 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (200 Î¼m) were added as protease inhibitors. The cell suspension was incubated with 2.5 mg of lysozyme for 1 h on ice. After 1 h, the solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 18,000 Ã g at 4 Â°C. Except for GST-PDZ2 and GST-PDZ2+PDZ2, which proved insoluble, all the GST fusion proteins were mainly found in the water-soluble phase. This phase was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing the column with phosphate-buffered saline, the fusion protein was eluted from the column with reduced glutathione. Surface plasmon resonance was measured using a BIAcore 2000 instrument. A total of 900 resonance units of biotinylated synthetic peptide, corresponding to the 32 amino acids that compose the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-2, was coupled to a streptavidin sensor chip. Analytes (GST fusion proteins) were perfused (10 Î¼l/min) over the control (Fc1) and capture (Fc2) surfaces in running buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, 0.01M Hepes, pH 7.4). Binding was measured as the difference between the Fc2 and Fc1 binding curves. All bindings were tested at different concentrations of analyte. Purified GST fusion proteins or isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactoside-induced BL21/ER2566 cells expressing these fusion proteins were re-suspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were cleared by centrifugation and fractionated in 12% SDS-PAGE, each lane containing 0.1 Î¼g of fusion protein. Cultured human MCF-7 cells were scraped in phosphate-buffered saline and treated with heparitinase before fractionation by 12% SDS-PAGE. After electro-transfer to Hybond-C-super membranes, the blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in TBS-Tween (150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) and incubated with fusion proteins of GST-myc-syntenin, GST-mycdeletion mutants, or GST-syntenin point mutants (10 Î¼g/ml in TBS-Tween). After a 3-h incubation at room temperature, the blots were washed with TBS-Tween and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with anti-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 or with anti-syntenin mAb 1C8, both diluted to 1 Î¼g/ml in TBS-Tween. After rinsing with TBS-Tween, bound anti-myc and anti-syntenin were visualized with horseradish peroxidase goat anti-mouse (Bio-Rad 1/10.000) and ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bait, consisting of the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-2 fused in-frame to the DNA binding domain of Gal4, was constructed by PCR using theBamHI/PstI restriction sites of the pAS2 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories). The syntenin, mutant syntenins, and PDZ tandem prey were cloned, respectively, in pGAD10, pGAD424, and pACT2 (all from CLONTECH Laboratories). The pAS2 plasmids were transfected in Y187 yeast cells, whereas the pGAD/pACT plasmids were transfected in CG1945 yeast cells. Diploid cells resulted from mating Y187 with CG1945 were selected on double minus plates (Leuâ, Trpâ), assayed for Î²-galactosidase activity, and assayed for growth on triple minus plates (Leuâ, Trpâ, Hisâ) with and without 5 mm 3-aminotriazol. For the Î²A-Î²B-loop and Î±B mutants only, the galactosidase staining is shown in the figures; for the shuffle mutants, results of the growth assay are represented in tabular form in Fig. 4. Recombinant syntenin, free of any peptide extensions, but with the C-terminal valine substituted by an alanine, was produced in the IMPACT (intein-mediated purification with an affinity chitin binding Tag) T7 system, according to the protocols provided by the supplier (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). CDNA-encoding syntenin was produced by PCR using the primers 5â²-GGAATTCCATATGTCTCTCTATCCATCTCTCGAAG and 5â²-GGCCGCTCTTCCGCAAGCCTCAGGAATGGTGTGGTCCA and cloned in theNdeI and Sap I restriction sites of the pTYB1 vector to produce an in-frame fusion between the C terminus of syntenin and the N terminus of an intein-chitin binding domain fusion protein. After propagation of the plasmid in ER2566 E. coli cells and induction of the cells at an A 550 of 0.5 with 0.3 mm isopropyl Î²-d-thiogalactoside at 30 Â°C for 4 h, the tripartite fusion protein was isolated from crude cell extracts by affinity purification on a chitin column. After extensive washings, the column was treated overnight at 4 Â°C with 30 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol to induce the intein-mediated self-cleavage of the fusion protein and the consequent release of its syntenin moiety from the column. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining revealed only a single peptide band of 33 kDa in the eluate of the DTT-treated column. Alanine was substituted for the C-terminal valine in syntenin because we noted that this substitution markedly increased the efficiency of the excision process and yield of syntenin. The yield was approximately 1 mg/liter of induced culture. The syntenin solution was dialyzed overnight at 4 Â°C against 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0 (ITC buffer) before the isothermal titration calorimetry experiment. The titration was performed using an Omega isothermal titration calorimeter from MicroCalâ¢ Inc. (Northampton, MA). The concentration in the sample cell with a volume of 1.33 ml was 0.0980 mm (3.18 mg/ml). The titrated peptide was dissolved to a concentration of 1.72 mm (6.35 mg/ml) in the ITC buffer and injected in fractions of 18 Î¼l. The temperature of the cell was 25 Â°C. The obtained titration thermogram was analyzed with MicroCalâ¢Originâ¢ 5.0 software. The loop between the Î²A and Î²B strands of a PDZ domain is designated as the carboxylate binding loop. Crystal structures indicate that the main chain amides of this loop donate hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate of the terminal (0) residue of the interacting peptide (7.Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Recognition of this terminal carboxylate also involves the side chain of a basic residue, Arg or Lys, which invariantly occurs as the first residue of the loop. In syntenin these basic residues correspond to Lys-119 (PDZ1) and Lys-203 (PDZ2). Speculating that either one or both of these residues would be critical for optimal binding, we replaced these lysines by alanines in either PDZ1 or PDZ2 or in both PDZ1 and PDZ2 and tested the influence of these mutations on the syntenin-syndecan interaction. The exact positions of these mutations are shown in Fig.1. In yeast two-hybrid assays, syndecan bait only interacts with syntenin prey that contains the two PDZ domains of syntenin. Moreover, in this particular case bait and prey can not be interchanged (2.Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In this assay, as assessed from colony outgrowth and Î²-galactosidase staining and using syndecan-2 as bait, none of the Lys â Ala mutations markedly influenced the syndecan-syntenin interaction (Fig.2 B). In surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) experiments, GST fusion proteins that contain the two PDZ domains of syntenin bind avidly to a syndecan-2 cytoplasmic domain peptide that is immobilized on the sensor chip but not inversely. Moreover, peptide in solution does not compete for syntenin binding to immobilized peptide (2.Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Binding curves obtained from the perfusions of similar amounts and concentrations of the different GST-syntenin fusion proteins indicated a decreased binding to immobilized syndecan-2 peptide, both for the K119A mutant (PDZ1) and for the K203A mutant (PDZ2) (Fig. 2 E). Compared with wild-type syntenin, the binding of the K203A mutant (PDZ2) was more markedly reduced than that of the K119A mutant (PDZ1). A similarly significant reduced binding was also observed for the K119A/K203A double mutant. A GST-syntenin fusion protein binds also to GST-syndecan-2 fusion proteins that have been fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes (2.Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G.

When used as probes in blotting assays, at similar concentrations of GST-syntenin in solution and for similar amounts of GST-syndecan immobilized on the membranes (as assessed by parallel staining with anti-GST), all three Lys [rarrow] Ala mutants bound still to wild-type syndecan-2 (Fig.3). The K203A mutant (PDZ2) and the K119A/K203A double mutant produced signals of almost similar intensities, both clearly lower than the signal obtained with the K119A mutant (PDZ1). Like wild-type syntenin, none of these Lys â Ala mutants bound to GST-F(C30)S syndecan-2 (substitution of serine for the phenylalanine at the -2 position of the syndecan peptide), consistent with a PDZ-mediated interaction and an unchanged peptide specificity of this interaction (Fig. 3). All together, the negative effects of the lysine to alanine mutations suggested that both PDZ domains were (directly or indirectly) involved in the syndecan binding, possibly with a larger contribution of PDZ2 than of PDZ1.Figure 3Ligand overlays, testing for the binding of GST-syntenin and GST-syntenin mutants to blotted GST-wild-type syndecan-2 cytoplasmic domain, and GST-F(C30)S mutant syndecan-2 cytoplasmic domain fusion proteins. All GST-syntenin fusion proteins were added at similar concentrations (10 Î¼g/ml overlay solution). Bound syntenin or syntenin mutants were detected using the anti-syntenin mAb 1C8 at 1 Î¼g/ml. Each individual panelrepresents signals obtained for lanes derived from the same blots, each lane containing a similar amount of wild-type (WT) or mutant (FS) GST-cytoplasmic domain fusion protein. Because of potential variations in transfer efficiencies, signals obtained for different blots (different frames) cannot be directly compared.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The crystal structures of the PDZ domains of PSD95 and human Dlg (see above) also reveal an important role for the first residue of the second Î± helix of the domain (the Î±B1 residue). This Î±B1 residue interacts with the residue at the â2 position of the bound peptide and determines at least in part the specificity of the domain for the peptide. In the PDZ domains of PSD95 and human Dlg the Î±B1 residues are histidines that interact with threonines or serines at the â2 position of the bound peptides. The â2 residue in the syndecan peptide is a phenylalanine (t-FYA), and mutating this phenylalanine to alanine indeed abolishes the syndecan-syntenin interaction in yeast two-hybrid and overlay experiments (2.Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments predict that in syntenin the Î±B1 residues of the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains correspond to serine 171 and aspartate 251, respectively. In attempts to alter the binding specificities of the syntenin PDZ domains and reduce their interactions with wild-type syndecans, we converted their Î±B1 residues into histidines and embedded these in the sequence SHEQ, mimicking the sequence context for the Î±B1 histidines in PSD95 and human Dlg. The exact positions of these mutations (SDK â HEQ in PDZ1 and KDS â SHE in PDZ2) are represented in Fig. 1. As a complementary test, we also tested whether these mutant PDZ domains would interact with a mutant F(C30)S syndecan-2 cytoplasmic domain, expected to complement for the altered PDZ domain specificity by featuring a serine instead of a phenylalanine at the â2 position. In the two-hybrid assay with the wild-type syndecan-2 bait, the mutation of the PDZ1-Î±B helix showed no measurable effect, whereas the mutation of the PDZ2-Î±B helix (as single mutation or in combination with the PDZ1-Î±B mutation) abolished the interaction (Fig. 2 C). Substituting F(C30)S syndecan-2 for wild-type syndecan-2 as bait in these assays did not support an interaction with wild-type syntenin or the PDZ1Î±B mutant, but it restored the interaction with the PDZ2Î±B mutant and the PDZ1Î±B/PDZ2Î±B double mutant (not shown). In the BIAcore assay (Fig. 2 F) using an immobilized wild-type syndecan-2 cytoplasmic domain, the isolated mutation of the PDZ1-Î±B helix resulted only in a slight decrease in syntenin binding. The isolated mutation of the PDZ2-Î±B helix and the combination of the Î±B helix mutations in both PDZ1 and PDZ2 had clear negative effects. Similar results were obtained in blotting assays, where both the PDZ2Î±B mutant and the PDZ1Î±B/PDZ2Î±B mutant clearly showed reduced binding to wild-type GST-syndecan-2 (Fig. 3). Moreover, unlike wild-type syntenin and the PDZ1Î±B mutant, the PDZ2Î±B mutant and the PDZ1Î±B/PDZ2Î±B mutant were both effective at binding to the F(C30)S syndecan-2 mutant. All together the results obtained with the Î±B helix mutants also suggested that both PDZ domains of syntenin were involved in the syntenin-syndecan interaction, but clearly with a larger or more specific contribution of the PDZ2 domain. The combination of the Lys â Ala mutations in the carboxylate binding loops and of the Î±B helix mutations (KÎ±B mutations) in either PDZ1 or PDZ2 or in both PDZ1 and PDZ2 yielded results that were consistent with the above interpretation. In the two-hybrid assay with the wild-type bait, the K119A/PDZ1Î±B mutant (KÎ±B mutation of PDZ1) still interacted with syndecan (Fig.2 D). As could have been expected from the effects of the PDZ2Î±B mutations (see above), the KÎ±B mutation of PDZ2 (K203A/PDZ2Î±B) or of both PDZ1 and PDZ2 (K119A/PDZ1Î±B+K203A/PDZ2Î±B) suppressed this interaction. In the BIAcore assay, the KÎ±B mutation of either PDZ1 or PDZ2 had a negative effect on the binding, but the mutation of PDZ2 had a much stronger negative effect than the mutation of PDZ1 (Fig. 2 G).

The first three-dimensional structure of invertebrate chitin-binding protein was determined for tachycitin using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The measurements indicate that the structure of tachycitin is largely divided into N- and C-terminal domains; the former comprises a three-stranded Î²-sheet and the latter a two-stranded Î²-sheet following a short helical turn. The latter structural motif shares a significant tertiary structural similarity with the chitin-binding domain of plant chitin-binding protein. This result is thought to provide faithful experimental evidence to the recent hypothesis that chitin-binding proteins of invertebrates and plants are correlated by a convergent evolution process.

The plant chitin-binding domain is mostly composed of 30â43 residues including eight cysteines, three aromatic residues, and glycines and is frequently referred to as a hevein domain (8.Beintema J.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).

They also revealed that tachycitin consists of five intramolecular disulfide bridges; the connected Cys pairs are 6â33, 12â30, 24â61, 25â68, and 40â53. For invertebrates, the chitin-binding domain was assumed to comprise about 65 residues (17.Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) involving a high percentage of cysteine and aromatic residues in a similar manner to the plant chitin-binding domain. On the basis of such similarity between plant and invertebrate chitin-binding proteins, Shen and Jacobs-Lorena (17.Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) proposed a hypothesis that they are correlated by a rare evolutional process, convergent evolution, i.e. proteins from different origins develop to construct the same active site structure to acquire the same function. However, complete lack of 3D-structural information of invertebrate chitin-binding protein obscures the evolutional relationship between invertebrate and plant chitin-binding proteins. The present study determines the solution structure of tachycitin using NMR spectroscopy, which provides the first 3D structural information of invertebrate chitin-binding protein. An invertebrate chitin-binding protein, tachycitin, was isolated from hemocyte debris of horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) as described previously (1.Kawabata S. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Shigenaga T. Agarwala K.L. Saito T. Cho J. Nakajima H. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and used without further purification. The NMR samples were prepared by dissolving tachycitin in either 0.3 ml of D2O or H2O containing 10% D2O to give a final concentration of 1â2 mm, whose pH values were adjusted to be 4.0â6.5 by addition of DCl and/or NaOD. The NMR experiments were performed on JEOL JNM-Alpha 500 and 600 spectrometers operating at temperatures of 15, 20, 30, and 40 Â°C. The two-dimensional experiments, DQF-COSY, TOCSY (mixing time = 75, 85 ms), and NOESY (mixing time = 75, 250 ms), were acquired with low-power (20 Hz) presaturation on the water. The temperature coefficient (âÎÎ´/ÎT, ppb Kâ1) was estimated from the temperature dependence (15â40 Â°C) of the chemical shift of the HN resonance. The chemical shifts were referenced to the internal standard, TSP (0.00 ppm). Interproton distance restraints were derived from NOE cross-peaks in the NOESY spectra (mixing time = 75 ms), calibrated the peak intensities with known distances (2.2 â« for HÎ±(i)-HN(i + 1) of Î²-sheet and 1.75 â« for HÎ²-HÎ²â²), and were used as inputs for 3D structural calculations of tachycitin. The NOEs were classified into strong, medium, and weak, corresponding to three distance restraints with an upper limit of 2.7, 3.5, and 5.0 â«, respectively. The upper distance limit was corrected for methyl and methylene protons that were not assigned stereospecifically. The 35 dihedral Ï angle restraints were obtained by measuring3 J NH-HÎ± coupling constants; theÏ angle restraint of â60 Â± 30Â° was used for the residues having3 J HN-HÎ± coupling constants less than 6 Hz, and that of â120 Â± 30Â° was used for the residues having 3 J HN-HÎ±constants larger than 8 Hz. Hydrogen bond distance restraints were applied between nitrogen and oxygen atoms (2.4â3.5 â«) and Hn and oxygen atoms (1.5â2.5 â«) for regular secondary structures. The hydrogen bonding was assumed for the residues 18, 27â29, 31, 34, 36, 38, 45, 47, 52, 54, and 59, which show low temperature coefficients (<4.5 ppb Kâ1). Our previously determined disulfide bond formations were also used as the distance restraints (1.Kawabata S. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Shigenaga T. Agarwala K.L. Saito T. Cho J. Nakajima H. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). All NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (18.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11566) Google Scholar) and PIPP (19.Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar), and the structure calculations were performed using simulated annealing (SA) protocol in X-PLOR 3.851 (20.BruÌnger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.851. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). An extended structure of tachycitin was used as the starting structure for calculation, whose C-terminal end is patched (1.Kawabata S. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Shigenaga T. Agarwala K.L. Saito T. Cho J. Nakajima H. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with an amide group, CONH2. The initial set of restraints included only NOE restraints, no dihedral restraints, and no hydrogen bond restraints. From this initial set of restraints, 100 structures were generated using the SA protocol with heating for 60 ps and cooling for 30 ps. Of those 100 structures, 50 structures with lower total energy were selected as starting structures for the next refinement cycles. The refinement cycles were performed using the SA protocol with heating for 30 ps and cooling for 20 ps. The 25 lowest-energy structures presented in this paper were selected from the 50 structures calculated from the final round of refinement. The program PROCHECK (21.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-290Crossref Google Scholar) reveals that for all residues, 97.3% of the backboneÏ and Ï dihedral angles fell into core and allowed regions of the Ramachandran map. The structural determination was performed (TableI) using NMR-derived 1,070 experimental restraints, on the basis of the whole assignments of the 1H resonances of tachycitin at pH 4.2 and at 30 Â°C, which were deposited to BioMagResBank with the accession number of 4290. Structure of tachycitin (Fig. 1) appears to comprise a three-stranded Î²-sheet (Î²1, Î²2, and Î²3; residues 17â19, 26â31, and 34â39) in the N-terminal region and a two-stranded Î²-sheet (Î²4 and Î²5; residues 45â47 and 52â54) following a short helical turn (Î±1; residues 56â59) in the C-terminal region. Such arrangements of the secondary structures of tachycitin are not similar to those of any other known antimicrobial peptides in invertebrates; for example, the insect defensin family consists of one long loop, one Î±-helix, and one Î²-sheet from the N terminus (22.Dimarcq J.L. Bulet P. Hetru C. Hoffmann J. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 B, a distorted Î²-sandwich structure is constructed by the three-stranded and two-stranded Î²-sheets connected through a bending loop (Cys-40âLeu-44). It appears that this bending loop involves a type III' Î²-turn contributed by the residues Pro-41âLeu-44, for which the formation of a hydrogen bond between Leu-44 HN and Pro-41 Oâ² is evidenced by low temperature coefficient of Leu-44 (3.0 ppb Kâ1). A short segment (residues His-31âLeu-34) flanked between the strands Î²2 and Î²3 constructs a Î²-turn conformation. For this Î²-turn, molecular motional restraint contributed by a disulfide bond (Cys-6âCys-33) is suggested by observations of significant line-broadening of the HN resonances for Lys-32 and Cys-33. Another segment comprising six residues (Asn-47âVal-52) flanked by strands Î²4 and Î²5 adapt a Î²-hairpin structure. In this Î²-hairpin, Asn-47 Oâ² presumably forms a hydrogen bond with the Lys-51 HN, which is supported by the extremely low temperature coefficient (2.0 ppb Kâ1) obtained for Lys-51. Overall, the structure of tachycitin is characterized by Î²-sheets flanking short loops and turns, which is typical for most of the small disulfide-rich polypeptides (23.Harrison P.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Table INMR-derived restraints and structural statistics for the 25 calculated structures of tachycitinNo. of distance restraints Total1035 Short488 Medium (2 â¤ âi â jâ â¤ 4)326 Long (âi â jâ â¥ 5)195 Hydrogen bond26Dihedral restraints (Ï)35Restraint violation Distance (>0.2 â«)0 Dihedral (>2 degrees)0RMSD (â«) Well defined regionaWell defined region includes residues 6â68.Backbone atoms (heavy atoms)1.15 Â± 0.21 (1.95 Â± 0.24) Î²-Sheet regionsbThe Î²-sheet region includes residues 17â19, 26â31, 34â39, 45â47, and 52â54.Backbone atoms (heavy atoms)0.72 Â± 0.15 (1.73 Â± 0.34)Energies (kcal/mol) F total125.93 Â± 8.75 F bonds3.92 Â± 0.76 F angles93.08 Â± 5.01 F impropers14.95 Â± 1.41 F van der Waals (Frepel)cThe force constant for the van der Waals energy calculation was 4.0 kcal molâ1 â«â4.9.52 Â± 2.84 F NOEdForce constants for the calculation of NOE and dihedral energies were 50 kcal molâ1 â«â2 and 200 kcal molâ1 radâ2, respectively.4.20 Â± 1.35 F dihedraldForce constants for the calculation of NOE and dihedral energies were 50 kcal molâ1 â«â2 and 200 kcal molâ1 radâ2, respectively.0.26 Â± 0.16RMSD from experimental restraints NOE distance restraints (â«)0.0089 Â± 0.0014 Dihedral angle restraints (degrees)0.3339 Â± 0.1036RMSD from ideal covalent geometry Bonds (â«)0.001833 Â± 0.000180 Angles (degrees)0.5424 Â± 0.0146 Impropers0.3912 Â± 0.0182Ï and Ï in core and allowed regions (%) 97.3a Well defined region includes residues 6â68.b The Î²-sheet region includes residues 17â19, 26â31, 34â39, 45â47, and 52â54.c The force constant for the van der Waals energy calculation was 4.0 kcal molâ1 â«â4.d Force constants for the calculation of NOE and dihedral energies were 50 kcal molâ1 â«â2 and 200 kcal molâ1 radâ2, respectively. Open table in a new tab It was revealed that tachycitin shares a remarkable local structural similarity with a plant chitin-binding protein named hevein. Comparison between our determined structure of tachycitin (Fig.2 A) and a previously reported structure of hevein (9.Andersen N.H. Cao B. Rodriguez-Romero A. Arreguin B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1407-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B) clearly shows that an antiparallel Î²-sheet (colored in blue) and a helical turn (colored in red) are constructed in both proteins in highly similar manners. In addition, formation of a disulfide bridge (between Cys-40 and Cys-53) connecting the middle of Î²5 and the C terminus of Î²3 for tachycitin (colored in green, Fig. 2 A) is similarly identified in hevein (Fig. 2 B). The structural similarity further includes the loop regions, e.g. a hairpin loop structure involved in the antiparallel Î²-sheet (colored in orange). It should be noted that the hairpin loop of tachycitin (Asn-47âVal-52) comprises six residues with Î²Î±Î±Î³Î±LÎ² conformation whereas the corresponding loop of hevein comprises five residues with Î²Î±Î³Î±LÎ² conformation. Kawabata et al. (1.Kawabata S. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Shigenaga T. Agarwala K.L. Saito T. Cho J. Nakajima H. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) reported that the N-terminal 5â28 region of tachycitin shows sequence similarity with the N-terminal 2â21 region of hevein. However, such similarity is not identified by the present study; the secondary structural arrangement, as well as the disulfide-bond patterns, appears to be quite different for the suggested regions. The structural similarity between segment Cys-40âGly-60 of tachycitin and segment Cys-12âSer-32 of hevein, both comprising the antiparallel Î²-sheet (Î²4 and Î²5), was examined by looking at the superimpositions of the segments (Fig.3). The structural motif shown in Fig. 3has been found in several plant chitin-binding proteins (10.Martins J.C. Maes D. Loris R. Pepermans H.A. Wyns L. Willem R. Verheyden P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11.Wright C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12.Weaver J.L. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig.4). For hevein, segment Cys-12âSer-32 was identified as an essential chitin-binding domain (24.Asensio J.L. Canada F.J. Bruix M. Rodriguez-Romero A. Jimenez-Barbero J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 621-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It appears that arrangements of the two structural motifs shown in Fig. 3 are significantly consistent with each other (backbone RMSD = â¼1.5 â«). The aromatic side-chain groups of Trp-21 and Trp-23 of hevein (Fig. 3) are known to bind specifically to chitin-derived oligosaccharides through hydrophobic interactions (24.Asensio J.L. Canada F.J. Bruix M. Rodriguez-Romero A. Jimenez-Barbero J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 621-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25.Asensio J.L. Canada F.J. Bruix M. Gonzalez C. Khiar N. Rodriguez-Romero A. Jimenez-Barbero J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This binding is further strengthened by a hydrogen bonding with Ser-19 of hevein (25.Asensio J.L. Canada F.J. Bruix M. Gonzalez C. Khiar N. Rodriguez-Romero A. Jimenez-Barbero J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the residues of Asn-47, Tyr-49, and Val-52 of tachycitin are located at perfectly corresponding positions to the residues of Ser-19, Trp-21, and Trp-23 of hevein. Therefore, one could assume that the region shown in Fig. 3 comprising an antiparallel Î²-sheet and a helical turn (Î²4, Î²5, and Î±1; Fig. 2 A) in the C-domain of tachycitin serves as an essential chitin-binding site, which protrudes the side-chains of the putative functional residues, Asn-47, Tyr-49, and Val-52. Overall, it could be assumed that the N-terminal region comprising Î²1âÎ²3 of tachycitin (colored in gray in Fig.2 A) behaves as a stable domain so as to locate the C-terminal domain chitin-binding site proper for its function.Figure 43D structure-based sequence alignment of several chitin-binding proteins in invertebrates and plants with regard to the region corresponding to Cys-40âGly-60 of tachycitin.Invertebrates are as follows: T. tridentatustachycitin (Tachycitin), Anopheles gambiaechitinase (Ag-chit) (14.Shen Z.

Residue numbers for each segment are indicated in parentheses. Amino acids conserved between invertebrate and plant proteins are indicated with bold letters.

The 3D structural information has been available for the plant chitin-binding proteins (9.Andersen N.H. Cao B. Rodriguez-Romero A. Arreguin B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1407-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 10.Martins J.C. Maes D. Loris R. Pepermans H.A. Wyns L. Willem R. Verheyden P. J. Mol.

The information is now available for only tachycitin among the invertebrate chitin-binding proteins. It appears that the residues of Cys, Pro, and Gly, all of which have significant influence on the structural constructions, are well conserved in the chitin-binding proteins listed in Fig. 4. Conservation of polar and hydrophobic residues is further identified for the putative chitin-binding residues (e.g. Asn-47, Tyr-49, and Val-52 for tachycitin). For all plant chitin-binding proteins, the 21-residues segments listed in Fig. 4 appear to construct a closely similar 3D structure (9.Andersen N.H. Cao B. Rodriguez-Romero A. Arreguin B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1407-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 10.Martins J.C. Maes D. Loris R. Pepermans H.A. Wyns L. Willem R. Verheyden P. J. Mol.

Biol. 1990; 215: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) to the putative chitin-binding site of tachycitin. Further similarity in primary sequence identified between tachycitin, Ag-chit, Pj-chit1, Ch-chit, Peritrophin-44, and Tn-IM (nomenclatures described in the figure legend) assumes that these segments of the invertebrate chitin-binding proteins commonly comprise the chitin-binding structural motif as identified in tachycitin. In 1999, Shen and Jacobs-Lorena (17.Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) proposed a hypothesis that chitin-binding proteins in invertebrates and plants are correlated by a rare evolutional process, convergent evolution. Our present structural determination of tachycitin and the 3D structure-based sequence alignment are thought to provide faithful evidences for the proposed idea of the convergent evolution relationship between invertebrate and plant chitin-binding proteins. We are grateful to Shin-ya Ohki, Nobuyuki Matsuki, and Nobuaki Nemoto for help with NMR measurements and Ai Miura for keeping the NMR spectrometer at the optimum performance level."

The aim of this study was to determine whether tea polyphenols have inhibitory effects on androgen action in an androgen-responsive, prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. The tea polyphenol, EGCG, inhibited LNCaP cell growth and the expression of androgen regulated PSA and hK2 genes. Moreover, EGCG had a significant inhibitory effect on the androgenic inducibility of the PSA promoter. Immunoblotting detected a decrease in androgen receptor protein with treatments of the tea polyphenols EGCG, GCG and theaflavins. Northern blot analysis showed decreased levels of androgen receptor mRNA by EGCG. Transient transfections demonstrated that EGCG and theaflavins could repress the transcriptional activities of the androgen receptor promoter region. An Sp1 binding site in the androgen receptor gene promoter is an important regulatory component for its expression. This study suggests Sp1 is the target for the tea polyphenols because treatments of EGCG decreased the expression, DNA binding activity and transactivation activity of Sp1 protein. In conclusion, we have described a new property of tea polyphenols that inhibits androgen action by repressing the transcription of the androgen receptor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2072997843,"The ability of ethanol and arachidonic acid (AA), as inducers of oxidative stress and key factors in alcoholic liver disease, to up-regulate alpha 2 collagen type I (COL1A2) gene expression was studied in a hepatic stellate cell line overexpressing the ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) (E5 cells). A time- and dose-dependent induction in COL1A2 mRNA by ethanol or AA was observed that was prevented by diallylsulfide, a CYP2E1 inhibitor. Nuclear run-on experiments showed transcriptional activation of the COL1A2 gene by ethanol and AA. Catalase abrogated the increase in COL1A2 mRNA suggesting an H2O2-dependent mechanism. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels and production of prostaglandin E2 upon addition of AA were elevated in the E5 cells. Incubation with NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor, blocked the effect of AA, but not of ethanol, on COL1A2 expression suggesting that CYP2E1 activates COX-2 expression, and the oxidation of AA by COX-2 is responsible for the increase in COL1A2. Activity of a reporter construct driven by â378 base pairs of the proximal promoter region of the COL1A2 gene increased in E5 but not control cells and was further increased by ethanol or AA.

Histol. Histopathol. 1997; 12: 1069-1080PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of collagen type I gene expression is a key component of increased fibrogenesis by stellate cells (2.Lang A. Brenner D.A. Ital. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 173-179PubMed Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation have emerged as important stimuli to collagen gene induction in HSCs (3.Casini A. Ceni E. Salzano R. Biondi P. Parola M. Galli A. Foschi M. Caligiuri A. Pinzani M. Surrenti C. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). CYP2E1 is an important source of reactive oxygen species in alcohol-induced liver injury and fibrosis, generating superoxide (O2Â·â) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (4.Gorsky L.D. Koop D.R. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6812-6817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ekstrom G. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem.

Biophys. 1993; 300: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To examine the role of intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species in inducing the expression of COL1A2, we previously established an HSC line that overexpresses CYP2E1 and found, in the absence of exogenous substrate, a 3.5- to 4-fold increase in COL1A2 mRNA compared with control cells (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This increase was related to CYP2E1-derived reactive oxygen species, because it was prevented by antioxidants (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this study, we hypothesized that ethanol could further increase COL1A2 mRNA by a CYP2E1-dependent mechanism, because 1) CYP2E1 metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde (8.Lieber C.S. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 77: 517-544Crossref Scopus (772) Google Scholar) or reactive radical species such as the 1-hydroxyethyl radical (9.Albano E. French S.W. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D533-D540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 2) ethanol elevates CYP2E1 levels by increasing the stability of the protein (10.Song B.J. Gelboin H.V. Park S.S. Yang C.S. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16689-16697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Koop D.R. Tierney D.J. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In addition to effects of ethanol metabolism, recent evidence implicates dietary fat as contributing to the severity of alcoholic liver disease. In animal models, for example, diets containing saturated fatty acids protect against alcohol-induced liver injury, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids enhance the toxic potential of ethanol as measured by fatty liver, inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis (12.Tsukamoto H. Matsuoka M. French S. Semin. Liver Dis. 1990; 10: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, saturated dietary fat combined with ethanol diminishes lipid peroxidation, the activity of CYP2E1, and the synthesis of vasoactive and inflammatory eicosanoids by cyclooxygenase (COX) (13.Nanji A.A. French S.W. Life Sci. 1989; 44: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14.Nanji A.A. Griniuviene B. Sadrzadeh S.M.H. Levitsky S. McCully J.D. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 736-744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid are a requirement for the development of alcoholic liver disease; the conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid (AA) and its subsequent metabolism may play an integral role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (13.Nanji A.A. French S.W. Life Sci. 1989; 44: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14.Nanji A.A. Griniuviene B. Sadrzadeh S.M.H. Levitsky S. McCully J.D. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 736-744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AA, as a component of cell membranes, is a target for autoxidation and it is susceptible to lipid peroxidation (13.Nanji A.A. French S.W. Life Sci. 1989; 44: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14.Nanji A.A. Griniuviene B. Sadrzadeh S.M.H. Levitsky S. McCully J.D. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 736-744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and lipid peroxidation-derived products such as malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal can increase collagen expression (15.Bedossa P. Houglum K. Trautwein C. Holstege A. Chojkier M. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 1262-1271PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture models have been developed to explore the relationships between ethanol, AA, and CYP2E1 in mediating liver cell injury by oxidant stress. By overexpressing CYP2E1 in HepG2 cells, for example, AA can lead to oxidant stress-dependent toxicity (16.Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14532-14541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To date, however, no studies have explored the impact on fibrogenesis of oxidant stress generated by metabolism of ethanol or AA by CYP2E1. In this work, the oxidant stress derived from metabolism of ethanol or AA in CYP2E1-expressing HSC was found to be directly fibrogenic. Mechanistic studies reveal a critical role for H2O2 in the up-regulation of COL1A2expression by ethanol and AA; moreover, COX-2 mediates the AA-mediated induction of COL1A2 expression. This study employed a rat stellate cell line (HSC-T6) (17.Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.-G. Lalazar A. Theiss G. Kim S.-J. Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33750-33758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The cells contain intracellular filaments typical of primary HSCs, express desmin, alpha smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, take up and esterify retinol and retinol-binding protein, and are otherwise similar to primary stellate cells (17.Kim Y.

A stable cell line that overexpresses CYP2E1 (E5), as well as stable cell lines transfected with either the empty vector pCI-neo (D21) or CYP2E1 in the antisense orientation (F11), were previously established (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 Î¼g/ml of streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.5 mg/ml of G-418 in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. The amount of fetal bovine serum was reduced to 5% following transfections and/or when cells were incubated with ethanol or AA. Cell viability assays were performed for each treatment using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay as described previously (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (18.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter DNA constructs containing upstream sequences of theCOL1A2 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene were provided by Dr. Francesco Ramirez (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) (19.Boast S. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these constructs,COL1A2 sequences span from â3500 to +58 base pairs (â3500COL1A2-CAT), from â772 to +58 base pairs (â772COL1A2-CAT), or from â378 to +58 base pairs (â378COL1A2-CAT) (19.Boast S. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel transfections of the corresponding empty vector pEMBL8-CATat equivalent concentrations were performed in all experiments. Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared by the alkaline lysis method using the EndoFreeTM Maxiprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) followed by double CsCl-ethidium bromide gradient centrifugation (20.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized 16 h prior to transfection and seeded at a density of 2.5 Ã 105 cells per 10-cm dish. Fresh medium was added 2 h before the transfection. Complexes containing FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) plus plasmid DNA were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions with a final concentration of plasmid DNA for each of the chimeric COL1A2DNA constructs of 0.5 Î¼g/ml. Parallel co-transfections with 0.01 Î¼g/ml of the control pRL-null and TK-luciferase vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) containing the cDNA encoding the Renilla or firefly luciferase enzymes were performed in all the experiments to normalize for the transfection efficiency. The cells were incubated in the presence of the transfection mix for 6 h, after which the media was replaced. Two h later, 50 mm ethanol or 20 Î¼m AA were added to some of the cells. Cells treated with ethanol (and controls) were incubated in parafilm-sealed plates. After overnight incubation, a second dose of ethanol or AA was added. CAT activity was determined 48 h after the transfection using a commercial kit (Promega). An extract of cytosolic protein (0.2 or 10 Î¼g) obtained by three cycles of freeze-thawing in 0.25 mTris buffer, pH 7.5, was used in each assay, and the CAT reaction was carried out for either 6 min or 1 h. After extraction with ethyl acetate, the samples were loaded onto TLC plates, and the acetylated chloramphenicol was separated from the remaining chloramphenicol by liquid chromatography in chloroform:methanol (97:3). The intensity of the signal was detected using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA) and quantified using Image Quant software. Luciferase activity was assessed using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Final values were corrected by protein and by the efficiency of transfection and expressed as a percentage of acetylation of chloramphenicol. The intracellular amount of H2O2 and lipid peroxidation produced in the presence of ethanol or AA was detected by the 2â², 7â²-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) method and by the peroxidative degradation of cis-parinaric acid, respectively, according to published protocols (21.Carter W.O.

Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). 5 Î¼g of RNA were electrophoresed under denaturing conditions in 0.9% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred onto nylon membranes, and hybridized to random-primed 32P-labeled complementary DNA (cDNA) probes as described previously (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The probes used were a cDNA clone, Hf1131, coding for COL1A2(23.Myers J.C. Dickson L.A. de Wet W.J. Bernard M.P. Chu M.L. Di Liberto M. Pepe G. Sangiorgi F.O. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10128-10135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an S14 ribosomal protein cDNA clone purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). To determine the rate of COL1A2 transcription after ethanol or AA treatment, nuclear run-on assays were carried out as described previously (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The labeled nuclear RNAs were purified and hybridized to 8 Î¼g of each cDNA fragment that had been immobilized onto a nylon membrane. This amount of cDNA was calculated to represent a large excess over the amount of transcribed mRNA. Quantitative comparison of the intensity of the signal scanned in the Phosphorimager was performed using Image Quant software, and values were corrected using the S14 ribosomal protein signal as a control. Western Blot Analysis was performed with 30 Î¼g of total cell protein according to already published protocols (24.Zhang F. Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2424-2428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) using rabbit polyclonal anti-COX-2 antiserum (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI) as the primary antibody and IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody. The levels of prostaglandin E2 released to the medium by the D21 and E5 cells incubated in the presence or absence of 10 Î¼m AA for 30 min were determined using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Harbor, MI) as described previously (24.Zhang F. Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2424-2428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Production of prostaglandin E2 was normalized to total cell protein concentration. Results refer to mean Â± S.E. and are average values from three to six values per experiment; experiments were repeated at least twice. Comparisons among groups were made using the Student's t test. To evaluate the effect of ethanol and AA on collagen expression under oxidative stress conditions, HSC-T6 (17.Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.-G. Lalazar A. Theiss G. Kim S.-J. Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33750-33758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) cells were transfected with the humanCYP2E1 cDNA in the sense and antisense orientation as well as with the empty vector (pCI-neo), and stable cell lines referred to as E5, F11, and D21 cells, respectively, were developed (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The clone expressing the highest level of CYP2E1 (E5 cells) was used in all the experiments described below. CYP2E1 expression was validated before each experiment by assaying for p-nitrophenol oxidation and by Western blot using human liver microsomes as a positive control. To evaluate for toxicity, 15 Ã 103 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates and incubated overnight. In some wells, 25, 50, or 100 mm ethanol or 10, 20, or 30 Î¼m AA was added to the culture medium for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h, and the viability after each treatment was assessed by the MTT assay. The average values of cells grown in regular medium were considered as the 100% viability; no toxicity greater than 10% was observed in any of the ethanol or AA treatments at any of the indicated time or dose points (data not shown). Ethanol induction of CYP2E1 may contribute to the generation of a state of intracellular oxidant stress in the liver (25.Nordmann R. Ribiere C. Rouach H. Free Radic. Biol.

Endogenous production of reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 was monitored by the increase in the green fluorescence spectrum of dichlorofluorescein, a product of the de-esterification of DCF-DA and oxidation of dichlorodihydrofluorescin. Ethanol treatment of E5 cells increased H2O2 production by 30% when compared with the control group (p < 0.05), whereas no significant changes were observed in the presence of AA (Fig.1 A). Several studies have emphasized the important role of CYP2E1 in the enhanced microsomal lipid peroxidation after chronic ethanol consumption (26.Castillo T. Koop D.R. Kamimura S. Triadafilopoulos G. Tsukamoto H. Hepatology. 1992; 16: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 27.Niemela O. Parkkila S. Pasanen M. Ismuro Y. Bradford B. Thurman R.G. Alcohol. Clin. Exp.

Med. 1998; 46: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the levels of lipid peroxidation in the E5 cells incubated in the presence or absence of ethanol or AA was evaluated by studying the quenching of fluorescence of cis-parinaric acid. A 15% increase in the peroxidative degradation of cis-parinaric acid was detected in the presence of AA when compared with the non-treated cells (p < 0.05, Fig. 1 B). Ethanol did not promote lipid peroxidation, although it did increase H2O2 production. The E5 cells, in the absence of ethanol or AA, were previously shown to display high rates of reactive oxygen production compared with the D21 and F11 cells (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hence, the modest effects of ethanol or AA occur in cells already producing high levels of reactive oxygen species. We previously demonstrated that overexpression of CYP2E1 in HSC increased COL1A2 mRNA levels even in the absence of any added substrate (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether ethanol and AA could further increase COL1A2 mRNA levels, time course and dose-response experiments were carried out. Northern blots were performed in the presence or absence of 25, 50, and 100 mm ethanol or 10, 20, and 30 Î¼m AA, and mRNA levels were quantified as the ratio of COL1A2:s14 (Fig.2, A and C). COL1A2 mRNA did not change with any of the treatments in the D21 or F11 cells; the COL1A2:s14 ratio for the untreated D21 cells was assigned a value of 1. As described previously (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the E5 cells had a 3.5- to 4-fold increase of COL1A2 mRNA levels over values for the D21 or F11 cells. When E5 cells were treated with 25, 50, and 100 mm ethanol for 24 h there was a further increase in the COL1A2 mRNA levels (Fig. 2 A). After incubation for 24 h with 50 mm ethanol, there was a 2-fold increase in COL1A2 mRNA. Similarly, AA had no effect on COL1A2 mRNA levels in the D21 or F11 cells but produced a concentration-dependent increase in E5 cells (Fig.2 C). Incubation for 24 h with 20 Î¼m AA produced a 2-fold increase in COL1A2 mRNA expression. To study the effect of the time of incubation, cells were treated with 50 mm ethanol and 20 Î¼m AA for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. Time-dependent increases of COL1A2 mRNA levels by ethanol or AA were only observed in HSC where CYP2E1 was overexpressed (Fig. 2, B and D). COL1A2 mRNA expression was increased about 8-fold at 24 h with ethanol and AA treatment in the E5 cells compared with the D21 cells. Because ethanol or AA induced no measurable changes in COL1A2 mRNA levels at any time or dose in the D21 or F11 cells, subsequent experiments described below were carried out only in E5 cells. As described above, ethanol treatment increased H2O2 production, whereas AA treatment produced a modest increase in lipid peroxidation in E5 cells; increases in reactive oxygen species production by CYP2E1 metabolism of ethanol or AA were likely to be responsible for the increase of COL1A2 mRNA. To evaluate whether antioxidants prevented the induction of collagen mRNA, dose-response curves were performed by preincubating the cells for 6 h prior to 50 mm ethanol or 20 Î¼m AA treatment in the presence or absence of antioxidants. Catalase led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of COL1A2 mRNA levels in the E5 cells (Fig.3 A). Catalase also prevented the increase in COL1A2 mRNA produced by ethanol or by AA, whereas catalase inactivated by boiling had no effect (Fig. 3 A). Vitamin E is the principal lipid-soluble antioxidant in biological tissues and is widely used to prevent the onset of cell damage consequent to the induction of lipid peroxidation (32.Pratico D. Iuliano L. Basili S. Ferro D. Camastra C. Cordova C. Fitzgerald G.A. Violi F. J. Investig. Med. 1998; 46: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar). However, vitamin E did not affect the stimulation of COL1A2 mRNA by ethanol (Fig. 3 B), which is consistent with the lack of increase in lipid peroxidation by ethanol (Fig. 1 B). To our surprise, vitamin E did not prevent or decrease the stimulation of COL1A2 mRNA by AA (Fig. 3 B). Trolox, a synthetic vitamin E analogue, also did not prevent the increase in COL1A2 mRNA by AA (data not shown). N-t-butyl-Î±-phenyl-nitrone (PBN), a spin-trapping reagent that reacts with many radicals, including superoxide, hydroxyl, lipid, and 1-hydroxyethyl radicals (33.Thomas C.E. Ohlweiler D.F. Carr A.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3097-3104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), produced a concentration-dependent decrease in COL1A2 mRNA levels in the E5 cells and completely prevented the increase by AA (Fig. 3 C). Ebselen, a seleno-organic drug with anti-inflammatory properties that mimics the glutathione peroxidase reaction (34.MuÌller A. Cadenas E. Graf P. Sies H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3235-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), as well as the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase reaction (35.Maiorino M. Roveri A. Coassin M. Ursini F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), lowered COL1A2 mRNA levels in the E5 cells (higher concentrations than 25 Î¼m were toxic to the cells and could not be studied) and completely prevented the increase by AA (Fig. 3 C) (these concentrations of PBN and ebselen were not toxic). To confirm that the effect of both ethanol and AA on COL1A2 mRNA in the E5 cells is mediated by CYP2E1, cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of 1 mm DAS (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) 12 h before the addition of ethanol or AA. Cells were further incubated for 24 h, and COL1A2 mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. DAS, an effective inhibitor of CYP2E1 (36.Brady J.F. Ishizaki H. Fukuto J.M. Lin M.C. Fadel A. Gaspae J.M. Yang C.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 642-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), reduced the COL1A2 mRNA levels in the E5 cells and completely abolished the increase in COL1A2 mRNA produced by ethanol or AA (Fig. 4). These data indicate that CYP2E1 plays a role in the enhanced COL1A2 expression in the E5 cells and in the further increase produced by either ethanol or AA. To determine the mechanisms responsible for the increase in COL1A2 mRNA by ethanol or AA, nuclear run-on experiments were performed with nuclei isolated from the E5 cells. The rate of transcription of the collagen gene was compared with that of theS14 ribosomal protein gene as a control. Equal amounts (106 cpm/ml) of nascent transcripts of nuclei from cells treated in the presence or absence of ethanol or AA were hybridized to cDNAs immobilized onto nylon membranes. Cells incubated with ethanol or AA had a transcriptional rate of the (COL1A2 gene that was 75 or 100% greater than that of the non-treated cells (Fig.5 A) (p < 0.001). These increases are similar to the increased level of COL1A2 mRNA produced by ethanol or AA (about 2-fold). Previous observations demonstrated that the CYP2E1-dependent increase in COL1A2 mRNA levels, in the absence of any added substrate, involved both transcriptional activation of the COL1A2gene and stabilization of the mRNA (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To further validate that the increased COL1A2 mRNA produced by ethanol or AA was due to increased synthesis of the mRNA, the effect of actinomycin D was evaluated. Previous studies of mRNA stability (7.Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Greenwel P. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) showed that at 24 h, COL1A2 mRNA decayed by 50% in the D21 cells, whereas no degradation was observed in the E5 cells, consistent with increased mRNA stability. When E5 cells were preincubated with 10 Î¼g/ml of actinomycin D for 2 h prior to ethanol or AA treatment, no increases in mRNA levels were observed when compared with the non-treated E5 cells (Fig. 5 B); thus, actinomycin D blocked the increase in COL1A2 mRNA produced by ethanol or AA. To confirm that actinomycin D had indeed blocked transcription, the same membrane was reprobed for S14 ribosomal protein, which has a half-life of about 3 h; as expected, this mRNA could not be detected in cells incubated with actinomycin D for 24 h (data not shown). The addition of actinomycin D did not change the mRNA level of the untreated E5 cells, consistent with the stabilization of COL1A2 mRNA found in these cells. Thus, the nuclear run-on and actinomycin D results collectively suggest that the effect of ethanol and AA on COL1A2 mRNA expression in the E5 cells involves transcriptional activation and new mRNA synthesis. Because only a small increase in lipid peroxidation was observed after AA treatment in the E5 cel"

In an attempt to isolate B-MYB-regulated genes that may explain the role of B-MYB in cellular processes, representational difference analysis was performed in neuroblastoma cell lines with different levels of B-MYB expression. One of the genes, the mRNA levels of which were enhanced in B-MYB expressing cells, was ApoJ/ClusterinSGP-2/TRMP-2 (ApoJ/Clusterin), previously implicated in regulation of apoptosis and tumor progression. Here we show that the human ApoJ/Clusterin gene contains a Myb binding site in its 5â² flanking region, which interacts with bacterially synthesized B-MYB protein and mediates B-MYB-dependent transactivation of the ApoJ/Clusterin promoter in transient transfection assays. Endogenous ApoJ/Clusterin expression is induced in mammalian cell lines following transient transfection of a B-MYB cDNA. Blockage of secreted clusterin by a monoclonal antibody results in increased apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells exposed to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Thus, activation of ApoJ/Clusterin by B-MYB may be an important step in the regulation of apoptosis in normal and diseased cells.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Whereas c-MYB and A-MYB play important roles in many cellular processes and in development in a tissue specific manner, B-MYB is thought to have a general role in cellular proliferation and differentiation (2.Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3.Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 109-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, whereas c-MYB and A-MYB transactivate promoters containing the Myb consensus sequence in different cell systems, the activity of B-MYB appears to be regulated by cell-type specific factors (4.Tashiro S. Takemoto Y. Handa H. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1699-1707PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous B-MYB protein is phosphorylated at the onset of DNA synthesis by cyclin A/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 kinase (5.Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R. Mann D. Marias R. Watson R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1855-1864PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, several laboratories have demonstrated that B-MYB transactivating potential correlates with phosphorylation induced by the cyclin A/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 kinase complex (6.Ansieau S. Kowentz-Leutz E. Dechend R. Leutz A. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7.Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R.J.

Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J. Khalil K. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

B-MYB expression has been detected in all cell lines analyzed so far and is regulated at the G1/S border of the cell cycle (11.Reiss K. Travali S. Calabretta B. Baserga R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12.Lam E.W.-F. Robinson C. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1885-1890PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Watson R.J. Robinson C. Lam E.-W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In vivo, B-MYB expression is detected only in proliferating tissues of the developing mouse (14.Sitzmann J. Noben-Trauth K. Kamano H. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1889-1894PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with studies showing that transcription of the B-MYB gene is growth-regulated through an E2F site located in its promoter (15.Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma family members p107 and p130, which are associated with E2F4, are involved in B-MYB promoter silencing during the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (16.Hurford R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.-H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 17.Zwicker J. Liu N. Engeland K. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. Science. 1996; 271: 1595-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). De-repression of the E2F site leading to B-MYB gene transcription at the G1/S border of the cell cycle is linked to the disappearance of an Rb/E2F complex from the B-MYB promoter (17.Zwicker J. Liu N. Engeland K. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. Science. 1996; 271: 1595-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with a model in which regulation of B-MYB expression is achieved through repression of transcription during the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, coupled to cyclin-dependent phosphorylation of B-MYB protein during S phase. This concerted regulation suggests that B-MYB activity is restricted to the phase of DNA synthesis, in accord with experiments showing that ectopic expression of a B-MYB transgene in T98G glioblastoma cells results in S phase accumulation of cells, but not in a shortened G1 phase (18.Sala A. Casella I. Bellon T. Calabretta B. Watson R.J. Peschle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9363-9367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Ablation of endogenous levels of B-MYB protein by means of the antisense techniques causes block of cellular proliferation and/or survival of normal and transformed cell lines, consistent with a function in cell cycle progression (19.Arsura M.

Overall, the existing experimental evidence suggests that B-MYB is a gene required for cell cycle progression that may be involved in tumorigenesis. In this regard, serial analysis of gene expression in non-small cell lung cancer biopsies has shown that B-MYB is overexpressed in primary tumors, as compared with normal tissue (23.Hibi K. Liu Q. Beaudry G.A. Madden S.L. Westra W.H. Wehage S.L. Yang S.C. Heitmiller R.F. Bertelsen A.H. Sidransky D. Jen J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5690-5694PubMed Google Scholar). Exogenous B-MYB expression blocks differentiation and prevents the arrest of cell proliferation imposed by differentiative agents in the M1 and LAN-5 murine myeloid and human neuroblastoma cell lines, respectively (22.RaschellaÌ G. Negroni A. Sala A. Pucci S. Romeo A. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8540-8545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24.Bies J. Hoffman B. Amanullah A. Giese T. Wolff L. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 355-363PubMed Google Scholar). This may be particularly important in the light of recent data showing that expression of B-MYB, but not of A-MYB or c-MYB, in tumor biopsies of children affected by neuroblastoma correlates with poor survival (25.RaschellaÌ G. Cesi V. Amendola R. Negroni A. Tanno B. Altavista P. Tonini G.P. DeBernardi B. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3365-3368PubMed Google Scholar). Like other factors promoting cell cycle progression, B-MYB is subjected to negative control by growth suppressors. p107, a member of the retinoblastoma family, inhibits B-MYB transactivating activity and p107/B-MYB complexes are co-immunoprecipitated from human leukemic cell lines (26.Sala A. Watson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Also, B-MYB can rescue the G1arrest imposed by the tumor suppressor gene p53 (21.Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L. Sala A. Travali S. Apella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because B-MYB is a transcriptional activator, we reasoned that its function in normal and transformed cells might be mediated by downstream effector genes. Myb target genes, such as MIM-1 and TOM-1, are involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation (27.Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 28.Burk O. Worpenberg S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) but are not likely to be the mediators of B-MYB effects in nonhematopoietic cells. To identify genes that may be directly transactivated by B-MYB, we used a LAN-5 cell line stably transfected with B-MYB (LAN-5 B-MYB), previously shown to be refractory to the differentiation-inducing effects of retinoic acid (22.RaschellaÌ G. Negroni A. Sala A. Pucci S. Romeo A. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8540-8545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Representational difference analysis (RDA)1 of the LAN-5 B-MYB cell line revealed that several genes were differentially expressed in comparison to the parental cell line. We focused our interest on the ApoJ/Clusterin gene, which encodes a sulfated glycoprotein initially thought to be associated with apoptotic cell death but later shown to be expressed by apoptosis-resistant cells (reviewed in Ref. 29.Koch-Brandt C. Morgans C. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1996; 16: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and to be required for survival of cells treated with tumor necrosis factor Î± or subjected to oxidative stress (30.Sintich S.M.

Expression of ApoJ/Clusterin is also activated during carcinogenesis induced by N-nitroso-N-methylurea and dysplastic growth of rat prostate or during progression of prostate cancer in humans (34.Kadomatsu K.

The results presented in this study provide evidence that the ApoJ/Clusterin gene is a direct downstream target of the transcription factor B-MYB and that its expression is required for resistance to apoptotic cell death induced by the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. The neuroblastoma cell line LAN-5 and the B-MYB-transfected LAN-5 clone (LAN-5-B-MYB) (22.RaschellaÌ G. Negroni A. Sala A. Pucci S. Romeo A. Calabretta B. J. Biol.

The SAOS2 and COS-7 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15 and 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. For cell death assay, LAN-5 or LAN-B-MYB cells were cultured with or without 0.5 Î¼g/ml of doxorubicin in 96-well plates in the presence of 40 Î¼g/ml ApoJ monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or control antibody (c-myb monoclonal IgG; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). After 24 h of culture, cell death was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The pGL-ApoJ/Clusterin promoter plasmid was obtained as follows: a fragment of the human ApoJ/Clusterin promoter from nucleotide â4 to nucleotide â300, starting from the origin of transcription, was obtained by PCR. Restriction sites forXhoI and HindIII were introduced in the 5â² and 3â² primers, respectively, to facilitate cloning. After digestion withXhoI and HindIII, the PCR fragment was ligated to the PGL-basic vector (Promega) that had been digested withXhoI and HindIII. The pGL-ApoJ/Clusterin(mutant) promoter plasmid was obtained by introducing a 3-nucleotide mutation in the putative Myb sequence in the forward primer (wild-type, GGGCTAACCG; mutant, GGGTTTTCCG). Correct orientation and sequence of the ApoJ/Clusterin promoter plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. CMV-B-MYB is described in Ref. 21.Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L.

To obtain a construct producing a GST-B-MYB fusion protein, anEcoRI-BamHI fragment containing the B-MYB DNA-binding domain was released from the SK-B-MYB vector (20.Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and ligated to theEcoRI/BamHI-digested pGEX2T plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the analysis, we followed an improved RDA procedure (a detailed protocol was kindly provided by Michael O'Neill, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), which introduces a high performance liquid chromatography purification step of primers/adaptors and requires reduced amounts of starting RNA (37.O'Neill M.J. Sinclair A.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2681-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This method allows the obtainment of well isolated bands in difference product 2 (DP2), so that a third round of subtraction/amplification is generally not required. In brief, 10 Î¼g of total cellular RNA was extracted from LAN-5 or LAN-5 B-MYB cells with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ mRNA was obtained by flow of total RNA through an oligo-dT push-column (Stratagene). 200 ng of poly(A)+ RNAs was transcribed into cDNA with the aid of a cDNA-construction kit, following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 300 ng of TESTER amplicon (LAN-5 B-MYB) and 30 Î¼g of DRIVER amplicon (LAN-5) were subjected to one round of hybridization/PCR to obtain DP1. A 1:400 ratio of TESTER/DRIVER amplicons (63 ng/25 Î¼g) was used in the second hybridization/PCR step to obtain DP2. DP2 products digested withDpnII were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, eluted from the gel, subcloned into the BamHI-linearized pBluescript plasmid, and sequenced. GST-B-MYB protein was produced in vitro from pGEXB-MYB-transformed bacterial cultures grown for 2 h in LB medium containing 0.1 mm IPTG. GST or GST-B-MYB protein was mixed to the glutathione-Sepharose resin and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the purified proteins were eluted from the resin with free glutathione. Double-stranded oligonucleotides from the MIM-1 (TCGACACATTATAACGGTTTTTTAGC) or the ApoJ/Clusterin (AGACAGCCGGGCTAACCGCGTGAGAGG) promoters and including the underlined Myb consensus sequence were labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [Î³-32P]ATP and used as probes for gel shift experiments. In brief, 300 ng of fusion proteins was mixed at room temperature for 20 min with the different probes in a binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol, and 3 Î¼g of poly(dI-dC). At the end of the incubation period, the samples were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5Ã TBE buffer and run in 0.5Ã TBE for 2 h at 200 mV. Total RNA (500 ng) from LAN-5 and LAN-5-B-myb cell lines was reverse transcribed for 45 min at 40 Â°C in the presence of 2 Î¼m random hexamers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.8 mm dNTPs in 1Ã reverse transcriptase buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a total volume of 50 Î¼l. PCR mixtures were prepared using 5 Î¼l of the reverse transcriptase mixture in 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mmKCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.4 Î¼m upstream primer, 0.4 Î¼m downstream primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs and 2 units of Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Ltd., Otsu, Shiga, Japan) in a total volume of 50 Î¼l. PCR conditions were as follows: 1 min at 94 Â°C, 1 min at 50 Â°C, and 1 min at 72 Â°C for 20, 25, 30, or 35 cycles to set the appropriate conditions for linearity. 30 PCR cycles were then used for detection of ApoJ-1 transcripts, whereas 25 cycles were utilized to detect Î²-actin. A final extension step of 7 min at 72 Â°C was carried out in each case. 15 Î¼l of each PCR product was run on a 1% agarose gel in 1Ã TBE and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The filter was hybridized to a ApoJ-1-specific or to a Î²-actin-specific 5â² end-labeled oligonucleotide probe (specific activity, 5 Ã 108 cpm/Î¼g; concentration in the hybridization mixture, 1 Ã 106 cpm/ml), representing an internal portion of the amplified product at 45 Â°C in 5Ã SSC, 100 Î¼g/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA for 16 h. Washings were carried out in 2Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and for 30 min in the same buffer at 50 Â°C. The filter was exposed to an x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) in the presence of an intensifier screen for 3 h at â80 Â°C. Primers and probes were as follows. ApoJ-1: upstream primer, 5â²GTGCAATGAGACCATGATGG3â²; downstream primer, 5â²CAGGTAGTGGTAGGTATCCT3â²; probe, 5â²AGCATCATAGACGAGCTCTT3â². Î²-Actin: upstream primer, 5â²TCATCACCATTGGCAATGAG3â²; downstream primer, 5â²CACTGTGTTGGCGTACAGGT3â²; probe, 5â²ATGGAGTCCTGTGGCATCCACGAA3â². SAOS2 or LAN-5 cells were transfected according to the calcium phosphate precipitation method. 1 Î¼g of each plasmid was used in 30-mm wells; after 36 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was monitored with a luciferase assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Because B-MYB can significantly modulate the activity of viral promoters driving Î²-galactosidase plasmids, 2M. Cervellera, G. Raschella, G. Santilli, B. Tanno, A. Ventura, C. Mancini, C. Sevignani, B. Calabretta, and A. Sala, unpublished observations. rendering control of transfection efficiency difficult, the assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times with different plasmid preparations. Light emission was evaluated with the aid of a scintillation counter or luminometer and expressed as cpm. The neuroblastoma cell line stably expressing B-MYB (LAN-5 B-MYB) was subjected to RDA to identify genes preferentially expressed, compared with the parental cell line. After two rounds of hybridization/PCR, the DP2 products, consisting of five distinct bands (Fig.1), were subcloned into the pBluescript (SK+) and sequenced. The cDNA clones from band 1 corresponded to a ribosomal protein and collagen type III; the clones from bands 2 and 3 were identified as the sulfated glycoprotein Apolipoprotein J/Clusterin; those from band 4 contained tropomyosin III; and those from band 5 contained fibrillin and the tumor-associated antigen CO-029. As initial validation of the RDA procedure, Southern blot hybridization of the Driver (LAN-5) and Tester (LAN-5 B-MYB) amplicons with 32P-labeled probes representative of the various RDA fragments, revealed selective hybridization with the TESTER amplicon, suggesting that the DP2 products were preferentially expressed in the LAN-5 B-MYB cDNA population (not shown). To further confirm the result obtained by RDA, ApoJ/Clusterin expression was assessed by Northern blot in total cellular RNA from LAN-5 and LAN-5 B-MYB cells. Compared with parental cells, B-MYB-expressing cells showed markedly increased levels of ApoJ/Clusterin and of the tumor-associated antigen CO-029 (Fig. 2). This result was confirmed by a semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis with ApoJ/Clusterin and CO-029-specific primers (Fig. 3). To exclude the possibility that overexpression of ApoJ/Clusterin in the LAN-5 B-MYB cell line was the consequence of clonal selection, SAOS2 and COS-7, two highly transfectable cell lines, were transiently transfected with the CMV-B-MYB expression plasmid; 36 h later, they were assessed for ApoJ/Clusterin mRNA levels. Northern blot analysis confirmed that cells transfected with the B-MYB cDNA, but not mock-transfected cells, overexpressed the ApoJ/Clusterin mRNA (Fig.4). As a control of RNA loading, expression of Î²-actin remained unchanged among the different transfectants (Fig. 4).Figure 3RT-PCR phenotyping of LAN-5 and LAN-5B-MYB cells. Expression of ApoJ/Clusterin was analyzed in parental (lane 1) or in B-MYB-transfected (lane 2) LAN-5 cells. RT-PCR and southern hybridization were performed as described under âMaterials and Methods.â Î²-Actin levels were monitored to normalize the RT-PCR reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Enhanced expression of ApoJ/Clusterin mRNA in cells transiently transfects withB-MYB. COS-7 (lanes 1 and2) or SAOS2 (lanes 3 and 4) were transfected with CMV-B-MYB (lanes 2 and 4) or the CMV empty vector (lanes 1 and 3). After 36 h, cells were harvested and 20 Î¼g of total RNA was hybridized to the indicated probes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inspection of the 5â² flanking region of the human ApoJ/Clusterin gene revealed a putative Myb site, not described previously, starting at nucleotide â292 of the 5â² flanking sequence (38.Wong P. Taillefer D. Lakins J. Pineault J. Chader G. Tenniswood M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Notably, the Myb site is conserved in the rat promoter, although in the opposite orientation, in a region that presents no homology between the human and rat genes, suggesting that it may be important for ApoJ/Clusterin gene regulation in different species (Fig.5). Gel shift experiments were carried out to assess whether B-MYB interacts with this putative Myb binding site. A 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the putative Myb binding site of the human ApoJ/Clusterin promoter bound to GST/B-MYB, but not to GST alone (Fig.6, lanes 1 and 2). Competition with an excess of wild-type unlabeled probe abolished the binding, whereas the interaction was not abolished in the presence of an oligonucleotide carrying a mutated Myb binding site (Fig. 6,lanes 3 and 4).Figure 6Interaction of B-MYB with the 5â² flanking region of the ApoJ/Clusterin gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of GST B-MYB with the 32P-labeled ApoJ/Clusterin Myb binding site. The double-stranded oligonucleotide including the putative Myb binding site of the human ApoJ/Clusterin promoter was labeled with 32P and mixed with the GST/B-MYB fusion protein or GST alone for a gel shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was also performed with a 300-fold excess of an unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide (WT) or an oligonucleotide carrying a 3-nucleotide substitution in the putative Myb binding site (MUT) to assess specificity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further demonstrate that the ApoJ/Clusterin promoter contains a functional Myb binding site involved in B-MYB-dependent promoter regulation, an ApoJ/Clusterin promoter plasmid containing a wild-type or a mutated Myb binding site was co-transfected with the empty vector or with CMV-B-MYB in LAN-5 or SAOS2 cells. B-MYB significantly activated the wild-type plasmid in both cell lines, whereas transactivation of the mutant plasmid was markedly diminished, especially in SAOS2 cells (Fig.7, A and B). Interestingly, the basal activity of the ApoJ/Clusterin promoter carrying a mutated B-MYB binding site is lower than that of the wild-type promoter, suggesting that endogenous levels of MYB proteins are important for ApoJ/Clusterin promoter activity. SAOS2 cells contain almost undetectable levels of endogenous cyclin A protein and are especially useful to study the cooperative effects of B-MYB expression and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A kinase activity (8.Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J. Khalil K. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Accordingly, co-expression of B-MYB and cyclin A in SAOS2 cells resulted in a dramatic increase in promoter transactivation, suggesting that augmented expression of cyclins also may contribute to abnormal expression of ApoJ/Clusterin (Fig. 7 C). Neuroblastoma tumors expressing high levels of B-MYB and ApoJ/Clusterin might exhibit growth advantage through increased resistance to stress or apoptotic stimuli delivered by the host environment. To test this hypothesis, LAN-5 or LAN-5 B-MYB cells were exposed to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin, which causes apoptotic death of neuroblastoma cells (39.Fulda S. Sieverts H. Friesen C. Herr I. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3823-3829PubMed Google Scholar), in cultures supplemented with an anti-ApoJ monoclonal antibody. B-MYB-overexpressing cells showed a significant resistance to cell death induced by doxorubicin, as compared with parental cells (14.5 Â± 3 versus 32 Â± 5% of cell death, respectively) (Fig. 8). Interestingly, the anti-ApoJ antibody, but not a IgG-matched control antibody, accelerated cell death induced by doxorubicin of both cell lines (Fig.8). These results suggest that secreted ApoJ/Clusterin is important in protecting neuroblastoma cells from cell death induced by apoptotic agents, such as doxorubicin, and that B-MYB exerts its protective effects on neuroblastoma cells through activation of ApoJ/Clusterin expression. In this report, we provide evidence that B-MYB, the ubiquitous member of the Myb family, positively regulates expression of the anti-apoptotic gene ApoJ/Clusterin, conferring on B-MYB-expressing cells resistance to death induced by the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. A growing body of evidence implicates B-MYB in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, and it is becoming apparent that B-MYBexpression in tumor cells is associated with disease progression (26.Sala A. Watson R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An important step in the understanding of B-MYB function is to identify target genes that may be responsible for the phenotypic changes imposed by B-MYB expression. In a recent report (25.RaschellaÌ G. Cesi V. Amendola R. Negroni A. Tanno B. Altavista P. Tonini G.P. DeBernardi B. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3365-3368PubMed Google Scholar), we noted a correlation between high levels of B-MYB expression in neuroblastoma and decreased patient survival. We hypothesized that several B-MYB target genes may be up-regulated in response to augmented levels of B-MYB, resulting in more aggressive tumors. To directly identify genes activated by B-MYB, we compared gene expression patterns of parental and B-MYB-expressing neuroblastoma LAN-5 cells (22.RaschellaÌ G. Negroni A. Sala A. Pucci S. Romeo A. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8540-8545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). LAN-5 cells, similar to the majority of tumor biopsies from neuroblastoma patients, express average levels of B-MYB mRNA (Fig. 2). In contrast, B-MYBtransfected LAN-5 cells express high levels of B-MYBmRNA (Fig. 2). Thus, comparing gene expression in these two cell lines may lead to the identification of B-MYB target genes involved in normal and pathological processes. By RDA, we identified several genes that were differentially expressed in B-MYB-transfected cells. Notably, at least two genes overexpressed in the LAN-5 B-MYB cell line are implicated in tumor progression and/or tumor survival. The CO-029 antigen is a tetraspanin molecule the expression of which is observed in human carcinoma but not in normal tissues (40.Szala S. Kasai Y. Steplewski Z. Rodeck U. Koprowski H. Linnenbach A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6833-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The rat homologue of human CO-029 imposes a metastatic phenotype to transfected cells, suggesting that this molecule is involved in tumor spreading (41.Claas C. Seiter S. Claas A. Savelyeva L. Schwab M. Zoller M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein J/Clusterin is a ubiquitously expressed sulfated glycoprotein that appears to promote cell survival based on experiments in which its expression was ablated by antisense strategies or neutralizing antibodies (30.Sintich S.M. Steinberg J. Kozlowski J.M. Lee C. Pruden S. Sayeed S. Sensibar J.A. Prostate. 1999; 39: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32.Sensibar J.A. Sutkowski D.M. Raffo A. Buttyan R. Griswold M.D. Sylvester S.R. Kozlowski J.M. Lee C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2431-2437PubMed Google Scholar). Its expression seems to be directly regulated by B-MYB as indicated by the transactivation assays with the wild-type or the mutant ApoJ promoter (Fig. 7). ApoJ/Clusterin expression appears to increase resistance of neuroblastoma cells to death induced by environmental factors or chemotherapeutic drugs, at least in vitro (Fig. 8). This hypothesis is consistent with data showing that ApoJ/Clusterin expression is associated with advanced stages of neuroblastoma (data not shown). The mechanisms by which ApoJ/Clusterin exerts its protective effects during cell injury are presently unknown. ApoJ/Clusterin synthesis and posttranslational modification is a complex phenomenon, involving glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage of the precursor protein in two chains (Î± and Î²) that associate through disulfide bridges to form the secreted heterodimeric protein (reviewed in Ref. 42.Bailey R. Griswold MD. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Given the amphipathic nature of the protein, it has been proposed that ApoJ/Clusterin acts as a detergent, binding to hydrophobic complexes and denatured proteins and aiding in their uptake and clearance (42.Bailey R. Griswold MD. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The unprocessed form of ApoJ/Clusterin can remain intracellular, and it has been shown to associate with the Ku70 DNA-protein kinase, a protein involved in DNA repair, resulting in impaired Ku70 binding to DNA ends (43.Yang C.R. Yeh S. Leskov K. Odegaard E. Hsu H.L. Chang C. Kinsella T.J. Chen D.J. Boothman D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2165-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that increased ApoJ/Clusterin expression may affect tumor progression by increasing cell survival and accumulation of detrimental mutations (through Ku70 inactivation), which may be consistent with the establishment of a fully malignant phenotype. Consistent with previous observations (8.Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J. Khalil K. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we have shown that concomitant overexpression of cyclin A and B-MYB results in the synergistic activation of the ApoJ/Clusterin promoter (Fig.7 C). In light of this result, it will be important to evaluate the activity of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase in tumors. One could hypothesize that overexpression of B-MYBand cyclins may result in higher levels of ApoJ/Clusterin and increased survival of tumor cells. Our finding that ApoJ/Clusterin is a direct target of B-MYB further suggests that the spectrum of genes of which the expression is controlled by MYB proteins extends beyond those involved in cell proliferation and differentiation and includes genes associated with apoptosis resistance and cell survival, as previously reported (44.Frampton J. Ramquist T. Graf T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2720-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 45.Taylor D. Badiani P. Weston K.

https://openalex.org/W2016114470,"Commitment to the melanocyte lineage is characterized by the onset of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) expression. Mitf plays a fundamental role in melanocyte development, with mice lacking Mitf being entirely devoid of pigment cells. In the absence of functional Mitf protein, melanoblasts expressing Mitf mRNA disappear around 2 days after their first appearance either by apoptosis or by losing their identity and adopting an alternative cell fate. The role of Mitf must therefore be to regulate genes required for melanoblast survival, proliferation, or the maintenance of melanoblast identity. Yet to date, Mitf has been shown to regulate genes such as Tyrosinase,Tyrp-1, and Dct, which are required for pigmentation, a differentiation-specific process. Because expression of these genes cannot account for the complete absence of pigment cells in Mitf-negative mice, Mitf must regulate the expression of other as yet uncharacterized genes. Here we provide several lines of evidence to suggest that Mitf may regulate the expression of the Tbx2 transcription factor, a member of the T-box family of proteins implicated in the maintenance of cell identity. First, isolation and sequencing of the entire murine Tbx2 gene revealed that the Tbx2promoter contains a full consensus Mitf recognition element; second, Mitf could bind the promoter in vitro and activateTbx2 expression in vivo in an E box-dependent fashion; and third, Tbx2 is expressed in melanoma cell lines expressing Mitf, but not in a line in which Mitf expression was not detectable. Taken together, with the fact that Tbx2 is expressed in Mitf-positive melanoblasts and melanocytes, but not in Mitf-negative melanoblast precursor cells, the evidence suggests that the Tbx2 gene may represent one of the first known targets for Mitf that is not a gene involved directly in the manufacture of pigment.

The melanocyte lineage arises in the neural crest as nonpigmented precursor cells, termed melanoblasts, which then migrate to their final destinations in the epidermis and hair follicles, where they differentiate into mature pigment-producing melanocytes. Little is known of the precise program of events leading from a multipotent neural crest cell to a melanoblast, but the switch from a melanoblast precursor cell to a melanoblast is characterized by the onset of expression of the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ)1microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, Mitf (1.Hodgkinson C.A.

Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 442-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mitf plays a critical but poorly understood role in melanocyte development. Mice lacking Mitf generate neural crest-derived melanoblasts, as measured by the expression of Mitf mRNA, but these cells are no longer detectable around 2 days after their first appearance (3.Opdecamp K. Nakayama A. Nguyen M.T. Hodgkinson C.A. Pavan W.J. Arnheiter H. Development. 1997; 124: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in a mouse devoid of all pigment cells. It is likely that the loss of melanoblasts in Mitf-negative mice reflects either the failure of the melanoblasts to survive or an inability to maintain their identity. Although Mitf has been shown to regulate the expression of genes such as Tyrosinase and Tyrp-1 (4.Yasumoto K. Yokoyama K. Shibata K. Tomita Y. Shibahara S. Mol. Cell.

This implies that Mitf must regulate other genes required for the survival, proliferation of melanoblasts, or the maintenance of their cell identity. However, apart from the pigmentation genes, no targets for Mitf in the melanocyte lineage have been identified to date. Over the past few years considerable excitement has been generated by the discovery, by Bollag et al., (9.Bollag R.J. Siegried Z. Cebra-Thomas J.A. Garvay N. Davison E.M. Silver L.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) of a novel family of transcription factors defined by the conservation of the T box, which corresponds approximately to the DNA binding domain (10.Kispert A.

Consistent with the high degree of conservation within the T-box family, mutations within the family have a dramatic affect on development.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4763-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), which is essential for mesoderm induction, whereas mutations in the human Tbx3 andTbx5 genes result in the autosomal dominant ulnar-mammary (18.Bamshad M.

Both syndromes are characterized by developmental defects; in ulnar-mammary syndrome the limb and apocrine glands are affected, whereas Holt-Oram syndrome is characterized by abnormalities in the cardiac septum and forelimbs. In addition to these naturally occurring mutations, targeted disruption of the mouse Tbx6 gene results in an embryo in which the somites are transformed into neural tubes (20.Chapman D.L. Papaioannou V.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), whereas theTbx4 and Tbx5 genes regulate limb identity (21.Takeuchi J.K. Koshiba-Takeuchi K. Matsumoto K. Vogel-HoÌpker A. Naitoh-Matsuo M. Ogura K. Takahashi N. Yasuda K. Ogura T. Nature. 1999; 398: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,22.Rodriguez-Estaban C. Tsukui T. Yonei S. Magallon J. Tamura K. Balmonte J.C.I. Nature. 1999; 398: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Together the evidence suggests that T-box family members may play a crucial role in the maintenance of cell identity and that at least one family member may be expressed in all cell types. We have shown previously that, in the melanocyte lineage, a single T-box factor gene Tbx2, is expressed in melanoblasts and melanocytes but not in neural crest-derived melanoblast precursor cells (23.Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), that is, Tbx2 expression appears to occur after commitment to the melanocyte lineage. Given the critical role of the T-box family in the maintenance of cell identity in development, understanding the controls operating on Tbx2 expression should provide an important insight into the regulatory mechanisms operating during the genesis of the melanocyte lineage. To this end, we have isolated and sequenced the entire murine Tbx2 gene, characterized the intron/exon boundaries, and mapped the transcription start site. We demonstrate that the Tbx2 promoter functions in a cell type-specific fashion and can be regulated by Mitf through a specific Mitf-consensus binding site. Thus Tbx2 may represent one of the first known targets for Mitf in the melanocyte lineage other than those genes directly involved in the manufacture of pigment. Two primers corresponding to the 3â²-end of the mouse Tbx2 cDNA clone were synthesized: 5â²-CTCAGCCAAAGAGGCG-3â² and 5â²-CCCATTCTGTGCTGTACACG-3â². These were used to amplify by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) a 192-base pair (bp) Tbx2 cDNA fragment. This fragment was used as a probe to screen a mouse ES genomic library. A genomic clone of approximately 100 kilobases in a P1 vector was obtained, digested by BamHI or XhoI andSalI, and subcloned into either the BamHI orSalI sites of pBluescript-SK+. The locations of the intron/exon boundaries were determined by sequencing either genomic PCR products or direct sequencing of the subclones, and the transcription start site was located by primer extension analysis. Primer extension was performed with a primer (5â²-TCATCGGGACATCCGGCCCAGGCTCCAGG-3â²) derived from the previously published Tbx2 cDNA sequence (9.Bollag R.J. Siegried Z. Cebra-Thomas J.A. Garvay N. Davison E.M. Silver L.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Isolation of RNA and blotting procedures were described previously (24.Easty D.J. Guthrie B.A. Maung K. Farr C.J. Lindberg R.A. Toso R.J. Herlyn M. Bennett D.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2528-2532PubMed Google Scholar). For the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, total RNA isolated from various cell lines was subjected to RT with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by a first strand cDNA synthesis (First Strand cDNA synthesis kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCR was performed as described previously (23.Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the primers used were as follows: 5â²-CAGACAGACAGTGCGTC-3â² and 5â²-ACTGGGCTCACGGCTATTTC-3â² for Tbx2 and 5â²-CCAACTGCTTAGCCCCCCTGGCCAAG-3â² and 5â²-CTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCATG-3â² for the glyceraldehyde-3-phospho-dehydrogenase(G3PDH) gene yielding PCR products of 599 and 550, bp respectively. In performing the RT-PCR we took aliquots of the reactions for analysis every four cycles to determine the kinetics of the PCR reaction, and the samples for analysis were taken from the âlog phaseâ of the PCR reaction after the same number of cycles. The band shift assays for USF1were performed in a final volume of 20 Î¼l containing 20 mmHepes (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, and 112 mm KCl; nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (25.Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3494-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The conditions for binding of Mitf were as described (26.Bertolotto C. Busca R. Abbe P. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.-P. Ballotti R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) except that the DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide:bis) containing 10% glycerol. In vitrotranscribed/translated (ITT) protein was made by using a TNT T7 Quick Coupled transcription kit as instructed by the manufacturer (Promega). Nuclear extracts or ITT USF1 (27.Aksan I. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6930-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) were preincubated at 0 Â°C with 1 Î¼g of poly(dIdC-dIdC) for 20 min before adding 10, 50, or 250 ng of cold competitor or USF1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). After a further incubation of 20 min, the radiolabeled probe was added and the assays were carried out as described previously (23.Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-SV5 epitope antibody was purchased from Serotec, and the polyclonal anti-Mitf antibodies were raised in rabbits against either a C-terminal peptide, or against the N-terminal 70 amino acids fused to glutathione S-transferase. The sequence of double stranded oligonucleotides used as probes and competitors, where the lowercase letters indicate mutated bases and the underlined sequences indicate the E-box elements, are as follow:Tbx2 E box, 5â²-ctagaGAACAGGGCAGGACACATGTGAGATAGTCACAt-3â² and 5â²-ctagaTGTGACTATCTCACATGTGTCCTGCCCTGTTCt-3â²; Tbx2 E box mut, 5â²-ctagaGAACAGGGCAGGACACcTtTGAGATAGTCACAt-3â² and 5â²-ctagaTGTGACTATCTCAaAgGTGTCCTGCCCTGTTCt-3â². The Tbx2 promoter luciferase reporters were made by inserting the NcoI (â859/+121), and BamHI (â230)-NcoI (+121) fragments of the Tbx2 gene into either the NcoI or the BglII and NcoI sites, respectively, of the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). The â11/+121 promoter mutants was made by deletion of a SmaI fragment from the full-length promoter in the pGL3- Basic vector. The pCMV-USF1 vector was constructed by cloning the full-length human USF1 cDNA between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pCMV19a. HeLa and COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The mouse melanocyte and melanoma cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was added to a final concentration of 200 nm for the melan-c and melan-a cells. Transfections were performed by using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or the Transfast (Promega) reagents. Cells were plated at 2 Ã 104/ml in 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. Transfections were carried out as instructed by the manufacturers, and the vector pCH110 containing the SV40 promoter driving expression of a LacZ reporter was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. All transfections were repeated multiple times using different preparations of DNA. For each transfection used to obtain the results presented (see Fig. 2), we compared the values obtained for the lacZ reporter in the two cell lines and, assuming that any difference (which was around 20%) represented a difference in transfection efficiency, we used these values to adjust the relative levels of luciferase activity obtained using the Tbx2promoter-reporter. By giving the luciferase activity from theTbx2-luciferase reporter a value of 100% in B16 cells, we arrived for each transfection experiment at a value for the activity of the same reporter in HeLa cells as a percentage of that observed in B16 melanoma cells. We then took an average of the HeLa cell results and compared that with the result from B16 cells presented as 100%. The lacZ reporter was also used in other transfection experiments as a control for transfection efficiency, and the values obtained using the various Tbx2-luciferase reporters were adjusted accordingly. The luciferase assays were performed as instructed by the manufacturer of the luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and were quantitated with a Bertholdt Microlumat LB 96V plate luminometer. The origin and culture of the melanocyte and melanoma cell lines used for the RT-PCR have been described previously (28.Bassi M.T. Incerti B. Easty D.J. Sviderskaya E.V. Ballabio A.

Parsons P.G. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 152-156PubMed Google Scholar) with the MM96 and K1735 cell lines being provided Dr. Dot Bennett. To gain an insight into the regulation of Tbx2 gene expression in the melanocyte lineage, it was necessary to isolate the sequences controlling its expression. To this end a mouse BAC library was screened for clones containing the Tbx2 gene. A single BAC clone was isolated, which hybridized to probes derived from the 5â²- and 3â²-ends of the mouse Tbx2 cDNA. The BAC DNA was initially digested withBamHI and subcloned into pUC19. One subclone, containing approximately 9 kilobases of DNA, hybridized to probes derived from the 5â²- and 3â²-ends of the Tbx2 cDNA and was therefore likely to contain the entire Tbx2 gene. Sequence analysis confirmed that this was the case, and eventually the sequence of the wholeTbx2 gene was obtained. The mouse Tbx2 gene was found to comprise seven exons, the relative locations of which are depicted in Fig.1 A. Previous work (32.Campbell C. Goodrich K. Casey G. Beatty B. Genomics. 1995; 28: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) had identified the intron/exon boundaries of the human gene, which are aligned with those deduced for the mouse gene in Fig. 1 B, and the contribution of each exon to the Tbx2 protein is depicted in Fig. 1 C. The overall structure of the murine Tbx2gene is remarkably conserved in terms of number and position of exons when compared with that of the human gene. The evolutionary implications of the conservation of gene structure within the T-box family has been discussed previously (33.Yi C.-H. Terrett J.A. Li Q.-Y. Ellington K. Packham E.A. Armstrong-Buisseret L. McClure P. Slingsby T. Brook D.J. Genomics. 1999; 55: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34.Wattler S. Russ A. Evans M. Nehls M. Genomics. 1998; 48: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although the structure of the T-box genes is of considerable interest to evolutionary biologists, our primary concern here was to isolate the Tbx2 promoter and to gain some clues as to its regulation. Sequencing revealed that the initialBamHI fragment containing the Tbx2 gene extended only some 350 bp 5â² from the ATG initiation codon, and it was not clear whether this 5â² sequence contained a significant region of theTbx2 promoter. To obtain additional Tbx2 promoter sequence, the original BAC DNA was restricted with both XhoI and Sal1 and subcloned into pUC19. The clones isolated were screened using a probe derived from the 5â² end of the Tbx2cDNA and positive clones sequenced. The results obtained enabled us to determine the sequence of an additional 829 bp of theTbx2 promoter. The full sequence of this region is shown in Fig. 2 A and contains potential binding sites for several transcription factors, including AP1, AP2, SP1, SIF-1, GATA, HIF-1, and EGR-2 (not shown). However, although such an analysis might give some indication as to the potential of the promoter to be regulated, an extensive mutational analysis would be required to determine whether any of these binding sites might be functional. Moreover, because all of these factors are known to be expressed in a wide range of tissues, they were not of immediate interest in terms of the regulation of Tbx2 expression in the melanocyte lineage. In contrast, an E-box element, CATGTG, located between 332 and 327 bp 5â² to the initiator ATG, attracted our attention. E boxes are recognized by members of the bHLH and bHLH-LZ families of transcription factors. In the melanocyte lineage, the bHLH-LZ transcription factor Mitf plays a critical role; mice devoid of a functional Mitf lack all pigment cells. Mitf has been shown previously to regulate a number of genes, including Tyrosinase, Tyrp-1, andDct involved in the manufacture of the pigment melanin, a process specific to melanocytes and the retinal pigment epithelium. The sequences recognized in all these Mitf target promoters are E boxes with the sequence CATGTG, including the highly conserved M-box motif (35.Lowings P. Yavuzer U. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3653-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although such E-box elements are present in many genes, we recently established that Mitf can only recognize a subset of E-box motifs in vitro and in vivo (27.Aksan I. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6930-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus Mitf will recognize a CATGTG E box only if it is flanked by a specific 5â² T residue. In other words, Mitf recognizes TCATGTG, CATGTGA, or TCATGTGA. In addition, these elements may also be targeted by a second bHLH-LZ factor, USF1, which is ubiquitously expressed. As we discuss below, whether Mitf or USF1 will recognize these elements in vivowill depend on a number of factors related to the relative abundance of DNA-binding competent USF1 and Mitf in the cell at a given time. Before undertaking an analysis of the potential role of this E-box element in the Tbx2 promoter function, we first identified the transcription initiation site by primer extension analysis using a primer corresponding to sequences located between 24 and 52 bp 5â² to the ATG translation initiation codon and mRNA derived from a B16 melanoma cell line. The primer location was chosen because previously isolated Tbx2 cDNAs extended up to a maximum of 57 bp 5â² from the initiator ATG. The results (Fig. 2 B) revealed the presence of two bands corresponding to cDNAs extending some 117 bp 5â² to the initiator ATG and 60 bp 5â² to the end of the longest previously published cDNAs. Because no cDNAs extending beyond these positions were obtained using other primers located within the putative Tbx2 leader sequence (not shown), we believe that the 5â² ends of the cDNAs derived by primer extension most likely correspond to the location of the transcription initiation site. These are indicated in Fig. 2 A. Prior to examining the requirements for Tbx2 expression in melanocytes, we asked whether the gene was expressed in a number of cell lines that are regularly used for the analysis of melanocyte-specific gene expression. We had previously shown that Tbx2 was expressed in both melanoblasts and all melanocyte cell lines tested but was not expressed in a melanoblast precursor cell line (23.Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, we had not determined whether Tbx2 was also present in melanoma cell lines. We therefore asked whether Tbx2 was expressed in twoMitf-positive melanoma cell lines, B16 and MM96, oneMitf-negative melanoma line, K1735, and the melanocyte cell line melan-c, whereas melan-a melanocytes were used as a positive control. The results, shown in Fig. 3, reveal that Tbx2 was expressed in all cell lines that also expressed Mitf, that is, melan-a, melan-c, and the two melanoma lines B16 and MM96. However, intriguingly, given the presence of the potential Mitf binding site in the Tbx2 promoter, no expression was detected in the Mitf-negative cell line K1735. These results were confirmed independently by Northern blotting. 2D. Bennett, personal communication. To determine whether the Tbx2 promoter isolated was sufficient to direct cell type-specific expression, sequences between â859 and +121, relative to the transcription start site, were cloned upstream from a luciferase reporter (Fig.4 A), and promoter activity was determined following transfection into B16 melanoma cells. As a control, the Tbx2 promoter-luciferase reporter was also transfected into HeLa cells, which we have shown previously do not express Tbx2 (23.Carreira S. Dexter T.J. Yavuzer U. Easty D.J. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5099-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the relative promoter strength was determined by comparison to the activity of a cotransfected SV40-lacZ reporter. The results shown in Fig. 4 B demonstrate that theTbx2 promoter used was sufficient to direct expression specifically in the melanoma cell line; relative to the activity of the lacZ reporter, the Tbx2 promoter was at least 30-fold better expressed in B16 cells than in HeLa cells. We next determined whether the minimal promoter, which still retained the E-box motif, was functional using promoter deletion mutants (Fig.5 A). Deletion of theTbx2 promoter to â230 resulted in no more than around a 3-fold decrease in promoter activity relative to the promoter extending to â859 (Fig. 5 B). However, mutating the CATGTG E box motif to CCTTTG in the context of the â230 deletion resulted in a further 5-fold decrease in promoter activity, suggesting that this element plays a significant role in Tbx2 promoter function. The importance of this element was highlighted by the fact that the activity of the mutated promoter extending to position â230 was no more than 2-fold greater than when the promoter was almost entirely deleted to â11. The results obtained so far suggest that the Tbx2 promoter is cell type-specific and contains a functional E-box motif that contributes substantially to promoter function. In the melanocyte-specific Tyrosinase Tyrp-1 and Dct2 promoters, the specific E-box elements that are essential for their expression have been shown to bind both the bHLH-LZ transcription factors USF1 and Mitf (4.Yasumoto K.

To determine whether USF1 could recognize the E box present in theTbx2 promoter, we performed a DNA binding band shift assay using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe spanning the E box andin vitro transcribed/translated (ITT) USF1. The sequence of the probe is shown in Fig. 6 A, and the results of the DNA binding assay are shown in Fig.6 B.

https://openalex.org/W2089642693,"TOGp is the human homolog of XMAP215, aXenopus microtubule-associated protein that promotes rapid microtubule assembly at plus ends. These proteins are thought to be critical for microtubule assembly and/or mitotic spindle formation. To understand how TOGp interacts with the microtubule lattice, we cloned full-length TOGp and various truncations for expression in a reticulocyte lysate system. Based on microtubule co-pelleting assays, the microtubule binding domain is contained within a basic 600-amino acid region near the N terminus, with critical domains flanking a region homologous to the microtubule binding domain found in the related proteins Stu2p (S. cerevisiae) and Dis1 (S. pombe). Both full-length TOGp and the N-terminal fragment show enhanced binding to microtubule ends. Full-length TOGp also binds altered polymer lattice structures including parallel protofilament sheets, antiparallel protofilament sheets induced with zinc ions, and protofilament rings, suggesting that TOGp binds along the length of individual protofilaments. The C-terminal region of TOGp has a low affinity for microtubule polymer but binds tubulin dimer. We propose a model to explain the microtubule-stabilizing and/or assembly-promoting functions of the XMAP215/TOGp family of microtubule-associated proteins based on the binding properties we have identified."
https://openalex.org/W2038193649,"Nuclear receptors regulate transcription in direct response to their cognate hormonal ligands. Ligand binding leads to the dissociation of corepressors and the recruitment of coactivators. Many of these factors, acting in large complexes, have emerged as potential chromatin remodelers through intrinsic histone modifying activities. In addition, other ligand-recruited complexes appear to act more directly on the transcriptional apparatus. The DRIP complex is a 15-subunit complex required for nuclear receptor transcriptional activation in vitro. It is recruited to the receptor in response to ligand through specific interactions of one subunit, DRIP205. We present evidence that DRIP205 interacts with another member of the steroid receptor subfamily, estrogen receptor (ER). This interaction occurs in an agonist-stimulated fashion which in turn is inhibited by several ER antagonists. In vivo, a fragment of DRIP205 containing only its receptor interacting region acts to selectively inhibit ER's ability to activate transcription in response to estradiol.

The ligands for nuclear receptors include steroids, retinoids, vitamin D, thyroid hormone, prostanoids, and cholesterol metabolites, such as oxysterols and bile acids. Their combined effects are vast, influencing virtually every fundamental biological process, from development and homeostasis to proliferation and differentiation. Like other eukaryotic factors that regulate transcription, nuclear receptors bind selectively to DNA, primarily as dimers through two characteristic zinc finger modules and a dimerization region that directs self-interaction or hetero-partnering. Moreover, they possess identifiable transactivation functions (AFs),1 which can independently confer activation potential to heterologous DNA-binding domains. Transactivation is mediated by both constitutive and inducible AFs (AF-1 and AF-2, respectively), the latter of which is conferred by its integral location within the ligand-binding domain (LBD). A large number of nuclear receptor transcriptional cofactors have been isolated through interactions with receptors in yeast two-hybrid screens and from nuclear extracts in vitro, primarily using receptor LBDs as baits. One family of related proteins are collectively termed the p160 coactivators. They are represented by SRC-1/NCoA-1, TIF2/GRIP1/NCoA-2, and pCIP/ACTR/AIB1 (for review, see Refs. 1.Freedman L.P.

Besides sequence homology, p160 proteins share an ability to stimulate ligand-dependent transactivation by nuclear receptors in transient overexpression experiments. A distinctive structural feature of the p160 coactivators is the presence of multiple LXXLL signature motifs (also called LXDs, NR boxes, or NIDs), which comprise determinants for direct interactions with the nuclear receptor AF-2 (4.Heery D.M.

Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). A second shared feature of the p160 coactivators is an intrinsic histone acetyl transferase activity and the ability to interact with other histone acetyl transferase coactivators, such as CBP/p300 and pCAF (6.Ogryzko V.V.

These corepressors have been found as part of multiple complexes containing various HDACs through indirect interactions with corepressors bridged by mSin3a or through direct corepressor-HDAC interactions (9.Kao H.-Y.

Remarkably, recent data indicate that corepressors and coactivators use very similar determinants (i.e. the LXXLL motif) to recognize and interact with receptor LBDs (14.Lazar M.A. Hu X.

Ultimately, it is the absence, presence, or nature of the ligand that influences whether or not a corepressor or coactivator is bound to essentially the same site within the LBD. Functionally, these factors act in concert to modify histone tails, presumably to destabilize or stabilize chromatin (recently reviewed in Ref. 17.Lemon B.D. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to actions at the level of chromatin, other, distinct nuclear receptor coactivators also appear to act directly at promoters on key components of the transcriptional apparatus. A recently discovered multisubunit complex that was found to interact with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (18.Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J. Chang C.P. Burakov D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

A. 1996; 93 (3833): 8329Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) probably function, at least in part, at the level of direct recruitment. This complex, alternatively called DRIP or TRAP, binds to the nuclear receptor LBD AF-2 in response to ligand through a single subunit (DRIP205/TRAP220 (19.Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)). However, this single subunit anchors an additional 13â15 proteins comprising the DRIP/TRAP complex, thereby conferring hormone-dependent recruitment of what appears to be a preformed complex. Other activators unrelated to steroid/nuclear receptors, such as VP16, p65 subunit of NF-ÎºB, and SREBP-1a, also recruit this complex (called ARC; Ref. 23.NaÌaÌr A.M. Beaurang P.A. Zhou S. Abrahams A. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and many of the DRIP-TRAP-ARC subunits are also present in three similar, if not identical, SRB-associated complexes, NAT, SMCC, and mammalian SRB/mediator, the latter targeted by adenovirus E1A (24.Sun X.

Berk A.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). At least seven DRIP/TRAP/ARC subunits are homologous to proteins described as components of Srb/mediator, a complex that associates with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) through its large subunit's carboxylterminal repeat domain (reviewed in Ref. 27.Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1999; 9: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This suggests that the DRIP/TRAP/ARC coactivator complex, perhaps through mediator components, functions in part by targeting polymerase II holoenzyme to promoters. In fact, these related complexes are required for transcription by these same activators, as demonstrated utilizing purified components in in vitro transcription assays. The potent effect of the DRIP complex on transcriptional activationin vitro and the generality of the activators it cooperates with suggests that it is central to the process of transcription. While preliminary data indicate that the DRIP complex interacts with several nuclear receptors, in addition to VDR and TR, such as retinoic acid receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (18.Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J. Chang C.P. Burakov D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar,21.Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y.

Freedman, unpublished data. its role as a ligand-dependent coactivator of steroid receptors, including estrogen receptor (ER), has not yet been clearly elucidated. We recently demonstrated that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) LBD interacts with DRIP205 in a dexamethasone-dependent manner (28.Hittelman A.D. Burakov D. InÌiguez-LluhÄ±Ì J.A. Freedman L.P. Garabedian M.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5380-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal transactivation function of GR, AF-1, interacts selectively with a distinct DRIP subunit, DRIP150. These results suggest that two separate activation functions might serve to bridge a multisubunit complex like DRIP through multiple interactions and perhaps offer a possible explanation for the transcriptional synergism between these two transactivation domains of GR in response to hormone. In this work, we present evidence that DRIP205 interacts with another member of the steroid receptor subfamily, ER. This interaction occurs in an agonist-stimulated fashion, which in turn is inhibited by several ER antagonists. In transient transfection assays, a fragment of DRIP205 containing only its receptor-interacting region acts to selectively inhibit ER's ability to activate transcription in response to estradiol. These observations suggest a key role for the DRIP coactivator complex in estrogen-ER signaling. The BIAcore 2000 system, sensor chips CM5 (certified), Tween 20, amine coupling, and GST capture kits were obtained from BIAcore Inc. For BIAcore experiments, purified recombinant human estrogen receptors Î± and Î² were obtained from PanVera Corp. The buffer used for all experiments was 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT. 17-Î²-Estradiol and 4-(OH) tamoxifen were obtained from Sigma. Raloxifene was synthesized by Wyeth-Ayerst Medicinal Chemistry group. ICI-182,780 was provided by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals. A region encoding amino acids 613â773 of SRC1 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using primers designed for the specific sites. The amplified product was subcloned into pGEX-5X-3 using unique SmaI/XhoI sites. GST-ER-LBD (aa 312â595), GST-DRIP205 (aa 527â774), and well as DRIP205 mutant derivatives (GST-ÎNR1, GST-ÎNR2, GST-M1, and GST-M2) are all described elsewhere (29.Rachez C. Gamble M.

Garabedian (New York University Medical School). pcDNA3-hER-N (aa 1â251) and pcDNA3-hER-C (aa 185â595) were generated through polymerase chain reaction amplification and ligated into the pcDNA3 vector. BL-21 cells expressing GST-DRIP205, GST-DRIP205 mutants, GST-ER derivatives, or GST-SRC1 were grown at 37 Â°C until A 600 reached 0.4. Subsequently, the temperature was lowered to 24 Â°C and incubation was continued until cells reached A 600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). Cells were allowed to grow at 24 Â°C for an additional 3 h, harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm in a Sorval SS-34 rotor for 20 min, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cells were sonicated, and the homogenate was centrifuged for 1.5 h at 45,000 rpm in a T45 rotor (Beckman). The supernatant was applied to a glutathione-agarose column (Pierce). Bound GST-fused proteins were eluted with a gradient of reduced glutathione from 5 to 50 mm in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA. Eluted proteins were concentrated with ammonium sulfate (final concentration of 70%) and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex-200 column. Protein immobilization on a BIAcore sensor chip surface was carried out as described previously (31.Cheskis B.J. Freedman L.P. Picard D. Nuclear Receptors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 95-116Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-GST-antibody was immobilized using an amine coupling kit, as described by the manufacturer. 6000â8000 RU of protein was typically bound. Purified GST-DRIP205 or GST-SRC1 was then immobilized using antibody-antigen interactions. Surfaces with approximately 600â800 RU of immobilized protein were used for the interaction analysis. Each binding cycle was performed with a constant flow of buffer at 10 Î¼l/min. Samples of ER were injected across the surface via a sample loop. Once the injection plug had passed the surface, the formed complex was washed with buffer for an additional 1000 s. Following each injection, the surface was regenerated with one 10-Î¼l injection of 0.05% SDS solution. To remove immobilized GST coactivator, a 10-Î¼l injection of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.0, was used. All experiments were performed at 25 Â°C. Data were collected at 1 Hz and analyzed using the BIAEvaluation program 3.0 (BIAcore, Inc.) on a Compaq PC. This program uses a global fitting analysis method for the determination of rate and affinity constants of macromolecular interactions. Refractive index differences for the ERs at different protein/ligand concentrations were adjusted using the Sigma Plot 5.0 program. GST-fusion proteins (20 Î¼g), ER-LBD (aa 312â595), DRIP 205 (aa 527â774) or GST alone, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were preincubated in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 170 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 4 Â°C. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled (Promega TNT reticulocyte lysate system) human ER (aa 1â595), human ER-N (aa 1â251), or human ER-C (aa 185â595) were incubated with the immobilized fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 Â°C. The beads were washed four times in the same buffer without bovine serum albumin, resuspended in 2Ã SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 3 min; the associated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The U2OS-ER cell line was a kind gift from M. J. Garabedian, I. Rogatsky, and J. Trowbridge (New York University Medical Center). Cells were cultured with or without estradiol in the medium (10â6m) for 24 h. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF), in the presence of protease inhibitors (15 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 Î¼g/ml aprotenin, 20 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 mmbenzamidine). The extracts were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. For ER immunoprecipitation, 20 Î¼g of SRA1010 anti-ERÎ± IgG antibody (StressGen) was used per 1 mg of protein extract. The same amount of normal rabbit serum was used as a control. The immunoprecipitation from hormone-treated cells was performed in the presence of 10â4m estradiol. The extracts were incubated for 2 h with the antiserum before adding a 1:1 mix of protein A and Gamma-bind G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for another 1 h. The beads were washed four times with the buffer described above, washed three times with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and then boiled in SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. DRIP 205 was detected by Western blot using anti-PBP polyclonal serum that was kindly provided by Dr. M. Lazar (University of Pennsylvania Medical School). Antibody was used at a 1:750 dilution. U2OS-ER cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 500 Î¼g/ml G418 to maintain ER expression. Cells were seeded on 35-mm dishes at a density of 2 Ã 105 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phenol red-free medium supplemented with 10% stripped fetal bovine serum and 1% nonessential amino acids. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 15 Î¼g of total DNA including 2 Î¼g of ERE-TK-Luc, 2 Î¼g of CMV-Î²-Gal, and various amounts of pcDNA3-DRIP205 box. 12 h following transfection, cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline, and fresh medium with or without estradiol was added. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and luciferase activity was quantified using a luminometer. Î²-Galactosidase activity of the cell lysates was determined and used to normalize luciferase activity. 2 Ã 104 COS-7 cells per well were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red (BioWhitter) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 100 ng of pGL-Luciferase reporter, 20 ng of pCMV Î²-galactosidase control, 100 ng of pMGal4-DBD fused in frame to DRIP205-(527â774), and 100 ng of pVP16 fused to ERÎ± or ERÎ² LBD were co-transfected per well for 4 h. Cells were incubated in appropriate hormone-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red medium with 10% charcoal-stripped serum for 36 h and then harvested for luciferase and Î²-galactosidase assays. The relative level of luciferase activity was normalized to the Î²-galactosidase activity. We and others previously examined a subset of steroid/nuclear receptors for their ability to interact with the DRIP complex in the presence of their cognate ligands. In these experiments, very weak or no interaction with ER was detected (18.Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J. Chang C.P. Burakov D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1787-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 21.Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that this receptor does not interact with or coactivate through the DRIP complex. However, binding conditions used in these GST pull-down assays included relatively high amounts of the detergent deoxycholate that apparently inhibited estradiol binding to ER. Using revised conditions that included significantly lower amounts of detergent, we reanalyzed the ability of ER to interact with individual DRIP subunits. By expressing individual cDNAs of seven of the subunits in a coupled transcription/translation system, we observed that ERÎ±-LBD interacted with three DRIP subunits, DRIP240, -205, and -77. However, estradiol-induced interaction occurred only with DRIP205 (Fig.1 A). This is the same subunit previously identified as interacting directly with VDR (19.Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z.

Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). DRIP77 and DRIP240 also associated with ERÎ±, albeit more weakly, and this interaction was not significantly enhanced by estradiol. The ligand-enhanced ERÎ± interaction with DRIP205 was observed regardless of which protein was used as bait (Fig.1 B). Moreover, under the identical binding conditions described above, we found that ERÎ² also bound DRIP205, in a strongly estradiol-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). The DRIP205 interaction with both ER isoforms was also detected in cells using a mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 C). DRIP205 therefore does not have a binding preference for one of the two known isoforms of ER. In order to determine if DRIP205's interaction with ER anchors the entire multisubunit DRIP complex to the receptor, as it does with so-called class II nuclear receptors such as VDR, TR, and retinoic acid receptor, we initially attempted to view the complex bound to immobilized ERÎ±-LBD or full-length ERÎ± bound to glutathione beads. Under these conditions, we failed to detect the DRIP complex bound to liganded ER (data not shown). However, when endogenous ERÎ± was immunoprecipitated from human osteosarcoma U2OS cells overexpressing ERÎ± with an anti-ER antibody and immunoblotted against antibodies directed to DRIP subunits, we observed estradiol-dependent co-precipitation of DRIP205 (Fig. 1 D) but not other DRIP subunits, such as DRIP 130 or DRIP 150 (data not shown). These results are consistent with either DRIP205 bound on its own to ER or as part of an as yet to be determined subcomplex of DRIP. To examine more carefully aspects of DRIP205 binding with ER, we determined binding constants for the interaction in the presence of both agonist and antagonists, using surface plasmon resonance. Bacterially expressed and purified GST-DRIP205 was immobilized on the surface of a BIAcore sensor chip as described under âMaterials and Methods.â Fig. 2 Ademonstrates overlaid sensograms of the injections of 30 Î¼l of ERÎ² liganded with 17Î²-estradiol, at concentrations ranging from 4.4 to 280 nm. A saturable response was detected for ERÎ² liganded with estradiol, indicating that this DRIP derivative specifically interacted with purified ERÎ². Essentially identical results were generated with ERÎ± (data not shown). Fig. 2 Bpresents a graph of the amount of ERÎ² bound to DRIP205 at the end of each injection versus a logarithm of ERÎ² concentration. The sensograms generated were analyzed using the BIAEvaluation 3.0 program, as described previously (30.Cheskis B. Freedman L.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3309-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and values for apparent dissociation, association, and affinity rate constants were determined (Table I). Data analysis revealed that the ER-DRIP205 interaction in the presence of estradiol cannot be described using a simple monomolecular model. Rather, the data indicate that fast initial ERÎ² binding leads to the formation of an unstable ER-DRIP205 complex (k off1 = 1.8e â2sâ1) that slowly undergoes conformational changes, resulting in a significantly more stable complex. (k off2 = 2.11e â4sâ1). As summarized in Table I, the apparent affinity rate constant for the ERÎ²-17-Î²-estradiol-DRIP205 interaction was K D = 64 nm; the affinity of the ERÎ±-17-Î²-estradiol-DRIP205 interaction was found to be very similar (K D = 72 nm).Table IAffinities of DRIP205 to ERÎ± and ERÎ² in response to agonist or antagonistsERÎ±K DERÎ² K DnmDRIP205-E27264DRIP205-no ligand160158DRIP205â4HT240255DRIP205-Ral256207DRTIP2â5-ICI314329SRC13425Dissociation constants were generated by surface plasmon resonance, as described under âMaterials and Methodsâ and shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

E2, 17-Î²-estradiol; 4HT, 4-(OH)-tamoxifen; Ral, raloxifene; ICI, ICI-182,780. The effects of ER antagonists on DRIP205/ER binding were also analyzed by BIAcore. Fig. 3 A presents overlaid sensograms of injections of unliganded ERÎ±, and ERÎ± liganded with 17Î²-estradiol, 4-(OH) tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI-182,780 (all at 10â6m) run over immobilized DRIP205. While binding of agonist enhanced the affinity of ERÎ± interaction with DRIP205 compared with unliganded receptor, the pure antagonist ICI-182,780, and partial agonists 4-(OH)-tamoxifen and raloxifene all inhibited this interaction. Similar results were obtained for ERÎ² (data not shown). The data indicate that binding of 17Î²-estradiol significantly accelerated formation of the ER-DRIP205 complex, where kon1 was enhanced more than 3-fold compared with unliganded ER and more than 10-fold relative to ER liganded with ICI-182,780. Affinity and kinetic rates of DRIP205 interactions with both ERÎ± and ERÎ² in the presence of these antagonists are summarized in Fig. 3 B. Surface plasmon resonance was used to directly compare the affinities of ER with DRIP205 and SRC-1, a p160 nuclear receptor coactivator. Serial injections of ERÎ± or ERÎ² liganded with 17Î²-estradiol were run over flow cells immobilized with equivalent amounts of bacterially expressed GST-DRIP205 or GST-SRC1. Data analysis indicated that ERÎ± interacted with both DRIP205 and SRC1 with similar affinities, although somewhat higher for SRC1 (Table I). Essentially identical results were observed with ERÎ² (data not shown). Ligand-dependent interactions of most receptor coactivators, including DRIP205, have been mapped to the AF-2 domain within the receptor's ligand binding domain (18.Rachez C. Suldan Z. Ward J.

https://openalex.org/W2083220635,"A novel signaling pathway for mediation of Î²3-adrenergic activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1/2 (associated with proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis) has recently been proposed, which implies mediation via constitutively coupled Gi-proteins and GÎ²Î³-subunits, distinct from the classical cAMP pathway of Î²-adrenergic stimulation. To verify the significance of this pathway in cells in primary cultures that entopically express Î²3-adrenoreceptors, we examined the functionality of this pathway in cultured brown adipocytes. Norepinephrine activated Erk1/2 via both Î²3 receptors and Î±1 receptors but not via Î±2 receptors. Forskolin induced Erk1/2 activation similarly to Î²3activation, indicating cAMP-mediation; this induction could be inhibited with H89, implying protein kinase A mediation. The Gi-pathway was functional in these cells, as pertussis toxin increased agonist-induced cAMP accumulation. However, pertussis toxin was unable to affect adrenergically induced Erk1/2 activation. Also, wortmannin was without effect, implying that GÎ²Î³ activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway was not involved. PP1/2, which inhibits Src, abolished both Î²3- and Î±1-induced Erk1/2 activation. Thus, the proposed novel Gi pathway for Î²3 mediation is not universal, because it is not functional in the untransformed primary cell culture system with entopically expressed Î²3 receptors examined here. Here, the Î²3 signal is mediated classically via cAMP/protein kinase A. Î²3 and Î±1 signals converge at Src, which thus mediates Erk1/2 activation in both pathways. A novel signaling pathway for mediation of Î²3-adrenergic activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1/2 (associated with proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis) has recently been proposed, which implies mediation via constitutively coupled Gi-proteins and GÎ²Î³-subunits, distinct from the classical cAMP pathway of Î²-adrenergic stimulation. To verify the significance of this pathway in cells in primary cultures that entopically express Î²3-adrenoreceptors, we examined the functionality of this pathway in cultured brown adipocytes. Norepinephrine activated Erk1/2 via both Î²3 receptors and Î±1 receptors but not via Î±2 receptors. Forskolin induced Erk1/2 activation similarly to Î²3activation, indicating cAMP-mediation; this induction could be inhibited with H89, implying protein kinase A mediation. The Gi-pathway was functional in these cells, as pertussis toxin increased agonist-induced cAMP accumulation. However, pertussis toxin was unable to affect adrenergically induced Erk1/2 activation. Also, wortmannin was without effect, implying that GÎ²Î³ activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway was not involved. PP1/2, which inhibits Src, abolished both Î²3- and Î±1-induced Erk1/2 activation. Thus, the proposed novel Gi pathway for Î²3 mediation is not universal, because it is not functional in the untransformed primary cell culture system with entopically expressed Î²3 receptors examined here. Here, the Î²3 signal is mediated classically via cAMP/protein kinase A. Î²3 and Î±1 signals converge at Src, which thus mediates Erk1/2 activation in both pathways. extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 norepinephrine phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein kinase A pertussis toxin In its general structure, the Î²3-adrenoreceptor distinguishes itself from the Î²1/Î²2receptors, which are more similar between themselves (1Emorine L.J.

Mattei M.G. Strosberg A.D. Emorine L.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3721-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This distinction not only reflects different pharmacologies (i.e.differences in the adrenergic ligand binding site) but is also known to be reflected in the signaling function; desensitization via protein kinase A-mediated and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated receptor phosphorylation only occurs in the Î²1/Î²2 receptors and not in the Î²3 receptors (3Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Hayashi Y. Inagaki M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1991; 67: 723-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, the distinction between the receptor subtypes may be anticipated also in other ways to be associated with different intracellular signaling pathways for the Î²3 receptor versus the Î²1/Î²2 receptors. The signal from Î²1/Î²2 receptors is unquestionably mediated via the classical pathway leading from activation of Gs through activation of adenylyl cyclase to increases in cAMP and activation of protein kinase A. A similar pathway is undoubtedly also activated by the Î²3 receptors. However, alternative signaling pathways for the Î²3receptor may also exist. Indeed, based on experiments performed by several groups on the adipocyte-like cell line 3T3-F442A and especially in systems in which Î²3 receptors are ectopically expressed (4Gerhardt C.C. Gros J. Strosberg A.D. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Soeder K.J. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W. Luttrell L.M. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12017-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated that an alternative, suggested constitutive, primary pathway for Î²3-signaling may exist. According to these investigations, the Î²3receptor is not only coupled to Gs but also constitutively to Gi (4Gerhardt C.C. Gros J. Strosberg A.D. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Soeder K.J. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W. Luttrell L.M. Collins S. J. Biol.

In its turn, Gi may activate the Erk1/21 mitogen-activated protein kinase, as observed in several systems (7Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Soeder K.J. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W. Luttrell L.M. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12017-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) in which Î²3/Gi activation, through Î²Î³ mediation, would lead to activation of Erk1/2, with implied major effects on cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and cell differentiation. Thus, in this suggested model, Î²3 activates Erk1/2 in a Gs/cAMP-independent manner. Due to the potential significance of this novel pathway in several physiological contexts, we found it of importance to examine its role in the paradigmatic physiological system for investigation of Î²3-mediated effects: brown adipocytes. In the cultured brown adipocyte system under investigation here, the Î²-adrenergic signal is virtually exclusively mediated via Î²3receptors. The Î²2 receptor gene is practically silent in these cells (10Bengtsson T. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Î²1 receptors present do not make a measurable contribution to e.g. cAMP accumulation (11Bronnikov G. Houstek J. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2006-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nisoli E. Tonello C. Landi M. Carruba M.O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in these cells, adrenergic stimulation has already been demonstrated to lead to an activation of Erk1/2 (14Shimizu Y. Tanishita T. Minokoshi Y. Shimazu T. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Lindquist J.M. Rehnmark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30147-30156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which has been shown to be of high physiological significance, as it is linked to inhibition of apoptosis (15Lindquist J.M. Rehnmark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30147-30156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We therefore consider this an optimal system in which to elucidate the physiological significance of the proposed novel Î²3/Gi pathway for Erk1/2 activation. We found that in these non-transformed cells, the adrenergic signal that activated Erk1/2 was mediated via both Î±1 and Î²3 receptors. There was, however, no contribution from Î±2 stimulation; thus, Î±2-induced Gi activation could not activate Erk1/2. The Î±1 activation was mediated via Src activation. The Î²3 stimulation was also mediated via Src activation, but the pathway from the Î²3 receptor to this Src activation was classical in the sense that it was mediated via Gs, adenylyl cyclase activation, increase in cAMP levels, and activation of protein kinase A rather than through the Î²Î³-subunits of the G-proteins. It was especially noteworthy that inhibition of the Gi system did not in any way affect the ability of Î²3 stimulation to activate the Erk1/2 cascade. We conclude that the proposed novel Î²3/Gi/GÎ²Î³ pathway for Erk1/2 activation is not universal, because it is not responsible for Erk1/2 activation in the paradigmatic Î²3 system of the brown adipocytes. To which extent the proposed Gi/Erk1/2 pathway is of significance in other physiologically relevant systems requires identification of other entopic Î²3 systems coupled to Erk1/2 activation in cell types different from brown adipocytes. Three-week-old male mice (NMRI strain; Eklunds, Stockholm, Sweden) were kept at 22 Â°C with free access to food and water for 2â3 days before sacrifice by CO2anesthesia. Brown adipocyte precursor cells were isolated from pooled interscapular, axillary, and cervical brown adipose tissue, as described earlier (16NeÌchad M. Kuusela P. Carneheim C. BjoÌrntorp P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 149: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Rehnmark S. NeÌchad M. Herron D. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol.

In brief, tissue was minced in a Hepes-buffered Ringer solution containing 0.1â0.2% (w/v) collagenase type II (Sigma) and digested for 30 min at 37 Â°C. The digest was successively filtered through a 250-Î¼m and a 25-Î¼m nylon filter to remove undigested material and mature cells. The precursor cells were pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 2000 rpm), washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), pelleted again, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of culture medium per mouse. The precursor cells were seeded into multi-well culture dishes (Falcon; Corning) at an inoculation density corresponding to 2.5 mice/6-well plate (growth area 9.4 cm2/well). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2.4 nm insulin, 25 Î¼g/ml sodium ascorbate, 10 mm Hepes, 4 mm glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin at 37 Â°C in an atmosphere of 8% CO2 in air. Cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium on day 1, and medium was changed on days 1 and 3 of culture. On day 4, the medium was changed to one without serum, consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 (1:1 mixture, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2.4 nm insulin, 25 Î¼g/ml sodium ascorbate, 10 mm Hepes, 4 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicilin, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. The cells were incubated in this medium for 24 h to reduce basal Erk1/2 activity before experiments (15Lindquist J.M. Rehnmark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30147-30156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On day 5, cultures were treated as indicated in the individual experiments, medium was aspirated, and cells were lysed directly in the well by the addition of 80 Î¼l of 65 Â°C SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Cells were scraped, transferred to an Eppendorf tube on ice, and sonicated for 10 s followed by heating to 100 Â°C for 5 min. Aliquots of the samples were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membrane (pore size 0.45 Î¼m; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a semidry electroblotter. After transfer, the membranes were allowed to soak in Tris-buffered saline for 5 min, followed by quenching of nonspecific binding (1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline). After quenching, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody (1:1000 dilution of phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (New England BioLabs)) overnight at 4 Â°C. The primary antibody was detected with a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (New England BioLabs)) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were then stripped with 10 m urea, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 Â°C and reprobed with a p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase antibody (New England BioLabs), detected with the same secondary antibody. The blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR films and quantified on a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. The ratio between phosphorylated and total Erk protein p-Erk/Erk is shown in the results; the ratio was normalized in each experiment to that observed with 1 Î¼m NE. Brown adipocytes were stimulated as indicated and treated as described by Bronnikov et al. (13Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP levels were determined with the cyclic AMP assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In the pertussis toxin (PTX) experiment, 10 Î¼m yohimbine and 3 Î¼g/ml adenosine deaminase (Sigma) were added 10 min before agonist stimulation. l-Norepinephrine, bitartrate (Arterenol), isoprenaline (l-isoproterenol d- bitartarte), clonidine, A23187, forskolin, genistein, pertussis toxin, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and collagenase (type II) were obtained from Sigma, cirazoline was from Research Biochemicals, Inc., CGP-12177 was from Molecular Probes, H89, PP1, and PP2 were from Calbiochem. BRL-37344 was from Smith-Kline Beecham, and UK-14304 was from Tocris Cookson. ICI-89406 and ICI-118551 were gifts from Imperial Chemical Industries (Zeneca). All agents were freshly dissolved in water, except 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, forskolin, PP1, PP2, and genistein, which were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO; final concentration was maximally of 0.1%). Norepinephrine activates Erk1/2 in brown adipocytes (14Shimizu Y. Tanishita T. Minokoshi Y. Shimazu T. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Lindquist J.M. Rehnmark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30147-30156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To delineate in detail which adrenergic receptor subtype(s) mediates the norepinephrine effect, we stimulated brown adipocytes with different adrenergic agonists. Erk1/2 activation was measured as the level of phosphorylation of the two isoforms Erk1 and Erk2, which correlates with activation (15Lindquist J.M. Rehnmark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30147-30156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As expected, norepinephrine led to a very marked increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig.1 A), which was transient (Fig. 1 B). The Î±1-adrenergic agonist cirazoline and the Î²-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline were also able to activate Erk1/2 in a transient manner (Fig. 1, AâB), although to a lower extent than norepinephrine, indicating that the norepinephrine response was of a composite nature. In confirmation of this, the addition of cirazoline and BRL-37344 together gave 94 Â± 26% of the norepinephrine-induced level (mean of 2 experiments). Concerning the Î² effect, the Î²3 receptor agonist BRL-37344 (Fig. 1 A) as well as the Î²3 agonist CGP-12177 (Fig. 2 and3 B), which is an antagonist on Î²1 and Î²2 receptors (18Mohell N. Dicker A. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), were both able to induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation to the same extent as isoprenaline (which is an agonist on all three Î² receptors). That Î²3receptor stimulation is able to activate Erk1/2 phosphorylation is fully in agreement with earlier suggestions (4Gerhardt C.C. Gros J. Strosberg A.D. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Soeder K.J. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W. Luttrell L.M. Collins S. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Neither the Î²1 selective antagonist ICI-89406 (10 Î¼m) nor the Î²2 selective antagonist ICI-118551 (10 Î¼m) were able to inhibit the Î²-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation when added before isoprenaline (0.1 Î¼m, 5 min) (data not shown), in agreement with the absence of Î²2 receptors in these cells (10Bengtsson T. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the low or absent contribution of Î²1 receptors to cAMP accumulation (11Bronnikov G. Houstek J. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2006-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nisoli E. Tonello C. Landi M. Carruba M.O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Î² receptor activation seems to be solely through the Î²3 receptor.Figure 3Effect of pertussis toxin on induced cAMP levels and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. A, cultured brown adipocytes were pretreated with 200 ng/ml PTX for 1 h and stimulated with 1 Î¼m BRL-37344 and 10 Î¼madrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for 10 min, after which cAMP levels were analyzed as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The values are means Â± S.E. from one experiment with quadruplicate trials for each treatment.

As the Î±2 receptor antagonist yohimbine markedly increases norepinephrine-induced cAMP in these cells (13Bronnikov G. Bengtsson T. Kramarova L. Golozoubova V. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4185-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the absence of effect was not due to an absence of Gi-coupled Î±2receptors in these cells. In the light of the suggested ability of a Gi-coupled receptor to activate Erk1/2 (4Gerhardt C.C. Gros J. Strosberg A.D. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Soeder K.J. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W. Luttrell L.M. Collins S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), the absence of effect of Î±2-adrenoreceptor stimulation is therefore noteworthy. These results imply that Î±1- and Î²3-coupled receptors, but not Î±2-coupled receptors, may activate Erk1/2 activation in brown adipocytes. That Î²-adrenoreceptor stimulation can activate Erk1/2 is still controversial, and according to a novel hypothesis, Î²3-adrenoreceptor responses occur exclusively via non-cAMP-dependent pathways (4Gerhardt C.C. Gros J. Strosberg A.D. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Soeder K.J. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W. Luttrell L.M. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12017-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We found, however, that the cAMP-mimicking agent 8-bromo-cAMP (10 mm, 5 min) induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation (data not shown), as does dibutyryl-cAMP (14Shimizu Y. Tanishita T. Minokoshi Y. Shimazu T. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To substantiate that activation of adenylyl cyclase is responsible for the Î²3-adrenoreceptor activation of Erk1/2, we investigated the time course of forskolin-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. As seen in Fig. 1 C, forskolin was able to induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation (in agreement with earlier findings (15Lindquist J.M. Rehnmark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30147-30156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). The transient activation was correlated both temporarily and in extent to the isoprenaline-induced response (Fig. 1 B). Even in the presence of the Î²-antagonist propranolol (10 Î¼m, 5 min) during the experiment, forskolin (10 Î¼m, 5 min) was still able to induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation, implying that the presence of the Î²-adrenoreceptor in its activated form is not necessary for the forskolin effect (data not shown). Although the above experiments demonstrate that cAMP is able to mimic the Î²3-adrenergic activation of Erk1/2, this may not necessarily be the pathway used for Î²3-adrenergic mediation. To investigate whether the cAMP/PKA pathway is the one that mediates the Î²3 effect, we pretreated brown adipocytes with the PKA inhibitor H89 before stimulation with different adrenergic agonists (Fig. 2). Norepinephrine stimulation led to a reduction in the level of phosphorylation, but the reduction was not total, only about half that of the norepinephrine effect (Fig. 2). However, as norepinephrine stimulated Erk1/2 activation through both the Î±1 and the Î² pathway, it would not be anticipated that the Î±1 component should be sensitive to H89. Indeed, the Î±1 component (i.e. the cirazoline-induced) was not inhibited at all by H89, explaining the only partial inhibition of the norepinephrine effect. In contrast, isoprenaline-, CGP-12177- and BRL-37344-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylations were all totally abolished by H89 pretreatment. Also, the forskolin-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation could be abolished by H89 pretreatment. This is of particular interest as it indicates that the inhibition is indeed of a post-cyclase step and is not due to receptor antagonism by H89 of the type demonstrated for the Î²1- and Î²2-adrenoreceptor (20Penn R.B. Parent J.L. Pronin A.N. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Benovic J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 428-437PubMed Google Scholar) (furthermore, we have found no antagonism by H89 on Î²3 receptors in brown adipocytes 2J. M. Fredriksson, H. Thonberg, K. B. E. Ohlson, B. Cannon, and J. Nedergaard, unpublished observations. ). Thus, these results indicate that not only forskolin/cAMP-induced Erk1/2 activation is mediated via the PKA pathway, but that this is also the case for the Î²3-induced activation. These results are therefore in contrast to earlier reports in other systems, indicating that Î²3-adrenoreceptor-induced Erk1/2 activation was mediated by cAMP-independent pathways (4Gerhardt C.C. Gros J. Strosberg A.D. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Soeder K.J. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W. Luttrell L.M. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12017-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Concerning Î²-adrenergic activation of Erk1/2, two pathways have been suggested, both involving Gi. Thus, in Î²2-transfected HEK-293 cells, PKA is suggested to mediate a switch in receptor coupling from Gs to Gi, and it is further suggested that it is through this Gi-coupling that Erk1/2 is activated (21Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Similarly, as noted above, the Î²3-adrenoreceptor has been suggested to couple to Gi directly and thus activate Erk1/2 (4Gerhardt C.C. Gros J. Strosberg A.D. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Soeder K.J. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W. Luttrell L.M. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12017-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because both these suggestions ascribe an essential role to Gi in the mediation, we investigated if Gi was necessary for Erk1/2 activation in the brown adipocyte system. For this, we used the Gi inhibitor PTX. To demonstrate that PTX was effective in these cells, we first examined the effect of PTX on agonist-induced cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3 A). In the presence of PTX, the Î²3-adrenoreceptor and the adrenocorticotropic hormone-induced cAMP levels were much elevated, indicating a PTX-sensitive Gi-inhibitory effect. The experiment also demonstrated that Gi is active during Î²3stimulation, in agreement with earlier observations (5Soeder K.J. Snedden S.K. Cao W. Della Rocca G.J. Daniel K.W. Luttrell L.M.

Based on the above experiment, it was clear that PTX was able to inhibit Gi in our system. Therefore, to investigate the Gi involvement in Î²-adrenergic stimulation of Erk1/2 activation, brown adipocytes pretreated with PTX as above were stimulated with different adrenergic agonists. PTX pretreatment had no effect in itself on Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). However, unexpectedly, PTX was also fully unable to inhibit norepinephrine-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Whereas an inability to inhibit the Î±1-(cirazoline)-induced phosphorylation was expected, it was clear that it was also equally unable to inhibit Î²3-induced activation. Also, a long pre-incubation with PTX (100 ng/ml, 16 h) was fully unable to inhibit BRL-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation (not shown). PTX-sensitive Gi-proteins were therefore not required for activation of Erk1/2 in response to Î²3-adrenoreceptor stimulation in brown adipocytes. In certain systems, it has been reported that adrenergic receptors stimulate the Erk1/2 pathway through PI3K (4Gerhardt C.C. Gros J. Strosberg A.D. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To examine if this was also the case in the system here investigated, brown adipocytes were pretreated with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and then stimulated with norepinephrine or BRL-37344. The wortmannin pretreatment had no effect in itself on Erk1/2 phosphorylation, but it did inhibit insulin-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. However, wortmannin did not alter the norepinephrine- or BRL-37344-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4) (in agreement with Shimizu et al. (14Shimizu Y. Tanishita T. Minokoshi Y. Shimazu T. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). As PI3K has been discussed as a further mediator of Gi-coupled stimulation, the inability of wortmannin to inhibit adrenergically induced Erk1/2 activation may be considered compatible with the demonstration above that Gi is not the mediator of adrenergic stimulation. As the above experiments indicated that Î²3-adrenergic activation of Erk1/2 was not mediated via the suggested Gi/PI3K pathway, but rather via a classical cAMP/PKA pathway, the nature of the steps downstream of PKA activation required elucidation. In general, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk1/2 pathways has often been demonstrated to proceed via tyrosine kinases. To investigate whether also norepinephrine-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation was dependent on protein-tyrosine kinase activity, we used the non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. As shown in Fig.5, genistein fully inhibited norepinephrine-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. This implies that activation of Erk1/2 by norepinephrine requires tyrosine kinase activity, independent of whether the activation was mediated via Î²3- or Î±1-adrenoreceptor (although the tyrosine kinase involved, of course, does not have to be the same for the two receptors).

Although a defective gene has been identified in both humans and thenpc nih mouse model of NP-C disease, how this leads to abnormal neuronal function is unclear. Here we show that whereas embryonic striatal neurons from npc nih mice can take up low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol, its subsequent hydrolysis and esterification are significantly reduced. Given the importance of cholesterol to a variety of signal transduction mechanisms, we assessed the effect of this abnormality on the ability of these neurons to respond to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In contrast to its effects on wild type neurons, BDNF failed to induce autophosphorylation of the TrkB receptor and to increase neurite outgrowth in npc nih neurons, despite expression of TrkB on the cell surface. The results suggest that abnormal cholesterol metabolism occurs in neurons in the brain during NP-C disease, even at embryonic stages of development prior to the onset of phenotypic symptoms. Moreover, this defect is associated with a lack of TrkB function and BDNF responsiveness, which may contribute to the loss of neuronal function observed in NP-C disease.

For example, in the basal ganglia, distended neuronal cell somata with displaced nuclei, neurofibrillary tangles, and process degeneration are prevalent (12.Love S. Bridges L.R. Case P.

Despite the relative plethora of data describing morphological abnormalities, little is known about how neuronal function is compromised, when the biochemical and physiological abnormalities arise during development, or whether the defects originate in glia and/or neurons in NP-C disease.Previous studies have demonstrated that cultures from embryonic striata are advantageous for assessing neuronal differentiation and the actions of neurotrophic factors. These cells can be maintained in vitro in a defined, serum-free medium (14.Ventimiglia R. Mather P. Jones B.E. Lindsay R.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15.Ikeda Y. Nishiyama N. Saito H. Katsuki H. Dev.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes the differentiation of striatal neurons in vitro as it doesin vivo (14.Ventimiglia R. Mather P. Jones B.E. Lindsay R.M. Eur. J.

Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 513-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). These neurons also respond to neurotrophin-3, but not to nerve growth factor (14.Ventimiglia R. Mather P. Jones B.E. Lindsay R.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 18.Mizuno K. Carnahan J. Nawa H. Dev.

Brain Res. 1993; 17: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Recent evidence indicates that localization of sphingolipids and cholesterol in membrane domains, or âlipid rafts,â is essential for assembly and activity of specific transmembrane signaling complexes (for review see Refs. 22.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 397: 569-572Crossref Scopus (8019) Google Scholar and 23.Hooper N.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and implies that defects in cholesterol metabolism could interfere with neurotrophin signaling and neuronal differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that abnormalities in the metabolism of exogenously supplied LDL-derived cholesterol are evident in embryonic striatal neurons from npc nih mutant mice and that these deficits are accompanied by loss of BDNF-mediated neurite outgrowth and TrkB receptor activation. Consistent with this, TrkB activation also fails to occur in wild type striatal neurons depleted of cholesterol. The results are important for understanding neurotrophin-mediated signal transduction as well as the mechanisms underlying NP-C disease.DISCUSSIONNiemann-Pick type C disease is a progressive and fatal neuropathological disorder. Although this disease is associated with abnormal cholesterol metabolism in peripheral tissues, the basis for the progressive neurodegeneration and abnormal brain function is unclear. Here we show that although embryonic neurons from the brain of â/â npc nih mice can survive in vitroand are not grossly abnormal in appearance, they exhibit significant deficits in cholesterol metabolism, neurite outgrowth, and neurotrophin responsiveness, all of which may contribute to the progression of NP-C disease.Accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in peripheral fibroblasts is the diagnostic hallmark of NP-C disease, yet elevated cholesterol has not been reported in previous analyses of the brains of NP-C patients or npc nih mutant mice (1.Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Patterson M.C. Scriver C.R. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Frederickson D.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2625-2639Google Scholar, 2.Liscum L. Klansek J.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, we did not detect an abnormal accumulation of cholesterol in striatal neurons isolated from â/â npc nih mice at an embryonic stage of development. Studies in vivo suggest that minimal amounts of LDL-derived cholesterol are taken up by the brain, especially during embryonic and early postnatal development (39.Xie C. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11992-11997Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 52.Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Nutr. Metab. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1997; 7: 195-201Google Scholar). However, although it appears that neurons rely heavily on de novo synthesis of cholesterol during initial development (52.Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Nutr. Metab. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1997; 7: 195-201Google Scholar, 53.Turley S.D. Burns D.K. Rosenfeld C.R. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1953-1961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Jurevics H.A. Kidwai F.Z. Morell P. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been suggested that exogenous uptake, as part of cholesterol recycling in the brain, may be important for subsequent neuronal remodeling (Refs. 55.Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Foss D. Mahley R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar and 56.Weisgraber K.H. Roses A.D. Strittmatter W.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar and for discussion see Ref. 39.Xie C. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11992-11997Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, we show that embryonic striatal neurons take up exogenously supplied cholesterol linoleate. More important, we find that subsequent to its uptake, the neurons from â/ânpc nih mice exhibit significant deficits in their ability to hydrolyze and esterify this cholesterol. These results extend the findings of a previous study showing an impaired cholesterol metabolism in mixed cultures of glia and neurons from newborn â/ânpc nih mice (36.Patel S.C. Suresh S. Weintraub H. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) by providing direct evidence this abnormality occurs in neurons. Taken together, the findings suggest that in NP-C disease errors in neuronal cholesterol metabolism occur early in brain development and may have an accumulating influence as the remodeling of neuronal connections continues in the brain.Previous studies suggest that cholesterol is important for neurite outgrowth. In particular, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis impairs the neurite outgrowth from sympathetic neurons (41.de Chaves E.I. Rusinol A.E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30766-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), whereas exogenous cholesterol enhances neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion neurons (40.Handelmann G.E. Boyles J.K. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1677-1688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, interfering with LDL receptor-independent means by which cholesterol uptake may occur results in simplified dendritic arborizations from neurons of the central nervous system, including decreases in the number and average length of neurites (57.Narita M. Bu G. Holtzman D.M. Schwartz A.L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,58.Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Here we show that abnormal metabolism of cholesterol in neurons from â/â mice is accompanied by deficits in neurite outgrowth that mirror those reported in these previous studies, including a reduced number of primary neurites, fewer branch points, and diminished neurite length. Thus, the abnormal cholesterol metabolism associated with mutation of the NPC1 gene may ultimately compromise both the complexity and the maintenance of neuronal arbors and lead to eventual loss of neuronal function in NP-C disease.In addition to the observed deficiencies in cholesterol metabolism and neurite outgrowth, we show for the first time that striatal neurons from â/â npc nih mice do not respond to BDNF with an increase in neurite outgrowth. Errors in cholesterol metabolism in NP-C disease could potentially interfere with BDNF signaling in a variety of ways, as cholesterol and other lipid metabolites have important roles in multiple aspects of neuronal signal transduction. For example, sphingomyelin plays an important role in the signaling from the p75 neurotrophin receptor (59.Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, cholesterol is necessary for the covalent modification and function of molecules such as ras that are involved in neurotrophin signaling pathways (60.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 61.Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Finally, gangliosides, which are elevated in NP-C disease (1.Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Patterson M.C. Scriver C.R. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Frederickson D.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2625-2639Google Scholar,2.Liscum L. Klansek J.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), have been shown to alter receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (62.Weis F.M.B. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12059-12066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 63.Mutoh T. Tkuda A. Miyadai T. Hamaguchi M. Fujiki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Van Brocklyn J. J. Neuro-oncol. 1995; 24: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, because these aspects of signaling may be affected in NP-C disease, perhaps most consistent with our data from both wild type and mutant mice is the idea that the errors in cholesterol homeostasis that arise as a result of the NPC1 mutation interfere with TrkB signaling by altering lipid rafts. Specifically, recent studies have demonstrated that localization of sphingolipids and cholesterol in lipid rafts is essential for the assembly and activity of transmembrane signaling complexes in these specialized membrane domains (22.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 397: 569-572Crossref Scopus (8019) Google Scholar, 23.Hooper N.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 42.Masserini M. Palestrini P. Pitto M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Relevant to these studies, a previous report suggests that mutation of the NPC1 gene is associated with alterations in the cholesterol composition of the rafts isolated from peripheral tissues (66.Garver W.S. Erickson R.P. Wilson J.M. Colton T.L. Hossain G.S. Kozloski M.A. Heidenreich R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Chemical depletion of cholesterol from the cell surface disassembles raft-enriched membrane invaginations referred to as caveolae and interferes with the function of receptor tyrosine kinases (67.Liu P. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 68.Furuchi T. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). TrkA activation is also disrupted upon altered expression of caveolin-1 (46.Bilderback T.R. Valeswara-Rao G. Lisanti M.P. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a cholesterol-binding protein that plays a key role in controlling the level of cholesterol in the plasma membrane (69.Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 70.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We find that although the levels of TrkB protein are comparable in striatal neurons from wild type and mutant mice, the BDNF-induced autophosphorylation of TrkB was essentially eliminated in neurons from the â/â npc nih mice. Furthermore, TrkB activation was also abolished in wild type striatal neurons acutely depleted of cholesterol, consistent with the fact that the TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase is found in lipid rafts (43.Wu C. Butz S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). When taken together, the results support the assertion that the abnormal cholesterol metabolism associated with the NPC1 mutation interferes with BDNF responsiveness by altering lipid rafts and interfering with TrkB activation.Evidence suggests that BDNF and the activation of TrkB play prominent roles in the maintenance and modulation of neuronal function. For example, BDNF modulates axonal and dendritic arborization, the expression of peptides and calcium-binding proteins, and synaptic transmission (71.Gao W.-Q. Zheng J.L. Karihaloo M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2656-2667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 72.Patterson S.L. Abel T. Deuel T.A. Martin K.C. Rose J.C. Kandel E.R.

Neurosci. 1999; 22: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). TrkB signaling has also been shown to be important in the mature nervous system, as indicated by recent experiments in which expression of this receptor was conditionally knocked out in forebrain neurons of postnatal mice. Although the knockout did not result in gross abnormalities in brain structure, these animals exhibited selective deficits in both synaptic and cognitive functions (75.Minichiello L. Korte M. Wolfer D. KuÌhn R. Unsicker K. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Lipp H.-P. Bonhoeffer T. Klein R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 401-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Thus, our finding that neurons from â/ânpc nih mice exhibit deficits in BDNF-mediated TrkB signaling may not only provide a basis for understanding the aberrant neuronal morphology described in these animals but may also provide insight into the cognitive deficits that characterize the postnatal progression of NP-C disease. Finally, by identifying specific cellular and molecular deficits in neuronal function in NP-C disease, our results provide insight not only into the neuropathology of this disorder but also into neurotrophin signaling and the functional significance of cholesterol in the brain. Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C)1 disease is a fatal, autosomal recessive disorder resulting in progressive central nervous system deterioration and premature death. Analysis of this disorder has benefited from feline and murine (npc nih mutant mice) models that recapitulate much of the human pathology (for review see Refs. 1.Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K.

For example, both NP-C patients andnpc nih mutant mice are characteristically asymptomatic at birth. Tremor and ataxia occur later, and innpc nih mutant mice these symptoms appear after approximately 1 month (3.Morris M.D. Bhuvaneswaran C. Shio H. Fowler S. Am. J.

The NPC1 protein is thought to be important for cholesterol trafficking and metabolism (2.Liscum L. Klansek J.J. Curr. Opin.

Despite the fact that progressive neurological deterioration is ultimately the cause of premature death, neither the levels of cholesterol nor of phospholipids are grossly elevated innpc nih mutant mouse brain (1 and 2) leaving the basis for this deterioration unknown. Postmortem studies have characterized widespread anatomical abnormalities in brains of both humans and animals with NP-C disease (1.Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Patterson M.C. Scriver C.R.

The severest pathology is often in regions involved with extrapyramidal motor control, including cerebellum, basal ganglia, red nucleus, and spinal cord (3.Morris M.D. Bhuvaneswaran C. Shio H.

For example, in the basal ganglia, distended neuronal cell somata with displaced nuclei, neurofibrillary tangles, and process degeneration are prevalent (12.Love S. Bridges L.R. Case P.

Despite the relative plethora of data describing morphological abnormalities, little is known about how neuronal function is compromised, when the biochemical and physiological abnormalities arise during development, or whether the defects originate in glia and/or neurons in NP-C disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that cultures from embryonic striata are advantageous for assessing neuronal differentiation and the actions of neurotrophic factors. These cells can be maintained in vitro in a defined, serum-free medium (14.Ventimiglia R. Mather P. Jones B.E. Lindsay R.M. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2088305283,"Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP) is a major glycoprotein associated with human urine that binds pro-inflammatory cytokines and also inhibits in vitro T cell proliferation induced by specific antigens. THP derived from human pregnancy urine (designated uromodulin) has previously been shown to be 13-fold more effective as an inhibitor of antigen-induced T cell proliferation than THP obtained from other sources. Structural analysis of human THP and uromodulin has for the first time revealed that these glycoproteins areO-glycosylated. THP from nonpregnant females and males expresses primarily core 1 type O-glycans terminated with either sialic acid or fucose but not the sialyl Lewisxepitope. By contrast, the O-glycans linked to uromodulin include unusual core 2 type glycans terminated with one, two, or three sialyl Lewisx sequences. The specific association of these unusual carbohydrate sequences with uromodulin could explain its enhanced immunomodulatory effects compared with THP obtained from males and nonpregnant females. Analysis of THP from one of the pregnant females 2 months postpartum showed a reversion of theO-glycan profile to that found for a non-pregnant female. These data suggest that the glycosylation state of uromodulin could be under the regulation of steroidal hormones produced during pregnancy. The significant physiological implications of these observations are discussed.

The significant physiological implications of these observations are discussed. Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry interleukin Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP)1 is the most abundant glycoprotein in human urine (1.Tamm I. Horsfall F.L. J. Exp. Med. 1952; 95: 71-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 2.Tamm I. Horsfall F.L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1950; 74: 108-114Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The precise physiological role of THP remains enigmatic, despite considerable investigation of this glycoprotein over the past 50 years. THP was shown to block hemagglutination induced by influenza, mumps, and Newcastle disease viruses (1.Tamm I. Horsfall F.L. J. Exp. Med. 1952; 95: 71-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 2.Tamm I. Horsfall F.L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1950; 74: 108-114Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). THP has been postulated to be essential for protecting the kidneys from bacterial infections (3.Orskov I. Ferencz A. Orskov F. Lancet. 1980; 1: 887Abstract PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 4.Orskov I. Orskov F. Birch-Andersen A. Infect. Immun. 1980; 27: 657-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). THP has also been implicated as a potential component necessary for maintenance of the electrolyte balance in the nephron (5.Mattey M. Naftalin L. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, THP may also play a significant role in several pathological conditions involving the kidney, including acute renal failure, urinary tract infection, stone formation, and interstitial nephritis (6.Hoyer J.R. Seiler M.W. Kidney Int. 1979; 16: 279-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In 1973, two studies (7.Adcock E.W.D. Teasdale T. August C.S. Cox S. Meschia G. Ballaglia T.C. Naughton M.A. Science. 1973; 181: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8.Contractor S.F. Davies H. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 243: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) suggested that human chorionic gonadotropin isolated from pregnancy urine suppressed specific immune activitiesin vitro. However, this immunosuppressive activity turned out to be due to a contaminant of the human chorionic gonadotropin preparation (9.Muchmore A.V. Blaese R.M. J. Immunol. 1977; 118: 881-886PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Caldwell J.L. Stites D.P. Fudenberg H.H. J. Immunol. 1975; 115: 1249-1253PubMed Google Scholar). Muchmore and Decker (11.Muchmore A.V. Decker J.M. Science. 1985; 229: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) later used lectin affinity chromatography, gel separation, and isoelectric focusing to purify a glycoprotein from human pregnancy urine that mediated this immunosuppressive activity. They designated this glycoprotein âuromodulinâ to account for its origin and its immunomodulatory activities. Amino acid sequence analysis (12.Hession C. Decker J.M. Sherblom A.P. Kumar S. Yue C.C. Mattaliano R.J. Tizard R. Kawashima E. Schmeissner U. Heletky S. Chow E.P. Burne C.A. Shaw A. Muchmore A.V.

Science. 1987; 236: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) revealed that uromodulin represented THP glycoforms produced during pregnancy. Uromodulin was initially shown to inhibit antigen-induced T cell proliferation at relatively low concentrations (11.Muchmore A.V. Decker J.M. Science. 1985; 229: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Subsequent investigations by Muchmore and colleagues (14.Muchmore A.V. Decker J.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2541-2546PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Sherblom A.P. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5418-5424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Sherblom A.P. Sathyamoorthy N. Decker J.M. Muchmore A.V. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 939-944PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that uromodulin could also bind to recombinant interleukin-1 and recombinant interleukin-2 and recombinant tumor necrosis factor via its oligosaccharide sequences. The glycans associated with uromodulin have been proposed to be essential for its immunosuppressive and cytokine binding activities (12.Hession C. Decker J.M. Sherblom A.P. Kumar S. Yue C.C. Mattaliano R.J. Tizard R. Kawashima E. Schmeissner U. Heletky S. Chow E.P. Burne C.A. Shaw A. Muchmore A.V. Science. 1987; 237: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 14.Muchmore A.V.

By contrast, another study indicated that both THP and uromodulin would bind to IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor but only after these cytokines were either denatured or immobilized on solid surfaces (17.Moonen P. Gaffner R. Wingfield P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 226: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, a more recent study indicates that oligosaccharides associated with THP block IL-1 binding to immune effector cells and to an IL-1-dependent cell line (18.Tandai-Hiruma M. Endo T. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4459-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The investigators in this study (18.Tandai-Hiruma M. Endo T. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4459-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) also provided strong evidence that N-linked glycans terminated with GalNAc, and a sulfate group mediates these immunomodulatory activities in vitro. This demonstration that THP or its derivative oligosaccharides can also mediate cytokine bindings, and specific responses in immune cells suggests that this glycoprotein is functionally equivalent to uromodulin. However, Muchmore and co-workers (12.Hession C. Decker J.M. Sherblom A.P. Kumar S. Yue C.C. Mattaliano R.J. Tizard R. Kawashima E. Schmeissner U. Heletky S. Chow E.P. Burne C.A. Shaw A. Muchmore A.V. Science. 1987; 237: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) suggested that uromodulin was a 13-fold more active inhibitor of antigen-specific T cell proliferation than THP. The observation that THP and uromodulin express identical polypeptide sequences suggests that pregnancy-related changes in post-translational modifications could be responsible for their differential immunosuppressive activities. The present investigation was undertaken to determine if THP and uromodulin are differentially glycosylated. Several pregnancy associated changes in the glycosylation of THP were found, the most notable being that uromodulin specifically expresses unusual core 2 type O-linked glycans terminated with up to three sialyl Lewisx sequences. THP or uromodulin was purified from urine from a range of individuals. Each sample was prepared individually. THP was isolated using the same procedure originally employed by Tamm and Horsfall (1.Tamm I. Horsfall F.L. J. Exp. Med. 1952; 95: 71-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The urine sample was adjusted to pH 7.0 using sodium hydroxide. Sodium chloride was then added and dissolved to give a final concentration of 0.58 mNaCl. The sample was then left at 4 Â°C for 5 h followed by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was removed and the precipitate resuspended in 2 ml of 0.58 m sodium chloride. The sample was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was again removed and the precipitate resuspended in 2 ml of water. This purified THP/uromodulin was then transferred into a regenerated cellulose dialysis membrane with 12â14-kDa nominal molecular weight cutoff (Cellu-Sep) and dialyzed against 4 Ã 2.5 liters of water at 4 Â°C, the water being changed at 12-h intervals for 2 days. After dialysis the THP/uromodulin was lyophilized. THP/uromodulin was subject to reduction and carboxymethylation of SâS-bridged cysteine residues as described previously (19.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. in Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar) with three modifications. First, the reduction was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere; second, the iodoacetic acid incubation was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere at 37 Â°C; and third, the reaction was terminated and desalted by dialysis against 4 Ã 2.5 liters of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, at 4 Â°C for 2 days, the dialysate being changed every 12 h. After dialysis the sample was lyophilized. THP/uromodulin was digested with trypsin using a 1:100 w/w ratio of trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4, Sigma) to THP/uromodulin as described (19.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. in Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). The incubation period for the digestion was 5 h. Following termination of the digestion the sample was lyophilized. THP/uromodulin was digested with 3 units of peptide N-glycosidase F (EC3.5.1.52, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described (19.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. in Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by lyophilization, and the released N-glycans were separated from peptides and O-glycopeptides by Sep-Pak as described (19.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. in Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Prior to loading onto the conditioned Sep-Pak the sample was dissolved in 200 Î¼l of 5% acetic acid. TrypticO-glycopeptides from uromodulin, present in the 20% 1-propyl alcohol Sep-Pak fraction, were dissolved in 50 mmammonium acetate, pH 4.5, and digested with 25 milliunits of V. cholerae neuraminidase (EC 3.2.1.18, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 24 h at 37 Â°C. Following digestion the sample was lyophilized. THP/uromodulin was subject to reductive elimination as described (19.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. in Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Following termination of the reaction using glacial acetic acid, the 20 and 40% 1-propyl alcohol fractions were combined prior to Dowex chromatography. The released O-glycans were dissolved in 50 Î¼l of hydrofluoric acid (Sigma) and placed on ice for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by drying under a stream of nitrogen. A solution of 2 mm sodium periodate in 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, was prepared, wrapped in foil, and placed in the fridge for 1 h. Released, driedO-glycans were then dissolved in 50 Î¼l of this reagent, wrapped in foil, and placed on ice in the fridge overnight. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 Î¼l of ethylene glycol and lyophilized. The products of periodate cleavage were reduced using 200 Î¼l of a 10 mg/ml solution of sodium borohydride in 2m ammonium hydroxide. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by addition of glacial acetic acid until all the sodium borohydride had been neutralized. The sample was subject to Dowex chromatography, borate removal, permethylation, and Sep-Pak clean up using an acetonitrile gradient as described (19.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. in Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Released glycans were permethylated using the sodium hydroxide procedure and purified by Sep-Pak using an acetonitrile gradient as described (19.Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. in Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from the permethylated glycans as described (20.Albersheim P. Nevins D.J. English P.D. Karr A. Carbohydr. Res. 1967; 5: 340-345Crossref Scopus (1515) Google Scholar) and analyzed by gas chromatography-MS. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometric analysis of permethylated glycans was performed using a ZAB 2SE 2FPD double-focusing mass spectrometer fitted with a cesium ion gun operating at 30 kV. The matrix used was monothioglycerol, and all samples were dissolved in methanol prior to loading. Data were collected and analyzed using VG OpusÂ® software. Linkage analysis of partially methylated alditol acetates was carried out using an MD 800 gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a 30 m Ã 0.25 mm inner diameter RTX-5 fused silica capillary column (Restek Corp.). The sample was dissolved in hexanes and injected onto the column at 65 Â°C. The column was held at this temperature for 1 min and then increased to 290 Â°C at a rate of 8 Â°C per min. THP or uromodulin were isolated as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ from urine samples of three males, three non-pregnant females, and two pregnant females. Additionally THP was isolated from one of the pregnant females 2 months postpartum. All samples exhibited a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at about 90 kDa (data not shown). Peptide mapping by FAB-MS confirmed the presence of the THP polypeptide (data not shown). Putative O-glycans were released by reductive elimination, permethylated, and purified on a Sep-Pak cartridge that was eluted with a stepwise gradient of aqueous acetonitrile. The permethylated glycans, which were recovered in the 35 and 50% acetonitrile fractions, were analyzed by FAB-MS and linkage analysis. Under the conditions used for reductive elimination, a portion of theN-glycans is also released. Their presence was taken into account in the interpretation of the FAB and linkage data. FAB-MS analyses of the 35% acetonitrile fractions from male THP showed several low molecular weight O-glycans, the most abundant of which (m/z 895 and 1256) were present in all three samples (Fig. 1 and TableI). These masses correspond to compositions NeuAcHexHexNAcitol and NeuAc2HexHexNAcitol, respectively, and are consistent with sialylated and desialylated T-antigen structures (NeuAcÎ±2â3GalÎ²1â3GalNAc and NeuAcÎ±2â3GalÎ²1â3(NeuAcÎ±2â6)GalNAc). These simple core 1 type glycans are found in many glycoproteins including glycophorin, erythropoietin, and plasminogen. There is some variation between individuals with respect to the relative abundance of the above two glycans and the compositions of minor structures present (Table I). For example, m/z 1140 (NeuAcHexHexNAcHexNAcitol) was detected in only two samples. This glycan probably carries the Sdaantigen (GalNAcÎ²1â4(NeuAcÎ±2â3)GalÎ²1-)which is known to be present on the antennae of THP N-glycans (21.Hard K. Van Zadelhoff G. Moonen P. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 895-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The 50% acetonitrile fractions showed molecular ions attributable to high mannose N-glycans (Fig. 1 b and Table I). These are readily identifiable because of their unique compositions and because they exhibit pairs of molecular ions separated by 16 mass units due to the incomplete reduction that is characteristic ofN-glycans released under reductive elimination conditions.O-Glycans, in contrast, are fully reduced under the conditions employed in our experiments. No significant signals corresponding to O-glycans were observed in the 50% fraction.Table IAssignments of molecular ([M + Na] +) and A-type fragment ions detected in the FAB-mass spectra of permethylated glycans derived from three male (M1âM3) and three female (F1âF3) THP samplesSignal (m/z)CompositionM1M2M3F1F2F3 534HexHexNAcRâ(â)(â)(â)ââ 779HexHexNAcHexNAcRâââ(â)â(â) 895NeuAcHexHexNAcRââââââ 953FucHexHexNAcHexNAcRââââââ 983Hex2HexNAcHexNAcRâ(â)(â)âââ1070NeuAcHexHexNAc2+ââââââ1140NeuAcHexHexNAcHexNAcRââââââ1157FucHex2HexNAcHexNAcRââ(â)(â)ââ1256NeuAc2HexHexNAcRââââââ1331Fuc2Hex2HexNAcHexNAcRââ(â)âââ1344NeuAcHex2HexNAcHexNAcRâ(â)(â)âââ1484 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex6HexNAc+ââââââ1580 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex5HexNAc2âââ(â)ââ1596 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex5HexNAcHexNAcRâ(â)â(â)ââ1688 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex7HexNAc+(â)âââââ1784 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex6HexNAc2ââââââ1800 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex6HexNAcHexNAcRââââââ1836 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.FucHex3HexNAc4ââââââ1852 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.FucHex3HexNAc3HexNAcRââââââ1988 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex7HexNAc2ââââââ2004 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex7HexNAcHexNAcRââââââMajor components are shown by check marks and minor components by check marks in parentheses.

Fig. 2 and Table I show FAB data obtained from the analysis of THP from a single female. Data from a further two females are also shown in Table I. Comparison with the male data allows the following conclusions to be drawn. (i) The two major glycans observed in the male (NeuAc1,2HexHexNAcitol) are also found in female THP, but their abundance varies significantly between individuals and is generally lower in females than males. (ii) Like the male, the non-pregnant female appears to contain relatively simpleO-glycans containing no more than six sugar residues. (iii) In two of the samples analyzed, an abundant signal at m/z1157 was detected corresponding to FucHex2HexNAcHexNAcitol. One of these two samples also exhibited a minor signal corresponding to the presence of a second fucose residue (m/z 1331). These glycans probably contain Lewisx/a structures (GalÎ²1â4/3(FucÎ±1â3/4)GlcNAcÎ²1), evidence for which is provided by a fragment ion at m/z 638 (A-type fragment ion of composition FucHexHexNAc+). Fig.3 a and TableII show FAB data obtained from the analysis of the 50% Sep-Pak fraction of permethylated glycans from uromodulin obtained from a single pregnant female. Data from a second pregnant female are also shown in Table II. The data show striking differences when compared with THP. The most notable feature is the presence of major molecular ions corresponding to largeO-glycans rich in fucose and sialic acid which are completely absent in the THP samples. The most abundant of these components are observed at m/z 1519 (NeuAcFucHex2HexNAcHexNAcitol), m/z 1880 (NeuAc2FucHex2HexNAcHexNAcitol), andm/z 2504 (NeuAc2Fuc2Hex3HexNAc2HexNAcitol). Weaker signals are present at higher mass that correspond to largerO-glycans carrying additional fucosyl and sialyl residues up to a composition of NeuAc3Fuc3Hex4HexNAc3HexNAcitol (m/z 3487). The abundant signal at m/z 999 (NeuAcHexHexNAcFuc+) is consistent with the presence of either sialyl Lewisx or sialyl Lewisa. The majority of the putative Lewis epitopes are sialylated since a signal at m/z 638 (not shown), representing FucHexHexNAc+, is minor compared with m/z 999. No signals were detected for fragment ions corresponding to lactosamine repeats, indicating that the higher mass structures are most likely produced by branching of O-glycans rather than chain elongation.Table IIAssignments of the molecular ([M + Na] +) and A-type fragment ions detected in the FAB-mass spectra of permethylated glycans derived from uromodulinSignal (m/z)CompositionPregnant female 1Pregnant female 2 534HexHexNAcRââ 779HexHexNAcHexNAcRââ 895NeuAcHexHexNAcRââ 953FucHexHexNAcHexNAcRââ 983Hex2HexNAcHexNAcRââ1140NeuAcHexHexNAcHexNAcR(â)â1157FucHex2HexNAcHexNAcRâ(â)1256NeuAc2HexHexNAcRââ1331Fuc2Hex2HexNAcHexNAcR(â)(â)1344NeuAcHex2HexNAcHexNAcRââ1519NeuAcFucHex2HexNAcHexNAcRââ1580 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex5HexNAc2ââ1596 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex5HexNAcHexNAcRââ1693NeuAcFuc2Hex2HexNAcHexNAcRââ1784 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex6HexNAc2ââ1800 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex6HexNAcHexNAcRââ1880NeuAc2FucHex2HexNAcHexNAcRââ1938NeuAcFuc2Hex2HexNAc2HexNAcRââ1988 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex7HexNAc2ââ2004 aSignals correspond toN-glycans.Hex7HexNAcHexNAcRââ2142NeuAcFuc2Hex3HexNAc2HexNAcRâ(â)2504NeuAc2Fuc2Hex3HexNAc2HexNAcRââ2748NeuAc2Fuc2Hex3HexNAc3HexNAcRâ(â)2952NeuAc2Fuc2Hex4HexNAc3HexNAcRâ(â)3126NeuAc2Fuc3Hex4HexNAc3HexNAcRââ3313NeuAc3Fuc2Hex4HexNAc3HexNAcRâ(â)3487NeuAc3Fuc3Hex4HexNAc3HexNAcRâ(â)Major components are shown by check marks and minor components by check marks in parentheses.

Analysis of THP/uromodulin isolated from the first pregnant female 2 months after birth of a male baby showed a dramatic change in the O-glycan profile (Fig.3 b). Notably the sialylated and fucosylatedO-glycans observed in uromodulin had virtually disappeared (for example, compare m/z 1519, 1880, and 2504 in Fig. 3,a and b), whereas the profile of smallO-glycans that eluted in the 35% Sep-Pak fraction was largely unaffected and was similar to the non-pregnant state (Fig.4, a and b). Reductively eliminated glycans from uromodulin were subjected to hydrofluoric acid defucosylation, and the products of the reaction were permethylated and analyzed by FAB-MS after Sep-Pak purification. The data show that the signals attributed to fucose containing O-glycans (Table II) have either disappeared or are considerably reduced in intensity (compare Fig.5, a and b). New signals are present (Fig. 5 b) consistent with loss of fucose from the original structures such as m/z 1344 (loss of fucose from m/z 1519) and m/z 1706 (loss of fucose from m/z 1880). The fragment ion originally present at m/z 999, representing a possible sialyl Lewis epitope, has also virtually disappeared. The signal at m/z 825 (NeuAcHexHexNAc+ fragment ion) is more intense than was originally detected. This product is expected following the defucosylation of the putative sialyl Lewis epitope. Tryptic glycopeptides were desialylated using V. cholerae sialidase, and glycans were released by reductive elimination, permethylated, and analyzed by FAB-MS. The data showed the loss of signals with compositions consistent with the presence of sialic acid (compare Fig.6, a and b). New signals were observed at the expected desialylated masses. Thus loss of one and two sialic acids, respectively, from m/z 1519 and 1880 yields m/z 1157, whereas similar losses fromm/z 2142 and 2504 yields m/z 1781. The new signals at m/z 2230 and 2404 represent desialylation of the higher mass structures shown in Fig. 6 a, specificallym/z 2230 is derived from m/z 2952 and 3313, andm/z 2404 is derived from m/z 3126 and 3487. The sialyl Lewisx/a fragment ion (m/z 999) disappeared concomitant with a significant increase in the signal atm/z 638 (FucHexHexNAc+), consistent with the loss of sialic acid from this epitope. Mild periodate oxidation cleaves linear sections of sugar structures if vicinal hydroxyl groups are present. Thus, with respect to the O-glycans of uromodulin, the GalNAcitol and any sialic acids are sensitive to this reagent. Reductively eliminated glycans were subjected to mild periodate oxidation followed by reduction, permethylation, Sep-Pak clean up, and FAB-MS analysis. The FAB data for the 35 and 50% Sep-Pak fractions (Fig. 7, a and b,respectively, and Table III) showed molecular ions consistent with periodate cleavage of the GalNAcitol residue producing two distinct sets of products, one containing the C-1 to C-4 carbons of the GalNAcitol (denoted C-4) attached to the 3-linked antenna(e), and the other containing the C-5 and C-6 carbons (denoted C-2) attached to the 6-linked antenna(e). Thus, m/z 719, 1069, 1342, 1587, 1791, 1967, 2065, and 2240 are attributable to 3-linked antennae because their masses are consistent with the presence of a C-4 moiety at the reducing end (Table III). Similarly,m/z 562, 736, 835, and 1009 are consistent with 6-linked antennae (attached to the C-2 moiety). From these data it is evident that the sialyl Lewisx/a epitope is present on both 3-linked (m/z 1342) and 6-linked (m/z 1009) antennae, although the significantly larger signal at m/z1009 compared with m/z 1342 indicates that attachment to carbon 6 is more common in these smaller structures. The higher mass signals corresponding to 3-linked antennae have compositions consistent with the possible presence of lactosamine repeats. However, the absence of A-type fragment ions characteristic of polylactosamine sequences in the spectra of the intact glycans (see, for example Fig. 3 a) suggests that polylactosamine structures are unlikely to be present. Consequently 3-linked antennae of compositions NeuAcFuc2Hex3HexNAc2-C-4, NeuAc2FucHex3HexNAc2-C-4, and NeuAc2Fuc2Hex3HexNAc2-C-4 are likely to be branched. Their compositions are consistent with the presence of two sialyl Lewisx epitopes.Table IIIAssignments of molecular ions ([M + Na] +) of reductively eliminated uromodulin O-glycans following periodate treatment, reduction, and permethylationMass (m/z)Composition35% acetonitrile fraction 562HexHexNAc-C2 719NeuAcHex-C4 736FucHexHexNAc-C2 835NeuAcHexHexNAc-C2 1009NeuAcFucHexHexNAc-C2 1069FucHex2HexNAc-C4 1342NeuAcFucHex2HexNAc-C450% acetonitrile fraction 1587NeuAcFucHex2HexNAc2-C4 1791NeuAcFucHex3HexNAc2-C4 1967NeuAcFuc2Hex3HexNAc2-C4 2065NeuAc2FucHex3HexNAc2-C4 2240NeuAc2Fuc2Hex3HexNAc2-C4See text for explanation of C-2 and C-4.

https://openalex.org/W2335019470,"Phosphorylation/inactivation of RB is typically required for cell cycle progression. However, we have identified a tumor cell line, C33A, which progresses through the cell cycle in the presence of an active allele of RB (PSM-RB). To determine how C33A cells evade RB-mediated arrest, we compared RB signaling to downstream effectors in this resistant cell line to that of the RB-sensitive SAOS-2 cell line. Although introduction of PSM-RB repressed E2F-mediated transcription in both C33A and SAOS-2 cells, PSM-RB failed to repress Cyclin A promoter activity in C33A. Ectopic expression of PSM-RB in SAOS-2 cells resulted in a decrease in both Cyclin A and Cdk2 protein levels without affecting Cyclin E or Cdk4. In contrast, over-expression of PSM-RB in C33A cells did not alter endogenous Cyclin A, Cyclin E, or Cdk2 protein levels or impact Cdk2 kinase activity, indicating that signaling from RB to down-stream targets is abrogated in this cell line. The importance of Cdk2 activity was demonstrated by p27Kip1, which attenuated Cdk2 activity and inhibited cell cycle progression in C33A cells. Since RB signaling to Cdk2 is disrupted in these tumor cells, we co-expressed two proteins that cooperate with RB in transcriptional repression, AHR and BRG-1, in an attempt to correct this signaling dysfunction. Co-expression of AHR/BRG-1 with PSM-RB attenuated Cyclin A and Cdk2 expression as well as Cdk2-associated kinase activity, resulting in cell cycle inhibition of C33A cells. Importantly, ectopic expression of Cyclin A was able to reverse the arrest mediated by co-expression of AHR/BRG-1 with PSM-RB. These results indicate that down-regulation of Cdk2 activity is requisite for RB-mediated cell cycle arrest. Thus, this study reveals a new mechanism through which tumor cells evade anti-proliferative signals, and provides insight into how RB-signaling is mediated."

After light-induced isomerization and early photointermediates, the receptor reaches a G-protein-dependent equilibrium between active and inactive conformations distinguished by the protonation of key opsin residues. In this report, we study the role of the 9-methyl group of retinal, one of the crucial steric determinants of light activation. We find that when this group is removed, the protonation equilibrium is strongly shifted to the inactive conformation. The residually formed active species is very similar to the active form of normal rhodopsin, metarhodopsin II. It has a deprotonated Schiff base, binds to the retinal G-protein transducin, and is favored at acidic pH. Our data show that the normal proton transfer reactions are inhibited in 9-demethyl rhodopsin but are still mandatory for receptor activation. We propose that retinal and its 9-methyl group act as a scaffold for opsin to adjust key proton donor and acceptor side chains for the proton transfer reactions that stabilize the active conformation.

It is composed of the apoprotein opsin comprising seven transmembrane helices (TMs)1 and the chromophore 11-cis-retinal, which is covalently bound to Lys296 in TM7 via a protonated Schiff base (SB), keeps the receptor in the inactive conformation, and acts as a highly effective inverse agonist. Following the absorption of a photon, the retinal isomerizes to a strained all-trans-conformation (1.Ganter U.M. GaÌrtner W. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7480-7488Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which induces a series of conformational rearrangements of the opsin moiety. The final product of this reaction sequence is the active conformation (R*) that contains all-trans-retinal as a covalently bound agonist and is capable of catalyzing the activation of the retinal G-protein transducin (Gt) (for reviews see Refs. 2.Stryer L.

These events can be summarized as shown in Fig.1 A). Aftercis-trans-isomerization and initial, short lived intermediates, illuminated rhodopsin progresses from the lumirhodopsin form to the first long lived state, metarhodopsin I (meta I). Up to and including meta I, the SB of the pigment remains protonated. Deprotonation of the SB and protonation of its counterion Glu113 mark the transition from the meta I (Î»max = 478 nm) to the metarhodopsin II (meta II) conformation (5.JaÌger F. Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P.

The 9-methyl group of the retinal, which has been shown to interact directly with the Gly121 residue of opsin in the middle of TM3 (21.Han M. Groesbeek M. Sakmar T.P. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), is known to be one of the crucial steric determinants of photoactivation. Removal of this group (see Fig.2) causes steric defects that reduce the ability of the pigment to progress to the meta II state and impair its catalytic efficiency (23.Ganter U.M. Schmid E.D. Perez-Sala D. Rando R.R. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5954-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, B and C,summarize the two conceivable reaction pathways that may be adopted by the defective pigment formed with this chromophore. Either a breakdown of the steric mechanisms prevents light-activated 9-demethyl (9-dm) rhodopsin from reaching the protonation equilibrium and instead causes the formation of a weakly active product (b) or the lack of retinal's 9-methyl group allows the photoreaction to proceed to the protonation equilibrium, but shifts this equilibrium in favor of the inactive conformation analogous to meta I (c). Experimental results until now have not been able to decide between the two possibilities. In the present study, we provide proof that c is the correct scheme. We show that illuminated 9-dm rhodopsin is in an equilibrium between SB-protonated and SB-deprotonated forms that is strongly shifted toward the protonated form when compared with the normal pigment. Further, we show that this equilibrium is affected by transducin and pH much like the meta I â meta II equilibrium of the wild type pigment. We also find that many of the defects of this pigment can be rescued by the replacement mutation E134Q, 2Pigments consisting of the opsin with the Glu â Gln replacement at position 134 are designated by E134Q. which has previously been shown to mimic the effects of proton uptake (12.Fahmy K.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Mark Hirschel (National Center for Research Resources and the National Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN) and was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) largely following the manufacturer's instructions.n-Dodecyl-Î²-d-maltoside (dodecyl maltoside, DM) was purchased from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). Reagents for tissue culture were from Life Technologies, Inc. or Sigma. COS-1 cells (ATCC No. CRL-1650) were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mammalian expression vectors for wild type opsin and the rhodopsin mutant E134Q (27.Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. T. P. Sakmar (Rockefeller University, New York). Completeâ¢ protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and was used at a concentration of 1 tablet/75 ml of buffer. Expression of opsin genes was performed basically as described (28.Oprian D.D. Meth. Neurosci. 1993; 15: 301-306Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: COS-1 cells were grown in monolayer in plastic cell culture roller bottles (surface area 850 cm2) under a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2at 37 Â°C. Growth medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter d-glucose and 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate, supplemented with 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. At 80â95% confluence, transient transfection of the cells was initiated using a transfection mixture composed of 150 Î¼g of plasmid DNA, 6 ml of 1 m Tris buffer (pH 7.4), 48 ml of serum-free growth medium, and 6 ml of DEAE-dextran stock solution (2.5 mg/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). After 5.5 h, the transfection mixture was replaced with 75 ml of 0.1 mm chloroquine in growth medium for 90 min. The cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and further incubated in growth medium until harvest 64â68 h later. By incubation with 1 mm Na2EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0) for 10 min, cells expressing the apoproteins were detached from the plastic surface. The cell suspension was supplemented with protease inhibitors and incubated with 30 Î¼m (final concentration) 11-cis-retinal or 9-demethyl-11-cis-retinal, respectively, for 2â4 h at 4 Â°C to reconstitute the pigment. The rhodopsins were purified by immunoaffinity adsorption based on a procedure described by Oprian et al. (29.Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were solubilized by the addition of dodecyl maltoside (1% (w/v) final concentration), and nuclei were removed by centrifugation. Pigments from two roller bottles were incubated with 1D4-Sepharose and washed twice with 0.03% (w/v) DM in phosphate-buffered saline and once with elution buffer (0.015% (w/v) DM, 10 mm BTP, pH 6.0; 50 ml/wash). Elution of the pigments from the 1D4-Sepharose was carried out in elution buffer supplemented with 100 Î¼m peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 18 amino acids of rhodopsin. Gtwas purified from bovine retinae essentially as described (30.Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8220-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and stored in 20 mm BTP, pH 7.1, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The first three steps of the synthesis of 9-demethyl-retinal were performed according to the following procedure of Van den Tempel and Huisman (31.Van den Tempel P.J. Huisman H.O. Tetrahedron. 1966; 22: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar): oxidation of Î²-ionone with sodium hypochlorite, reduction of the resulting acid with LiAlH4, followed by reoxidation with MnO2resulted in 3-(2,6,6-trimethyl-cyclohexene-1-yl)-2-propenal. Elongation of the chain was achieved by Wittig-Horner coupling of the aldehyde with 2-(diethylphosphono)-acetonitrile and subsequent reduction with diisopropylaluminiumhydride, followed by a second Wittig-Horner coupling with 4-(diethylphosphono)-3-methyl-2-butene-nitrile. Subsequent reduction of the nitrile with diisopropylaluminiumhydride formed 9-demethyl-retinal. The all-trans isomer was separated by silicagel column chromatography (n-hexane/15% diethylether). Irradiation of a solution of the all-transisomer of 9-demethylretinal in acetonitrile (1 mg/ml, GE EHJ 250 W with a Schott KG5-Filter, 120 min) resulted in a photostationary mixture of six geometric isomers (20% 11-cis isomer), which were separated by isocratic preparative HPLC (Kromasil Si-100â5 Î¼,n-hexane, 7% diethylether) and characterized by1H NMR spectroscopy. The purity of the isolated 11-cis isomer was verified with analytic HPLC and was greater than 95%. The buffers used were 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) DM, and 20 mm MES (for pH 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5) or BTP (for pH 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and8.0) adjusted to pH. The spectra at pH 6.5 were measured with both buffers. Acid denaturation of the pigment was performed by adding 10% of the sample volume of 1 m HCl. Samples were illuminated for 10 s using a fiber optic light source equipped with a >480-nm longpass and a heat protection filter. The concentration of rhodopsin was determined spectrophotometrically using Îµ = 42,700 molâ1 cmâ1 for all pigments. Experiments were performed essentially as described (12.Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 32.Ernst O.P. Bieri C. Vogel H. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 471-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The instrument settings were Î»exc = 300 nm and Î»em = 345 nm, and the integration time was 2 s at 20 Â°C. Pigment concentration in samples was 2 nm with 0.01% (w/v) DM and 250 nm Gt in 20 mm BTP, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. Illumination of the sample using the same equipment as for UV-visible spectroscopy was maintained throughout the experiment. Activation of Gt was started by adding GTPÎ³S into the cuvette. Traces were corrected for the dilution because of the addition of GTPÎ³S and normalized relative to the fluorescence intensity before the addition. Initial slopes of the traces were determined by linear regression to the first 15% of the amplitude gain. Opsin was expressed in COS cells, reconstituted with 11-cis-9-demethyl-retinal or 11-cis-retinal, and purified in dodecyl maltoside yielding up to 100 Î¼g of purified rhodopsin/cell culture roller bottle with spectral ratios of 1.9 (A 280/A 464 for 9-dm rhodopsin) to 1.7 (A 280/A 500 for rhodopsin). UV-visible spectra of 9-dm wild type (wt) rhodopsin at pH 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5 are shown in the main panel of Fig.3. The dotted line is the spectrum taken of the sample at pH 6.5 before illumination. It displays the visible Î»max at 464 nm, in accordance with data reported in the literature (22.Han M. Groesbeek M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The dark spectra of the samples at pH 5.5 and 7.5 are nearly identical (data not shown). The solid lines are the spectra taken after illumination. At pH 7.5, the spectrum shows the formation of a photoproduct with the visible Î»max at 466 nm. This species is slightly red-shifted from the dark form and has been described before (22.Han M. Groesbeek M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The spectrum also shows an increase of absorption around 380 nm. The spectra taken after illumination at pH 6.5 and 5.5 clearly show this to be a second species with a Î»max of 380 nm. This species is in a pH-dependent equilibrium with the 466-nm form and is favored at acidic pH. The dashed line is a spectrum taken after the illuminated pH 5.5 sample was denatured with 1 m HCl (10% of sample volume added). It shows a Î»max of 432 nm, characteristic of an intact, protonated SB. Spectra taken of dark samples denatured with acid display the same Î»max (data not shown). The shift in Î»max between the 432 nm observed after acidification and the 440 nm found with normal retinal roughly corresponds to the shift between the absorption maxima of the free retinals in solution (22.Han M. Groesbeek M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An absorption maximum around 380 nm is indicative of a deprotonated Schiff base. From its UV-visible absorption spectrum, the 380-nm absorbing species of 9-dm rhodopsin is similar to meta II, the Schiff base-deprotonated intermediate of light-activated rhodopsin, which also shows a Î»max of 380 nm. Also, the pH dependence of this species resembles that found for bovine rhodopsin in disc membrane preparations (9.Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5054-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11.Parkes J.H. Gibson S.K. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6862-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), where meta II formation is increased at acidic pH. However, there is an important difference; when native rhodopsin or recombinant wild type opsin regenerated with normal retinal are purified in dodecyl maltoside, the formation of meta II following illumination is increased such that the meta I â meta II equilibrium becomes almost independent of pH and temperature (Fig. 3,inset, and Ref. 10.Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Hence, when compared with the normal pigment, SB deprotonation by 9-dm rhodopsin is clearly deficient. Purified 9-dm rhodopsin prepared from native, i.e. not expressed, opsin also shows pH-dependent SB deprotonation after illumination (data not shown). Interestingly though, SB deprotonation is less than with the expressed pigment. Fig.4 shows a sequence of spectra taken before and after illumination of 9-dm rhodopsin in the presence of 500 nm Gt and after addition of 50 Î¼mGTPÎ³S. The spectra labeled âdarkâ and âilluminatedâ in Fig.4 A show that the presence of Gt stimulates the formation of the 380-nm absorbing species to a level higher than that observed in the absence of Gt, which is seen in Fig. 4 B. This effect is similar to a static measurement of âextra meta II,â an assay commonly applied to rhodopsin in disc membranes (6.Emeis D. Kuhn H. Reichert J. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 32.Ernst O.P. Bieri C. Vogel H. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 471-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); Gt stabilizes meta II at the expense of its tautomeric SB-protonated form meta I. The result shows that 9-dm rhodopsin can form a 380-nm absorbing species that is capable of forming a stable complex with Gt. In the case of native rhodopsin, this complex catalyzes GTP uptake into Gt, which results in complex dissociation. The spectrum labeled â+GTPÎ³Sâ in Fig. 4 A was taken after the addition of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPÎ³S to the complex of illuminated 9-dm rhodopsin and Gt. It shows a decrease of the absorption at 380 nm and a concurrent increase around 464 nm, presumably because GTPÎ³S uptake into Gt has caused the dissociation of the complex. By showing that the Gt-induced accumulation of the SB-deprotonated over the SB-protonated species is reversible, this experiment demonstrates that light-activated 9-dm rhodopsin exists in a true, Gt-sensitive equilibrium between these forms, in analogy to the meta I â meta II equilibrium in native rhodopsin. It also proves that the SB is still intact in the 380-nm absorbing species (additionally verified by acid denaturation, data not shown). We investigated the effects of the E134Q replacement mutation, which has been shown to mimic exogenous protonation (12.Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13.Arnis S. Fahmy K. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23879-23881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Kim J.M. Altenbach C. Thurmond R.L. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14273-14278Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), in combination with 9-dm retinal. Fig.5 shows a series of spectra of the pigment 9-dm E134Q, with the pH varying from 5.5 to 7.5. Most importantly, the extent of SB deprotonation greatly exceeds that shown by 9-dm wild type pigment, demonstrating a significant functional rescue of this 9-dm-induced deficiency. Especially at basic pH, the extent of SB deprotonation in illuminated 9-dm E134Q is comparable to that displayed by wild type pigments bearing the normal retinal and yields complete deprotonation. However, a striking result is that increasing acidity leads to an increase of absorption around 466 nm and a concurrent decrease in a 380-nm absorption. This behavior is the opposite of that shown by the 9-dm wild type pigment or bovine rhodopsin but similar to what is known from the E113Q counterion mutant (33.Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3079-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the case of E113Q in the dark, it was shown that the SB was protonated directly with solution protons. As an explanation for the present observation, we suggest that the pK a of the Schiff base in 9-dm meta II may be less acidic than that of normal meta II. This could force exogenousreprotonation of the SB at acidic pH and would lead to two counteracting processes; one is the low pH-induced transition from the meta I-analog to 9-dm meta II and the other is the exogenousreprotonation of the SB in a presumably meta II-like conformation. In the 9-dm E134Q mutant, the first process would always proceed to completion, leaving only the second process to be observed. This hypothesis implies that the lack of retinal's 9-methyl group has a direct influence on the pK a of the Schiff base, probably because of a different geometric arrangement between the SB and the counterion. It will be interesting to investigate whether the SB counterion Glu113 changes its state of protonation when the SB is reprotonated in this pigment. For 9-dm wt rhodopsin and 9-dm E134Q, we have recorded the light-induced absorbance increase at 380 and absorbance decrease at 464 nm, at increments of 0.5 between pH 5.5 and 8.0 (Fig. 6 A, open symbols, at 464 nm; closed symbols, at 380 nm). Note that plotting the decrease inverts the sign of the absorbance change, which is actually negative. Because both absorbance increase at 380 nm and absorbance decrease at 464 nm indicate SB deprotonation, plotting the data in this way gives higher ordinate values for more extensive SB deprotonation. At acidic pH, the data show an increase of SB deprotonation by 9-dm wt (circles) but a decrease of deprotonation by 9-dm E134Q (triangles). One possible explanation for the behavior shown by 9-dm E134Q is reprotonation of the SB from solution. If this is true, it might be expected to also occur with 9-dm wt pigment (for details, see âDiscussionâ). To eliminate this counteracting process from the titration curve of 9-dm wt, we have expressed SB deprotonation by 9-dm wt as a percentage of deprotonation by 9-dm E134Q, at every pH (Fig. 6 B). A formal derivation shows that this yields data that only includes the first step, i.e. pH-induced SB deprotonation. These data were numerically fitted to yield an estimated pK a for this transition of 5.7. The basic end of the fitted curve was left open to account for pH-independent absorbance changes. Fig.7 shows recordings of the change of intrinsic fluorescence over time caused by rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPÎ³S uptake into Gt. Table I shows the results of a quantification of these experiments performed using a linear regression to determine the initial rate of activation (i.e. initial slope of the trace). Fig. 7 A shows traces recorded in the presence of 2 nm wild type or 9-dm wild type pigments. At the indicated time, GTPÎ³S was added to reach final concentrations of 0.2, 1.0, or 5 Î¼m GTPÎ³S as indicated. Between 1 and 5 Î¼m GTPÎ³S, the rate of activation is virtually independent of the concentration of GTPÎ³S. Under these circumstances, the rate-limiting step in catalysis is the formation of the complex between R* and Gt (an exact derivation yields k+ [R*] [Gt ] for the rate, withk+ being the rate constant for complex formation). The results show that this step is slowed by a factor of 4 in 9-dm rhodopsin. This is to be expected if the decrease in the catalytic activity is mainly because of a reduced formation of the active species and hence a reduced efficiency of collisional coupling.Table IRelative rates of transducin activationPigmentConcentration of GTPÎ³S5 Î¼m1 Î¼m0.2 Î¼mwt1.000.950.639-dm-wt0.220.230.17E134Q1.059-dm-E134Q0.97Rates of Gt activation by 2 nm pigment at 20 Â°C, pH 7.5.

All values are relative to wild type pigment bearing the normal retinal. Fig. 7 B shows traces recorded in the presence of 2 nm wild type, 9-dm wild type, E134Q, and 9-dm E134Q rhodopsins. At the indicated time, GTPÎ³S was added to reach a final concentration of 5 Î¼m. In this assay also, the E134Q replacement mutation shows a virtually complete functional rescue of defects caused by the 9-dm retinal, as rates of activation by 9-dm E134Q, wt, and E134Q pigments are within 5% percent of each other. This parallels the increased formation of meta II exhibited by this pigment. It is a general property of G-protein-coupled receptors that their interaction with G-proteins depends on the stereochemistry of the respective ligands, defining their agonistic or antagonistic properties. In the case of the photoreceptor rhodopsin, the crucial effect of retinal stereochemistry on the early photochemically defined stages of activation is a well established fact. In the present study, we have addressed the question if and how retinal stereochemistry also co-determines the late proton transfer reactions leading to breaking of the salt bridge between the protonated Schiff base and the counterion. These are the intermediates that display the most obvious analogies to receptors activated by diffusible ligands, e.g. as seen in the extended ternary complex model (34.Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated the origin of the low Gt-activating capacity of the photoreceptor 9-dm rhdopsin, which is formed by reconstituting the apoprotein, opsin, with a retinal chromophore lacking the 9-methyl group. The data published in the literature have shown the importance of this group. When it was removed, yielding 9-dm rhodopsin, the deprotonation of the SB, which is a prerequisite for the transition to the active state (7.Longstaff C. Calhoon R.D. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4209-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8.Kibelbek J. Mitchell D.C. Beach J.M. Litman B.J.

Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was not observed, and the catalytic activity of this pigment was several times lower than that of opsin bearing the normal chromophore (22.Han M. Groesbeek M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23.Ganter U.M. Schmid E.D. Perez-Sala D. Rando R.R. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5954-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have presented data that show that, although the transition to the active form may be greatly impeded in light-activated 9-dm rhodopsin, it is not impossible and is rather the manifestation of a very unfavorable equilibrium between inactive, SB-protonated and active, SB-deprotonated forms (Fig. 1 C). The Gtstabilizes the deprotonated form, showing that this form represents the interacting, active conformation of the receptor. This is further supported by the fact that the interaction can be terminated by the addition of GTPÎ³S. Additionally, we have found that neutralization of the opsin residue Glu134 by replacing it with Gln recovers much of the functionality lost due to removal of retinal's 9-methyl group. Published data suggest that the E134Q mutation anticipates the uptake of a proton from solution, which in wild type rhodopsin accompanies the light-induced formation of the active state (12.Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13.Arnis S. Fahmy K. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23879-23881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24.Weitz C.J. Nathans J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14176-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25.Kim J.M.

This effect seems to be strong enough to force the transition of 9-dm rhodopsin to the active state. We arrived at the following conclusions. (i) The 9-methyl group of retinal is the strongest factor among several that influence transition to metarhodopsin II. When native rhodopsin is illuminated, it finally enters an equilibrium between the inactive, SB-protonated meta I and the active form meta II with a deprotonated SB. A number of factors are known to influence this equilibrium, low pH and high temperature both shift the equilibrium toward meta II. The influence of the receptor's hydrophobic environment, e.g. when rhodopsin is embedded in detergent micelles (dodecyl maltoside in this study) after purification, can override both these factors and cause a complete shift to meta II in a wide range of pH and temperatures (10.Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that a similar detergent-induced shift from the inactive toward the active receptor conformation has been observed for the Î²2-adrenergic receptor (34.Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented in this study show that the action of the 9-methyl group of retinal is a further, perhaps even the decisive factor in the meta I â meta II equilibrium. When this group is removed, even the normally dominating influence of the detergent environment does not suffice to shift this equilibrium toward meta II at basic pH. Instead, the equilibrium becomes pH-dependent, with SB deprotonation favored at acidic pH as known from bovine rhodopsin in retinal disc membranes. (ii) Interaction with Gt requires deprotonation of the Schiff base. Potentially, 9-dm rhodopsin may be able to form several SB-deprotonated species with the concomitant 380-nm absorption maximum. As witnessed by the increased formation of these species when transducin is present after illumination, at least one of these is able to interact with Gt, demonstrating that the form capable of interaction is stabilized at the expense of those SB-protonated forms that are not. It also shows that, even under conditions that are very unfavorable for Schiff base deprotonation, the proton transfer event is required for the binding of Gt. (iii) Reduced Gt activation by 9-dm rhodopsin is explained by a strongly shifted equilibrium between an inactive and an active conformation, 9-dm meta II. Besides the similar pH dependence, the ability to bind and activate Gt is a further common feature of meta II and the 380-nm form of 9-dm rhodopsin, which we term 9-dm meta II. The data, especially the reversal of the shift after the addition of GTPÎ³S, show that the interactive species must be linked to the SB-protonated forms via a true equilibrium. Hence, the all-trans-form of this chromophore, resulting from the photoactivation of 9-demethyl-11-cis-rhodopsin, shows itself to behave as a partial agonist, i.e. removal of the 9-methyl group reduces the capability of the bound ligand to shift the receptor from its inactive towards its active conformation. (iv) Retinal provides the scaffold for adjustment of proton donor and acceptor groups. We have recently proposed that meta I may be the state in which proton donor and acceptor groups in light-activated rhodopsin are arranged in such a way with respect to angle, distance, and electric field as to prepare for the proton translocations that mark the transition to the meta II state (18.Hofmann K.P. Rhodopsins and Phototransduction.in: Novartis Foundation Symposium. 224. Wiley, Chichester, UK1999: 158-180Google Scholar, 36.Hofmann, K. P. in Handbook of Biological Physics (Hoff, A. J., Stavenga, D. G., de Grip, W. J., and Pugh, E. N., Jr., eds) Vol. IV, Elsevier, Amsterdam, in pressGoogle Scholar). In their infrared spectroscopic study, Ganter et al. (23.Ganter U.M. Schmid E.D. Perez-Sala D. Rando R.R. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5954-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) found that the photoactivation reaction of 9-dm rhodopsin shows its clearest defect in the progression from lumirhodopsin. We have shown that the defects of the dysfunctional meta I conformer become visible in the proton translocations involving the SB and Glu113. Taken together, this could mean that retinal acts as a scaffold to adjust the apoprotein moiety, which allows the proton transfer reactions that stabilize the active conformation to occur. To reach the signaling state of rhodopsin, TM3 and TM6 move relative to another (37.Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 38.Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which has been suggested to cause the observed exposure of the cytoplasmic end of TM7 (39.Abdulaev N.G. Ridge K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12854-12859Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Assuming such movement of TM3, which carries the key residues Gly121, Glu113, and Glu134, relative to its surroundings, the 9-methyl group possibly makes use of the helix structure to prime meta I for the transition to meta II. In the case of 9-demethyl retinal, insufficient priming occurs, because either TM3 is left free to fluctuate or it is adjusted in a position unsuitable for the transition to meta II (Fig.8). It will be interesting to see whether other stereochemical elements of retinal that are known to have an influence on the rhodopsin activation pathway, namely the Î²-ionone ring (40.JaÌger F.

https://openalex.org/W2015998205,"The human prostatic carcinoma cell line LNCaP is sensitive to TNF-Î± treatment and expresses wild-type p53. To analyse the possible role of p53 in TNF-Î±-mediated apoptosis, we generated a derivative of LNCaP, LN-56, expressing a dominant-negative element of p53, GSE56. P53 inactivation in LN-56 was associated with an increased resistance to apoptosis induced by TNF-Î±. Surface expression of TNF-Î± receptors was unchanged in LN-56 compared to LNCaP. TNF-Î± treatment resulted in accumulation of p53 in LNCaP and upregulation of p21/WAF1. Activation of caspase-7 and PARP proteolysis were delayed in LN-56 under TNF-Î± treatment. TNF-Î±-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells was accompanied by caspase-dependent proteolysis of p21/WAF1 and Rb, which was significantly attenuated in LN-56. Cytochrome c release was induced by TNF-Î± treatment in both cell lines, but caspase-9 was not activated. LNCaP and LN-56 were injected s.c. in nude mice and tumors were identified in all LN-56, but not LNCaP, bearing mice indicating that p53 plays an important role in growth control of prostatic neoplasms. Interestingly, accumulation of p53 in TNF-Î±-treated LNCaP cells was decreased in the presence of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, suggesting a new role of activated caspases in acceleration of p53 response. In summary, these results indicate that p53 is involved in TNF-Î±-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP."

Soluble receptor purified from mammalian cells is able to bind poliovirus, neutralize viral infectivity, and induce structural changes in the virus particle. Binding studies revealed that there are two binding sites for the receptor on the poliovirus type 1 capsid, with affinity constants at 20 Â°C of KD1 = 0.67 Î¼m and KD2 = 0.11 Î¼m. The relative abundance of the two binding sites varies with temperature. At 20 Â°C, the KD2 site constitutes approximately 46% of the total binding sites on the sensor chip, and its relative abundance decreased with decreasing temperature such that at 5 Â°C, the relative abundance of the KD2 site is only 12% of the total binding sites. Absolute levels of the KD1 site remained relatively constant at all temperatures tested. The two binding sites may correspond to docking sites for domain 1 of the receptor on the viral capsid, as predicted by a model of the poliovirus-receptor complex. Alternatively, the binding sites may be a consequence of structural breathing, or could result from receptor-induced conformational changes in the virus.

For some viruses, interaction with a cell receptor serves only to concentrate virus on the cell surface; release of the genome is a consequence of low pH or the action of proteinases (1Racaniello V.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 769-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For other viruses such as poliovirus, the cell receptor is also an unzipper and initiates conformational changes in the virus that lead to release of the genome. Poliovirus is an attractive system for studying cell entry, because its three-dimensional structure is known (2Hogle J.M. Chow M. Filman D.J. Science. 1985; 229: 1358-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) and its cell receptor has been identified (3Mendelsohn C. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 855-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The poliovirus virion is composed of 60 protomers, each containing a single copy of the four capsid proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4, organized with icosahedral symmetry. Distinguishing features of the virion surface include a prominent peak or mesa at the 5-fold axis of symmetry, a deep surface depression, or canyon, surrounding the 5-fold axis, another protrusion at the 3-fold axis, and a hydrocarbon-binding pocket beneath the canyon floor. The results of genetic and structural analyses demonstrate that the canyon is the receptor-binding site (4Colston E. Racaniello V.R.

The receptor for three poliovirus serotypes (Pvr,1 also called CD155) is a type I integral membrane protein that contains three extracellular Ig-like domains, a transmembrane spanning region, and a cytoplasmic tail (3Mendelsohn C. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 855-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The results of genetic analyses indicate that domain 1 of Pvr contains the binding site for poliovirus (8Selinka H.-C. Zibert A. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virology. 1994; 203: 344-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Specific interactions between poliovirus and a soluble form of Pvr (sPvr) have been identified by cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction of the virus-receptor complex (6Belnap D.M. McDermott Jr., B.M. Filman D.J. Cheng N. Trus B.L. Zuccola H.J. Racaniello V.R. Hogle J.M. Steven A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This work demonstrates that all contacts of the receptor with poliovirus involve Pvr domain 1. The interaction of poliovirus with Pvr at temperatures greater than 33 Â°C results in dramatic structural rearrangements that lead to the production of altered particles (13Guttman N. Baltimore D. Virology. 1977; 82: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Mandel B. Virology. 1967; 31: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15DeSena J. Mandel B. Virology. 1976; 70: 470-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These particles lack the capsid protein VP4, and the hydrophobic N terminus of VP1 is extruded to the virion surface. Altered particles can be detected experimentally by their sedimentation rate, 135 S, which differs from native virions (160 S). The altered particle may be an intermediate in the viral entry pathway (16Fricks C.E. Hogle J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1934-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Curry S. Chow M. Hogle J.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7125-7131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dove A.W. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4728-4735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Belnap D.M. Filman D.J. Trus B.L. Cheng N.

Reversible structural changes occur in the capsids of picornaviruses in the absence of receptors. For example, portions of poliovirus and rhinovirus VP1 and VP4 that are internal in the crystal structure can be detected on the surface of the capsid (20Li Q. Yafal A.G. Lee Y.H. Hogle J. Chow M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3965-3970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Lewis J.K. Bothner B. Smith T.J. Siuzdak G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6774-6778Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The translocation of internal proteins to the capsid surface has been called structural breathing. The functional significance of breathing remains unclear, although it is likely to play a role in virus binding and entry. Antiviral compounds that block rhinovirus uncoating also block breathing (21Lewis J.K. Bothner B. Smith T.J. Siuzdak G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6774-6778Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Poliovirus binding to cells at temperatures below 37 Â°C is blocked by the antiviral compound WIN51711, suggesting that the viral capsid must undergo structural changes to bind to Pvr (22Dove A. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3929-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, it was shown that the drug does not affect the binding of a poliovirus mutant that is believed to more readily undergo structural transitions (22Dove A. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3929-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The equilibrium but not the kinetics of poliovirus binding to sPvr has been examined (23Arita M. Koike S. Aoki J. Horie H. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3578-3586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such parameters are important because they describe the interaction of virus with receptor, which enables a better understanding of the reaction and its comparison to other systems. The results of such studies, together with structural and genetic analyses of the virus-receptor interaction, provide a complete picture of early events in infection (24Rux A.H. Willis S.H.

To study the kinetics and equilibrium of poliovirus binding to Pvr, we used surface plasmon resonance (28Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 29Canziani G. Zhang W. Cines D. Rux A. Willis S. Cohen G. Eisenberg R. Chaiken I. Methods. 1999; 19: 253-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to examine the interaction of a soluble form of Pvr (sPvr) with poliovirus. sPvr expressed in and purified from mammalian cells is able to bind poliovirus, neutralize viral infectivity, and induce the formation of altered particles. Surface plasmon resonance revealed that there are two binding sites for Pvr on the poliovirus capsid. The relative abundance of the two binding sites varies with temperature. The two binding sites may correspond to docking sites for domain 1 of Pvr on poliovirus predicted by the model of the poliovirusÂ·Pvr complex (6Belnap D.M. McDermott Jr., B.M. Filman D.J. Cheng N. Trus B.L. Zuccola H.J. Racaniello V.R. Hogle J.M. Steven A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 7He Y. Bowman V.D. Mueller S. Bator C.M.

Alternatively, the binding sites may be a consequence of structural breathing or could result from receptor-induced conformational changes in the virus. Recombinant sPvr was produced in the 293-T human epithelial kidney cell line. 293-T cells were propagated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 Î¼g of streptomycin/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). HeLa cells were propagated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% bovine calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 Î¼g of streptomycin/ml. Hybridoma cell line 711C was propagated in HB basal medium plus HB101 supplement (Irvine Scientific). Poliovirus type 1, Mahoney strain, was grown in HeLa cells and purified by differential centrifugation and CsCl density gradient fraction as described (30Rueckert R.R. Pallansch M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 78: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The ratio of particles to plaque forming units was determined to be 250:1. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a portion of PVR cDNA that corresponds to the ectodomain, residues 1â337. DNA encoding 5 histidine residues and a termination codon were added to the 3â²-end during amplification. The 5 histidine residues were added after a naturally occurring histidine (His-337) in Pvr. The following oligonucleotide primers were used: 5â²-ttgagagacaattgGGAAGCGAGGAGACGCCCG-3â² and 5â²-gggagtgacaattgctaatggtggtgatggtgGTGCTCACTGGGAGGTCCCT-3â². Codons for the additional 5 histidine residues are shown in bold. The Pvr sequence is in capital letters. The amplified DNA product was inserted into the first cistron position of the bicistronic vector pCMV/IRES/GFP, resulting in p3DPVR/IRES/GFP/MP8. Expression of this DNA in mammalian cells should produce a bicistronic mRNA in which the first cistron encodes sPvr, followed by the encephalomyocarditis internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the second cistron, which encodes green fluorescent protein (GFP). 293-T cells were seeded in 10-cm diameter plastic cell culture plates 1 day before use. After cells achieved 20% confluence, and 6 h before DNA transfection, the medium was changed. Ten Î¼g of plasmid p3DPVR/IRES/GFP/MP8 plus 0.1 Î¼g of pRSV-Puro, a plasmid that contains the puromycin resistance gene, was introduced into 293-T cells by DNA-calcium phosphate coprecipitation (31Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). After 18 h of incubation at 37 Â°C, the medium was replaced, and incubation was continued for an additional 24 h. For selection and subculturing of drug-resistant cells, 5 Î¼g of puromycin (Sigma) was added per ml of medium. The subpopulation of puromycin-resistant 293-T cells was detached from the tissue culture plate using cell dissociation buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), passed through a 20-Î¼m nylon filter, chilled, and sorted on a Becton Dickinson FACStar with the excitation wavelength set at 488 nm. A small percentage of the population was sampled to determine the range of fluorescence intensity. A subpopulation of 1 Ã 107 GFP-expressing cells with relative fluorescence intensity greater than 95% of the whole population was collected on ice. GFP-positive cells were cultured for a week, and the isolation process was repeated with the following modifications. Individual cells with relative fluorescence intensity greater than 99.75% were clonally isolated and cultured. Of several cell lines obtained by this procedure, one with the highest level of secretion of sPvr, as determined by Western blot analysis, was selected for subsequent purification (data not shown). At each step of sPvr purification, total protein (Pierce), specific activity, and fold purification were determined. A unit of specific activity was defined as a 20-Î¼l aliquot capable of neutralizing 50 of 100 plaque-forming units (pfu) in a 100-Î¼l reaction volume. Fractions containing sPvr were determined by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The GFP-positive clonal population was expanded and grown on 150-cm tissue culture plates that contained 25 ml of growth medium. Enriched supernatant was mixed with loading buffer A (LBA, final concentration 50 mm NaPO4, 50 mm NaOH, pH 8, 3 mm imidazole) and nickel-agarose slurry (final 4% v/v) (Qiagen), and incubated at 4 Â°C overnight with stirring at 1000 rpm. The slurry was packed into a column (1-cm Bio-Rad Econo-column with flow adapter) and washed with 10 volumes of wash buffer A (WBA, 10 mm imidazole in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 20 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Bound protein was eluted with elution buffer A (EBA, 50 mmimidazole in PBS) at 4 Â°C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The sample was dialyzed overnight against loading buffer B (LBB, 20 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl) prior to application to a Q-Sepharose column (1-cm Bio-Rad Econo column packed with Q-Sepharose resin charged with counter ions and preequilibrated with loading buffer) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After washing with 10 volumes of LBB at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, the bound protein was eluted with an 80-ml linear gradient of NaCl (20â500 mm) in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected, and sPvr-containing samples were dialyzed against PBS, and fold purification was determined. The anti-Pvr monoclonal antibody 711C (11Morrison M.E. Yuan-Jing H. Wien M.W. Hogle J.W. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2578-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was purified from hybridoma supernatant using Affi-Gel protein A gel according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Approximately 200 pfu of poliovirus were incubated with different concentrations of sPvr in virus dilution buffer (PBS containing 0.02% bovine calf serum) for 30 min at 25 Â°C followed by 1 h at 37 Â°C. The virus titer was then determined by plaque assay on HeLa cell monolayers. To determine if incubation at low pH, the condition used to remove bound sPvr from virus on the sensor chip, affects virus infectivity, approximately 70 pfu of poliovirus were incubated in 10 mm glycine, pH 3, or PBS, for 5 min, followed by plaque assay. Plaque assays were carried out essentially as described (32La Monica N. Meriam C. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 515-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of isotopically labeled virus, purification, and alteration assays were done essentially as reported (23Arita M. Koike S. Aoki J. Horie H. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3578-3586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lonberg-Holm K. Gosser L.B. Kauer J.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1975; 27: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Kaplan G. Freistadt M.S. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For alteration assays, sPvr was incubated with purified poliovirus in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in a total volume of 100 Î¼l at 4 Â°C overnight. The virus-receptor complexes were then shifted from 4 to 37 Â°C for 0, 5, or 15 min, overlaid onto a 15â30% sucrose density gradient containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 Â°C in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Gradients were fractionated (0.6 ml) from the top to bottom, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. In such assays, not all of the sample can be accounted for, probably due to the hydrophobic nature of the 135 S particle (16Fricks C.E. Hogle J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1934-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a BIAcore X and BIAcore 3000 optical biosensor (BIAcore AB) at specified temperatures. Approximately 1,200 response units of purified poliovirus were coupled to flow cell 2 (Fc2) of a CM5 sensor chip via primary amines according to the manufacturer's specifications with the following modifications. After the activation step, purified poliovirus in PBS was diluted 1:3 with 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and injected at 2 Î¼l/min until desired response units were coupled to the flow cell. The running buffer for the experiments was PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20 (PBS-T, pH 7.0). For kinetic analysis of the sPvr-poliovirus interaction, the flow path was set to include both flow cells; the flow rate was 50 Î¼l/min, and the data collection rate was set to high. Poliovirus was allowed to bind for a 2-min interval with a wash delay set for an additional 3 min to allow for a smooth dissociation curve. Settings for equilibrium analyses were the same as for kinetics, except that the flow rate was set to 2 Î¼l/min. Regeneration of the virus (removal of bound sPvr) was done by brief pulses of 10 mm glycine at pH 3.0 with or without 300 mm NaCl until the response was returned to base line. BIAevaluation software, version 3.0, was used to analyze the surface plasmon resonance data, using global fitting. A novel approach was used to express a soluble form of the poliovirus receptor at high levels in mammalian cells for biochemical and biophysical studies. A plasmid was used that leads to the production of a bicistronic mRNA upon expression in mammalian cells. The coding region of the Pvr ectodomain (with a 6-histidine tag at the C terminus, Fig. 1) was placed in the first cistron position, followed by an IRES, and then the coding region for GFP in the second cistron. In a cell line stably expressing the bicistronic mRNA, the intensity of GFP fluorescence is an approximate indicator of the expression of the protein in the first cistron. 2T. Livelli, personal communication. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was then used to isolate a clonal cell line that contains a fluorescence intensity greater than 99.75% of the GFP-positive population. Enriched supernatant from the stable cell line used contained approximately 7 mg/liter sPvr. sPvr was purified from cultured supernatant using a two-step procedure. The level of purification was determined by assaying the capacity of sPvr to neutralize infectious poliovirus (34Kaplan G. Freistadt M.S. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the first step, nickel affinity chromatography achieved 160-fold purification over the cultured supernatant (Table I). In the second step, Q-Sepharose purification ion exchange chromatography achieved 2.3-fold purification over the previous step. At this stage of purification, sPvr was the only visible band on a Coomassie Blue-stained, SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1). Edman degradation revealed that the N terminus of purified sPvr begins at Asp-28 of the unprocessed precursor, as previously reported for the membrane-bound form (35Bibb J.A. Bernhardt G. Wimmer E. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although the predicted molecular mass of sPvr is 34 kDa, the purified protein migrates as a diffuse band between the 61- and 85-kDa molecular mass markers (Fig. 1), suggesting that the protein is heavily glycosylated. After treatment of sPvr with N-glycosidase F, which cleaves asparagine-linked glycan chains on glycoproteins, the polypeptide migrates at 34 kDa, the predicted size of the non-glycosylated protein (data not shown). A similar protein produced in insect cells migrated at 51 kDa, probably due to less extensive glycosylation in that cell type (23Arita M. Koike S. Aoki J. Horie H. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3578-3586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IPurification of sPvrProcedureTotal proteinTotal activityRecoverySpecific activityPurificationmgunits%units/mg-foldEnriched cell culture supernatant1,33050,00038Nickel-agarose3.722,000456,000160Q-Sepharose0.659,0004014,0002.3 Open table in a new tab We carried out several assays to determine whether purified sPvr is biologically active. Plaque reduction assays were used to determine the efficiency of neutralization of poliovirus by sPvr. Viral infectivity was reduced by 50% at 30 nm sPvr (Fig.2). In contrast, the 50% inhibitory dose for infectivity (IC50) of sICAM-1 for rhinovirus type 3 was 10-fold higher than sPvr, 300 nm (36Martin S. Casasnovas J.M. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3561-3568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this difference is that the affinity of poliovirus type 1 for its soluble receptor is greater than that of rhinovirus 3 for sICAM-1 (see below). We also determined if sPvr is capable of inducing structural changes in poliovirus. This question was addressed by incubating sPvr with poliovirus at 37 Â°C and assaying the products by sucrose gradient centrifugation. At the concentration of sPvr used, 1.8 Ã 10â8m, conversion of native virus (160 S) to 135 S altered particles and 80 S empty capsids was nearly complete within 15 min (Fig. 3). These results indicate that sPvr produced in mammalian cells can efficiently bind to poliovirus and induce the structural changes associated with cell entry. Surface plasmon resonance allows determination of quantitative affinities (KD), association (ka), and dissociation (kd) rates for the formation and dissociation of the virus-receptor complex (37Sauter N.K.

Virol. 1999; 73: 6759-6768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the kinetics of binding of sPvr to poliovirus by surface plasmon resonance, purified poliovirus was coupled to the sensor chip surface, and sPvr was injected over the chip surface. An example of raw sensorgram data is shown in Fig.4. In this experiment, flow cell 2 contained immobilized poliovirus, and flow cell 1 was activated and blocked without virus. sPvr was injected, and its association with virus was followed for 2 min. At 120 s, sPvr was replaced with buffer, and the dissociation of complex was followed for 3 min. The response on the y axis is measured in response units. The sensorgram reveals a change in the bulk refractive index, but there was no significant background response when 1.3 Î¼m sPvr was injected over the mock-coupled control surface. In the surface plasmon resonance experiments that followed, data from flow cell 2 were subtracted from the data from flow cell 1 to correct for changes in bulk refractive index. These results demonstrate binding of sPvr to poliovirus immobilized on the chip surface. The sensor chip surface was regenerated by treatment with low pH, to disrupt the virus-receptor interaction. Poliovirus remaining on the chip surface should survive these conditions, because its natural route of infection is through the acidic environment of the stomach. Two experiments were done to ensure that the sensor chips could be reused. First, unbound poliovirus was incubated in regeneration buffer (glycine buffer, pH 3) for 5 min at room temperature, and then infectivity was determined by plaque assay. As expected, this treatment did not reduce poliovirus infectivity, suggesting that conditions used for regeneration of the sensor chip do not disrupt virus structure (Fig.5). Second, repeated use and regeneration of sensor chips containing bound poliovirus did not affect sensorgrams and response levels (data not shown). To determine the specificity of the poliovirus-sPvr interaction, a blocking experiment was performed using a monoclonal antibody, 711C, directed against the first domain of Pvr and which prevents poliovirus attachment to cells (11Morrison M.E. Yuan-Jing H. Wien M.W. Hogle J.W. Racaniello V.R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2578-2588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two concentrations of monoclonal antibody 711C were preincubated with sPvr for 1 h at 4 Â°C prior to injection onto the sensor chip containing bound poliovirus. Preincubation with monoclonal antibody 711C inhibited formation of the virus-receptor complex (Fig. 6). A control monoclonal antibody DL11, directed against herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D, did not inhibit the formation of the poliovirus-sPvr complex (data not shown). These results indicate that the sPvr-poliovirus interaction under study resembles the interaction during infection of cells, since it is mediated by domain 1 of sPvr. Determination of kinetic binding parameters for the sPvr-poliovirus interaction was done at 20 Â°C using separate injections of 2.5-fold serial dilutions of sPvr onto the sensor chip containing bound poliovirus. The sensorgrams of the sPvr-poliovirus interaction were imposed upon different model curves generated by global fitting analysis (Fig.7). The data fit best with the parallel reactions (2 sites) model, A + B1 âAB1, A + B2 â AB2. The X 2 values generated using this model for interaction at 20 Â°C were below 1.5, indicating an excellent fit. On the other hand, the X 2 value for a one-site binding model was 29, demonstrating a poor fit to that model. The two affinity constants calculated from the surface plasmon resonance data are 0.67 Î¼m (KD1) and 0.11 Î¼m (KD2) (TableII). The calculated association rate constants are 3.6 Ã 103mâ1 sâ1(ka1) and 3.2 Ã 104mâ1 sâ1(ka2); the dissociation rate constants are 2.4 Ã 10â3sâ1 (kd1) and 3.3 Ã 10â3 sâ1(kd2) (Table II). Binding rates were unaffected by changes in flow rate, demonstrating that the poliovirus-sPvr interaction is not limited by mass transport (data not shown) (41Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar).

Immunoelectron microscopy and subcellular fractionation located racemase to mitochondria and peroxisomes. The enzymes were purified from both organelles with immunoaffinity chromatography. The isolated proteins were of the same size, with identical N-terminal amino acid sequences, and the existence of additional proteins with Î±-methylacyl-CoA racemase activity was excluded. A racemase gene of about 15 kilobases was isolated. Southern blot analysis and chromosomal localization showed that only one racemase gene is present, on chromosome 15, region 15B1. The putative initial ATG in the racemase gene was preceded by a functional promotor as shown with the luciferase reporter gene assay. The corresponding cDNAs were isolated from rat and mouse liver. The recombinant rat protein was overexpressed in active form in Pichia pastoris. The presented data suggest that the polypeptide encoded by the racemase gene can alternatively be targeted to peroxisomes or mitochondria without modifications. It is concluded that the noncleavable N-terminal sequence of the polypeptide acts as a weak mitochondrial and that the C-terminal sequence acts as a peroxisomal targeting signal.

Biochem. 1995; 231: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The enzyme is thought to have its major physiological role in the biosynthesis of bile acids, because mitochondrial hydroxylation at C-26 of the cholesterol side chain affords specifically the (25R)-diastereomer of di- and trihydroxycoprostanoic acid (THCA) (3.Shefer S. Cheng F.W. Batta A.K. Dayal B. Tint G.S. Salen G. Mosbach E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6386-6392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the following reactions, catalyzed by the peroxisomal oxidases that initiate Î²-oxidative cleavage of the side chain, are highly stereospecific for the (25S)-isomers (4.Van Veldhoven P.P. Croes K. Asselberghs S. Herdewijn P. Mannaerts G.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5.Pedersen J.I. Veggan T. BjoÌrkhem I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, inversion of the configuration at C-25 is required to connect the two pathways. THCA-CoA was shown to be racemized efficiently by Amacr (1.Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Other physiologic substrates are methyl-branched fatty acids of dietary origin such as pristanic acid (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecanoic acid), which is the Î±-oxidation product of phytanic acid, a metabolite of the chlorophyll component phytol (for review see Ref. 6.Steinberg D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2351-2369Google Scholar), and possibly also endogenously synthesized isoprenoids. Amacr has also attracted the interest of pharmacologists for its participation in the biotransformation of 2-arylpropionic acids (2-methylarylacetic acids) used as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs (IbuprofenÂ®), from the inactive (2R)- to the pharmacologically active (2S)-enantiomer (7.Shieh W.-R. Chen C.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3487-3493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Side chain cleavage of bile acids as well as Î²-oxidation of methyl-branched fatty acids take place in peroxisomes (8.Prydz K. Kase B.F. BjoÌrkhem I. Pedersen J.I. J. Lipid. Res. 1986; 27: 622-628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Verhoeven N.M. Wanders R.J.A. Poll The B.T. Saudubray J.M Jakobs C. J. Inher. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 697-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, Amacr activity is found to be distributed between peroxisomes and mitochondria in varying proportions, depending on the species. In human tissues, 80â90% of the activity is associated with peroxisomes (2.Schmitz W. Albers C. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), in line with its presumed function. In mouse and Chinese hamster, a roughly equal distribution between the two organelles is seen (10.Schmitz W. Helander H.M. Hiltunen J.K. Conzelmann E. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas in rats, Amacr activity is found almost exclusively in mitochondria (1.Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this distribution is not yet known. Only one cDNA sequence for the enzyme (cAMACR) has so far been found in mice, rats (10.Schmitz W. Helander H.M. Hiltunen J.K. Conzelmann E. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and humans (11.Albers C. Reinigung und Charakterisierung der a-Methylacyl-CoA-Racemase aus menschlicher Leber. Ph.D. thesis. University of WuÌrzburg, 1999Google Scholar) alike. To gain insight into possible mechanisms governing this distribution, we isolated the enzymes from highly purified mouse liver mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively, and compared their properties. At the genomic level, only one gene encoding Amacr (AMACR) was found and characterized. The data are discussed in view of the dual compartmentalization of the Amacr activity in mouse liver. Inorganic salts were from Merck; sucrose (molecular biology grade) and Tris were from Applichem (Darmstadt, Germany); Zymolase (LyticaseÂ®), EDTA, and Percoll were from Sigma; and morpholinopropane sulfonic acid was from Aldrich. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or of the highest purity available. Ingredients for bacterial and yeast growth media were from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI). Restriction enzymes and the corresponding buffers were from MBI Fermentas (Heidelberg, Germany). Nitrocellulose blotting membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell GmbH (Dassel, Germany). Radionuclides were purchased from Amersham-Buchler (Braunschweig, Germany), from Hartmann (Braunschweig, Germany), or from NEN Life Science Products.

The serum against the rat mitochondrial 120 kDa Î2-Î4-dienoyl-CoA reductase was described earlier (12.Hakkola E.H. Autio-Harmainen H.I. Sormunen R.T. Hassinen I.E. Hiltunen J.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1863-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For the preparation of the immunoaffinity column, IgGs from rabbit-anti-Amacr-antiserum (2.Schmitz W. Albers C. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) were purified by a HiTrap ProteinA column (1 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), following the instructions of the manufacturer. The resulting IgGs were bound to 1.5 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) peroxisome-deficient mutant cells Z65 (13.Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) were kindly supplied by Dr. Jutta GaÌrtner (DuÌsseldorf University Children's Hospital, DuÌsseldorf, Germany). Subcellular fractionation of mouse liver and CHO fibroblasts on Nycodenz gradients was performed essentially as described previously (14.Schmitz W. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For immunopurification of Amacr, livers of five mice were homogenized in 50 ml of sucrose solution (8.6% sucrose (w/w) in 1 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) using a Potter homogenizer. Nuclei and undisrupted material were sedimented by centrifugation at 600 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was centrifuged for 25 min at 12,000 Ãg in a JA-20 rotor, and the resulted pellet was resuspended in 18 ml of sucrose solution and loaded onto six centrifuge tubes containing 35 ml of Percoll solution (32.5% SIP, 67.5% sucrose solution) each. SIP consists of 9 volumes of Percoll-Suspension (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 1 volume of 2.5 m sucrose, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA, 1% ethanol. The tubes were centrifuged in an AH-628 rotor at 80,000 Ãg for 45 min at 4 Â°C. After centrifugation, the tubes were emptied from the bottom, and the contents were collected into fractions of 1.2 ml. The fractions were assayed for succinate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial marker) and catalase (peroxisomal marker) activities, respectively. Fractions 1â3 (mitochondria) and fractions 26â28 (peroxisomes) of all gradients were pooled, diluted 1:5 with sucrose solution (8.6% sucrose in 1 mm Tris, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mm EDTA), treated with ultra sound, and centrifuged in a SW40-Ti rotor for 1 h at 150,000 Ãg at 4 Â°C. The supernatants were pooled and applied onto the immunoaffinity column (1 Ã 5 cm) three times with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Unbound proteins were washed out with 40 ml of 0.1m Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.0. Bound proteins were eluted with 60 ml of either 200 mm glycine, pH 2.8 (acidic elution), or 50 mm diethylamine, pH 11.5 (alkaline elution). The eluates of the latter were immediately neutralized with 4 ml of 1 m sodium phosphate, pH 5.1, containing 1m NaCl, and concentrated on a 30 kDa cutoff membrane in an Amicon Centriprep tube (Amicon, Witten, Germany) to a volume of 5 ml. Catalase was determined by the TiO(SO4) method (15.HuÌbl P. Bretschneider R. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1964; 335: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and succinate dehydrogenase was measured as described by Banerjee et al. (16.Banerjee A. Burg J. Conzelmann E. Carroll M. Sandhoff K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1984; 365: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Amacr activity was measured with [2-3H]pristanoyl-CoA and [24,25-3H]THCA-CoA as described previously (1.Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Livers were harvested from control and clofibrate-treated Balb/c mice (fed with 0.5% (w/w) clofibrate-supplemented chow for 2 weeks) after vascular perfusion fixation (17.Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I.

Small tissue blocks (â¼1 mm) were processed for thin sectioning by progressive lowering of temperature (18.Carlemalm E. Villiger W. Hobot J.A. Acetarin J.D. Kellenberger E. J. Microsc. 1985; 140: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, small tissue blocks were dehydrated in graded series of ethanol concurrent with decreasing temperature from 0 to â70 Â°C before infiltration with MicroBed resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) at â35 Â°C; tissues embedded in the same resin were then polymerized under UV light at â35 Â°C for 60 h. For immunogold labeling, thin sections (80 Î¼m) on nickel grids were incubated with a blocking medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline and then exposed to polyclonal anti-Amacr antibody followed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline. Similar grids were incubated with catalase and mitochondrial reductase antibodies as control for the labeling. Antibody distribution was identified by gold particles (20 nm) conjugated to protein A. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in a 12.5% gel (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ProBlottÂ®, Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, CA) in 10 mm CAPS (pH 11)/10% methanol (v/v) with a constant potential of 50 V for 120 min (20.Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the protein bands of interest were cut off and loaded into the sequencer. Protein N-terminal sequencing was performed with a Procise 494A sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Division, CA). Rat liver total RNA (30 Î¼g) was prepared from rat liver with the Biozym PUREscript RNA isolation kit (Biozym Diagnostik, Oldendorf, Germany), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For the first strand synthesis of cAMACR, the Titanâ¢One Tube reverse transcription-PCR system from Roche Molecular Biochemicals was used according to the instructions of the manufacturer, with 1 Î¼l of 100 Î¼m sequence-specific primer RRaceII (for oligonucleotide sequences see Table I). The first strands were polyadenylated and amplified by a PCR reaction using the polyT primer and primer HisR. The PCR products were purified, and a second nested PCR was performed with the same polyT primer and M9R as nested cAMACR-specific primer. The purified PCR products were ligated into pCR2.1 with the Invitrogen original TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, De Schelp, Netherlands) and transformed into competent INV-Î± cells, following the instructions of the manufacturer. Plasmids from 50 colonies were isolated and treated with EcoRI. The size of the excised inserts was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The three largest inserts were sequenced, using plasmid-specific primers (M13forw and M13rev). For amplification of the complete rat liver cAMACR, a PCR was performed, using 1 Î¼l of rat liver Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), primers RS-F and HisR, and Stratagene native PfuDNA polymerase. The resulting product was purified from the agarose gel, cloned in pCR2.1, and transformed into INV-Î±. The corresponding plasmids were amplified, purified, and digested with NdeI. The insert was cloned into NdeI-digested and dephosphorylated pET3a (pET Expression System 3, Novagen, Madison, WI) and transformed into INV-Î± cells. Plasmids containing the insert in the right orientation were transformed into competent BL21(DE3)-LysS. Plasmid C1â9, containing the coding sequence for rat liver racemase, was produced in the same manner, except that oligo R-YN-2-Kozak was used as forward primer and oligo R-YC-1-Mut was used as reverse primer for the PCR reaction. For the expression of Amacr in yeast cells, the Pichiaexpression kit (Invitrogen) was used. For the generation of the expression casette, the coding cAMACR was amplified by PCR, using plasmid C1â9 as template, RY-F-wt as forward primer, and RY-C2-wt as reverse primer. The product was cloned into pCR2.1 plasmid and transformed into INV-Î± cells. The plasmids were amplified, isolated, and treated with NdeI. The resulting insert was isolated from a 1% agarose gel and ligated into NdeI-digested and dephosphorylated pHilD2 vector. The plasmid was amplified in INV-Î± cells, isolated, linearized with NotI, and transformed intoPichia pastoris strain GS115. The expression of recombinant Amacr from 90 MutS transformants was analyzed according the manual of the manufacturer. Genomic DNA was extracted from kidney of BALB/c mouse (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-10.70Google Scholar) and used as template in PCR. Amplification (ExpandTM High Fidelity PCR system; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with primers ST10.1 and SR19.0, resulted in a 5-kb fragment, which was subcloned into the pUC18 vector (Sure Clone ligation kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and partly sequenced from the 5â² end. A pair of oligonucleotide primers, INT14 and ST10.1, was designed to give in PCR a 600-bp fragment from the exon-intron boundary. This set of primers was sent to Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis, MO) for screening of the mouse ES-129/SvJ I genomic library. Received bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones were BACM-235K4, BACM-13L1, and BACM-151H13. BAC DNA was isolated with the K-100 Magnum kit (Genome Systems) and digested with restriction enzymesHindIII and EcoRI. Digested DNA was subjected to Southern blotting (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-10.70Google Scholar), and the presence of AMACR in BAC clones was detected with three probes made by PCR and random prime labeling to correspond to the 5â² end of the mouse cAMACR with primers RaseI and RS4.0, the middle part with primers RU1.0 and K100, and the 3â² end with primers K51 and SR19.1. Sequencing of 3â² end of the gene was done on the subcloned 2-kbHindIII fragment of clone BACM-13L1 with oligonucleotide primers SR19.1 and LO2. Upstream sequencing was done directly on the BACM-13L1 clone. Oligonucleotide primers used in sequencing were designed according to sequences obtained from previous reactions. Sequencing was performed on both DNA strands. PCR reactions were used to determine the size of the introns. Intron 1 was amplified with primers ALE28 and ALE18, intron 2 with ALE22 and ALE17, intron 3 with RU3.0 and RS4.0, and intron 4 with primers K50 and ST 10.1. In addition, introns 1 and 2 were sequenced through. DNA sequencing was done with an automated ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Chromosomal localization of the gene was detected by Genome Systems, Inc. The fluorescent in situ hybridization was carried out by using the digoxigenin-labeled BACM-13L1 clone as probe. Hybridization was done to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from mouse embryo fibroblasts. Genomic DNA was extracted from kidney of BALB/c mouse with the SDS-proteinase K method (21.Sambrook J.

The filter was washed twice before autoradiographing at â70 Â°C for 24 h (Kodak X-Omat AR). For Northern hybridization, a mouse Multiple Tissue NorthernTM blot (CLONTECH) nylon membrane was used, on which 2-Î¼g aliquots of poly(A+) RNA from various mouse tissues had been blotted. Hybridization was done according to the manufacturer's instructions in ExpressHybTM hybridization solution with32P-labeled mouse cAMACR as probe. The hybridized fragments were autoradiographed at â70 Â°C for 72 h. Primers PR-3 and PR-4 were designed to amplify a 1670-bp-long piece of the 5â² noncoding region ofAMACR by PCR (Pfu polymerase; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The amplified fragment was cloned into theSmaI-digested pGL3-Basic reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Correct orientation of the insert was ascertained by sequencing. HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 units/ml), gentamicin (50 Î¼g/ml), 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected by using LipofectAMINE-transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies Inc.). Briefly, 4 Ã 105 cells were plated onto a 60-mm dish 24 h before transfection with a solution containing 4 Î¼g of luciferase reporter plasmid with amplified promoter or the same promoter region but in inverted orientation or 2 Î¼g of luciferase reporter plasmid without promoter or 2 Î¼g of pGL3-control vector (Promega). In addition, in all above-mentioned transfections, 0.6 Î¼g of pSV-Î²-galactosidase control plasmid (Promega) was used as normalization vector. Cell extracts were prepared using reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase and Î²-galactosidase activities were assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega andCLONTECH) with Labsystems Luminoscan RS luminometer (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). All luciferase values were normalized with Î²-galactosidase activity in the same extract. DNA sequences were analyzed with the DNASIS program (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Yokohama, Japan). Transcription factor binding sites were searched for by using a MatInspector V2.2 data base (23.Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Western blots with the rabbit antiserum against rat liver Amacr were done as described (2.Schmitz W. Albers C. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by the dye binding method of Bradford (24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The use of animals was approved by the University of Oulu Committee on animal experimentation Mouse liver homogenate was subjected to subcellular fractionation on a Nycodenz gradient. As shown in Fig. 1(lower panel), Amacr activity was found in three regions of different density. Two regions were found in the gradient, comigrating with the marker enzymes for peroxisomes (catalase) as well as for mitochondria (succinate dehydrogenase), and one region was in the fractions floating at the top of the gradient. Furthermore, when subjecting the fractions to Western blot analysis using rabbit antibodies against rat liver Amacr, the intensity of the visualized bands correlated with the distribution of the Amacr activity. The size of the visualized polypeptides was the same in each region (Fig. 1,upper panel). To study the subcellular distribution of the Amacr activity further, experiments were carried out with CHO fibroblasts. When control CHO fibroblasts were fractionated, a distribution of the Amacr activity similar to that in mouse liver was found (Fig.2 a). When the fractionation was carried out with CHO peroxisome-deficient mutant cells, which are devoid of peroxisomes, Amacr activity was still comigrating with the mitochondrial fractions and showed the same specific activity as in the mitochondrial fractions of the control CHO fibroblasts (Fig.2 b). Neither particle bound catalase activity was found in these cells, in agreement with earlier findings (13.Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), nor particle bound Amacr activity in the fractions with densities corresponding to the peroxisome-containing fractions of the control cells. For further investigation of the subcellular distribution of Amacr, sections of mouse liver were subjected to immunoelectron microscopy with the antiserum against rat liver Amacr (2.Schmitz W. Albers C. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) using the protein A-gold labeling technique (Fig. 3). The gold particles were located in mitochondria and peroxisomes from control and clofibrate-treated mice (10 days) without any observed change in the labeling intensity. For control purposes, the tissue sections were treated with antibodies against rat 120-kDa Î2-Î4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (12.Hakkola E.H. Autio-Harmainen H.I. Sormunen R.T. Hassinen I.E. Hiltunen J.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1863-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and rat catalase for labeling mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively. In both cases, the antibody recognized the expected compartment as shown in Fig. 3. An affinity column was prepared with the rabbit antibodies against rat Amacr (2.Schmitz W. Albers C. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When the soluble extract of ultrasound-treated mouse liver homogenate was applied to the column, all Amacr activity was bound to the column, and none could be detected in the flowthrough fractions (data not shown), documenting that the antibodies used recognize all soluble Amacr(s). Subsequently, peroxisomes and mitochondria were isolated from mouse liver on a self-generating Percoll gradient (Fig. 4 a), and the soluble extracts were applied separately to the immunoaffinity column. More than 99% of the Amacr activities were retained on the column. When the bound proteins from each of the experiments were eluted with acidic buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, protein staining of the SDS-PAGE gels showed one major protein band in each lane (Fig. 4 b), at a position corresponding to the size of the purified Amacr protein (42 kDa). In Western blots, the immunologically cross-reactive bands showed the same size as that from mouse liver homogenate (not shown but see compare with Fig. 1). No Amacr activity could be detected in this eluate. When alkaline buffer instead of acidic buffer was used for elutions, SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis revealed similar results, and also Amacr activity was detectable, albeit very low, (0.83 and 0.42% of the applied activity for mitochondrial and peroxisomal fractions, respectively). This showed that mitochondrial and peroxisomal Amacrs are equally well bound to and released from the affinity column but are rapidly inactivated under the harsh conditions employed. Similary, the cytosol (supernatant of the differential centrifugation at 12,000 Ã g) was applied to and eluted from the affinity column with comparable results. The immunoisolated proteins of the alkaline elution were, after SDS-PAGE, blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the Amacr bands were excised and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Each of the immunopurified samples from peroxisomes or mitochondria or cytosol gave the same single homogeneous N-terminal sequence: Val-Leu-Arg-Gly-Val-Arg-Val-Val-Asp-Leu-Ala-Gly-Leu-Ala-Pro (NAmacr). NAmacr was not found in the polypeptide encoded by the known mouse cAMACR (10.Schmitz W. Helander H.M. Hiltun"
https://openalex.org/W2101840599,"The ets family of transcription factors comprises many members which contribute to diverse cellular functions that vary depending upon the cell- and tissue-type context. Recently, different groups have identified a novel member of the ets family that is epithelial-specific. Variably called ESE-1, ERT, jen, ESX, this gene is designated currently as ELF3. In order to understand transcriptional regulatory mechanisms mediated by ELF3, we investigated its effect on the human keratin 4 gene promoter based upon the role of keratin 4 in early differentiation of the esophageal squamous epithelium. Interestingly, ELF3 suppressed basal keratin 4 promoter activity in both esophageal and cervical epithelial cancer cell lines, a novel result, while simultaneously activating the late-differentiation linked SPRR2A promoter. Furthermore, serial deletion constructs of the keratin 4 promoter continued to be suppressed by ELF3, a phenomenon that was only partially rescued by ELF3 ets domain mutants, but completely abrogated by deletion of the ELF3 pointed domain. These results suggest that ELF3 may have dual functions in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in squamous epithelial differentiation. One of these functions may not be exclusively mediated through DNA binding in the context of transcriptional suppression of the keratin 4 promoter."

The expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity during the first 24-h postfertilization, followed by 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase, suggest an early supply of tetrahydrobiopterin for neurotransmitter synthesis in the neurons and for tyrosine supply in the melanophores. At 48-h postfertilization, sepiapterin formation branches off the de novo pathway of tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis. Sepiapterin, via 7,8-dihydrobiopterin and biopterin, serves as a precursor for the formation of 7-oxobiopterin, which may be further catabolized to isoxanthopterin and 2,4,7-trioxopteridine. Neither 7,8-dihydrobiopterin nor biopterin is a substrate for xanthine oxidoreductase. In contrast, both of these compounds are oxidized at C-7 by a xanthine oxidase variant form, which is inactivated by KCN, but is insensitive to allopurinol. The oxidase and the dehydrogenase form of xanthine oxidoreductase as well as the xanthine oxidase variant have specific developmental patterns.

Sepiapterin, via 7,8-dihydrobiopterin and biopterin, serves as a precursor for the formation of 7-oxobiopterin, which may be further catabolized to isoxanthopterin and 2,4,7-trioxopteridine. Neither 7,8-dihydrobiopterin nor biopterin is a substrate for xanthine oxidoreductase. In contrast, both of these compounds are oxidized at C-7 by a xanthine oxidase variant form, which is inactivated by KCN, but is insensitive to allopurinol. The oxidase and the dehydrogenase form of xanthine oxidoreductase as well as the xanthine oxidase variant have specific developmental patterns. It follows that GTP cyclohydrolase I, the formation of sepiapterin, and the xanthine oxidoreductase family control the pteridine pathway in the zebrafish.

Cell. 1996; 87: 969-977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Several studies have been reported on the staging, cell fate determination, lineage determination, and patterning for the development of the peripheral neurons and the pigment cells in this animal. Both of these types of cells are derived from the neural crest (2.Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.H. Devel. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8412) Google Scholar, 3.Raible D.W. Eisen J.S. Development. 1994; 120: 495-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Dorsky R.I. Moon R.T. Raible D.W. Nature. 1998; 396: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Large scale screens for embryonic and early larval zebrafish mutations have enabled the analysis of different aspects of neuronal and of pigment development and the identification of the genes specifically required for them (5.Kelsh R.N. Brand M. Jiang Y.J. Heisenberg C.P. Lin S. Haffter P. Odenthal J. Mullins M.C. van Eeden F.J.M. Furutani-Seiki M. Granato M. Beuchle D. Vogelsang L. NuÌsslein-Vollhard C.

In the zebrafish, some of the pigments are believed to be pteridine-related, and differences in their biosynthesis were suggested to occur in several mutants (6.Odenthal J. Rossnagel K. Haffter P. Kelsh R.N. Vogelsang E. Brand M. van Eeden F.J.M. Furutani-Seiki M. Granato M. Hammerschmidt M. Heisenberg C.P. Jiang Y.J. Kane D.A. Mullins M.C. NuÌsslein-Vollhard C. Development. 1996; 123: 391-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The de novo biosynthesis of pteridines begins with GTP and results in the formation of H4biopterin.1 The first committed step of this pathway is catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16) and yields H2neopterin triphosphate (9.Burg A.W. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2349-2358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 6-Pyruvoyl-H4pterin synthase (EC 4.6.1.10) eliminates the phosphate groups from this and catalyzes an intramolecular reaction, yielding 6-pyruvoyl-H4pterin (10.Takikawa S. Curtius H.C. Redweik U. Leimbacher W. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both keto groups of this unstable intermediate are reduced by sepiapterin reductase (EC1.1.1.153) via formation of 6-(1â²-hydroxy-2â²-oxopropyl)-H4pterin, isomerization to 6-lactoyl-H4pterin, and final reduction of this 1â²-oxo compound to H4biopterin; the necessary hydride equivalents come from NADPH (11; pathway reviewed in Ref. 12.Dutch D.S. Smith G.K. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1991; 2: 411-423Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). H4biopterin serves as the electron donor for the hydroxylation of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan and thus is the essential cofactor for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters, catecholamine and serotonin (reviewed in Ref. 13.Kaufman S. Fisher D.B. Hayaishi O. Oxygenases. Academic Press, Inc., New York1962: 285-370Google Scholar). H4biopterin is therefore synthesized in the neurons, and its subsaturating levels, in some cases, control neurotransmitter synthesis (14.Hirayama K. Kapatos G. J. Neurochem. 1990; 70: 164-170Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15.Kapatos G. Hirayama K. Hasegawa H. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2048-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). H4biopterin is also an essential component of nitric oxide synthase (reviewed in Refs. 16.Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The diversity of nitric oxide function as a diffusible intercellular messenger in fishes is, however, not yet explained in such detail as in mammals (18.Nilsson G.E. Soderstrom V. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 118: 949-958Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and not yet analyzed in the zebrafish. The pigment cells of cyprinid fishes, including the zebrafish, comprise three types. First there are the iridophores, which are packed with purine crystals, identified as guanine and hypoxanthine (19.Ziegler I. Z. Vgl. Physiol. 1956; 39: 163-189Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Second, are the melanophores. They synthesize melanin from dopa, which in turn is produced from tyrosine. The supply with this rate-limiting substrate depends on the hydroxylation of phenylalanine and thus on the availability of the essential cofactor H4biopterin. Several years ago it was suggested that, in differentiating melanophores of fish, H4biopterin is involved as the essential cofactor for tyrosine formation (20.Ziegler I. Z. Naturforsch. 1963; 18b: 551-556Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and more recently it has been demonstrated that, in the human epidermis, H4biopterin does indeed regulate the supply of tyrosine required for melanin synthesis (21.Schallreuter K.U. Wood J.M. Pittelkow M.R. GuÌtlich M. Lemke R. RoÌdl W. Swanson N.N. Hitzemann K. Ziegler I. Science. 1994; 263: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The third type of pigment cells found in the zebrafish are the xanthophores, which contain pteridines serving directly as pigments. Recently, it has been suggested that the yellow color of these cells is due to sepiapterin (6.Odenthal J. Rossnagel K. Haffter P. Kelsh R.N. Vogelsang E. Brand M. van Eeden F.J.M. Furutani-Seiki M. Granato M. Hammerschmidt M. Heisenberg C.P. Jiang Y.J. Kane D.A. Mullins M.C. NuÌsslein-Vollhard C. Development. 1996; 123: 391-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a compound that was first isolated from thesepia mutant of Drosophila and was shown to be a 7,8-dihydropterin carrying a lactoyl group at position C-6 (reviewed in Ref. 22.Pfleiderer W. Angew. Chemie. 1963; 75: 993-1040Crossref Google Scholar). Accumulation of pteridines in the skin of various cyprinid species has also been described (19.Ziegler I. Z. Vgl. Physiol. 1956; 39: 163-189Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23.HuÌttel R. Sprengling G. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1943; 554: 69-82Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24.Matsumoto J. Kajishima T. Hama T. Genetics. 1960; 45: 1177-1189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the main component of these, originally named ichthyopterin, was shown to be 7-oxobiopterin (25.Tschesche R. Glaser A. Chem. Ber. 1958; 91: 2081-2089Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26.Kauffmann T. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1959; 625: 133-139Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). During the development of vertebrates, multipotent neural crest cells give rise to peripheral neuronal cells as well as to pigment cells (27; reviewed in Ref. 28.Eisen J.S. Weston J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although these two types of cells vary widely in their phenotype and cellular function, it nevertheless seems clear that both of them must express the enzymes that catalyze the de novo synthesis of pteridines from GTP. So far, the numerous genetic and developmental studies that address neuronal defects, changes in pigment cell pattern, or both have focussed on the description of the phenotype. The aim of the present work, therefore, was to analyze the pattern of how pteridines occur in the zebrafish, to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway leading to them, and thus to identify committing steps in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters, of melanin, and of xanthophore pigments during the development of the organism. Wild type zebrafish of the AB background were raised in the zebrafish facility of the Institute of Mammalian Genetics, Neuherberg, and embryos were obtained from natural spawning. They were grouped according to number postfertilization hours at 28.5 Â°C. The samples were collected in batches of 10â20 animals, immediately frozen, and kept at â85 Â°C until analysis. Chemicals used for the determination of enzymatic activities and for protein and pteridine determination were obtained as described previously (29.Ziegler I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 28: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30.Kerler F. HuÌltner L. Ziegler I. Katzenmaier G. Bacher A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Pterins were from Schircks (Jona, Switzerland). 2,4,7-Trioxopteridine was prepared by a modification of a previously described method (31.Pfleiderer W. Chem. Ber. 1957; 90: 2588-2603Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (see below). A sample of the same compound, as well as 7-oxo-6-carboxypterin and 7-oxobiopterin isolated from carp skin were donated by Dr. M. Nakagoshi (Kitasato). Construction of the plasmids used for expression of murine recombinant GTP cyclohydrolase I and for murine sepiapterin reductase followed the procedures described earlier (11.Auerbach G. Herrmann A. GuÌtlich M. Fischer M. Jacob U. Bacher A. Hubert R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7219-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32.GuÌtlich M. Ziegler I. Witter K. Hemmens B. HuÌltner L. McDonald J.D. Werner T. RoÌdl W. Bacher A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1675-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recombinant 6-pyruvoyl-H4pterin synthase was a gift from Dr. A. Bacher (MuÌnchen). Milk xanthine oxidoreductase was obtained from Sigma, alkaline phosphatase from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, MicroSpin G25 columns from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sep-Pak cartridges from Waters Corporation, and cellulose thin layer chromatography plates from Merck. A suspension of 6-amino-5-nitroso-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (1.0 g; 6.4 mmol) in deaerated water (100 ml) containing sodium hydroxide (0.26 g; 6.4 mmol) was hydrogenated over Raney nickel catalyst (1 ml) at room temperature and pressure for 15 h. The reaction mixture was filtered under nitrogen directly onto methyl glyoxalate hemiacetal (1.57 g; 128 mmol) prepared from dimethyl l-tartrate (33.Waldener A. Tetrahydron Letts. 1986; 27: 6059-6062Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and the resulting mixture was stirred in the dark at room temperature for 10 h. Evaporation followed by recrystallization from water using activated charcoal, gave 2,4,7-trioxopteridine as a light yellow solid (1.05 g; 91%). The samples (batches of 50 animals, 96- to 120-h postfertilization) were extracted by homogenization with a Wheaton Teflon homogenizer in 100 ml of Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 6.9) and centrifuged at 13,000 Ãg for 10 min. The extract was oxidized by acidic iodine, deproteinized by trichloroacetic acid, and purified by cation-exchange chromatography, as described previously. The lyophilized material was prefractionated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), using 3% methanol in water as the mobile phase, and a fluorescence detector, as described before (29.Ziegler I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 28: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30.Kerler F. HuÌltner L. Ziegler I. Katzenmaier G. Bacher A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The fractions were concentrated in vacuo. Three main fractions were obtained and identified using a combination of physical and chemical methods. HPLC analysis using a Shimadzu model RF 535 fluorescence detector was carried out on reverse-phase columns using five different solvent systems, the compositions of which are detailed below (see the legend of Table I). Mass spectrometric analysis was carried out using a Micromass LCT instrument with electrospray ionization and time-of-flight analysis. The source temperature was 30 Â°C, and the cone voltage was 30 V. Fractions I and II were dissolved in 30 Î¼l of 0.1 m ammonium hydroxide, and 30 Î¼l of 15% methanol in water, respectively, and injected onto a C-18 reverse-phase HPLC column leading into the mass spectrometer. For further identification of biopterin and of 7-oxobiopterin in Fractions II and III, respectively, the fractions were oxidized by alkaline permanganate, and the resulting pterin-6-carboxylic acids were separated by HPLC and fluorometrically detected as described previously (34.Ziegler I. HuÌltner L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Table IHPLC analysis of the zebrafish pteridine patternSolvent systemIIIIIIIVVFraction I7.27.57.411.48.2Fraction II7.8/8.37.0/7.47.6/8.2 5.1/16.87.2Fraction III11.49.59.620.29.8Biopterin8.37.48.216.87.22,4,7-Oxobiopterin7.87.07.65.17.27-Oxobiopterin11.49.59.620.39.8Isoxanthopterin7.27.57.311.48.2Extracts of zebrafish (96â120 h postfertilization) were prepurified as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ and prefractionated by reverse-phase HPLC with 3% methanol. The fractions (IâIII) were then analyzed in five solvent systems. The compositions of the solvent systems were: I, 2-propanol 0.4%, triethylamine 1%, adjusted to pH 7.0 with H3PO4; II, 3% methanol, 1% acetonitrile, 0.02% phosphoric acid; III, 3% methanol, 1% acetonitrile; IV, K2HPO4 3.5 mm, adjusted to pH 7.2 with H3PO4; V, 5% methanol, NaH2PO4 100 mm, adjusted to pH 3 with H3PO4.

Open table in a new tab Extracts of zebrafish (96â120 h postfertilization) were prepurified as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ and prefractionated by reverse-phase HPLC with 3% methanol. The fractions (IâIII) were then analyzed in five solvent systems.

The flow rate was 1 ml/min; the numbers refer to the retention time (minutes). Sepiapterin was identified by its enzymatic reduction to H2biopterin. A centrifuged homogenate (Tris buffer, 50 mm, pH 6.9) of 40 animals (120-h postfertilization) was concentrated by loading onto Sep-Pak cartridges as described before (35.FerreÌ J. Jacobson K. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 350: 389-398Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), desorbed with methanol, concentrated in a vacuum, spotted on cellulose thin layer plates, and developed with butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:5, v/v). The yellow fluorescent spots (R F = 0.17) were extracted with Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 7.9), centrifuged, and incubated for 40 min with NADPH (200 Î¼m) and recombinant sepiapterin reductase for 40 min. After acidic iodine oxidation of the reaction product H2biopterin, the sample was analyzed by HPLC in solvent systems I and II (see legend of Table I). Batches of 10â20 animals were extracted, oxidized, deproteinized, and prepurified by cation-exchange chromatography as described above. Because isoxanthopterin is only partially retained and also 7-oxobiopterin and 2,4,7-trioxopteridine are only partially retained, the lyophilized water washes were separately monitored and their amounts combined. For quantitative determination by HPLC analysis, the solvent systems I and II (see legend of Table I) were used. Due to the different fluorescence characteristics of biopterin and, conversely, of the pteridines substituted at the 7-position, the samples were either monitored at two different wavelength settings (350-nm excitation/450-nm emission and 340-nm excitation/420-nm emission) or the relative emission characteristics were determined for each series, and the samples were then monitored at only one wavelength setting (350-nm excitation/450-nm emission) and the relevant factors were applied for calculations. For the determination of sepiapterin, the samples were homogenized in 1 ml of Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 6.8), centrifuged, and then adsorbed onto reverse-phase C-18 Sep-Pak cartridges (35.FerreÌ J. Jacobson K. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 350: 389-398Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After washing, desorption with 3 ml of methanol, and concentration by vacuum, sepiapterin was determined by its absorption at 440 nm. The standard curve was linear in the range of 0â15 nmol/ml. For all enzyme assays, batches of 10â20 animals were homogenized in Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) as described above. The centrifuged homogenates (13,000 Ãg, 15 min) were passed through MicroSpin G25 columns. For determination of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity, the reaction product H2neopterin triphosphate was oxidized to neopterin triphosphate by acidic iodine solution. After reduction of excess iodine by ascorbic acid and dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase (0.8 unit/200 Î¼l), neopterin was determined by HPLC using solvent systems I and II (see legend of Table I). For determination of 6-pyruvoyl-H4pterin synthase, H2neopterin triphosphate was first generated by incubation of GTP with recombinant murine GTP cyclohydrolase I. To determine the activity of the synthase, the extract containing it (plus Mg2+, to achieve a final concentration of 10 mm) was added, and the unstable intermediate 6-pyruvoyl-H4pterin was converted to H4biopterin by the addition of recombinant murine sepiapterin reductase and NADPH (200 Î¼m). After acidic iodine oxidation, biopterin was separated by HPLC (36.GuÌtlich M. Witter K. Bourdais J. Veron M. RoÌdl W. Ziegler I. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The activity of sepiapterin reductase was determined by reduction of sepiapterin to dihydrobiopterin with NADPH, acidic iodine oxidation, and HPLC separation of the resultant biopterin. The detailed conditions for all enzyme assays were as described previously (30.Kerler F. HuÌltner L. Ziegler I. Katzenmaier G. Bacher A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For preparation of 6-pyruvoyl-H4pterin as a potential substrate for the xanthine oxidoreductase variant, H2neopterin triphosphate was first generated by incubation of GTP with recombinant murine GTP cyclohydrolase I, and EDTA was quenched by addition of Mg2+as described above; the reaction mixture was incubated with recombinant 6-pyruvoyl-H4pterin synthase for 20 min and then immediately used. Due to the endogenous sepiapterin reductase activity of zebrafish homogenates and the additional function of this enzyme as an isomerase (11.Auerbach G. Herrmann A. GuÌtlich M. Fischer M. Jacob U. Bacher A. Hubert R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7219-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37.Katoh S. Sueoka T. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the intermediates 6-lactoyl-H4pterin and 6-(1â²-hydroxy-2â²-oxopropyl)-H4pterin are transiently formed also, so that these could also be considered as possible precursors for 7-oxobiopterin formation. The assay for xanthine oxidoreductase activity used the conversion of pterin to isoxanthopterin, which was then separated by HPLC (solvent system IV; see legend of Table I) and fluorometrically detected (340-nm excitation/410-nm emission) (38.Beckman J.S. Parks D.A. Pearson J.D. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 39.Yamamoto T. Moriwaki Y. Takahashi S. Tsutsumi Z. Yamakita J. Nasako Y. Hiroishi K. Higashino K. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Appl. 1996; 681: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The instrument was standardized by measurements with the product (isoxanthopterin) and the substrate. For the determination of the oxidase activity, the reaction mixture (100 Î¼l) contained the extract (30 Î¼l), pterin (50 Î¼m), and air-saturated Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0). For the determination of combined dehydrogenase plus oxidase activity, NAD (400 Î¼m) was included. The samples were incubated for 40 min at 37 Â°C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 n trichloroacetic acid (20 Î¼l). Protein was estimated by the Coomassie dye binding reagent (Bio-Rad protein assay reagent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracts from 4- to 5-day-old zebrafish, which had been purified by cation-exchange chromatography and then prefractionated by reverse-phase HPLC with 3% methanol, yielded three major fractions, labeled I through III. Each of these fractions was investigated separately, and the pteridines in them were identified as described below. Fraction I eluted at 9.8 min. On further reverse-phase HPLC analysis with a fluorescence detector, it showed one peak that coeluted with authentic isoxanthopterin in all of five different solvent systems (Table I). Its maximum fluorescence emission at 410 nm, and its UV spectra in both 0.1 m HCl and 0.1 m NaOH were identical with those of authentic isoxanthopterin. The two strongest peaks in its electrospray mass spectrum occurred at m/z 180 (M + H+) and 218 (M + K+) and were identical with the two strongest peaks of authentic isoxanthopterin measured under the same conditions. Fraction II eluted at 11.0 min. On further reverse-phase HPLC analysis with a fluorescence detector, it showed two peaks in four out of five solvent systems tested (Table I), and these were identified as 2,4,7-trioxopteridine and biopterin. First, the two peaks had the same retention times as authentic samples of 2,4,7-trioxopteridine and biopterin. Second, the excitation/emission wavelengths of the first fluorescence peak were shifted from 350/450 nm to 340/420 nm, reaching 3-fold enhancement. This is typical of 7-oxopteridines (40.Hodnett C.N. McCormack J.J. Sebean J.A. J. Pharm. Sci. 1976; 65: 1150-1154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 41.Nakagoshi M. Takikawa S. Tsutsue M. Experientia. 1983; 39: 742-744Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 42.Davis M.D. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3526-3533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the mass spectrum of the first fluorescence peak showed a strong ion atm/z 203 (M + Na+). Authentic 2,4,7-trioxopteridine, measured under the same conditions, also shows a strong ion at m/z 203. Fourth, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the compound in the second fluorescence peak was found to have both UV and mass spectra identical with those of authentic biopterin. The mass spectrum showedm/z peaks at 238 (M + H+), 260 (M + Na+), and 276 (M + K+). Fifth, alkaline permanganate oxidation of the second peak yielded pterin-6-carboxylic acid (Fig. 1 A). Alkaline iodine oxidation of zebrafish extracts, which decomposes H4biopterin (43.Fukushima T. Nixon J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), left no biopterin. This demonstrated that the total biopterin fraction exists as H4biopterin. Fraction III eluted at 13.9 min. It showed a 1.5-fold increase in fluorescence intensity at 420 nm as compared with 450 nm, indicating a 7-oxopteridine, and HPLC analysis in solvent systems IâIV (Table I) suggested its identity with 7-oxobiopterin. This was confirmed by alkaline permanganate oxidation of Fraction III to 6-carboxy-7-oxopterin (Fig. 1 B). The yellow pterin, isolated from the Sep-Pak cartridges, had an absorption maximum at 340 nm in 0.1 m NaOH and at 410 nm in 0.1 m HCl, as is characteristic for sepiapterin (44.Pfleiderer W. Chem.

Reduction of it with sepiapterin reductase plus NADPH yielded H2biopterin, which was oxidized by acidic iodine to biopterin, identified by HPLC analysis with solvent systems I and II (Fig. 1 C and Table I) The individual pteridines, which constitute the final pattern of pigments in the xanthophores, were found to have different developmental profiles (Fig.2). Both H4biopterin and sepiapterin were the first ones to form, appearing within 24-h postfertilization. H4biopterin rapidly increased to a maximum after 72 h, and finally stayed constant around 7 pmol per animal. In contrast, sepiapterin continued to increase during the following period up to a 10-fold level. Formation of the three 7-oxopteridines (7-oxobiopterin, isoxanthopterin, and 2,4,7-trioxopteridine) began after an initial time lag of 24 h, but their concentrations then increased rapidly. This indicated that the de novo biosynthetic pathway must first provide the substrate for the subsequent formation of the 7-oxo derivatives. The three enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of H4biopterin from GTP jointly start to develop during the first 24-h postfertilization (Fig.3 A). This agrees with the early increase in H4biopterin levels (Fig. 2). However, their activities diverge after 72 h: GTP cyclohydrolase I activity reaches a maximum after 72 h and then declines, whereas both 6-pyruvoyl-H4pterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase activities continue to increase after 72 h. Xanthine oxidoreductase efficiently converts pterin into isoxanthopterin (38.Beckman J.S. Parks D.A. Pearson J.D. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 45.Forrest H.S. Glassmann E. Mitchell H.K. Science. 1956; 124: 725-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This enzyme was therefore a likely candidate for the generation of the 7-oxopterins from intermediates that are synthesized along the route of the de novo pathway in the zebrafish. The enzyme exists as two interconvertible forms, xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidoreductase, which use either NAD+ (the dehydrogenase) or molecular oxygen (the oxidase) as the electron acceptor. In the same way as purified milk xanthine oxidoreductase, extracts of zebrafish (72-h postfertilization) were able to catalyze the oxygenation of pterin to isoxanthopterin. The yield was 83.9 Â± 13.1 pmol/mg/min (O2 as electron acceptor) and 124 Â± 20.8 pmol/mg/min (NAD+ as electron acceptor). The development of the pteridine pattern (Fig. 2) suggests that at approximately 48-"
https://openalex.org/W1978532711,"Fractalkine, or neurotactin, is a chemokine that is present in endothelial cells from several tissues, including brain, liver, and kidney. It is the only member of the CX3C class of chemokines. Fractalkine contains a chemokine domain (CDF) attached to a membrane-spanning domain via a mucin-like stalk. However, fractalkine can also be proteolytically cleaved from its membrane-spanning domain to release a freely diffusible form. Fractalkine attracts and immobilizes leukocytes by binding to its receptor, CX3CR1. The x-ray crystal structure of CDF has been solved and refined to 2.0 â« resolution. The CDF monomers form a dimer through an intermolecular Î²-sheet. This interaction is somewhat similar to that seen in other dimeric CC chemokine crystal structures. However, the displacement of the first disulfide in CDF causes the dimer to assume a more compact quaternary structure relative to CC chemokines, which is unique to CX3C chemokines. Although fractalkine can bind to heparin in vitro, as shown by comparison of electrostatic surface plots with other chemokines and by heparin chromatography, the role of this property in vivois not well understood.

Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). Chemokines provide a chemotactic gradient toward the site of inflammation as they direct the trafficking of a number of leukocytes, accomplishing this by binding to and activating 7-transmembrane-spanning G-protein-coupled receptors on the surface of the leukocytes. Activation of these receptors then leads to an increase in integrin adhesiveness and stable arrest (2Bargatze R.F. Butcher E.C. J. Exp.

Dermatol. 1998; 8: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar). They are mainly characterized by the presence and conserved relative position of the first two cysteine residues. The intramolecular disulfide bridges stabilize the fold of the peptide, ensuring its binding to specific receptors and its functional activity. Chemokines are classified into four categories: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C. CC chemokines contain two N-terminal adjacent cysteines, whereas the same cysteines in CXC chemokines are separated by one residue. C chemokines contain only one N-terminal cystine residue, and only one member, lymphotactin, has been identified so far (9Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A.

Recently, a new chemokine was discovered that contains the cysteine motif CX3C. This 372-residue protein, known as fractalkine (10Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Zlotnik A.

Because of this natural immobilization, fractalkine can withstand vascular flow to capture and activate leukocytes (13Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J.

A detailed analysis of the structure of CDF would elucidate the differences between CX3C and other chemokines. Here, we describe the x-ray crystal structure of CDF, solved at 2.0 â« resolution. The crystal structure shows a novel quaternary structure for chemokines, which is directly dependent on the bulge produced by the introduction of three residues between the N-terminal cysteines. CDF can bind to heparin, as shown by heparin-agarose chromatography, with an affinity similar to MIP-1Î±. A comparison of the calculated electrostatic surface maps for CDF with those for other chemokines shows similarities of charge distribution, which is indicative of heparin-binding capability. CDF (residues 1â76 of fractalkine, with the N-terminal methionine numbered 0) and its selenomethionine form were overexpressed using the plasmid pLSM103 in Escherichia coli strain BL21/pLysS (20Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Both proteins were lyophilized after reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography and were dissolved in water just before crystallization. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion, mixing 4 Î¼l of protein (17 mg/ml) with 2 Î¼l of well solution (4 m sodium formate, 100 mm disodium citrate, pH 3.0) and 10 Î¼l of water. Hexagonal prisms formed quickly (within 1â2 days) and continued to grow for about 1 week. Although very large crystals could be grown (1â2-mm diameter), they diffracted poorly when exposed to a conventional x-ray source (a rotating anode powered by a Rigaku RU200 generator), on average showing a maximum resolution of 2.8â3.0 â« for a 1Â° oscillation of 10-min exposures. The crystals also deteriorated quickly because of radiation damage, as even the largest (2 mm) crystals mounted in capillaries stopped diffracting after several minutes of exposure. Rapid cooling of the crystals in a liquid nitrogen stream (100 K), after a brief (30 s) soaking in cryoprotectant (6m sodium formate, 100 mm disodium citrate, 10% glycerol, pH 3.0), allowed complete data sets to be collected. In addition, synchrotron radiation allowed for higher resolution data collection (2.0 â«). The space group was determined to be either P6122 or P6522, with unit cell dimensionsa = 110.47 â«, c = 123.99 â«. A data set for the native protein and data sets for the selenomethionine derivative at three wavelengths in the multiple anomalous diffraction experiment were collected (beamline X9B, NSLS) (Table I). The positions of the selenium atoms were determined using SHELXS (21Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar) and were refined using SHARP (22de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The phases were further improved by electron density modification and solvent flattening using DM (23Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) and PHASES (24Furey W. Swaminathan S. Acta Crystallogr. 1990; 18: 73-83Google Scholar). Interestingly, interpretable maps could also be generated using phases derived from data belonging to the pseudocell of length c/2 (l = 2n+1 removed). In both cases, the density for the C-terminal helices and internal Î²-strands could be identified only when the symmetry for space group P6122 or P6222 was applied.Table ICrystal data and refinement statisticsNativeSeMet Î»1SeMet Î»2SeMet Î»3Wavelength (â«)0.980.979150.979460.96483Resolution range (â«)20â2.020â3.020â3.020â3.0Number of reflections (total/unique)345,321/30,36653,284/9,24842,954/9,22843,047/9,245Unit cell (â«)a = 110.47a = 110.27c = 123.99c = 121.86Space groupP6122P6122Completeness (overall/last shell1-aUsing only those reflections within the shell of 2.07â2.0 â« (native) or 3.11â3.0 â« resolution (SeMet).)98.8%/98.4%100%/100%99.9%/99.9%99.9%/99.9%R merge1-bR merge = Î£âI n â â©Iâªâ/Î£â©Iâª.(overall/last shell1-aUsing only those reflections within the shell of 2.07â2.0 â« (native) or 3.11â3.0 â« resolution (SeMet).)3.9%/49.1%9.8%/50.0%8.7%/40.1%8.9%/50.3%I/ÏI (overall/last shell1-aUsing only those reflections within the shell of 2.07â2.0 â« (native) or 3.11â3.0 â« resolution (SeMet).)61.5/3.914.1/3.313.8/3.714.9/3.0R free/R work1-cR work = Î£â{âFo(h)ââkâFo(h)â}â/Î£âFo(h)â;R free = Î£(h) Â·Tâ{âFo(h)ââkâFc(h)â}â/Î£(h) Â· TâFo(h)â, whereT represents a test set of reflections (10% of total, chosen at random) not used in the refinement.32.1%/23.8%RMSD: bonds1-dRMSD, root mean square deviation.0.012 â«RMSD: angles1-dRMSD, root mean square deviation.1.927Â°B-factor (â«2; protein atoms/all atoms)46.4/49.8Number of residues262Number of waters2641-a Using only those reflections within the shell of 2.07â2.0 â« (native) or 3.11â3.0 â« resolution (SeMet).1-b R merge = Î£âI n â â©Iâªâ/Î£â©Iâª.1-c R work = Î£â{âFo(h)ââkâFo(h)â}â/Î£âFo(h)â;R free = Î£(h) Â·Tâ{âFo(h)ââkâFc(h)â}â/Î£(h) Â· TâFo(h)â, whereT represents a test set of reflections (10% of total, chosen at random) not used in the refinement.1-d RMSD, root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab Because only four sites were located clearly, only one of the three selenomethionines present in the monomer was ordered. From its location in the electron density as well as by comparison to the NMR model of CDF (20Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), Met62 was identified as the ordered selenium site. A relatively good fit to the electron density was achieved for the regions corresponding to the Î²-strands and C-terminal Î±-helix with the sulfur of Met62 placed at the selenium sites. Because of the strong noncrystallographic symmetry, two monomers could be placed by fitting the NMR model to the density, whereas the remaining two were positioned by translating the first two monomers along the c axis by c/2. Although significant fragments of the main chain of all four monomers were located in the electron density, an extensive remodeling followed by refinement was necessary for most of the model. The model was truncated to residues 7â68, and regions 7â19 and 28â36 were rebuilt based on initial maps using the program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). The model was refined using X-PLOR (26BruÌnger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-Ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and SHELXL (21Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), giving a final R-factor of 0.238 and a freeR-factor of 0.321. See Table Ifor further details. The chemokines RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed), MCP-1, MCP-3, MCP-4, MIP-1Î±, and MIP-1Î² were loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) and eluted with a 15-ml linear gradient (0â2 mNaCl in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The presence of protein was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm, and the concentration of NaCl was determined by using an in-line conductivity meter calibrated using the same gradient without protein. RANTES was a gift from Dr. Amanda Proudfoot (27Proudfoot A.E. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Montjovent M.O. Borlat F. Offord R.E. Wells T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2599-2603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). MCP-1, MCP-3, and MCP-4 were overexpressed in E. coli and purified using standard protocols. MIP-1Î± and MIP-1Î² were purchased from PeproTech (Princeton, NJ). The interactions between monomers of CDF in the crystal are limited, and as a result the average B-factor of the molecule is relatively high (46 â«2) for a frozen crystal. This is not the first such example for chemokines; however, for instance, the crystal structure of viral MIP-2 solved using multiple anomalous diffraction also shows a high average B-factor (49 â«2) (PDB accession code 1cm9). The loose packing of the molecules reflects the high solvent content of 65â70%. Four monomers of CDF are found within the asymmetric unit arranged as layers along the c-parameter (Fig. 1). This arrangement gives rise to large (70 â«) channels along this direction. The four monomers in the asymmetric unit are arranged as two asymmetric dimers related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold rotation. This 2-fold axis lies along the (1 -1 0) vector, translated to approximatelyc = 1/6. Because of slight translational misalignments and packing anomalies between the two dimers (see below), the exact symmetry for P6222, with c = 62 â« (the pseudo half-cell), is broken, forcing four monomers rather than two into the asymmetric unit of P6122, with c = 124 â«. When the data were scaled as the pseudo half-cell (l = 2n+1 removed) and the model was refined against these data, the free R-factor did not drop below 0.40, confirming the correct space group as P6122. There is no direct contact seen between these two created dimers, but rather through bound solvent molecules. The closest contact (â¼4 â«) between the dimers is at the C terminus of monomer D, the Î±-helix of which is ordered for an extra 1Â½ turns (residues 68â74), and of the symmetry-related monomer B. There is a presumed contact between the disordered C termini of monomers A and C, whose helices, if ordered past residue 68, would overlap at the site of the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis in the crystal. The two monomers that create the dimers (monomers A and D, and B and C) make close contact with each other through an asymmetric interaction of residues 8â14. The dimer is stabilized by a Î²-sheet formed by residues Cys8 to Thr11 (monomers A and C) and residues Thr11 to Lys14 (monomers B and D) and additional hydrogen bonds between loops 26â28 and 46â48. Note that CDF has not been found to dimerize in solution at any concentration (20Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Hoover, D. M., Shaw, J. P., Gryczynski, I., Proudfoot, A. E. I., Wells, T. N., and Lubkowski, J. (2000)Prot. Pept. Lett., in pressGoogle Scholar). However, this does not rule out dimer formation in vivo, in the presence of the receptor and other participating molecules. It has been observed that at high concentrations, as well as in crystalline environments, chemokines frequently form well defined dimers (or tetramers (29Czaplewski L.G. McKeating J. Craven C.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The modes of dimerization of chemokines can be classified into two general categories, one observed for most of the CXC chemokines and the other found for CC chemokines. The dimer formed by CDF does not resemble either of these modes, except that the dimeric interaction is formed via an intermolecular Î²-sheet, similar to CC chemokines. However, the monomers in CDF form a more compact dimer than that of CC chemokine dimers. This motion is facilitated by the 3-residue insertion between the disulfides. Although the second disulfide of CDF (Cys12-Cys50) can be superimposed onto the second disulfide of two CC chemokines (MCP-1 (30Lubkowski J. Bujacz G. BoqueÌ L. Domaille P.J. Handel T.M. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and RANTES (PDB accession code 1b3a)), the first disulfide of CDF (Cys8-Cys34) forces the N terminus to remain close to the core of the monomer. This arrangement causes the second monomer to twist around the peptide Ser13-Lys14to form the intramolecular Î²-sheet. The first disulfide also causes a bulge in the Î²-strands formed between the two CDF monomers, further distorting the dimeric interface and possibly weakening the dimer formation. The asymmetry of the dimerization is evident when the monomers are superimposed onto each other (Fig.2). Overall, the structure of the CDF monomer (Fig. 3) is similar to that of other chemokine monomers, particularly MCP-1 and RANTES. This similarity is not surprising, because CDF has the highest identities with these two chemokines (35% and 21%, respectively). The C-terminal Î±-helix on monomer D, however, extends out to Ala71, with the remaining residues in an extended conformation (Leu72-Arg74). The extension of the helical conformation is probably weakly stable, because there are no direct contacts between this extension and other protein atoms. Also, the extension of C termini for the other three monomers is blocked by the presence of protein crystal contacts. Almost all residues are clearly defined by electron density. Residues 42â47, which form a loop and are completely solvent accessible, are the most disordered within the chain, except for the extreme N and C termini. Several solvent-accessible side chains also appear to be disordered, such as Lys14 and Arg44. Met15, although clearly visible in the electron density, has a higherB-factor than Met62, which might be the reason why only one selenium site was determined by the multiple anomalous diffraction experiment. Superpositions of CC chemokine monomers MCP-1 and RANTES onto the CDF monomer show significant differences where the sequence alignment deviates (Fig. 4). The crystal structures of MCP-1 and RANTES superimpose on the crystal structure of CDF with fewer deviations than the superposition of the CDF NMR model (20Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) on the crystal structure of CDF. This is seen clearly within the 40s loop (Thr43-Arg47) and in the bulge between Cys8 and Cys12. The N terminus, from Val5-Cys12, and the loop encompassing residues 28â38 are shifted unidirectionally relative to the crystal structure of CDF. This shift is considerable, because the superpositions show a maximal difference of 7 â« between the NMR model and crystal structure of CDF. The N terminus, which is attached via the disulfide between Cys8 and Cys34, is pulled along with this loop into its new position. This unidirectional shift between the NMR model and the crystal structure is partly because of crystal contacts at the edge of the 30s loop (Ser33), stabilizing this region of the molecule and perhaps twisting the chain fragments away. However, the crystal structures of MCP-1 and RANTES, although determined in completely different crystallographic conditions, are closer in structural alignment to CDF. Most chemokines are highly positively charged. This property facilitates the binding to GAGs on the surface of cells, which immobilizes and presents the chemokines for interaction with their receptors on mobile lymphocytes (5Witt D.P. Lander A.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The free, proteolytically cleaved fractalkine form can chemoattract neutrophils and T lymphocytes, whereas the tethered fractalkine form can only chemoattract neutrophils after posttranslational processing in vivo (12Pan Y. Lloyd C. Zhou H. Dolich S. Deeds J. Gonzalo J.A. Vath J. Gosselin M. Ma J. Dussault B. Woolf E. Alperin G. Culpepper J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Gearing D. Nature. 1997; 387: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). This finding raises the question of whether free or tethered CDF can interact and bind to GAGs similar to other freely diffusible chemokines. There are several highly conserved, positively charged residues present in most chemokines, which can be grouped into two sites based on sequence proximity, mutagenesis, and structural proximity. Site 1 comprises residues within the C-terminal helix (which usually begins after a conserved proline, Pro54, in CDF). Site 2 comprises residues from the loop between the second and third Î²-strands of the main Î²-sheet (residues 44â47 in CDF). These two sites have been found to be important in binding chemokines to GAGs (32Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Kuschert G.S. Hoogewerf A.J. Proudfoot A.E. Chung C.W. Cooke R.M. Hubbard R.E. Wells T.N.

The electric charge distribution on the molecular surface of CDF shows clustered positive patches in three regions (Fig.5). Two of the patches overlap with sites 1 and 2, as described above. It is not known whether CDF can bind to GAGs or whether binding to GAGs is required for CDF to chemoattract lymphocytes or neutrophils, but the free form of fractalkine might require some other type of immobilization to create a haptotactic gradient. To investigate whether CDF binds to GAGs with an affinity similar to other chemokines, we compared CDF with an assortment of chemokines using heparin affinity chromatography (TableII). The binding of CDF to heparin-Sepharose is closest in affinity to MIP-1Î±. Although the theoretical pI, number of charged residues, and protein sequence of CDF are most similar to those of RANTES and MCP-1, the binding of CDF to heparin-Sepharose is lower. MIP-1Î± has fewer positive charges on its surface than CDF, RANTES, or MCP-1. Thus, the affinity of CDF for binding to GAGs is not dependent strictly on total net charge but on charge localization on the surface of the protein.Table IIComparison of the concentration of NaCl required to elute various chemokines from heparin-Sepharose and theoretical isoelectric pointsProtein[NaCl], MpI2-aTheoretical.No. K, R2-bNumber of lysine and arginine or aspartate and glutamate residues within the chemokine.No. D, E2-bNumber of lysine and arginine or aspartate and glutamate residues within the chemokine.MIP-1Î±0.34, 0.392-cFrom Ref. 43.5.1478CDF0.37, 0.222-dFrom Ref. 20.9.56115MIP-1Î²0.492-eFrom Ref. 6.4.7768Neutrophil-activating peptide-20.562-cFrom Ref. 43.6.911313Interleukin-80.60c,e9.021410MCP-10.609.39137MCP-30.76, 0.802-cFrom Ref. 43.9.74167MCP-40.789.98154Interferon-inducible protein-100.852-cFrom Ref. 43.10.1166Lymphotaxin0.862-cFrom Ref. 43.10.6156RANTES0.959.241052-a Theoretical.2-b Number of lysine and arginine or aspartate and glutamate residues within the chemokine.2-c From Ref. 43Kuschert G.S.V.

This phenomenon has been seen for the chemokines stromal cell-derived factor-1Î± (35Dealwis C. Fernandez E.J. Thompson D.A. Simon R.J. Siani M.A. Lolis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The driving forces in forming oligomers within a crystal lattice probably include the high concentrations of protein available in the crystal, as well as the unusual electrostatic environment that would be present under such conditions. Similar conditions might occur in vivo, because chemokines are not fully diffusible in simple buffered solutions but are immobilized within a two-dimensional area on the cell surface. It is unknown what local concentrations of the chemokine could be achieved under such conditions. There are other factors known to drive oligomerization. A key structural determinant for aggregation of CC chemokines has been identified as two key acidic residues, one within the 20s loop (Glu26 in RANTES), the other within the C-terminal helix (Asp67 in RANTES) (29Czaplewski L.G. McKeating J. Craven C.J. Higgins L.D. Appay V. Brown A. Dudgeon T. Howard L.A. Meyers T. Owen J. Palan S.R. Tan P. Wilson G. Woods N.R. Heyworth C.M. Lord B.I. Brotherton D. Christison R. Craig S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16077-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although there is no acidic residue in CDF corresponding to Glu26, CDF residue Asp67 does correspond to the second acidic residue in RANTES. Because the aggregation of MIP-1Î±, MIP-1Î², and RANTES is pH-dependent, the oligomers are likely to be held primarily by electrostatic forces. Also, it was found that only one mutation is required to abolish all oligomerization in MIP-1Î±, whereas single mutations lower the amount of oligomerization in RANTES from large, nonspecific aggregates to dimers and tetramers (29Czaplewski L.G. McKeating J. Craven C.J. Higgins L.D. Appay V. Brown A. Dudgeon T. Howard L.A. Meyers T. Owen J. Palan S.R. Tan P. Wilson G. Woods N.R. Heyworth C.M. Lord B.I. Brotherton D. Christison R. Craig S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16077-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Because CDF has a more disperse positive charge on its surface than RANTES, similar to MIP-1Î±, as well as only a single acidic residue, it seems to be in agreement with data for MIP-1Î± and RANTES that CDF does not oligomerize in solution (20Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Hoover, D. M., Shaw, J. P., Gryczynski, I., Proudfoot, A. E. I., Wells, T. N., and Lubkowski, J. (2000)Prot. Pept. Lett., in pressGoogle Scholar). Because the CDF dimer formed within the crystal is both asymmetric and distinct from CC chemokines in form, a comparison may not totally explain the forces behind oligomerization. Although it is known that CDF does not oligomerize in solution, it cannot be ruled out that fractalkine might dimerize while tethered to a membrane. An analysis of the electrostatic surface maps and structure shows that this dimerization is possible. The dimeric interface is relatively devoid of charges, whereas the side opposite the interface is highly charged (data not shown). Also, both C termini for the two monomers within the dimer are on the same side (Fig. 1), unlike the dimers seen in CC chemokine structures (37Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The C-terminal helix is likely to extend farther from the main Î²-sheet, as seen in monomer D. Thus, while bound to the membrane by a flexible mucin-like tether, CDFs might form dimers. CDF binds to heparin with roughly the same affinity as MIP-1Î± (20Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,32Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The electrostatic surface of CDF is most similar to MIP-1Î±. We expect that the binding of CDF to heparin in vivo would be similar to that of MIP-1Î±. Mutation studies have shown that a cationic cleft composed of residues Arg18, Arg46, and Arg48 (Lys19, Arg45, and Arg48 in CDF) is required for binding MIP-1Î± to heparin; the neutralization of any one of these positive charges eliminates binding to heparin (32Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The same is probably true for CDF. Although disruption of MIP-1Î±-GAG interactions has little or no effect on binding to and signaling through CCR1 on Chinese hamster ovary cells, it impairs the ability of MIP-1Î± to induce both a change in the shape of monocytes and chemotaxis, presumably through disruption of interactions with CCR5 (32Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 38Graham G.J. Wilkinson P.C. Nibbs R.J. Lowe S. Kolset S.O. Parker A. Freshney M.G. Tsang M.L. Pragnell I.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6506-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). MIP-1Î±, as opposed to interleukin-8, MCP-1, or RANTES, does not oligomerize on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and its activation of CXCR1-, CCR1-, and CCR2-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells is only slightly weakened by deglycosylation (6Hoogewerf A.J.

Thus, although CDF might bind to GAGs, this binding probably only affects the chemoattractant and activation activities of CDF with specific receptors. In summary, we have shown that CDF forms a novel quaternary structure relative to other chemokines. CDF binds to heparin and is most similar to MIP-1Î± in terms of electrostatic properties, although it is most similar to MCP-1 in terms of sequence homology.

Numerous studies demonstrated that the CaM-KK/CaM-KIV cascade is present and functional in various cell types such as Jurkat cells (12.Park I.-K. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

The CaM-KK/CaM-KI cascade is activated in PC12 cells upon membrane depolarization, although its physiological role remains to be determined (18.Alleta J.M. Selbert M.A. Nairn A.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20930-20934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently a kinase homologous to mammalian CaM-KI (CeCaM-KI) has been cloned in C. elegans (19.Eto K. Takahashi N. Kimura Y. Masuho Y. Arai K. Muramatsu M. Tokumitsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22556-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Unlike mammalian CaM-KI, overexpressed CeCaM-KI is predominantly localized in the nucleus of transfected cells because of the presence of an N-terminal nuclear localization signal. In transfected cells, CeCaM-KK and CeCaM-KI reconstitute a signaling pathway that mediates Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein and cAMP-response element-dependent transcription, similarly to the mammalian CaM-KK/CaM-KIV pathway. In addition to CaM-KI and IV, protein kinase B has been identified as a target for CaM-KK. The phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase B by CaM-KK is responsible for the anti-apoptotic effect upon modest elevation of intracellular Ca2+ in NG108 cells (20.Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). CaM-KK has an N-terminal catalytic domain and a regulatory domain containing autoinhibitory and CaM-binding segments at its C terminus in a similar manner to other CaM kinases. The catalytic domain of CaM-KK contains a unique Arg-Pro-rich 22 residues insert, which plays an important role for recognition of downstream CaM kinases (11.Tokumitsu H. Takahashi N. Eto K. Yano S. Soderling T.R. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15803-15810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+/CaM to CaM-KK is absolutely required for its activation and efficient phosphorylation of target protein kinases (7.Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5617-5622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27.Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21473-21481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previous studies using site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides identified the CaM-binding region of Î±CaM-KK as spanning residues 438â463 (21.Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+-CaM complex with the Î±CaM-KK peptide (residues 438â463) has been resolved by NMR spectroscopy. The CaM-KK peptide forms a fold comprising an Î±-helix (residues 444â454) and a hairpin-like loop (residues 455â459) whose C terminus folds back onto the helix (22.Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This unique loop structure in CaM-KK peptide is stabilized by intramolecular hydrophobic interaction between Met453 and Phe459, which anchor to the C-terminal domain of CaM, as well as interactions involving Phe463, Ile448, and Leu449. This was confirmed by mutation of either Phe459 or Phe463 to Asp, which resulted in a significant reduction of CaM-binding ability of CaM-KK. Trp444 was also identified as another anchoring residue to the N-terminal domain of CaM. Therefore, the orientation of the CaM-KK peptide with respect to the two CaM domains is opposite to that of the MLCKs and CaM-KII peptides (35.Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B.

These observations raised the question why CaM-KK requires an opposite orientation of CaM binding to that of other CaM kinases for the regulation of its protein kinase activity. In this report, we present evidences using CaM-KK mutants and chimeras to assume the critical role of the unique regulatory domain of CaM-KK and the orientation of CaM binding for the kinase autoinhibition.

GST-CaM-KK-(84â434) was constructed by the insertion of aXbaI-digested fragment from pME-CaM-KK-(1â434, 21) into pGEX-KG vector, and the recombinant enzyme was expressed inEscherichia coli JM109 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose. GST-CaM-KI-(1â293, K49E) into pGEX-4T3 was constructed by polymerase chain reaction followed by mutagenesis using a mutagenic oligonucleotide (5â²-AAACTGGTGGCCATCGAATGCATTGCCAAGAAG-3â²) and a GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega Co.). Expressed GST-CaM-KI-(1â293, K49E) in E. coli JM109 was purified on glutathione-Sepharose. Recombinant rat CaM was expressed in E. coli BL-21 (DE3) using pET-CaM (23.Hayashi N. Matsubara M. Takasaki A. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided from Dr. Nobuhiro Hayashi (Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan), and purified by phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography. Nucleotide sequences of those constructs were confirmed. Twenty six-residue synthetic peptides corresponding to the calmodulin-binding domain of both rat Î±CaM-KK (residues 438â463) (21.Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and C. elegans CaM-KK (residues 331â356) (11.Tokumitsu H. Takahashi N. Eto K. Yano S. Soderling T.R. Muramatsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15803-15810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were synthesized by the Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Purity of either peptide was estimated at higher than 95% judging by high pressure liquid chromatography. All other chemicals were from standard commercial sources. Mutagenesis of CaM-KK using pME-CaM-KK (wild-type, 4) plasmid as a template was carried out by a GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega Co.) and mutagenic oligonucleotides as follows; I441A, 5â²-AACTCAGTCAAGCTTGCCCCCAGCTGGACC-3â²; I441R, 5â²-AACTCAGTCAAGCTTCGCCCCAGCTGGACC-3â²; I441D, 5â²-AACTCAGTCAAGCTTGACCCCAGCTGGACC-3â². For CaM-KK truncation and chimera mutants, pME-CaM-KK-(1â463, 21) was mutated at Ile441 by a mutagenic oligonucleotide (5â²-AAGAACTCAGTCAAGCTTAAGCCCAGCTGGACCACT-3â²) to introduce the AflII site and then digested withAflII followed by treating with mung bean nuclease to create a blunt end at the first codon (C) of Leu440. After digestion with NotI, the linearized plasmid ligated with pre-annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides containing theNotI site as follow: pME-CaM-KK-(1â440), 5â²-TCTGACATATGCGCTCTAGAACTAGTGC-3â² and 5â²-GGCCGCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGCATATGTCAGA-3â²; pME-CaM-KK-(1â441), 5â²-TCATCTGACATATGCGCTCTAGAACTAGTGC-3â² and 5â²-GGCCGCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGCATATGTCAGATGA-3â²; pME-CaM-KK-(1â443), 5â²-TCATCCCCAGCTGACATATGCGCTCTAGAACTAGTGC-3â² and 5â²-GGCCGCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGCATATGTCAGCTGGGGATGA-3â²; pME-CaM-KK-(1â444), 5â²-TCATCCCCAGCTGGTGACATATGCGCTCTAGAACTAGTGC-3â² and 5â²-GGCCGCACTAGTTCTAGAGCGCATATGTCACCAGCTGGGGATGA-3â²; pME-CaM-KK-440/smMLCK (chicken gizzard, residues 797â816), 5â²-TCAGAAGAAAATGGCAGAAAACAGGCCATGCTGTCCGAGCAATAGGAAGACTGTCATCCATGTGAGC-3â² and 5â²-GGCCGCTCACATGGATGACAGTCTTCCTATTGCTCGGACAGCATGGCCTGTTTTCTGCCATTTTCTTCTGA-3â²; pME-CaM-KK-440/skMLCK (rabbit skeletal muscle, residues 577â596), 5â²-TCAAGAGGCGCTGGAAGAAAAACTTCATTGCCGTCAGCGCTGCCAACCGCTTCAAGAAGATCTGAGC-3â² and 5â²-GGCCGCTCAGATCTTCTTGAAGCGGTTGGCAGCGCTGACGGCAATGAAGTTTTTCTTCCAGCGCCTCTTGA-3â²; pME-CaM-KK-440/CaM-KII (rat, residues 296â313), 5â²-TCCGACGGAAATTGAAGGGTGCCATCTTGACAACTATGCTGGCTACGAGAAATTTTTGAGC-3â² and 5â²-GGCCGCTCAAAAATTTCTCGTAGCCAGCATAGTTGTCAAGATGGCACCCTTCAATTTCCGTCGGA-3â². pME-CaMKK-(1â448) and (1â434) were constructed as described previously (21.Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For construction of Ile441-inserted CaM-KK chimera mutants, each chimeric mutant described above was digested with EcoRI and NotI and re-inserted into a newly digested pME18s plasmid, which was used as a template for mutagenesis. Mutagenic oligonucleotides are described as follows: pME-CaM-KK-441/skMLCK, 5â²-AAGAACTCAGTCAAGCTTATCAAGAGGCGCTGGAAGAA; pME-CaM-KK-441/smMLCK, 5â²-AAGAACTCAGTCAAGCTTATCAGAAGAAAATGGCAGAA-3â²; pME- CaM-KK-441/CaM-KII, 5â²-AAGAACTCAGTCAAGCTTATCCGACGGAAATTGAAGGG. The nucleotide sequence of each mutant was confirmed by automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA sequencer. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were subcultured in 10-cm dishes 12 h before transfection. The cells were then transferred to serum-free medium and treated with a mixture of either 10 Î¼g of pME18s plasmid DNA (DNAX Research Institute, Inc.) or CaM-KK cDNA containing plasmid DNAs and 60 Î¼g of LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 6.4 ml of medium. After a 32â48-h incubation, the cells (3 plates) were collected and homogenized with 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 10 mg/liter pepstatin A, 10 mg/liter trypsin inhibitor) at 4 Â°C. After centrifugation at 15,000 Ã g for 15 min, the supernatant was diluted by the addition of twice the volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 10 mg/liter pepstatin A, and 10 mg/liter trypsin inhibitor (buffer A) and then applied to a Q-Sepahrose column (0.5-ml bed volume), which had been pre-equilibrated with 50 mmNaCl containing buffer A. After washing the column with 10 ml of the equilibration buffer, CaM-KK was eluted by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.6 m NaCl containing buffer A and stored at â80 Â°C. Either partially purified CaM-KK (1 Î¼l) from transfected COS-7 cells or E. coliexpressed GST-CaM-KK-(84â434, 0.7 Î¼g/ml) was incubated with 10 Î¼g of GST-CaM-KI-(1â293, K49E) at 30 Â°C for 5 min in a solution (25 Î¼l) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMg(Ac)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 Î¼m [Î³-32P]ATP (1000â2000 cpm/pmol) in the presence of either 2 mm EGTA or 2 mmCaCl2, 3 Î¼m CaM. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [Î³-32P]ATP and terminated by spotting aliquots (15 Î¼l) onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P-81) followed by washing in 75 mm phosphoric acid (24.Roskowski R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 99: 3-6Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Phosphate incorporation into GST-CaM-KI-(1â293, K49E) was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting of the filters. For each experiment, â¼10-fold volume of partially purified CaM-KKs used in the assay was analyzed by Western blotting to check the amount of the enzymes. CaM-KK activity was measured for 5 min, which was under the linear condition. Western blotting was carried out using antiserum (1/1000 dilution) against a peptide corresponding to a conserved protein kinase motif (residues 132â146 of CaM-KII), and the biotinylated-CaM overlay was done as described previously (4.Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Detection was performed by using chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products). Protein concentration was estimated by Coomassie Blue dye binding (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (25.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). We have previously identified the CaM-binding domain at the C-terminal of rat Î±CaM-KK (residues 438â463) by using mutagenesis and a synthetic peptide (Fig.1 A) (21.Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, a study using NMR spectroscopy has shown that the CaM-binding peptide (residues 438â463) of Î±CaM-KK bound to the N- and C-terminal domains of CaM in an opposite direction to all other known CaM kinases such as MLCKs and CaM-KII (22.Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This result raised the possibility that CaM-KK is regulated by a mechanism distinct from that controlling other CaM kinases. Indeed, we have found that the CaM-binding peptide (residues 438â463) of Î±CaM-KK is a weak inhibitor of the enzyme, when CaM-KIV activation assay was used to measure CaM-KK activity (21.Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, we performed a direct phosphorylation assay toward the GST-CaM-KI-(1â293, K49E) mutant as a substrate to determine CaM-KK activity. The use of this CaM-KI mutant has numerous advantages. First, CaM-KI lacking a regulatory domain (including an autoinhibitory and CaM-binding domains) is more suitable for measuring the Ca2+/CaM sensitivity of CaM-KK. Second, substitution of Lys49 by Glu abolishes the binding of ATP and allows us to rule out the possibility of a feedback phosphorylation of CaM-KK by activated CaM-KI, which would indirectly affect CaM-KK activity (26.Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10086-10093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Finally, a direct phosphorylation assay allows us to perform kinetic analysis of CaM-KK activity. Thus we examined the inhibitory effect of the Î±CaM-KK peptide (residues 438â463) on the constitutively active mutant (84â434) of CaM-KK lacking both an autoinhibitory and CaM-binding domains (7.Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5617-5622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the peptide inhibits CaM-KK 84â434 activity with an IC50 of â¼15 Î¼m in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. This inhibition is comparable to that obtained with the corresponding peptide from C. elegans CaM-KK (residues 331â356). Kinetic analysis indicated that the peptide inhibition of CaM-KK 84â434 was competitive with respect to ATP (Fig. 1 B, inset) but not to its protein substrate (data not shown). When Ca2+/CaM was added into the inhibitory reaction using 24 Î¼m CaM-KK peptide, the activity of CaM-KK 84â434 was restored up to 80â90% of its original activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). These results indicated that the CaM-binding peptide could also interact with the catalytic domain of CaM-KK and function as an autoinhibitory peptide. Previous mutagenesis study revealed that block mutation of either Lys435-Asn436-Ser437 or Val438-Lys439-Leu440 by triple Asp resulted in increased Ca2+/CaM-independent activity (10â20% of total activity), suggesting that these residues are involved in autoinhibitory function either directly or indirectly (21.Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because constitutive activity of those mutants is low compared with that of fully constitutive active mutant (1â434), we tested the possibility that other regions of CaM-KK, further C-terminal from residue 440, could be important for autoinhibition. When we truncated at residue 448 in CaM-KK, the mutant was inactive (21.Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that the truncation mutant of CaM-KK at Trp444, which turns out to be the anchoring residue to N-terminal domain of CaM (22.Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), was also inactive (27.Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21473-21481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we postulated that the important residue(s) for the autoinhibition are located between residue 438 and 444. We, therefore, constructed other truncated CaM-KK mutants (Fig.2 A) and overexpressed them in COS-7. The expression level of each mutant was analyzed by immunoblotting after partial purification on Q-Sepharose (Fig.2 B). Direct phosphorylation assay toward GST-CaM-KI-(1â293, K49E) by each mutant was performed in the absence of Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 2 C). Consistent with previous observation (21.Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a truncated version of CaM-KK at Phe463did not exhibit significant Ca2+/CaM-independent activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. Further truncation from residue 448 to 441 generated detectable but weak Ca2+/CaM-independent activity, which is â¼20â25% of fully constitutively active mutant (1â434). Interestingly, truncation at Ile441 resulted in complete constitutive activity of CaM-KK similar to that of 1â434 mutant. This result suggests that Ile441 is essential but residue 435â440 may not be absolutely critical for CaM-KK autoinhibition. Our previous result demonstrating a 10â20% constitutive activity of CaM-KK after triple Asp substitution between residues 435â440 was likely because of the indirect effect of the mutation on the function of residue 441. It is noteworthy that Ile441 is conserved in Î²-isoform (8.Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9.Anderson K.A. Means R.L.

To confirm the involvement of Ile441 in the regulatory mechanism of CaM-KK, we mutated Ile441 by Ala, Arg, or Asp in the wild-type CaM-KK. Each mutant exhibited 40â60% of Ca2+/CaM-independent activity and was further activated by Ca2+/CaM (Fig.3 B). A similar result was obtained when these mutations were introduced into the CaM-KK 1â463 mutant (data not shown). The mutation of Ile441 by Asp significantly reduced the binding ability of CaM compared with either wild type or other Ile441 mutants (Fig. 3 A,lower panel). This result is in accordance with the previous observation that the mutation of Val438-Lys439-Leu440 by triple Asp reduced the binding ability of Ca2+-CaM complex (21.Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This is probably because of an intermolecular electrostatic repulsion, because there are many acidic residues in the region of CaM, which binds to the N terminus of the CaM-KK peptide (residues 438â463) (22.Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that the CaM binding and autoinhibitory regions in CaM-KK are overlapped at Ile441. Extensive mutagenesis studies indicated that most of the elements required for CaM binding and autoinhibition of MLCK and CaM-KII were located within the combined segment but clearly separated because mutation of the CaM recognition region has little effect on autoinhibition of the kinases (28.Shoemaker M.O.

Moreover, the CaM recognition sequence among MLCKs and CaM-KII can be interchangeable (28.Shoemaker M.O. Lau W. Shattuck R.L. Kwiatkowski A.P. Matrisian P.E. GuerraSantos L. Wilson E. Lukas T.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4930-4938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may be guaranteed by the fact that MLCKs and CaM-KII contain basic amino acid clusters located at N-terminal of the first hydrophobic anchoring residue resulting in the same direction of CaM-binding (35.Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 36.Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

In contrast, the three-dimensional structure of the Ca2+-CaM complex with the CaM-KK peptide (residues 438â463) has shown that the orientation of CaM binding to the peptide was opposite of that observed for MLCKs and CaM-KII. This difference can be due to the presence of a basic amino acid cluster (Lys451, Arg455-Lys456-Arg457) in the C-terminal region, which interacts with the negatively charged C-terminal channel outlet of CaM (22.Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To determine whether the proper orientation of CaM binding to CaM-KK was required for the regulation of the enzyme, we constructed chimera CaM-KK mutants that contained CaM-binding segment of either chicken smMLCK (residues 797â816) (38.Olson N.J. Pearson R.B. Needleman D.S. Hurwitz M.Y. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), rabbit skMLCK (residues 577â596) (39.Herring B.P. Stull J.T. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1724-1730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or rat Î±CaM-KII (residues 296â313) (40.Lin C.R. Kapiloff M.S. Durgerian K. Tatemoto K. Russo A.F. Hanson H. Schulman H. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5962-5966Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 41.Hanley R.M. Means A.R. Ono T. Kemp B.E. Burgin K.E. Waxham N. Kelly P.T. Science. 1987; 237: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) based on the position of an N-terminal anchoring residue to CaM (Trp444in CaM-KK, Trp800 in smMLCK, Trp580 in skMLCK, and Leu299 in Î±CaM-KII) (Fig.4 A). The clusters of basic amino acids, which are critical for the orientation of the binding of CaM to the peptide, are located at the N terminus of the CaM-binding sequence of each CaM kinase. Therefore, we fused each CaM-binding segment with the catalytic portion of CaM-KK at Leu440. These chimera enzymes were expressed in COS-7 cells and partially purified to analyze their enzymatic activities and Ca2+/CaM binding by CaM overlay method (Fig. 4 B). All of the chimeric enzymes retained the ability to bind Ca2+/CaM as expected (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). Unlike the wild-type and 1â463 mutant of CaM-KK, which are Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzymes, all of the chimeric mutants expressed â¼60% of constitutive activity (Fig.4 C). It is not surprising because Ile441, which is critical for autoinhibition described above, was replaced by a basic residue (Arg or Lys) in all of the chimera mutants. In the presence of Ca2+/CaM, all chimeric enzymes slightly enhanced the CaM-KK activity suggesting that the CaM-binding region of each CaM kinase slightly blocks the catalytic activity. This is consistent with that Ile441 mutants of CaM-KK, which exhibited 40â60% constitutive activities and were further activated by the addition of Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 3 B). Finally we inserted Ile441 into the boundary between the catalytic domain and CaM-binding region of each chimeric CaM-KK to examine Ca2+/CaM dependence of the mutants (Fig.5 A). As shown in Fig.5 B, all of the chimera CaM-KKs containing Ile441are virtually inactive in the absence of Ca2+/CaM and are activated by Ca2+/CaM to the same extent to the wild-type CaM-KK. These results demonstrate that the orientation of Ca2+/CaM binding to the CaM-binding region is not critical for the relief of CaM-KK autoinhibition. The present mutagenesis identified Ile441 as a critical residue for autoinhibition of Î±CaM-KK located at â3 position from Trp444, which is an anchoring residue to the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of CaM. Three-dimensional structural analysis of Ca2+/CaM binding (35.Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 36.Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) and sequence alignment of MLCKs and CaM-KII show that the residues at the â1 to â3 position from the N-terminal anchoring residue to CaM (Fig. 4 A) are basic in all of them. These residues are critical for the determination of the direction in which CaM is binding, as they interact with more negatively charged C-terminal domain than N-terminal domain of CaM. In the case of CaM-KK, substitution of Ile441 by either Ala, Arg, or Asp resulted in increased constitutive activity (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that a residue with a lower hydrophobicity at â3 position from Trp444 caused suppression of the autoinhibitory function. Thus, a basic residue should not be located at a key position for the autoinhibition in CaM-KK. In agreement with this, the cluster of basic amino acid is located at the C-terminal portion in CaM-binding segment of CaM-KK (Lys451, Arg455-Lys456-Arg457), resulting in an opposite direction of Ca2+/CaM binding compared with other CaM kinases such as MLCKs and CaM-KII (22.Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), although the direction of Ca2+/CaM binding itself is not critical for relief of the autoinhibition. This is supported by the result that all of the chimeric CaM-KKs lacking Ile441 exhibited enhanced Ca2+/CaM-independent activity (Fig. 4). Kinetic analysis of CaM-KK peptide inhibition raises the possibility that Ile441 interacts with the ATP-binding domain directly and/or distort the ATP-binding site allosterically by interacting with the catalytic domain of CaM-KK. This might be analogous to Phe307 in the CaM-binding domain of CaM-KI that interacts with Phe31 in its glycine-rich ATP loop resulted in obstructing the nucleotide binding pocket (42.Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We propose that the Ca2+/CaM-binding segment of CaM-KK with an opposite orientation of CaM binding to other CaM kinases plays a key role for its autoinhibitory function through Ile441. Ile441 is likely the residue released from the catalytic domain upon binding of Ca2+/CaM to the regulatory region. Future studies including structural determination will be necessary to establish the molecular mechanism of interaction between Ile441 and the catalytic domain of CaM-KK and to determine how this residue contributes to the autoinhibitory function of CaM-KK."

https://openalex.org/W1990669582,"Polysialic acid (PSA) is a developmentally regulated carbohydrate found primarily on neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM) in embryonic tissues. The majority of NCAM in adult tissues lacks this unique carbohydrate, but polysialylated NCAM (PSA-NCAM) is present in adult brain regions where neural regeneration persists and in some pediatric brain tumors such as medulloblastoma, which show greater propensity for leptomeningeal spread. Pax3, a developmentally regulated paired homeodomain transcription factor, is thought to be involved in the regulation of neural cell adhesion molecules. Overexpression of murine Pax3 into a human medulloblastoma cell line (DAOY) resulted in an increase in NCAM polysialylation and a 2â4-fold increase in Î±2,8-polysialyltransferase type II mRNA levels. No difference was observed in Î±2,8-polysialyltransferase type IV message. The addition of PSA to NCAM changed the adhesive behavior of these <i>Pax3</i> transfectants. Transfectants expressing high PSA-NCAM show much less NCAM-dependent aggregation than those with less PSA-NCAM. In addition, <i>Pax3</i> transfectants having high PSA-NCAM show heterophilic adhesion involving polysialic acid to heparan sulfate proteoglycan and agrin. These observations suggest that a developmentally regulated transcription factor, Pax3, could affect NCAM polysialylation and subsequently cell-cell and cell-substratum interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2062560106,"Protein splicing is a self-catalytic process in which an intervening sequence, termed an intein, is excised from a protein precursor, and the flanking polypeptides are religated. The conserved intein penultimate His facilitates this reaction by assisting in Asn cyclization, which results in C-terminal splice junction cleavage. However, many inteins do not have a penultimate His. Previous splicing studies with 2 such inteins yielded contradictory results. To resolve this issue, the splicing capacity of 2 more inteins without penultimate His residues was examined. Both the Methanococcus jannaschii phosphoenolpyruvate synthase and RNA polymerase subunit Aâ² inteins spliced. Splicing of the phosphoenolpyruvate synthase intein improved when its penultimate Phe was changed to His, but splicing of the RNA polymerase subunit Aâ² intein was inhibited when its penultimate Gly was changed to His. We propose that inteins lacking a penultimate His (i) arose by mutation from ancestors in which a penultimate His facilitated splicing, (ii) that loss of this His inhibited, but may not have blocked, splicing, and (iii) that selective pressure for efficient expression of the RNA polymerase yielded an intein that utilizes another residue to assist Asn cyclization, changing the intein active site so that a penultimate His now inhibits splicing.

Inteins have 2 structural domains (Fig.1 A) as follows: a splicing domain that is composed of the N-terminal and C-terminal splicing regions, and a central region encoding a homing endonuclease (3.Belfort M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11869-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The protein splicing reaction requires the intein splicing domain plus the first amino acid of the C-extein. The self-catalytic protein splicing mechanism (reviewed in Noren et al. (20.Noren C.J. Wang J. Perler F.B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 450-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) consists of the following four steps, each involving nucleophilic displacements (Fig. 2): (i) formation of a linear (thio)ester by an acyl rearrangement of the conserved Cys or Ser at the intein N terminus; (ii) formation of a branched intermediate by transesterification when the thiol/hydroxyl group of the Ser, Thr, or Cys at the beginning of the C-extein attacks the (thio)ester from step 1, resulting in transfer of the N-extein to the side chain of the first C-extein residue; (iii) resolution of the branched intermediate by cyclization of the intein C-terminal Asn or Gln, resulting in cleavage of the peptide bond between the intein and the C-extein; and (iv) formation of a native peptide bond between the exteins by a spontaneous SâN (or OâN) acyl rearrangement. Dead-end side reactions are often observed when the intein is expressed in a heterologous extein. N-terminal splice junction cleavage products are formed by cleavage of the (thio)ester at either the N-terminal splice junction or at the branch point in the branched intermediate. C-terminal splice junction cleavage results when Asn or Gln cyclization precedes steps 1 or 2. Although inteins are not true enzymes in the sense that they do not act on multiple substrates, they use the same mechanisms as enzymes to facilitate splicing, including oxyanion holes at each splice junction (6.Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 20.Noren C.J. Wang J. Perler F.B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 450-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This paper focuses on the role of the intein penultimate residue, which is thought to facilitate C-terminal splice junction cleavage and Asn cyclization when His is present at this position. Inteins must increase the rate of Asn or Gln cyclization, since Asn cyclization takes several days at 37 Â°C, pH 7.4, in model peptides, and cyclization of Gln is even slower due to entropic factors (21.Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in both proteins and peptides, the preferred reaction is the attack by the main chain nitrogen on the side chain carbonyl leading to deamidation, as opposed to the protein splicing reaction in which the side chain amide nitrogen attacks the main chain carbonyl (21.Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inteins can increase the rate of Asn or Gln cyclization and direct the reaction toward peptide bond cleavage by aligning reactive groups and rendering the peptide bond more labile by generating an electrophilic center at the carbonyl carbon. The increased electrophilicity could be accomplished by (i) hydrogen bonding to the carbonyl oxygen, thereby stabilizing the developing negative charge on the tetrahedral intermediate of the cyclization reaction, and/or (ii) making the main chain amine a better leaving group by donating a proton. Inteins could also facilitate cyclization by increasing the nucleophilicity of the side chain amide group. The intein penultimate His is thought to assist Asn cyclization. Most inteins have a His in the penultimate position (2.Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 344-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and mutation of this His inhibits or blocks splicing (10.Chong S. Williams K.S. Wotkowicz C. Xu M.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10567-10577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11.Cooper A.A. Chen Y. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H.

The crystal structures of the Mycobacterium xenopi gyrase subunit A (GyrA)1 intein (6.Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and theSaccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar ATPase intein (8.Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) in the absence of a C-extein reveal that the intein penultimate His is in hydrogen bonding distance to an Asn carboxylate oxygen. The penultimate His therefore facilitates Asn cyclization by making the Asn carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Modeling of the M. xenopi GyrA intein suggests that the penultimate His may donate a proton to the main chain amine leaving group (6.Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Seventeen inteins (10 families of intein alleles) have another residue at the penultimate position (2.Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 344-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), including Gly, Ala, and Phe which are unlikely to assist in Asn or Gln cyclization (Fig. 1 B). Are these inteins capable of splicing? Previous studies of 2 such inteins yielded contradictory results. The Chlamydomonas eugametosClpP intein failed to splice in Escherichia coli unless its penultimate Gly was mutated to His (19.Wang S. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11869-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that inteins lacking a penultimate His are inactive. On the other hand, the DnaE intein of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 spliced in E. coli (22.Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), although more spliced product accumulated when its penultimate Ala was mutated to His (23.Scott C.P. Abel-Santos E. Wall M. Wahnon D.C. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13638-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To address this issue further, the Methanococcus jannaschii (Mja) phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PEP) and RNA polymerase subunit Aâ² (Rpol Aâ²) inteins with Phe and Gly at the intein penultimate position, respectively, were tested for their ability to splice with their native penultimate residue and with a penultimate His. The Pyrococcus sp. GB-D DNA polymerase intein in pMIP21 (24.Xu M. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) was replaced with either the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein or the Mja PEP intein plus varying lengths of native N- and C-extein sequences (E) to generate MEIEP fusions (Fig. 1 C). DNA encoding the M. jannaschiiinteins was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA using Mja Rpol Aâ² primers, 5â²-ATG CTC GAG CAC CAA ACT TAA TTA TTG AGG AT and 5â²-ATT GAG GCC TTC AGC GTT GTA GGG CGG GCA ATT or Mja PEP primers 5â²-ATG CTC GAG ACG ATG TTT GTT AAG GAT GAA AAA and 5â²-ATT GAG GCC TCT AGA AAC GAT TGC CGC GTG GCA GTT. The Mja Rpol Aâ² fragment included 200 native N-extein residues and 5 native C-extein residues. The Mja PEP intein fragment included 150 native N-extein residues and 7 native C-extein residues. The resultant PCR fragment was digested withXhoI and StuI, purified from agarose gels with a QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.) and ligated into gel-purifiedXhoI/StuI cut pMIP21 vector DNA. All mutants were constructed by substituting a restriction enzyme fragment in pMEIEP with a PCR fragment generated using the following primers containing the desired mutations: PEP intein F411H primers 5â²-AAA TGG AAA CCA ATA AGG GT and 5â²-GCG GCC CTA AAA CGA TTG CCG CGT GGC AGT TAT GTA CAA CTA TTGG; Rpol Aâ² intein G451H primers 5â²-GAA TTT GGT ATT GAA TTA AAG and 5â²-ATT GAG GCC TTC AGC GTT GTA GGG CGG GCA ATT GTG TGT TAA AAA GCC; Rpol Aâ² intein primers 5â²-AAA GAG AAA TGC CTT AA GAA TGGA and 5â²-CCT TCA GCG TTG TAG GGC GGG CAA TTX XXT GTT AAA AAG CC, in whichXXX was TGC for G451A, AAA for G451F, TTT for G451K, and CCA for G451W. A His6 tag was incorporated at the end of paramyosin by insertion of a double-strand oligonucleotide into theSalI and PstI sites in the PEP intein clone and the SalI and HindIII sites in the Rpol Aâ² intein clone. The sequence of all PCR fragments was confirmed after sequencing both DNA strands by the NEB DNA sequencing core facility. All enzymes were obtained from New England BioLabs and used as described by the manufacturer. E. colistrain TB1 (New England BioLabs) cells containing pMEIEP plasmids were grown at 30 Â°C to mid log phase and then further incubated in the presence or absence of 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside at 15 Â°C overnight. Nickel column (Qiagen Inc.) purified proteins containing the C-terminal His tag were prepared as described by the manufacturer with the addition of 10% glycerol in all buffers. Induction of MEIEP precursors in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside resulted in increased proteolytic cleavage within the intein and little or no increase in precursor, spliced products, or single splice junction cleavage products. Therefore, experiments were performed with purified samples from uninduced cultures. MEIEP precursors, spliced products, and cleavage products are distinguishable by relative mobility in Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE and by immunoreactivity in Western blots using anti-MBP and anti-paramyosin sera (24.Xu M. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In order to obtain clear separation of MEEP and IEP, samples were electrophoresed in 8% acrylamide SDS-PAGE, and the 30-kDa EP product was run off the bottom of the gel. The same samples were also electrophoresed in 12% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue for analysis of the EP product (data not shown). Coomassie Blue-stained gels were digitized with a Microtek Scanmaker III and quantitated with NIH Image 1.51 software as described (25.Telenti A. Southworth M. Alcaide F. Daugelat S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Perler F.B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The values for at least 3 independent experiments were averaged for each sample and the standard deviation of the means calculated. The increase or decrease in molar percent of spliced product (MEEP) or N-terminal splice junction cleavage product (IEP) was calculated as follows: percent increase = (mutant â wild type)/wild type Ã 100 and percent decrease = (wild type â mutant)/wild type Ã 100. Purified Mja Rpol Aâ² MEIEP samples were sequenced as described (24.Xu M. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 8% Tris glycine polyacrylamide gel (NOVEX) and transferred to a ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PE Biosystems). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, bands corresponding to the branched intermediate (MEIEP*); the MEIEP precursor and the MEEP spliced product were excised, and each was subjected to sequential Edman degradation. The data were acquired and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 610A Data System. The well studied MIP in vitro protein splicing system (18.Xu M. Perler F.B.

BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was used to examine whether a penultimate His is required for splicing of the Mja Rpol Aâ² and PEP inteins. The MIP precursor consists of an intein (I) inserted in-frame between theE. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP or M) and the Î Sal fragment of Dirofilaria immitis paramyosin (P). In this study, native extein sequences (E) were included to improve splicing by better mimicking the native precursor active site, generating the MEIEP fusions (Fig. 1 C). The Mja PEP intein has a penultimate Phe at position 411 and the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein has a penultimate Gly at position 451. Size, immunoreactivity, and in some cases N-terminal protein sequencing were used to identify precursor (MEIEP), spliced product (MEEP), branched intermediate (MEIEP*), and N-terminal splice junction (ME + IEP) or C-terminal splice junction (MEI + EP) cleavage products. Cleared cell lysates were chromatographed over nickel-chelating columns, resulting in purification of proteins containing the C-terminal His tag and loss of ME and MEI. The Mja PEP and Rpol Aâ² MEIEP precursors spliced efficiently in E. coli(Fig. 3), with 60% spliced MEEP product observed with the Mja PEP intein and 68% with the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein (Table I). No C-terminal splice junction cleavage product (EP) was observed when samples were electrophoresed in 12% SDS-PAGE (data not shown). No increase in spliced product was observed if protein samples were incubated overnight in vitro at 16 or 37 Â°C at pH 6.0 to 8.5 (data not shown). It is not known why some proportion of precursors usually fail to splice in heterologous systems, although it has most often been attributed to misfolding or aggregation.Table ISplicing and cleavage activities of the Mja Rpol Aâ² and PEP inteins in MEIEPProteinRpol Aâ²PEPG451G451HF411F411HMEIEP*0 aValues indicate the molar percent of each protein.

Open table in a new tab Mutation of the Mja PEP intein penultimate Phe and the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein penultimate Gly to His was performed to see if âreversionâ to this normally conserved residue would improve splicing. There was a 43% increase in spliced MEEP product obtained from the F411H mutant Mja PEP intein samples as compared with the wild type samples (Fig. 3 and Table I). However, replacing the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein penultimate Gly with His resulted in a 27% decrease in spliced product, a 57% increase in IEP N-terminal splice junction cleavage product, and an accumulation of a slowly migrating protein; amino acid sequencing of the latter protein indicated that it was the branched intermediate, since it had the predicted pair of amino acids present in each of 15 cycles of Edman degradation (Table II). One amino acid in each cycle corresponded to the MBP sequence, and the other residue in that cycle corresponded to the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein sequence. The identities of the Mja Rpol Aâ² precursor (MEIEP) and spliced product (MEEP) were also confirmed by protein sequencing (data not shown). The accumulation of branched intermediate and N-terminal splice junction cleavage products is indicative of inhibiting only the Asn cyclization step and not the acyl shift or transesterification steps (Fig. 2).Table IIN-terminal amino acid sequence of the branched intermediate from the G451H mutant in the Mja Rpol Aâ² MEIEP precursorCycleMja Rpol Aâ² InteinMBPResiduepmolResiduepmol1Sâ²-PTH aSâ²-phenylthiohydantoin (dehydroalanine phenylthiohydantoin artifact) was observed in place of Cys.6.78Met12.52Val15.2Lys6.033Asp7.30Thr6.954Gly5.30Glu5.405Asp7.59Glu7.226Thr6.21Gly9.467Thr7.98Lys4.118Val12.4Leu6.219Leu7.23Val11.510Leu5.36Ile2.2811Asp6.77Trp5.3112Gly5.23Ile4.7413Lys6.23Asn8.8814Leu4.14Gly7.5915Ile2.74Asp7.70Each cycle of Edman degradation contained 2 residues that correspond to the N-terminal sequence of the intein and the N-extein (MBP).a Sâ²-phenylthiohydantoin (dehydroalanine phenylthiohydantoin artifact) was observed in place of Cys.

The Mja Rpol Aâ² intein penultimate residue, Gly-451, was replaced with Ala, Lys, Phe, or Trp in the MEIEP context (Fig.4 and TableIII). Ala, Lys, and Phe substitutions resulted in a similar decrease in spliced product (â¼27%) as in the G451H mutation. G451H and G451F resulted in an increase in N-terminal splice junction cleavage products and branched intermediate, suggesting that His and Phe substitutions only inhibited Asn cyclization. The bulky penultimate Trp residue resulted in the largest reduction in spliced product (59%) but still allowed N-terminal splice junction cleavage and the accumulation of branched intermediate. No C-terminal splice junction cleavage product (EP) was observed in any sample (data not shown).Table IIIThe effect of mutating the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein penultimate residue in MEIEPProteinGly-451G451AG451HG451KG451FG451WMEIEP*0 aValues indicate the molar percent of each protein.

Contradictory results were obtained when the first two inteins naturally lacking a penultimate His were tested for the ability to splice. The C. eugametos ClpP intein with a penultimate Gly (19.Wang S. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11869-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) failed to splice in E. coli, whereas the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 DnaE intein with a penultimate Ala did splice (22.Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The present study examined two more inteins that lack a penultimate His. Both the M. jannaschii PEP and Rpol Aâ² inteins with a Gly or Phe at the penultimate position yielded >60% spliced product in E. coli despite the fact that neither Gly nor Phe can chemically participate in Asn cyclization. In experiments to be published elsewhere, 2M. W. Southworth and F. B. Perler, manuscript in preparation. we have also demonstrated splicing of the Pyrococcus sp. GB-D KlbA intein, which has a penultimate Ser. To date, half of the intein families that lack a penultimate His have been examined, and all but 1 are capable of splicing. We therefore suggest that the failure of the C. eugametos ClpP intein to splice in E. coli(19.Wang S. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11869-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) is the exception, rather than the rule, and that most inteins that lack a penultimate His will probably be active. It is possible that theC. eugametos ClpP intein splices in its native organism, since there is precedent for failure of active inteins to splice inE. coli (27.Davis E.O. Thangaraj J.S. Brooks P.C. Colston M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The splicing reaction requires that the two splice junctions are in close proximity. Inteins are thought to have a complex active site with two oxyanion holes as follows: one at the C-terminal splice junction that facilitates Asn or Gln cyclization and includes the intein penultimate His, and a second oxyanion hole at the N-terminal splice junction that facilitates the first two nucleophilic displacements and includes residues in intein block B (6.Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 20.Noren C.J. Wang J. Perler F.B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 450-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several substitutions in the penultimate position of the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein had little effect on reactions at the N-terminal splice junction, since N-terminal splice junction cleavage products were observed and the branched intermediate accumulated. However, all of these mutations inhibited Asn cyclization as evidenced by the failure to rapidly resolve the branched intermediate and the absence of C-terminal splice junction cleavage products. Although these data support the presence of separable oxyanion holes at each splice junction, precursor and intermediate structures would help to determine whether they are distinct or overlapping. Both the C. eugametos ClpP and Mja Rpol Aâ² inteins have a penultimate Gly. Unlike the C. eugametos ClpP intein that is activated by a penultimate His (19.Wang S. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11869-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein is inhibited by a penultimate His. A penultimate His in the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein may cause steric inhibition at the intein active site or block access to the C-terminal splice junction by a new residue(s) that facilitates Asn cyclization. Four more mutations were made at Gly451 ranging from the second smallest amino acid, Ala, to the largest amino acid, Trp. Substituting Gly with Ala yielded a similar reduction in spliced product as His, Lys, and Phe, indicating that either packing at the C-terminal splice junction is so tight that substituting Gly with the slightly larger Ala will cause the same steric effect as substituting with Phe or that the conformational flexibility that Gly provides is critical for aligning active site residues at the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein C-terminal splice junction. We suggest that all inteins evolved from ancestors that had a penultimate His that facilitated Asn or Gln cyclization. Mutation of the intein penultimate His might have yielded an intein that still spliced, although less efficiently (unless other compensatory mutations occurred simultaneously). Asn or Gln cyclization would then become rate-limiting. Enough active extein might still be synthesized to permit survival of the host until further mutation increased splicing proficiency. In support of this hypothesis, splicing of the C. eugametos ClpP (19.Wang S. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11869-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 DnaE (23.Scott C.P. Abel-Santos E. Wall M. Wahnon D.C. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13638-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and the Mja PEP inteins improved when the intein penultimate residue was ârevertedâ to His. These inteins may yet to have fully compensated for the absence of a penultimate His. They may have recently mutated or selective pressure may be low since they may produce sufficient amounts of spliced extein despite inefficient splicing. The more essential and highly expressed the gene product, the stronger the selection for mutations that would improve splicing. Although dnaE encodes an essential protein that is part of the replicative DNA polymerase, splicing of Synechocystissp. PCC6803 DnaE does not have to be very efficient, since only a few molecules of replicative DNA polymerase are generally required per cell (<20 molecules/cell in E. coli) (28.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 165-196Google Scholar). However, Rpol Aâ² is not only an essential protein, but it is a highly expressed protein, comprising part of the archaeal RNA polymerase. Therefore, individuals that acquired mutations that improved splicing of the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein would rapidly become fixed in the population. In fact, the Mja Rpol Aâ² intein has changed so much that splicing is now inhibited when its penultimate residue is reverted back to His. The differences in splicing capacity of inteins that naturally lack a penultimate His may thus reflect inteins at different stages of evolving toward rapid splicing after mutation of their penultimate His. The data also suggest that splicing of inteins that naturally lack a penultimate His may improve if the native penultimate residue is replaced by His.

The melatonin-related receptor, despite sharing considerable amino acid sequence identity with melatonin receptors, does not bind melatonin and is currently an orphan G protein-coupled receptor. To investigate the structure and function of both receptors, we engineered a series of 14 chimeric receptor constructs, allowing us to determine the relative contribution of each transmembrane domain to ligand binding and receptor function. Results identified that when sequences encoding transmembrane domains 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 of the melatonin mt1 receptor were replaced by the corresponding domains of the melatonin-related receptor, the resultant chimeric receptors all displayed specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1177-1185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). There are now almost 20 reported melatonin receptor sequences, which have been classified into three molecular subtypes, mt1, MT2, and Mel1c (3.Alexander S.P.H. Peters J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20 (suppl.): 57Google Scholar). Despite classification as molecular subtypes, they all have essentially identical binding affinities for melatonin (K i = â¼0.5 nm), and each mediates inhibition of stimulated cyclic AMP levels, mainly but not exclusively via the activation of Gi proteins (4.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Godson C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 100-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). During the cloning of the melatonin receptors a homologue, the melatonin-related receptor, was identified, but despite containing 57% amino acid sequence identity with the TM1 domains of the melatonin mt1 receptor, it did not bind 2-[125I]iodomelatonin or melatonin (5.Reppert S.M.

Neuroendocrinol. 1998; 10: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The melatonin-related receptor remains an orphan GPCR with no ligand or signal transduction pathway yet identified. The molecular structure and function of the melatonin mt1receptor has been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, identifying the conserved His residue within TM5 as interacting with the 5-methoxy group of melatonin (7.Conway S. Canning S.J. Barrett P. Guardiola-Lemaitre B. Delagrange P. Morgan P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8.Kokkola T. Watson M.A. White J. Dowell S. Foord S.M. Laitinen J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Using the nomenclature of Ballesteros and Weinstein (9.Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2509) Google Scholar), this residue is located at position 5.46 (His5.46), which corresponds to a position identified in the binding site of many other rhodopsin-like GPCRs, including Ser5.46 (amino acid 207) in the hamster Î²2adrenergic receptor (10.Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the Î²2adrenergic receptor has also been shown to involve an ionic interaction with Asp3.32 (11.Dixon R.A.F. Sigal I.S. Rands E. Register R.B. Candelore M.R. Blake A.D. Strader C.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 12.Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Hill W.S. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10267-10271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding residue in the human melatonin mt1 receptor, Met3.32, was found not to directly participate in melatonin receptor activation. (8.Kokkola T. Watson M.A. White J. Dowell S. Foord S.M. Laitinen J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding site of the melatonin receptor appears similar but not identical to those of other rhodopsin-like GPCRs. A recent molecular model proposed for the structure of the melatonin receptor-binding site hypothesized that two TM7 residues, Ser7.38 and Ala7.42, may also be involved in melatonin binding interactions (13.Navajas C. Kokkola T. Poso A. Honka N. Gynther J. Laitinen J.T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 304: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); however, site-directed mutagenesis of these residues recently suggested that this was not the case (8.Kokkola T. Watson M.A. White J. Dowell S. Foord S.M. Laitinen J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, apart from His5.46, the residues forming the melatonin-binding site remain to be identified. Many reports have been published that utilize chimeric receptor constructs to determine the contribution of different domains of GPCRs toward either ligand binding, binding selectivity, or receptor activation (14.Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 15.Frielle T. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9494-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This methodology is therefore an effective way to rapidly characterize GPCRs with poorly defined ligand-binding sites. The results from such chimeric receptor experiments provide a means to focus subsequent studies, such as site-directed mutagenesis, on the individual amino acid residues that provide ligand binding and signal transduction. We have utilized the technique of recursive PCR (16.Dillon P.J. Rosen C.A. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 298-300PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Ye Q.-Z. Johnson L.L. Baragi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18.Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) to engineer 13 unique restriction endonuclease sites into the human melatonin mt1 receptor DNA sequence, without altering the encoded amino acid sequence. This synthetic human melatonin mt1receptor sequence allowed the precise engineering of a series of 14 chimeric receptors with the human melatonin-related receptor. These chimeric receptors enabled us to investigate the relative contribution of each TM domain to ligand binding and receptor activation. The results from these studies were used to design site-directed mutagenesis experiments on the human melatonin mt1receptor. The data generated by site-directed mutagenesis identified a residue in TM6 as being critical for both ligand binding and receptor function. Tissue culture media, supplements, and sera were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. 2-[125I]Iodomelatonin (2200 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Oligonucleotides for recursive PCR were synthesized and purified by Bioline, other oligonucleotides were form Sigma-Genosys. Melatonin and general reagents were obtained from Sigma. Molecular biology reagents and enzymes were purchased from Promega. The DNA sequence encoding the human melatonin mt1 receptor (19.Conway S. Drew J.E. Canning S.J. Barrett P. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Guardiola-Lemaitre B. Delagrange P. Morgan P.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was engineered by PCR to introduce a FLAG epitope sequence (5â²-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG-3â²) directly after the ATG start codon. This was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the engineered receptor sequence was ligated as aHindIII/KpnI restriction fragment into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). This plasmid was named pcDNA3-mt1. A series of 16 overlapping oligonucleotides (60â80 bases each with overlaps of 18â20 bases) were designed to construct the DNA sequence encoding to human melatonin mt1 receptor from the Bpu1102 I restriction endonuclease site (base 203) to one base following the stop codon (base 1054). Two sets of 8 oligonucleotides were assembled in two separate recursive PCRs, essentially by the method of Prytulla et al. (20.Prytulla S. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recursive assembly PCR was performed using 5 pmol of each of 8 oligonucleotides in a 100-Î¼l volume with 2.5 units of nativePfu DNA polymerase (Promega). 10 Î¼l of the recursive assembly PCR reactions were then used as the templates in two PCR reactions to amplify the assembled DNA fragments (452 and 429 base pairs). Products were purified, ligated into pCR-Script (Stratagene), and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The products were recovered asBpu1102 I/BamHI andBamHI/XbaI restriction fragments, respectively, and ligated into pcDNA-mt1. Correct ligation was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the plasmid was named pcDNA3-mt1-(syn). The nucleotide modifications present in the synthetic human melatonin mt1 receptor DNA sequence, relative to the published native sequence (2.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Ebisawa T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1177-1185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), are listed in Fig.1. The two exons encoding the human melatonin-related receptor (5.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Ebisawa T. Mahle C.D. Kolakowski L.F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR from a genomic DNA library (CLONTECH). The two fragments were joined and engineered by PCR to introduce a FLAG epitope sequence directly after the ATG start codon. This product was ligated into pcDNA3 and confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the plasmid was named pcDNA3-MRR. PCR was subsequently used to truncate the melatonin-related receptor coding sequence, engineering a new TGA stop codon at bases 979â982 (numbering excluding the FLAG epitope sequence), prior to the sequence encoding the large carboxyl-terminal domain. This PCR also introduced two restriction endonuclease sequences, a silent EcoRV restriction endonuclease site (bases 973â978) was placed immediately before the new stop codon, and a XbaI site was introduced 8 bases following the stop codon. This PCR product was cloned back into pcDNA3 and confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the plasmid was named pcDNA3-MRR-(trunc). The DNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal domain of the melatonin-related receptor was engineered by PCR to introduce a silent EcoRV restriction endonuclease site (bases 973â978) and a silent XbaI site (bases 1838â1843) spanning the stop codon (bases 1840â1842). This product was cloned back into pcDNA3 and confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the plasmid was named pcDNA3-MRR-(CT). Segments of the human melatonin-related receptor were amplified by PCR from pcDNA3-MRR-(trunc) using oligonucleotide primers containing selected restriction endonuclease recognition sequences. Products were subcloned into pCR-Script, confirmed by DNA sequencing, and recovered as restriction products using the endonuclease recognition sites introduced by the PCR primers. These products were ligated into similarly restricted pcDNA3-mt1-(syn). When required the carboxyl-terminal domain of the melatonin-related receptor was obtained as an EcoRV/XbaI fragment from pcDNA3-MRR-(CT) and ligated onto appropriate chimeras. Confirmation of the successful construction of each chimeric receptor was performed by DNA sequencing. It should be noted that for some chimeras replacement of TM domains also included some sequence encoding the adjacent IL or EL domains, as illustrated in Fig.2. In the following text we will therefore refer to chimeric receptors having replaced STM1 (segment including TM1) to STM7, to highlight that these sequences may encode loop(s) as well as the TM domains. TM will also now only be used where it specifically refers to the transmembrane region. Two site-directed mutants of the human melatonin mt1 receptor, Ala6.49Cys and Gly6.55Thr, were constructed using a PCR-based protocol with pcDNA-mt1-(syn) as the template. The amplification products were restricted, subcloned back into pcDNA3, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-7 cells were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% new born calf serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution, in 5% CO2 at 37 Â°C. Confluent plates were reseeded at 15,000 cells/cm2 and used 24 h later for transfection. Cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method of Cullen (21.Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The expression of all receptor constructs was confirmed by the immunological detection of the engineered FLAG epitope as described previously (6.Drew J.E. Barrett P. Williams L.M. Conway S. Morgan P.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1998; 10: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For ligand binding experiments, transfected cells were cultured for 72 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and harvested. Cells were pelleted in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (13,000 Ã g, 1 min, 4 Â°C) and stored frozen at â80 Â°C. 2-[125I]Iodomelatonin equilibrium binding experiments on transfected COS-7 cells were performed as described previously (22.Conway S. Canning S.J. Howell H.E. Mowat E.S. Barrett P. Drew J.E. Delagrange P. Lesieur D. Morgan P.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 390: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein determinations were performed by the method of Bradford (23.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with duplicate or triplicate determinations, and the data were averaged.K d and IC50 values were determined by Grafit software (Sigma), and K i values were calculated by the method of Cheng and Prusoff (24.Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated on three or more occasions, and the mean values Â± S.E. were calculated. The DNA encoding the Î±-subunit of Gs(25.Harris B.A. Robishaw J.D. Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Science. 1985; 229: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), with the exception of the final 15 bases, was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using messenger RNA isolated from HEK293 cells as the template. Based on the findings of Komatsuzaki et al. (26.Komatsuzaki K. Murayama Y. Giambarella U. Ogata E. Seino S. Nishimoto I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a synthetic DNA linker was ligated onto the amplified product to essentially replace the DNA encoding the final 5 amino acid residues of Gs with that encoding the final 5 amino acids of Gi (27.Michel T. Winslow J.W. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7663-7667Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The product was subcloned into pcDNA3 and confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with receptor constructs and the chimeric Gs/Gi construct as described above. Following transfection cells were cultured for 24 h, trypsinized, and reseeded into 24-well tissue culture plates (1 Ã 105cells/well). Following a further 24-h incubation, cells were briefly washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with appropriate concentrations of melatonin (in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) for 2 h at 37 Â°C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 5%). Cyclic AMP levels were determined as previously reported (28.Morgan P.J. Davidson G. Lawson W. Barrett P. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1990; 2: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with triplicate determinations, and the data were averaged. EC50 values were determined by Grafit software (Sigma). Experiments were repeated two or three times, and where appropriate the mean values Â± S.E. were calculated. Receptor constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells, and in all cases expression was confirmed by immunological detection of the engineered FLAG epitopes (data not shown). The synthetic human melatonin mt1 receptor displayed a 2-[125I]iodomelatonin K daffinity value that was identical the native human melatonin mt1 receptor (Ref. 19.Conway S. Drew J.E. Canning S.J.

This demonstrated that modification of the nucleotide sequence of the synthetic mt1 receptor sequence had no detectable effect on receptor expression. Both the human melatonin-related receptor and the truncated human melatonin-related receptor produced no detectable 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding (Fig. 3 and data not shown). This confirmed the previous reports for both the human and ovine melatonin-related receptors (5.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Ebisawa T. Mahle C.D. Kolakowski L.F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6.Drew J.E. Barrett P. Williams L.M. Conway S. Morgan P.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1998; 10: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These data also demonstrated that the lack of observed 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding to melatonin-related receptors was not due to the presence of the extended carboxyl-terminal domain. Chimera [mt1 (STM1 MRR)] displayed a 2-[125I]iodomelatonin K d binding affinity close to that determined for the melatonin mt1-synthetic receptor but was expressed at a much reduced level (B max values, 14.2 and 506.9 fmol/mg protein, respectively). This implied that none of the residues that were changed in STM1 of this chimera relative to the melatonin mt1 receptor sequence appeared to perturb the ligand-binding site but that one or more of these residues affected the level of receptor which bound the ligand at the cell membrane. Chimera [mt1 (NT+STM1 MRR)] identified that when the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the melatonin-related receptor was also present in combination with STM1 then the determinedK d remained close to that of the melatonin mt1-synthetic receptor but that the expression was further reduced to 1.14 fmol/mg protein. This additional reduction inB max may be due to the removal of the two Asn-linked glycosylation consensus sequences (Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)) that are present in the amino-terminal domain of the melatonin mt1 receptor but absent from the melatonin-related receptor sequence. The mutation or removal of such glycosylation sequences has been shown to reduce the B max values for some GPCRs (29.Rands E. Candelore M.R. Cheung A.H. Hill W.S. Strader C.D. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10759-10764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the reduced expression seen in our studies could be due to other differences present in the amino-terminal sequences of the two receptors. Chimeras [mt1 (STM2 MRR)], [mt1 (STM3 MRR)], and [mt1 (STM5 MRR)] all displayed K d and B max values close to that of the melatonin mt1 receptor (within 3-fold), demonstrating that the residues that were changed in STM2, STM3, and STM5 of these chimeras relative to the melatonin mt1 receptor sequence did not appear to be critical to either ligand binding or the detectable receptor level in the melatonin mt1 receptor. Chimera [mt1 (STM7+CT MRR)] displayed a 4.5-fold reduction in ligand binding affinity relative to the melatonin mt1-synthetic receptor and was expressed at a reduced level (B max = 44.2 fmol/mg protein). This suggested that some of the residues that were changed in STM7 were required for high affinity ligand binding in the melatonin mt1 receptor and that some residues affected the level of receptor which bound the ligand. Chimera [mt1 (STM7 MRR)] in which the carboxyl-terminal domain of the melatonin-related receptor was truncated gave K d andB max values essentially identical to chimera [mt1 (STM7+ CT MRR)], indicating that the reduction inB max relative to the melatonin mt1receptor did not appear to be caused by the presence of the carboxyl-terminal domain but was caused by the altered residues within STM7. Competitive displacement of 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding to chimera [mt1 (STM7+CT MRR)] by a series of melatonin receptor ligands gave a very good correlation with binding data obtained for the synthetic melatonin mt1 receptor (r2 = 0.99; slope = 0.99). (Fig.4). This demonstrated that the changes induced in STM7 caused a consistent (4â5-fold) reduction in ligand binding affinity compared with the melatonin mt1 receptor. Chimeras [mt1 (STM4 MRR)] and [mt1 (STM6 MRR)] displayed no detectable 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding. This implied that some residues that were changed in STM4 and STM6 of these chimeras relative to the melatonin mt1receptor sequence were critical for high affinity 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding to the melatonin mt1 receptor. To expand on these initial findings additional multiple domain chimeras were constructed and tested. Chimeras [mt1(STM1+STM7 MRR)] and [mt1 (STM1+STM7+CT MRR)] gave similar K d affinity values as chimeras [mt1 (STM7 MRR)] and [mt1 (STM7+CT MRR)], respectively, but with a 7â9-fold increase inB max values. Therefore, in chimeras where either STM1 or STM7 was independently replaced, large reductions inB max values were observed, whereas in chimeras where STM1 and STM7 were replaced together, B maxvalues were returned to near wild-type melatonin mt1receptor levels. This indicated that there may be an association involving STM1 and STM7 in both the melatonin mt1 receptor and the melatonin-related receptor that increased the level of receptor that bound the ligand. The final chimeras to be tested were those to further investigate the roles of STM4 and STM6 in melatonin receptor ligand binding. Chimeras [MRR (NT+STM4 mt1)] and [MRR (NT+STM6 mt1)] displayed no detectable 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding. Chimera [MRR (NT+STM4+STM6 mt1)], however, displayed specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding, but this was not saturating at the highest concentration tested of 1500 pm(data not shown). Indeed, Scatchard analysis (30.Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1947; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) indicated that theK d was substantially above 1500 pm. To obtain an affinity value for this chimera competitive displacement of specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding (1500 pm tracer) was performed using 2-iodomelatonin (1 Ã 10â13 to 1 Ã 10â5m). Under the conditions of this study, where the tracer concentration was substantially below the K d of the tracer, the Cheng-Prusoff correction (24.Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar) states that the IC50 obtained for the displacement curve is approximately equal to theK i. Using this principal the meanK i value determined for chimera [MRR (NT+STM4+STM6 mt1)] was 28,800 Â± 10,800 pm, (n = 3). The identification that chimera [MRR (NT+STM4+STM6 mt1)] specifically bound 2-[125I]iodomelatonin demonstrated the importance of residues in both STM4 and STM6 of the melatonin mt1receptor for the formation of the melatonin receptor ligand-binding site. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with the chimeric melatonin mt1/melatonin-related receptors and a chimeric Gs/Gi G protein Î±-subunit construct. In previous reported studies the use of chimeric Gs/Gi Î±-subunit has been shown to cause GPCRs that normally inhibit cyclic AMP levels, via activation of Gi, to produce a ligand-mediated stimulation of cyclic AMP by promiscuous coupling to the Gs/Gi (26.Komatsuzaki K. Murayama Y. Giambarella U. Ogata E. Seino S. Nishimoto I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This system was employed for functional studies in COS-7 cells because this cell line has been previously reported as being unsuitable for studies on GPCRs that signal via a Gi-mediated reduction of cyclic AMP (31.Wong Y.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Melatonin (1 Ã 10â5m) was shown to elevate cyclic AMP levels â¼2-fold in COS-7 cells co-transfected with the melatonin mt1-synthetic receptor but to have no effect upon cells co-transfected with the melatonin-related receptor or in mock transfected cells (Fig.5). Melatonin elevated cyclic AMP levels in cells transfected with chimeric receptors involving the replacement of STM1, 2, 3, 5, or 7. Melatonin had no effect on cyclic AMP levels in COS-7 cells transfected with the individual STM4 and STM6 chimeras. Melatonin did however elevate cyclic AMP levels â¼3-fold in COS-7 cells transfected with chimera [MRR (NT+STM4+STM6 mt1)]. This again demonstrated that residues in STM4 and STM6 may play a very important role for both ligand binding and signal transduction in the human melatonin mt1 receptor. To investigate the roles of residues within TM6 of the human melatonin mt1 receptor, two site-directed mutants were constructed, Ala6.49Cys and Gly6.55Thr. Both of these mutants exchanged the native melatonin mt1receptor amino acid residue for that in the same position of the human melatonin-related receptor. Saturation binding analysis of Ala6.49Cys produced similar K d and B maxvalues as those obtained for the melatonin mt1-synthetic receptor (Fig.6). Therefore Ala6.49probably does not play a critical role in ligand binding to the melatonin mt1 receptor. Saturation binding analysis of mutant Gly6.55Thr also identified specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding, but this was not saturating at the highest concentration tested of 1500 pm. Using the same rationale as described above for chimera [MRR (NT+STM4+STM6 mt1)] the affinity for mutant Gly6.55Thr was determined by competitive displacement of 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding (1500 pm) by 2-iodomelatonin (1 Ã 10â13 to 1 Ã 10â5m) (Fig.7). This produced a meanK i affinity value of 126,000 Â± 44,000 pm (n = 3). These data demonstrated that Gly6.55 was critical for providing high affinity ligand binding to the melatonin mt1 receptor.Figure 7Competitive displacement of specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding to human melatonin mt1 receptor site-directed mutant Gly6.49Thr.Competitive displacement of specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding by 2-iodomelatonin in COS-7 cells expressing either the synthetic-melatonin mt1receptor (black circles) or site-directed mutant Gly6.49Thr (white circles) are shown. The 2-[125I]iodomelatonin tracer concentrations used were 1500 pm for Gly6.49Thr and 19.5 pm for the melatonin mt1 receptor. The data shown are the averages of duplicate determinations from a single representative experiment. Experiments were repeated three times. The determinedK i affinity values (means Â± S.E.) were, synthetic melatonin mt1 receptor, 8.12 Â± 2.89 Ã 10â11m; mutant Gly6.49Thr, 1.26 Â± 0.44 Ã 10â7m.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dose-response effects of melatonin upon cyclic AMP levels in COS-7 cells co-transfected with the Gs/Gi chimeric G protein Î±-subunit and either the melatonin mt1-synthetic receptor, selected chimeric receptors, or the 2 site-directed mutant receptors were performed (Fig.8). The results demonstrated that melatonin (1 Ã 10â12 to 1 Ã 10â4m) caused a dose-dependent stimulation of cyclic AMP level for all receptor constructs. The melatonin mt1-synthetic receptor had a determined EC50affinity value of 186 pm, close to other reported values for melatonin-mediated activation of mt1 receptors (2.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Ebisawa T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1177-1185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 4.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Godson C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 100-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Chimera [mt1 (STM7+CT MRR)] produced an EC50affinity value 7.3-fold lower than that of the mt1-synthetic receptor. This was consistent with the observed 4.5-fold reduction in ligand binding affinity previously described for this chimera (Figs. 3 and 4). Chimera [MRR (NT+STM4+STM6 mt1)] produced an EC50 affinity value â¼830-fold lower than that of the mt1-synthetic receptor. This demonstrated that dual replacement of STM4 and STM6 of the melatonin-related receptor with the corresponding sequences of the melatonin mt1 receptor could produce melatonin-mediated receptor activation at high dose. Site-directed mutant Ala6.49Cys produced a similar response to that of the mt1-synthetic receptor (within 2.2-fold), whereas mutant Gly6.55Thr displayed a profound loss of melatonin-mediated receptor activation with an EC50 affinity value â¼166,000-fold lower than that determined for the melatonin mt1-synthetic receptor. The aim of this study was to expand the understanding of the molecular processes that underlie how melatonin receptors bind and are activated by melatonin. To achieve this, we employed a strategy involving chimeric receptors constructed from the human melatonin mt1 receptor and the human melatonin-related receptor. The rationale for these studies was based on the fact that melatonin receptors bind melatonin with high affinity (4.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Godson C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 100-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), whereas the melatonin-related receptor, which shares considerable sequence identity with melatonin receptors, does not bind melatonin (5.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Ebisawa T. Mahle C.D. Kolakowski L.F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6.Drew J.E. Barrett P. Williams L.M. Conway S. Morgan P.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1998; 10: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis for why the melatonin-related receptor does not bind melatonin was that this was due to the absence of a limited number of specific amino acid residues present in the melatonin receptor ligand-binding site and not due to a gross difference in the structures of the two receptors. If this hypothesis was accurate it would be possible to identify in which domains of the of melatonin receptor such residues occurred by the construction of chimeric receptors in which small regions of the melatonin mt1 receptor were replaced with the corresponding region of the melatonin-related receptor. A significant reduction in ligand binding affinity, compared with that of the melatonin mt1 receptor, would show that one or more of the altered amino acid residues was important for the structure or function of the melatonin mt1 receptor. Chimeric receptors in which STM2, 3, or 5 of the melatonin mt1 receptor were replaced by the equivalent melatonin-related receptor sequences had little effect on eitherK d or B max when compared with the synthetic human melatonin mt1 receptor. This demonstrated that the altered residues within these domains were not critical for high affinity ligand binding in melatonin receptors. It should be noted, however, that these studies were not designed to yield any information on the contribution of the conserved residues toward ligand binding. Indeed His5.46 is conserved in both melatonin receptors and in the melatonin-related receptor and has been previously shown to be involved in ligand binding within the melatonin mt1 receptor (7.Conway S. Canning S.J. Barrett P. Guardiola-Lemaitre B. Delagrange P. Morgan P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8.Kokkola T. Watson M.A. White J. Dowell S. Foord S.M. Laitinen J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our findings do, however, suggest that any further site-directed mutagenesis studies that are designed to investigate possible ligand binding residues in STM2, 3, or 5 of melatonin receptors should concentrate on the residues that are conserved with the melatonin-related receptor. Chimeric replacement of STM1 also displayed little difference in K d value compared with the melatonin mt1 receptor; however theB max was reduced by 36-fold. Therefore, one or more of the altered residues within this domain reduced the amount of receptor that was capable of binding the ligand. Immunological detection of the FLAG epitope on this chimera, however, indicated that the expression was indistinguishable from that of the melatonin mt1 receptor; therefore, the loss of observed binding was probably due to a change in the structure of the expressed receptor and not due to impaired expression. Chimeric replacement of STM7 reduced both K d and B max values relative to the melatonin mt1 receptor. This suggests that STM7 may be involved in the ligand-binding site of melatonin receptors. To further investigate the role of STM7 in the melatonin receptor-binding site, competitive displacement studies were performed using six bioisosteres of melatonin, including drugs that had a modified N-acetyl group (S20642, 5-methoxy tryptophol) or a modified 5-methoxy group (Jam09, N-acetyl tryptamine). The relative reductions in binding affinities for all of these drugs were identical, indicating that the changes produced in the STM7 chimera affected the general structure of the melatonin receptor-binding pocket and did not appear to affect specific interactions that might occur with, for example, the N-acetyl group. The chimeras involving the replacement of either STM4 or STM6 resulted in no detectable 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding. This indicated that one or more nonconserved residues in STM4 and STM6 may be critical in providing ligand binding in the melatonin mt1receptor. To expand upon the above data, additional multiple domain chimeras were constructed. All of these chimeras were engineered to have the amino-terminal domain of the melatonin mt1 receptor because of our previous observation that this produced higher expression levels than when the amino-terminal domain of the melatonin-related receptor was present. Two multiple chimeras were designed to investigate whether the reduction in B max observed for both STM1 and STM7 chimeras were related. These data identified that when both STM1 and STM7 were simultaneously replaced by melatonin-related receptor sequences, the B max levels were elevated to near melatonin mt1 receptor levels. Therefore, high expression levels were seen when STM1 and STM7 were present as a pair from either the melatonin mt1 receptor or the melatonin-related receptor but not when they were combined. It has previously been shown that TM1 and TM7 are adjacent in rhodopsin-like GPCRs (32.Schertler G.F.X. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 33.Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 12: 1693-1703Crossref Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Therefore, the most logical explanation of the above phenomenon is that both melatonin receptors and melatonin-related receptors have some form of close association between TM1 and TM7 and that when this is perturbed the structure of either receptor is compromised. Potentially TM1 and TM7 could form specific interactions between their respective amino acid residues. There is evidence to suggest that different TM domains may interact in GPCRs (34.Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), as illustrated by the reported interaction of TM2 and TM7 in the gonadotrophin hormone releasing hormone receptor (35.Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). Because the melatonin and melatonin-related receptors are, however, not typical GPCRs in possessing Ala7.50 in TM7, instead of the otherwise conserved Pro7.50, it is possible that this conveys unique aspects to the structure of these receptors, especially involving TM7. It is interesting to note that amino acid positions 1.56 (Ser1.56mt1, Ala1.56 melatonin-related receptor) and 7.58 (Gln7.58 mt1, Glu7.58melatonin-related receptor) both show nonconservation between the melatonin receptors and the melatonin-related receptor but are potentially closely positioned within the structure of these receptors. It is possible that residues such as these could therefore form unique interactions in these receptors. Additional site-directed mutagenesis studies may resolve the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed association of STM1 and STM7 in melatonin and melatonin-related receptors. The final three chimeric receptors that were constructed were to further investigate the role of STM4 and STM6 to ligand binding in the melatonin mt1 receptor. We found that when STM4 and STM6 were replaced together in chimera [MRR (NT+STM4+STM6 mt1)], this receptor construct could bind 2-[125I]iodomelatonin, albeit with a relatively low affinity, K i 28,800 Â± 10,800 pm. Replacement of STM4 or STM6 alone resulted in no detectable 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding. The ligand binding results were complemented by measurement of the melatonin-mediated stimulation of cyclic AMP levels in COS-7 cells co-transfected with a Gs/Gi chimeric G protein Î±-subunit. All of the chimeras that bound 2-[125I]iodomelatonin stimulated cyclic AMP levels, whereas the receptors that displayed no detectable ligand binding did not. The one exception to this was chimera [mt1 (NT+STM1 MRR)], which bound 2-[125I]iodomelatonin at a very low level (1.14 fmol/mg protein) but did not display changes in cyclic AMP level. This would appear to be solely due to the low expression level, because HEK293 cells that express mt1 receptors at â¼1 fmol/mg protein also failed to display melatonin-mediated effects upon cyclic AMP levels (19.Conway S. Drew J.E. Canning S.J. Barrett P. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Guardiola-Lemaitre B. Delagrange P. Morgan P.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The observation that chimera [MRR (NT+STM4+STM6 mt1)] bound 2-[125I]iodomelatonin and demonstrated melatonin-mediated stimulation of cyclic AMP levels identified that certain residues that were altered within these exchanged domains (STM4 and STM6) must be critical for providing ligand binding to the melatonin mt1 receptor. The altered residues in STM4 mainly occurred within IL2 and EL2 and not TM4. These loop domains are not thought to be directly involved in ligand binding in rhodopsin-like GPCRs; therefore, the most probable explanation is that residues in these domains are required for the formation or maintenance of the melatonin receptor structure. This may possibly occur by interactions with other IL and EL domains. The altered residues present in STM6 included two residues within TM6 as well as some residues in IL3 and EL3. It is possible that residues in IL2 or EL2 may interact with residues in IL3 or EL3, respectively, thereby explaining why STM4 and STM6 were both required to produce detectable 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding in the chimeric receptors. Such putative interactions could be explored using more refined chimeras or by site-directed mutagenesis. To study altered residues within TM6, two site-directed mutants were constructed in the melatonin mt1 receptor, Ala6.49Cys and Gly6.55Thr. These exchanged the melatonin mt1 receptor residues for those present in the melatonin-related receptor. Mutant Ala6.49Cys displayed both aK d binding affinity and a functional EC50 value close to those determined for the melatonin mt1 receptor. This suggested that Ala6.49 was not critical for ligand binding in the melatonin receptor. Mutant Gly6.55Thr, however, displayed a â¼970-fold reduction inK d binding affinity and a â¼166,000-fold reduction in functional EC50 value relative to the determined melatonin mt1 receptor values. Therefore, replacement of Gly6.55 with a Thr residue severely compromised both high affinity ligand binding and ligand-mediated signal transduction in the melatonin mt1 receptor. The positions of Gly6.55, Ala6.49, and His5.46 are shown on a schematic projection of the human melatonin mt1receptor (Fig. 9). As can be seen, Gly6.55 is predicted to point toward the central receptor core, and this suggests that mutant Gly6.55Thr affected ligand binding and receptor function by directly perturbing the structure of the melatonin receptor ligand-binding pocket. The most probable explanation for this would appear to be that the Thr residue was not tolerated in the melatonin receptor-binding pocket because of its hydroxyl containing side-chain structure. We have presented data that Gly6.55 is an important conserved residue required for ligand binding and receptor activation in melatonin receptors. Additional site-directed mutagenesis could further expand our knowledge of the molecular structure of TM6 and its role in the melatonin receptor ligand-binding site."

Some members of this latter group of proteins are themselves involved in cell signaling, while some are enzymes and others have less well defined functions (12.Brown D. Curr. Opin.

The channel-forming protein toxin aerolysin and its inactive precursor proaerolysin have the unique ability to bind specifically and with high affinity to GPI-anchored proteins on the surfaces of target cells (17.Cowell S. Wolfgang A. Gruber H.J. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Molec. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18.Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22604-22609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Once bound, proaerolysin may be converted to aerolysin by surface proteases (21.Abrami L. Fivaz M. Decroly E. Seidah N.G. Jean F. Thomas G. Leppla S.H. Buckley J.T. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32656-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Bound aerolysin then forms heptameric oligomers that can insert into the plasma membrane, producing discrete channels (22.van der Goot F.G. Pattus F. Wong K.R. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2636-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because binding effectively concentrates the toxin on the cell surface, promoting oligomerization, cells that display GPI-anchored proteins are far more sensitive to aerolysin than those that do not (23.Nelson K.L. Brodsky R.A. Buckley J.T. Cell. Micro. 1999; 1: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24.Brodsky R.A. Mukhina G. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Jones R.J. Buckley J.T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, normal T lymphocytes, which contain several GPI-anchored proteins that bind aerolysin, including Thy-1, are killed by 1-h exposure to 10â10maerolysin or proaerolysin, whereas T lymphocytes that lack GPI-anchored proteins because they are unable to synthesize the anchor are approximately 104-fold less sensitive. Similarly, we have shown that channel formation in artificial lipid bilayers occurs at far lower aerolysin concentrations if the bilayers contain incorporated GPI-anchored proteins, such as Thy-1 from brain or lymphocytes, or the erythrocyte aerolysin receptor, a novel aerolysin-binding GPI-anchored protein purified from erythrocytes (17.Cowell S. Wolfgang A. Gruber H.J. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Molec. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18.Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that lipid rafts promote channel formation by aerolysin because the increased density of GPI-anchored proteins therein leads to higher toxin concentrations than elsewhere on the cell surface, thereby, it was argued, increasing the rate of oligomerization (25.Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, only circumstantial evidence was presented to support the proposal. It was shown that aerolysin comigrates with the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction upon density gradient centrifugation, which is consistent with the fact that GPI-anchored proteins also tend to migrate there, and with our observation that aerolysin binds these proteins with high affinity (17.Cowell S. Wolfgang A. Gruber H.J. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Molec. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18.Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22604-22609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It was also shown that treating cells with a cholesterol-lowering agent, which is known to lower the amount of GPI-anchored protein that is detergent-insoluble, also lowered the amount of detergent-insoluble aerolysin (25.Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, no comparison was made of the rate of channel formation by the toxin in the normal and treated cells. Although it is possible that the concentration of GPI-anchored proteins in rafts might promote oligomerization of aerolysin, rafts could conceivably have the opposite effect. These regions are thought to be enriched in saturated lipids, so that the lateral mobility of GPI-anchored proteins may actually be lower when they are in rafts than when they are in the bulk of the membrane (2.Brown D.A. London E. J. Memb. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 3.Jacobson K. Dietrich C. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 87-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Restricted motion of bound aerolysin would tend to lower oligomerization rates. In any case, whether or not aerolysin binding to raft-associated GPI-anchored proteins does affect the kinetics of oligomerization of the toxin, it seems unlikely that there would be a significant change in the overall rate of channel formation. This is because binding rather than oligomerization is the rate-limiting step in channel formation, especially at low toxin concentrations (26.Garland W.J. Buckley J.T. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so that any influence of lipid rafts on oligomerization would probably be masked. In the present study, we looked for direct evidence of an effect of lipid rafts on channel formation by aerolysin. Cell sensitivity to the toxin was compared before and after treatment with methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, which abolishes lipid rafts by reducing plasma membrane cholesterol levels (27.Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). We found that the sensitivity of a T cell line was unaffected by cholesterol extraction; nor was the sensitivity of erythrocytes decreased by cholesterol removal. We also studied liposomes containing incorporated GPI-anchored placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), which we show acts as an aerolysin receptor. Liposomes containing PLAP associated with rafts were no more sensitive to aerolysin than liposomes that were raft-free. Liver phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and brain sphingomyelin (SM) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Cholesterol and a crude preparation of human placental alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Sigma. Proaerolysin and the inactive variant Y221G were purified as described previously. The purified variant was labeled with the fluorescent probe Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), using a procedure provided by the manufacturer. The murine lymphocyte cell line EL4 was generously provided by Dr. R. Hyman (Salk Institute). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium (DMEM) supplemented with bovine fetal clone I serum (10%, v/v), streptomycin (100 Î¼g/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) with 5% CO2at 37 Â°C. EL4 cells at 2 Ã 106 cells/ml were washed twice in neat DMEM and then incubated with or without 10 mmmethyl-Î²-cyclodextrin in DMEM for 30 min at 37 Â°C, rotating end over end. Following extraction, half of the cells were washed twice in DMEM and used in the cytotoxicity assay and for flow cytometry; the other half were washed twice in PBS, and then a cholesterol determination (Cholesterol 20; Sigma) was performed on them. Lymphocytes (1 ml of 2 Ã 107 cells/ml in DMEM, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) were incubated with 10â8m Y221G proaerolysin on ice for 1 h. We used the proaerolysin variant here because it can bind as well as native proaerolysin but does not cause cell death, since it cannot form functional channels. Following incubation, the cells were washed twice in PBS and then extracted with 500 Î¼l of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 2.2 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, and 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin) for 30 min on ice. In some experiments, the detergent extraction step was carried out first; then 10â8m Y221G was added to the cells, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 4 Â°C. Mixtures were adjusted to 1.5 m sucrose and overlaid with 8 ml of 1.2 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, followed by 2.5 ml of 0.15 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The samples were then centrifuged in an SW41 rotor at 38,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 Â°C. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and sample buffer was added for SDS-PAGE. Material at the bottoms of the centrifuge tubes was suspended directly in sample buffer. The detergent solubility of lymphocyte Thy-1 was determined by simply measuring pelleting after detergent extraction (8.Benting J. Rietveld A. Ansorge I. Simons K. FEBS. 1999; 462: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by exposure to 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS with protease inhibitors for 15 min on ice as above. This was followed by centrifugation in a TA100.2 rotor (Beckman) at 75,000 rpm at 4 Â°C for 30 min. Protein was precipitated from the supernatant and the resuspended pellet with trichloroacetic acid (10%, w/v), and Thy-1 was detected by sandwich Western blotting. The detergent insolubility of PLAP incorporated into liposomes was also measured by centrifugation. Liposomes (100 nmol of lipid) were pelleted at 75,000 rpm at 4 Â°C for 20 min in a TA100.2 rotor, and the pellet was resuspended in 450 Î¼l of 0.1% Triton X-100 in 20 mmHEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and extracted on ice for 15 min. After centrifuging at 75,000 rpm at 4 Â°C for 30 min, the enzyme activity was measured in the supernatant and in the pellet resuspended in the same buffer. Lymphocytes at 106cells/ml, treated with or without 10 mmmethyl-Î²-cyclodextrin as above, were incubated with a range of proaerolysin concentrations for 1 h at 37 Â°C under 5% CO2. Both 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium and phenazine methosulfate were then added to final concentrations of 333 and 7.66 Î¼g/ml, respectively. The samples were incubated at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2 for 4 h, after which theA 490 was measured as described previously (23.Nelson K.L. Brodsky R.A. Buckley J.T. Cell. Micro. 1999; 1: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Human erythrocytes were treated with 3.5 mmmethyl-Î²-cyclodextrin or PBS alone and then washed with PBS. Activated aerolysin was added to a final concentration of 5 nm in stirred cuvettes containing 1.5 ml of 0.8% (v/v) washed cells in PBS. The rate of hemolysis was monitored by measuring the decrease in optical density of the erythrocyte suspensions at 600 nm and 37 Â°C as a function of time. Readings were made using a Varian Cary I recording spectrophotometer as described previously (24.Brodsky R.A. Mukhina G. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Jones R.J. Buckley J.T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aerolysin concentration dependence of rat erythrocyte hemolysis was determined as described previously (28.Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Sellman B. Tweten R.K. Buckley J.T. Molec. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Control cells and cells that had been treated with methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin for 30 min at 37 Â°C were exposed to 10â8m Alexa 488-labeled Y221G proaerolysin for 30 min on ice. They were then washed twice with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. Twenty-five mg of human PLAP were dissolved in 50 ml of 1% Triton X-114 in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by incubating for 20 min on ice. The extract was separated into detergent-rich and aqueous phases by warming the sample to 37 Â°C for 10 min and then centrifuging in a JA17 rotor (Beckman) for 10 min at 10,000 rpm and 23 Â°C. The detergent-rich phase was cooled and diluted back to 1% Triton X-114 by adding cold 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Following warming and centrifuging to separate the phases once more, protein was precipitated from the detergent-rich phase by adding 5 volumes of acetone at â20 Â°C and incubating on ice for 30 min and then centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 30 min at 0 Â°C in a JA17 rotor. The acetone was decanted, and the pellet was dried for 2 h under vacuum. The dried pellet was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1% octyl glucoside, and applied to a DEAE column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted with a salt gradient of 0â0.5 m NaCl in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% octyl glucoside. Enzyme activity, which was assayed using a standard alkaline phosphatase assay (Sigma), appeared at approximately 0.18 m salt. Silver staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis produced a single band accounting for more than 95% of applied material. The purified protein had a specific activity of approximately 400 units/mg, slightly less than the specific activity reported previously for purified alkaline phosphatase lacking the GPI anchor (29.Chang T.C. Huang S.M. Huang T.M. Chang G.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Lipid films containing 12 Î¼mol of total lipid in the proportions 5 PC:3 PE:3 CH, 3 PC:3 PE:3 CH:2 SM, 4 PC:3 PE:3 CH, and 3 PC:3 PE:3 CH:1 SM, were dried under nitrogen. Dried films were desiccated overnight and then each rehydrated in 2 ml of 20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 100 mmcarboxyfluorescein, pH 7.4. Liposomes containing sphingomyelin were rehydrated at 45 Â°C, while the others were rehydrated at room temperature. Liposomes were rapidly frozen (â70 Â°C acetone bath) and thawed (45 Â°C water bath) six times. After freeze thawing, liposomes were passed through a 0.4-Î¼m polycarbonate filter (Nucleopore) six times, using a Lipex Biomembrane extruder. The sphingomyelin liposomes were extruded at 45 Â°C, and the others were extruded at room temperature. Lipid phosphorous was measured according to a published procedure (30.Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicle size was determined using a Nicomp Submicron particle sizer. To determine optimum octyl glucoside concentrations for incorporation of GPI-anchored proteins into liposomes, a published method was used (31.Nosjean O. Roux N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The turbidity of liposomes at 450 nm was monitored while increasing the concentration of octyl glucoside until the absorbance at 450 nm began to drop. This detergent concentration (20 mm for 4 PC:3 PE:3 CH, 21 mm for 3 PC:3 PE:3 CH:1 SM, 23 mmfor 5 PC:3 PE:3 CH, and 30 mm for 3 PC:3 PE:3 CH:2 SM liposomes) was chosen for GPI-anchored protein incorporation. 9.5 Î¼g of PLAP was incubated with 500 Î¼l of 1.3 mm lipid. This mixture was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm HEPES, 0.15m NaCl pH7.4 at 4 Â°C (5 PC:3 PE:3 CH and 4 PC:3 PE:3 CH liposomes), or 22 Â°C (sphingomyelin-containing liposomes) to remove detergent and free carboxyfluorescein. Liposomes were then passed over a Sephacryl S-300 column (23 ml) in 20 mm HEPES, 0.15m NaCl, to remove unincorporated PLAP and free dye. Phosphorous assays were performed on liposomes collected off of the column. Carboxyfluorescein release was measured at 37 Â°C using a Photon Technology spectrofluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was set at 490 nm, and the emission wavelength was set at 520 nm. A 5-nm slit width was used for both monochromators. Aliquots of liposome preparations (0.26 nmol of lipid) were added to 3 ml of 20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. Activated aerolysin was added to a final concentration of 36 nm at 1 min. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (32.Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and blotted. Blots were probed with proaerolysin, followed by polyclonal anti-aerolysin and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase according to our published procedure (18.Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). They were then developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). One of the few easily measured properties of lipid rafts is their insolubility in some nonionic detergents (5.Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Schroeder R. London E. Brown D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The raft lipids and proteins are thought to remain associated in Triton X-100, and the insoluble complexes can be separated from other cell components by flotation in sucrose density gradients (5.Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since proaerolysin binds very tightly with GPI-anchored proteins, which partially associate with the insoluble complexes, some proaerolysin should be found in the floating fraction after extraction of cells that have been pretreated with the protein. Such an association was first reported using baby hamster kidney cells and presented as evidence that rafts favor channel formation by aerolysin (25.Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The results in Fig.1 A show that detergent extraction of EL4 cells pretreated with proaerolysin also led to a detergent-insoluble fraction, corresponding to rafts, that contained some of the protoxin. Not all of the protein was recovered with the floating fraction. Some remained at the bottom of the centrifuge tube, indicating that it was extracted with detergent and therefore not raft-associated. A similar distribution of the GPI-anchored protein Thy-1 was observed (data not shown). This is consistent with the generally held view that only a fraction of the plasma membrane's GPI-anchored proteins are localized in rafts at any given time. It was not possible to make a direct comparison of our results with those obtained with baby hamster kidney cells, since in that study gradient fractions were normalized to constant total protein, thereby heavily weighting the amount of aerolysin apparently associated with the floating fraction in the SDS-polyacrylamide gels (25.Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The fact that detergent extraction of cells that had been incubated with aerolysin resulted in the recovery of some of the toxin in a detergent-insoluble fraction is not necessarily evidence that there is a real and physiologically significant association of the toxin with rafts in situ. Thus, when aerolysin was added after the cells had been disrupted with Triton X-100, the amount recovered in the low density detergent-insoluble fraction did not differ very much from the amount recovered in this fraction when the cells had been preincubated with the toxin before extraction (Fig. 1, compareA and B). There is considerable evidence that the detergent-insoluble fraction, or lipid rafts, can be greatly reduced by lowering the cholesterol content of the membrane. This can be accomplished by treating cells with the cholesterol-sequestering agent methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (27.Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Extraction of EL4 cells with 10 mm methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin for 30 min led to a 45% decline in cholesterol levels and a striking change in the amount of Thy-1 detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction (data not shown), evidence that rafts had been greatly reduced. Flow cytometric analysis of the treated and control cells using a fluorescently labeled toxin indicated that cholesterol extraction had little or no effect on aerolysin binding (Fig. 2). This was not surprising, since there is no reason to believe that there should be any difference in the binding of the protein to GPI-anchored proteins whether they are located in rafts or distributed on the rest of the membrane surface. More importantly, the results in Fig.3 show that the depleted cells, containing considerably less cholesterol and detergent-insoluble GPI-anchored protein, were no less sensitive to the toxin than the untreated cells.Figure 3Raft reduction does not affect the sensitivity of T lymphocytes to aerolysin. Cell viability was determined before (â) and after (â ) raft disruption by methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin. Also shown is the sensitivity of untreated rat erythrocytes to aerolysin (â). The percentage of cell lysis of erythrocytes was determined spectrophotometrically as described previously (28.Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Sellman B. Tweten R.K. Buckley J.T. Molec. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Lymphocyte cell viability was measured as described under âExperimental Procedures.âView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also studied the effect of cholesterol depletion on the sensitivity of human erythrocytes. Erythrocytes are lysed by aerolysin at concentrations similar to those that kill EL4 cells (Fig. 3), although they contain different aerolysin-binding GPI-anchored proteins. This too is not surprising, since aerolysin binds to the anchor, which has a constant core structure from cell to cell and species to species. Treatment with 3.5 mm methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin for 60 min removed 90% of the erythrocyte cholesterol, a higher percentage than is removed from other cell types, presumably because erythrocyte cholesterol is entirely associated with the plasma membrane. Remarkably, the nearly complete extraction of the steroid from the cells did not lower the rate at which they were lysed by aerolysin (Fig.4), despite the fact that the amount of raft-associated GPI-anchored protein, if any, must have been very small. The above results lend no support to the idea that lipid rafts have an important role to play in channel formation by aerolysin. However, although it seemed unlikely that the erythrocytes used to obtain the data in Fig. 4could contain any significant raft population after extraction of 90% of their cholesterol, we could not exclude the possibility that a small raft population remained. In order to compare membranes totally lacking rafts with membranes that contain a detergent-soluble fraction, we decided to use large unilamellar vesicles containing a GPI-anchored protein that acts as an aerolysin receptor. We have previously shown that Thy-1 is an excellent receptor for aerolysin when it is incorporated into liposomes; however, for the present study we wished to use a protein that could be more easily quantitated, so we first determined if GPI-anchored placental alkaline phosphatase could substitute for Thy-1. The results in Fig.5 A show that the addition of 36 nm aerolysin to liposomes containing incorporated PLAP resulted in rapid dye release, whereas liposomes without PLAP were not affected by this concentration of the toxin. We obtained a very similar pattern with liposomes containing incorporated Thy-1 (18.Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Having shown that PLAP is an aerolysin receptor, we then incorporated the enzyme into liposomes of different lipid compositions. Most of the PLAP in the 3:3:3:2 (PC:PE:CH:SM) vesicles was detergent-insoluble, evidence for the presence of rafts, whereas all of the enzyme in liposomes lacking SM was soluble in Triton X-100. Vesicles made with half as much SM had approximately half as much detergent-insoluble PLAP (data not shown). The ability to prepare liposomes with and without rafts allowed us to determine directly whether or not these lipid structures have any pronounced effect on aerolysin sensitivity. The rates of channel formation by aerolysin were next compared in liposomes lacking raft-associated PLAP or containing moderate (Fig.5 A) or large amounts (Fig. 5 B) of the detergent-insoluble enzyme. It may be seen that there were only minor differences in the rate of dye release regardless of the liposome composition. Release from the liposomes containing large amounts of raft PLAP was actually somewhat slower than from the corresponding liposomes lacking sphingomyelin (Fig. 5 B). The two liposome populations contained very similar proportions of PLAP to lipid, although the SM-containing population was somewhat smaller. Comparable results were obtained when lower concentrations of aerolysin were used (data not shown). Although the results in this paper cast no direct light on the existence or significance of lipid rafts in cell membranes, they clearly show that if these structures exist, they have little or no influence on the rate of channel formation by aerolysin, either in whole cells or in liposomes. The result is not surprising for two reasons. First, even if rafts did alter the rate of aerolysin oligomerization, we would not expect to see an effect on cells unless oligomerization becomes the rate-limiting step in channel formation. Normally, binding is rate-limiting, and there is no reason to believe that GPI-anchored proteins clustered in rafts would bind the toxin any better than when they are distributed on the cell surface. In fact, the results in Fig. 2 show that binding is not affected by raft disruption. Second, it is not intuitively obvious that, even if oligomerization were the rate-limiting step in channel formation, it would occur more quickly if the receptors were clustered in rafts. Membrane GPI-anchored proteins could be less mobile when they occur in these regions, because of the increased levels of relatively saturated fatty acids found there (7.Schroeder R. London E.

In any case, GPI-anchored proteins are also located in the bulk of the lipid bilayer, where they are apparently very mobile, some have speculated even more mobile than transmembrane proteins (3.Jacobson K. Dietrich C. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 87-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar,14.McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem.

They appear to simply pause in rafts as they move about the cell surface; at any given time, only a fraction is thought to be localized in rafts (3.Jacobson K. Dietrich C.

The results we obtained with erythrocytes extracted with methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin allow us to comment on the role of cholesterol in channel formation by aerolysin. There has been a recent report that aerolysin is inhibited when preincubated with cholesterol, which was taken as evidence that the toxin can interact with the steroid (34.Ferguson M.R Xu X.J. Houston C.W. Peterson J.W. Coppenhaver D.H. Popov V.L. Chopra A.K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier we had shown that aerolysin is capable of forming channels in cholesterol-free liposomes, indicating that it has no absolute requirement for the steroid (35.Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here we found that removing nearly all of the cholesterol from the cell did not lower the rate of channel formation. Thus, it would seem that cholesterol plays no significant role in the action of aerolysin. In conclusion, the unusual ability of aerolysin to bind to GPI-anchored proteins may provide a new tool to study the chemistry and biology of lipid rafts, but there is no reason to believe that these structures are important in the process of channel formation by the toxin.

https://openalex.org/W2323069939,"p27Kip1 (p27) controls cell cycle progression by binding to and inhibiting the activity of cyclin dependent kinases. Disruption of the p27 gene in mice (p27-/-) results in increased body growth with a disproportionate enlargement of the spleen, thymus, testis, ovary and pituitary. The increase in pituitary size is due to selective hyperplasia of the intermediate lobe (IL) while the anterior lobe (AL) is not overtly affected. p27 heterozygous mice (p27+/-), as well as p27-/- mice, are hypersensitive to radiation- and chemical-induced tumors compared to wildtype (p27+/+) littermates. Therefore, unlike classical tumor suppressors, only a reduction in p27 levels is necessary to predispose tissues to secondary tumor promoters. Consistent with these studies is the fact that the p27 gene sequence and mRNA levels appear normal in human pituitary adenomas while p27 protein levels are decreased. Therefore, a reduction in p27 levels could be sufficient to sensitize pituitary cells to tumorigenic factors. To test this hypothesis, metallothionein promoter-driven, human growth hormone-releasing hormone (MT-hGHRH) transgenic mice, that exhibit somatotrope hyperplasia before 9 months of age and subsequent adenoma formation with 30 - 40% penetrance, were crossbred with p27+/- mice for two successive generations to produce p27+/+, p27+/- and p27-/- mice that expressed the hGHRH transgene. At 10 - 12 weeks of age, p27-/- and p27+/+, hGHRH mice were larger than their p27+/+ littermates and displayed characteristic hyperplasia of the IL and AL, respectively. Expression of the hGHRH transgene in both p27+/- and p27-/- mice selectively expanded the population of somatotropes within the AL, where pituitaries of p27+/-, hGHRH and p27-/-, hGHRH mice were two- and fivefold larger than p27+/+, hGHRH pituitaries, respectively. There was also a synergistic effect of hGHRH transgene expression and p27-deficiency on liver, spleen and ovarian growth. At 6 - 8 months of age, 83% of p27+/-, hGHRH mice displayed macroscopic AL adenomas (>100 mg), while all pituitaries from p27+/+, hGHRH mice remained hyperplastic (<20 mg). In contrast to the dramatic effects of p27-deficiency on hGHRH-induced organ growth, elimination of p53, by crossbreeding MT-hGHRH mice to p53-deficient mice, did not augment the hyperplastic/tumorigenic effects of hGHRH transgene expression. Taken together these results demonstrate that a reduction in p27 expression is sufficient to sensitize somatotropes to the proliferative actions of excess GHRH, resulting in the earlier appearance and increased penetrance of hGHRH-induced pituitary tumors."

Gorbach S.L. Blacklow N.R. Infectious Diseases. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1998: 1824-1837Google Scholar). Eye infection by P. aeruginosa is relatively common, particularly in wearers of contact lenses (2.Burns F.R. Paterson C.A. Gray R.D. Wells J.T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 2065-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); if not promptly treated, these infections can result in corneal ulceration and visual impairment. Among the virulence factors of P. aeruginosa are two secreted metalloproteinases (3.Morihara K. Homma J.Y. Holder I.A. Bacterial Enzymes and Virulence. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 41-79Google Scholar), elastase (pseudolysin, PL)1 and alkaline proteinase (aeruginolysin, APR). Substrates for PL include extracellular matrix structural proteins, immunoglobulins, complement components, and Î±1-proteinase inhibitor (3.Morihara K. Homma J.Y. Holder I.A. Bacterial Enzymes and Virulence. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 41-79Google Scholar). APR degrades fibrinogen, fibrin (4.Shibuya Y. Yamamoto T. Morimoto T. Nishino N. Kambara T. Okabe H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1077: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), laminin (5.Heck L.W. Morihara K. Abrahamson D.R. Infect.

Immun. 1988; 56: 2925-2932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it also is capable of activating Hageman factor (7.Molla A. Yamamoto T. Akaike T. Miyoshi S. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10589-10594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (8.Twining S.S. Kirschner S.E. Mahnke L.A. Frank D.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual. Sci. 1993; 34: 2699-2712PubMed Google Scholar).APR and PL were initially characterized by Morihora (9.Morihara K. Tsuzuki H. Oka T. Ebata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3295-3304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Morihora K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 73: 113-124Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Subsequent structural comparison revealed that PL is related to thermolysin ofBacillus thermolyticus, and APR is homologous to the 50-kDa metalloproteinases secreted by Serratia marcescens andErwinia chrysanthemi (11.Maeda H. Morihora K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 395-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12.StoÌcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-RuÌth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). These enzymes constitute the serralysin branch of the metzincin superfamily of metalloendopeptidases (13.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography of APR (14.Baumann U. Wu S. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and SMP (15.Baumann U. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), theSerratia homolog of APR, shows that both consist of an N-terminal catalytic domain of about 230 residues and a C-terminal calcium binding domain of approximately 240 residues that appears to be required for proteinase secretion (16.Guzzo J. Pages J.-M. Duong F. Lazdunski A. Murgier M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5290-5297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domain contains sequences characteristic of the metzincin superfamily of metalloendopeptidases, namely a zinc-binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) and a conserved Met located in a turn near the base of the metal binding pocket. Other metzincins include astacins, MMPs, reprolysins, and the adamalysins (12.StoÌcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-RuÌth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar).Serralysin secretors are also capable of producing specific inhibitory proteins of about 125 residues that are transported to the periplasm where the signal peptide is removed (17.LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18.Duong F. Lazdunski A. Cami B. Murgier M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The three known members of this inhibitor family exhibit approximately 20% sequence identity and an additional 20% sequence similarity, including a conserved disulfide bond (19.Baumann U. Bauer M. LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The mature inhibitors from E. chrysanthemi and P. aeruginosa have N-terminal Ser, whereas the N terminus of the S. marcescens inhibitor is Gly; in addition, 8 of 15 N-terminal residues are identical among the three inhibitors.X-ray crystallography of a complex between SMP and the inhibitor ofE. chrysanthemi (Inh) reveals that Inh is folded into an eight-stranded Î²-barrel with an N-terminal trunk of 10 residues (19.Baumann U. Bauer M. LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Residues 1â5 occupy part of the extended active site of the proteinase, thereby preventing access of the substrate. Residues 6â10 form a linker that connects the N-terminal proteinase-binding peptide to the body of the Î²-barrel. The backbone carbonyl of Ser-1 interacts with the catalytic zinc; the Ser-2 side chain occupies the S1â²-binding site and also forms a hydrogen bond to the carboxyl end of the catalytic Glu, whereas Leu-3 occupies the S2â² recognition site. Penetration of the trunk region further than 5 residues into the substrate binding cleft appears to be prevented by the Î²-barrel, which itself interacts with the proteinase near its Met turn (19.Baumann U. Bauer M. LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Peptide mimetics of the trunk at concentrations up to about 100 Î¼m do not inhibit APR, thus demonstrating that the barrel is essential for inhibitory activity. 2R. D. Gray and R. E. Feltzer, unpublished data. 2R. D. Gray and R. E. Feltzer, unpublished data.The inhibitors of E. chrysanthemi and S. marcescens have been reported to inhibit their target proteinases with K I values of 1â10 (17.LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and 0.7 Î¼m (20.Bae K.H. Kim I.C. Kim K.S. Shin Y.C. Byun S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), respectively; the inhibitor from P. aeruginosa has not previously been characterized with respect to its interaction with APR. Because of the potential role of this proteinase in the development of Pseudomonas keratitis (21.Howe T.R. Iglewski B.H. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Gray R.D. Paterson C.A. Wentworth J.S. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55 Suppl. 1: 74Crossref Google Scholar, 23.Kernacki K.A. Hobden J.A. Hazlett L.D. Fridman R. Berk S. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 1371-1378PubMed Google Scholar), we initiated an investigation of the interaction between the two proteins. Our goal was to develop a recombinant expression system for APRin and to characterize its interaction with APR. After finding that the mature inhibitor exhibited an unexpectedly high affinity for APR (K D â4 pm), we undertook an assessment of the role of the N terminus in determining enzyme-inhibitor affinity. In addition, because of the structural similarity between the catalytic domain of the serralysins and that of the matrix metalloproteinases, we investigated possible interactions between APRin and other members of the metzincin family. Finally, we found that PL specifically removed 5 N-terminal residues from APRin, thereby essentially inactivating it.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study show that APRin interacts with its cognate proteinase in a reversible reaction that follows bimolecular kinetics as assessed by measurement of the time-dependent loss of catalytic activity. Implicit in this assertion is the reasonable assumption that the rate of inhibition of APR reflects the rate of its complex formation with APRin. We were unable to detect changes in UV absorbance or fluorescence that could provide an independent assessment of complex formation. However, the invariance of the apparent second order rate constant measured over a range of reactant concentrations supports the assumption that inhibition and binding are commensurate.The association rate was sensitive to the viscosity of the medium as expected for a diffusion-limited reaction. The 2-fold decrease ink on that accompanied the increase in viscosity brought about by 20% glycerol is approximately that expected for a purely diffusion-limited reaction according to the Smoluchowski equation (40.Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences. Cambridge University Press, UK1995: 270-275Google Scholar). With respect to ionic strength, the relatively small decrease in k on (â¼3-fold) associated with the large increase in salt concentration (24-fold) suggests that electrostatic interactions between the reactants are not a major determinant of the rate of complex formation. The small effect of ionic strength on the binding of APRin to APR can be contrasted with the 100-fold decrease in association rate constant for the barnase-barstar interaction associated with a 10-fold increase in ionic strength (41.Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Ionic strength effects of similar magnitude have been noted with other electrostatically controlled protein association reactions including hirudin with thrombin (42.Stone S.R. Dennis S. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6857-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and cytochrome c with cytochromeb 5 (43.Northrup S.H. Thomasson K.A. Miller C.M. Barker P.D. Eltis L.D. Guillemette J.G. Inglis S.C. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6613-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In these systems there was clear indication that mutual attraction of interfacial regions controls the rate of association by pre-aligning the reactants to increase the number of effective collisions (44.Gabdoulline R.R. Wade R.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1917-1929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 45.Elcock A.H. Gabdoulline R.R. Wade R.C. McCammon J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).The effect of trunk length on the kinetics of APR-APRin association may be interpreted in terms of the Brownian dynamics model of protein-protein interaction (46.Northrup S.H. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3338-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In this model, reaction partners collide in random orientations at a diffusion-limited rate. They become transiently trapped in a solvent cage that allows time for rotation and multiple close-range collisions to occur, thereby increasing the probability that reactive surfaces become aligned and guide productive bonding before the complex dissociates. A favorable effect of trunk length on the association rate could result from the increased probability for productive interactions provided by the increased surface area of a longer trunk. If this weakly bonded complex is viewed as a transition state, then the increased surface area provided by a long trunk will increase the stability of suboptimally aligned states leading to final docking. Fig.7 A shows that there is a strong correlation (r = 0.95) between logk on and total surface area (side chain plus backbone) of the 5-residue trunk proposed to interact with APR. This relationship suggests that the number of potential contacts between reactants does influence the stability of the transition state for association.The Gibbs free energy change associated with binding of APRin and APRin mutants also correlates with accessible surface area of the non-polar regions trunk, but the correlation is weaker (r = 0.76) than that for the rate of association. As shown in Fig. 7 B, a plot of âÎG of binding versussolvent-accessible non-polar surface area of the residues of APRin believed to interact with APR is approximately linear with a slope of â¼10 cal/mol/â«2 for the regression line. Free energy relationships such as this are usually correlated with desolvation of non-polar surfaces on binding and hence are related to hydrophobicity. The free energy change varies between 25 and 50 cal/mol/â«2depending on the experimental system (45.Elcock A.H. Gabdoulline R.R. Wade R.C. McCammon J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The value of â¼10 cal/mol/â«2 in Fig. 7 B probably represents a minimal estimate of the contribution of hydrophobicity to binding because proteinase surfaces were not included in the estimation of solvent-accessible area, yet these sites may also release water molecules to the bulk solvent on binding inhibitor. The effect of NaCl on the apparent K s for the non-polar substrate TPS (a 6.5-fold decrease) is also consistent with a role for hydrophobicity in ligand binding at the substrate-binding site. Interestingly, the interface between the inhibitor Î²-barrel and the Met-turn region of the proteinase contains 16 water molecules (19.Baumann U. Bauer M. LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting that desolvation in this region may make less of a contribution to the energetics of binding.The results of this study also show that the interaction of APR with its cognate inhibitor is unexpectedly strong in comparison to the two other serralysin-inhibitor pairs. Our data demonstrate that the APRÂ·wtAPRin complex is formed with a K D of â¼4 pm compared with reported affinities of the SMPÂ·SMPI complex of 0.7 Î¼m (20.Bae K.H. Kim I.C. Kim K.S. Shin Y.C. Byun S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the E. chrysanthemicomplex of 1â10 Î¼m (17.LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is perhaps significant that the secondary structure of wt APRin provided by CD indicates that its backbone conformation may differ from that of Inh, particularly with respect to the amount of Î²-structure present. These possible structural differences might provide stabilizing interactions, perhaps in the barrel region, that are not available to the SMPÂ·Inh complex.The reduced affinity of the truncated inhibitors and the lack of inhibition engendered by deletion of 6 or 10 N-terminal residues supports the inference from crystallography only 5 N-terminal residues of the trunk can bind to the proteinase. Ser-2 of Inh occupies S1â² of SMP, and Leu-3 and Leu-5 also contact the proteinase, presumably at S2â² and S4â² sites (19.Baumann U. Bauer M. LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The weak inhibition observed with Î(1â5) 4It is conceivable that the inhibition observed with the Î(1â5) mutant could have resulted from the presence of a small amount (â¼1%) of a contaminating high affinity inhibitor, possibly resulting from incomplete or inaccurate processing of the recombinant pelB-APRin protein. However, no contaminants were detected by mass spectrometry under conditions where a level of 1% of a contaminant could be observed. In addition, Î(1â5)-APRin generated by treating wt APRin with PL exhibited the same inhibitory properties as the recombinant preparation. and the lack of inhibition by Î(6â10) can be rationalized if APR has an S4â² site that interacts specifically with the hydrophobic residues such as Leu-5, which happens to be conserved in the three family members. The N-terminal residue of the Î(6â10) mutant is Ser, which may not bind strongly enough to the S4â² site to stabilize a complex. On the other hand, N-terminal position in the Î(1â5) mutant is Leu and could be accommodated at this site (refer to Table II for a summary of the N-terminal sequences).Finally, we found that PL, also a secreted metalloproteinase ofP. aeruginosa, could essentially inactivate APRin by removing its 5 N-terminal residues. In retrospect, this action of PL is not surprising in view of the proclivity of this enzyme for cleaving at bulky hydrophobic residues (47.Morihara K. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1967; 35: 179-243Google Scholar). Whether inactivation of APRin is physiologically significant or not is unclear because the function of the inhibitor has not been defined with certainty. It has been suggested that serralysin inhibitors protect the host from proteolysis during proteinase export (17.LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). From a teleological standpoint, it would appear advantageous for an organism to have a mechanism for inactivating an inhibitor that could be deleterious if released where it could neutralize a survival factor. Thus, inactivating APRin released for example as a result of cell death would benefit the colony as a whole. In this regard, use of APRin as a specific inhibitor of APR in treating Pseudomonas keratitis may require development of a modified molecule that resists the action of PL and possibly other proteinases present in infected corneas. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous microorganism that is usually benign with respect to healthy individuals but pathogenic in a number of clinical settings, including surgical patients, burn victims, and persons with cystic fibrosis (1.Pollack M. Gorbach S.L. Blacklow N.R. Infectious Diseases. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1998: 1824-1837Google Scholar). Eye infection by P. aeruginosa is relatively common, particularly in wearers of contact lenses (2.Burns F.R. Paterson C.A. Gray R.D. Wells J.T. Antimicrob.

Among the virulence factors of P. aeruginosa are two secreted metalloproteinases (3.Morihara K. Homma J.Y. Holder I.A. Bacterial Enzymes and Virulence. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 41-79Google Scholar), elastase (pseudolysin, PL)1 and alkaline proteinase (aeruginolysin, APR). Substrates for PL include extracellular matrix structural proteins, immunoglobulins, complement components, and Î±1-proteinase inhibitor (3.Morihara K. Homma J.Y. Holder I.A.

Subsequent structural comparison revealed that PL is related to thermolysin ofBacillus thermolyticus, and APR is homologous to the 50-kDa metalloproteinases secreted by Serratia marcescens andErwinia chrysanthemi (11.Maeda H.

Biol. 1994; 242: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), theSerratia homolog of APR, shows that both consist of an N-terminal catalytic domain of about 230 residues and a C-terminal calcium binding domain of approximately 240 residues that appears to be required for proteinase secretion (16.Guzzo J. Pages J.-M. Duong F. Lazdunski A. Murgier M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5290-5297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domain contains sequences characteristic of the metzincin superfamily of metalloendopeptidases, namely a zinc-binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) and a conserved Met located in a turn near the base of the metal binding pocket. Other metzincins include astacins, MMPs, reprolysins, and the adamalysins (12.StoÌcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-RuÌth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Serralysin secretors are also capable of producing specific inhibitory proteins of about 125 residues that are transported to the periplasm where the signal peptide is removed (17.LeÌtoffeÌ S.

Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The three known members of this inhibitor family exhibit approximately 20% sequence identity and an additional 20% sequence similarity, including a conserved disulfide bond (19.Baumann U. Bauer M.

The mature inhibitors from E. chrysanthemi and P. aeruginosa have N-terminal Ser, whereas the N terminus of the S. marcescens inhibitor is Gly; in addition, 8 of 15 N-terminal residues are identical among the three inhibitors. X-ray crystallography of a complex between SMP and the inhibitor ofE. chrysanthemi (Inh) reveals that Inh is folded into an eight-stranded Î²-barrel with an N-terminal trunk of 10 residues (19.Baumann U. Bauer M. LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Residues 1â5 occupy part of the extended active site of the proteinase, thereby preventing access of the substrate. Residues 6â10 form a linker that connects the N-terminal proteinase-binding peptide to the body of the Î²-barrel. The backbone carbonyl of Ser-1 interacts with the catalytic zinc; the Ser-2 side chain occupies the S1â²-binding site and also forms a hydrogen bond to the carboxyl end of the catalytic Glu, whereas Leu-3 occupies the S2â² recognition site. Penetration of the trunk region further than 5 residues into the substrate binding cleft appears to be prevented by the Î²-barrel, which itself interacts with the proteinase near its Met turn (19.Baumann U. Bauer M. LeÌtoffeÌ S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Peptide mimetics of the trunk at concentrations up to about 100 Î¼m do not inhibit APR, thus demonstrating that the barrel is essential for inhibitory activity. 2R. D. Gray and R. E.

However, using MHC class I restricted H-Y-TCR transgenic mice, we found that c-Myc activation in vivo enhances the efficiency of positive selection.

https://openalex.org/W2320866142,"Transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) is widely expressed in malignant as well as normal cells and is involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation. Although processing of TGFalpha has been extensively studied in normal cells, there is little information regarding TGFalpha cleavage in malignant cells. Therefore, we compared the processing of TGFalpha in two human colon carcinoma cell lines. We found that there was a defective cleavage pattern for the TGFalpha precursor resulting in retention of partially processed TGFalpha on the cell surface of both the HCT116a2alphaS3 and CBS4alphaS2 cell lines. This raised the possibility that signaling from the resulting defective cleavage species could differ from that of soluble TGFalpha. The membrane-associated TGFalpha induced higher phosphorylation of EGFR on the cell surface of adjacent cells than equivalent levels of mature TGFalpha. The interaction of membrane bound TGFalpha precursor with the EGFR caused a slower internalization of activated EGFR relative to the internalization of the soluble TGFalpha/EGFR complexes. In addition, the tethered TGFalpha was resistant to the ability of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) to reduce EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, also contributing to higher activation of EGFR. The enhanced activation of EGFR by the tethered form of TGFalpha was reflected by higher activation of Grb2, SHC and Erk downstream mediators of EGF receptor signaling. The higher activation of EGFR by membrane tethered TGFalpha indicates that defective TGFalpha processing provides a mechanism whereby malignant cells can obtain a growth advantage over normal cells."

We show that bFGF treatment inhibits Tyr-15 dephosphorylation of cdc2 and prevents activation of Cdc25C, similar to what is seen upon activation of the G2DNA damage checkpoint.

Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation is controlled by multiple growth-regulatory pathways that act together to ensure proper cell division. At the late G1restriction point the cell weighs the activity of positive and negative regulatory signals. After passage through the restriction point, mitogenic growth factors are no longer required for cells to complete division, and cells become refractory to growth-inhibitory signals (2.Pardee A.B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22825-22829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, cells come to rely upon the intrinsic regulators of the cell cycle machinery for orderly progression through the remainder of the cell cycle (2.Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar).Orderly progression through the mammalian cell cycle is dependent on the timed activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (5.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Each cell cycle phase is characterized by the presence of distinct cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes (6.Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 79: 547-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Cell cycle control by checkpoints functions through interference with activation of these complexes. For example, for the onset of mitosis the activation of cyclin B-cdc2 complexes is required (7.Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), whereas activation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint results in inhibition of these complexes, leading to an arrest in G2phase progression (8.Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Datta R. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1412-1414PubMed Google Scholar).Cyclin B is first synthesized during S phase, and cyclin B-cdc2 complexes continue to accumulate throughout G2. These complexes are held in an inactive state by phosphorylation of cdc2 at Thr-14 and Tyr-15, which is mediated by the Wee1 protein kinases (7.Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,9.King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). At the end of G2, abrupt dephosphorylation of this site by the phosphatase Cdc25C triggers cdc2 activation (9.King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Cyclin B-cdc2 then phosphorylates and thereby further activates Cdc25C, which induces the full activation of cdc2 by forming a positive feedback loop by mutual activation (10.Hoffman I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 11.Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). At the same time, certain sites within the cytoplasmic retention signal in the N terminus of cyclin B are phosphorylated, which allows translocation to the nucleus (12.Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13.Li J. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Upon nuclear translocation, the cyclin B-cdc2 complex can phosphorylate critical substrates required for the initiation of mitosis. Completion of mitosis in turn depends on the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of cyclin B at the metaphase/anaphase transition (14.Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar).We have investigated the mechanism of growth inhibition by bFGF1 in SK-N-MC cells, neuroepithelioma cells of embryonic neuroectodermal origin. We find that addition of bFGF delays cell cycle progression through the G2 phase of the cell cycle rather than during G1. This bFGF-induced delay in G2 progression resembles the G2 arrest seen after DNA damage, indicating the existence of a growth factor-sensitive point in G2.DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrate that bFGF can induce growth inhibition of SK-N-MC cells by a delay in G2 phase progression, a mechanism that appears similar to the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. We showed that treatment with bFGF increased the doubling time of SK-N-MC cells from â¼20 to â¼30 h, and we demonstrated that cells are delayed in G2/M by about 8 h. This indicates that the major, if not only, growth inhibitory effect of bFGF on SK-N-MC cells is exerted in the G2 phase and makes it unlikely that bFGF affects other cell cycle phases. This is remarkable because it is generally believed that extracellular factors can influence cell cycle progression during G1 and that cells become refractory to growth inhibitory signals after passage through the restriction point (2.Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). Our results clearly indicate that cells can be inhibited by growth inhibitory signals after passage through the restriction point, because the addition of bFGF to cells that are in S phase still results in a delay in G2/M progression of at least 8 h. Indeed, the addition of bFGF up to a point late in G2 still efficiently inhibited mitotic entry (data not shown).In addition to the results obtained with bFGF, stimulation of the Ret signaling pathway using a chimeric human epidermal growth factor receptor-Ret chimera receptor in SK-N-MC cells resulted in growth inhibition that was associated with a delay in G2 phase progression, similar to what is seen after bFGF treatment. 2V. A. J. Smits, M. A. van Peer, M. A. G. Essers, R. Klompmaker, G. Rijksen, and R. H. Medema, manuscript in preparation. These results indicate that this response is not restricted to a single growth factor receptor. Indeed, others have reported minor effects on G2progression by epidermal growth factor. Treatment of Hela and A431 cells with epidermal growth factor resulted in a short delay (1â2 h) in mitotic entry coupled with a delay in activation of cyclin B-cdc2 complexes (29.Kinzel V. Kaszkin M. Blume A. Richards J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7932-7936PubMed Google Scholar). However, in these cells no overall growth inhibition was observed with epidermal growth factor, in contrast to what we see with bFGF in SK-N-MC cells. Therefore, this is the first example of overall growth inhibition by an extracellular factor that appears to be confined to regulation of the G2/M transition. Nevertheless, the data obtained with epidermal growth factor in Hela and A431 cells suggest that negative growth regulation in G2 by extracellular factors might be a more general phenomenon. In addition to the extensively studied G1restriction point, growth regulation in G2 may therefore play an important role in the proliferation of some cells.It will be of interest to study the signaling molecules in the pathway by which bFGF and Ret induce growth inhibition of SK-N-MC cells. It should be noted that van Puijenbroek et al. (18.van Puijenbroek A.A.F.L. van Weering D.H.L. van den Brink C.E. Bos J.L. van der Saag P.T. de Laat S.W. den Hertog J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showed that growth inhibition by bFGF and Ret in these SK-N-MC cells is associated with sustained MAPK activation, whereas platelet-derived growth factor, which does not induce growth inhibition, also activates MAPK but gives rise to only a very transient activation of MAPK in these cells. Several studies support a role for MAPK in regulating progression through G2/M (30.Abrieu A. Fisher D. Simon M.N. Doree M. Picard A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6407-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31.Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Ueki K. Izumi T. Chatani Y. Kohno M. Kasuga M. Yazaki Y. Akanuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20293-20297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but other studies also suggest the involvement of other signaling molecules, for example, protein kinase C (32.Barth H. Kinzel V. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33.Hofmann J. O'Conner P.M. Jackman J. Schubert C. Ueberall F. Kohn K.W. Grunicke H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, using pharmacological inhibitors of MAPK, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and p38 MAPK we have been unable to obtain evidence for a possible involvement of any of these signaling molecules in the observed bFGF-induced growth inhibition (data not shown).A possible mediator of the G2 arrest induced by bFGF is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 waf1. This p53-regulated protein has been described as inhibiting kinase activity of the cyclins E, A, and B, resulting in an arrest in both the G1 and G2phases of the cell cycle (36.Medema R.H. Klompmaker R. Smits V.A.J. Rijksen R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). SK-N-MC cells do not express functional p53 (37.Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), but activation of p21 waf1 expression can also occur independently of p53 (38.Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 39.Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). However, up-regulation of p21 waf1 could not be observed after bFGF treatment (data not shown), indicating that the inhibition of cyclin B kinase activity by bFGF must be due to another mechanism.Because Tyr-15 dephosphorylation is a critical step in the activation of the cyclin B-cdc2 complex, we investigated the effect of bFGF on this dephosphorylation event. We found that cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation, as well as activation of the Cdc25C phosphatase responsible for this dephosphorylation, was inhibited by bFGF. DNA damage also results in the inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation by blocking activation of Cdc25C, thereby leading to an arrest in G2 (8.Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Datta R. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1412-1414PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, caffeine could revert both DNA damage- and bFGF-induced inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation, indicating once more that these two pathways are remarkably similar. Moreover, our finding that caffeine can revert the effect of bFGF on cdc2 dephosphorylation makes it unlikely that the inhibition of cdc2 activation by bFGF is due to an arrest of cell cycle progression at an early point in G2, prior to cdc2 activation. Thus, our data indicate that bFGF directly interferes with the activation of cyclin B-cdc2 to inhibit cell proliferation.Our results suggested that bFGF would interfere with cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation via inhibition of Cdc25C. The inhibition of cdc2 activation induced by DNA damage results from Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of the Ser-216 site of Cdc25C, leading to the inability of Cdc25C to activate cyclin B-cdc2 complexes (23.Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 24.Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H.

Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We showed that expression of Cdc25C mutated on Ser-216 was able to rescue the bFGF-induced inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation (Fig. 5) and restored the cyclin B-cdc2 kinase activity (data not shown). Expression of this mutant, in contrast to wild type Cdc25C, resulted in a rescue of the bFGF-induced G2 delay as demonstrated by a BrdUrd pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 5). This demonstrates that regulation of Cdc25C phosphorylation is a critical factor in the bFGF-induced growth inhibition of SK-N-MC cells. Because we find a partial reversion, we cannot rule out other effects of bFGF during G2/M. Indeed, using a BrdUrd pulse-chase assay we showed that bFGF induced an â¼8 h delay in G2 progression (Fig. 1 C), whereas the mitotic entry was only inhibited for 4â6 h (Fig. 2), which could indicate that bFGF has additional effects on events later in mitosis.Besides Chk1-mediated inhibition of Cdc25C, other pathways are activated after DNA damage to enforce a delay in G2. For example, p53-regulated p21 expression results in a sustained G2 arrest in response to DNA damage (27.Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of the nuclear translocation of cyclin B by DNA damage blocks the access of cyclin B to its mitotic substrates (28.Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We found that expression of Cdc25C-S216A was unable to revert the inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation that occurs in response to the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin (Fig. 5 B), consistent with the existence of parallel pathways. Thus, although certain similarities were observed between the DNA damage response and the effects of bFGF described here, the efficient rescue of bFGF-induced G2arrest seen in cells expressing Cdc25C-S216A mutant indicates that the pathways affected by bFGF are not as diverse as those activated after DNA damage.A potentially interesting link between bFGF-induced growth inhibition in G2 and the DNA damage checkpoint is suggested by studies on the radioprotective effect of bFGF. It has been reported that exogenous bFGF can protect cells from the lethal effects of ionizing radiation (40.Haimovitz-Friedman A. Vlodavsky I. Chaudhuri A. Witte L. Fuks Z. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2552-2558PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Fuks Z. Persaud R.S. Alfieri A. McLoughin M. Ehleiter D. Schwartz J.L. Seddon A.P. Cordon-Cardo C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2582-2590PubMed Google Scholar). This radioprotective effect of bFGF is correlated with a pronounced increase in the duration of the G2 arrest after irradiation (42.Jung M. Kern F.G. Jorgensen T.J. McLeskey S.W. Blair O.C. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5194-6197PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, bFGF expression has been reported to be present in abundant amounts in primary brain tumors, which are known for their poor responsiveness to radiation therapy (43.Takahashi J.A. Mori H. Fukumoto M. Igarashi K. Jaye M. Oda Y. Kikuchi H. Hatanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5710-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Given the effects of bFGF that we describe here, it is a distinct possibility that tumors producing high levels of bFGF respond so poorly to radiotherapy because of the suggested resemblance between DNA damage and bFGF in regulating cdc2 activity. Cells can respond to a variety of extracellular signals, which together dictate cellular behavior including the decision to proliferate, differentiate, or undergo apoptosis (1.Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation is controlled by multiple growth-regulatory pathways that act together to ensure proper cell division. At the late G1restriction point the cell weighs the activity of positive and negative regulatory signals. After passage through the restriction point, mitogenic growth factors are no longer required for cells to complete division, and cells become refractory to growth-inhibitory signals (2.Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar, 3.Laiho M. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massague J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22825-22829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, cells come to rely upon the intrinsic regulators of the cell cycle machinery for orderly progression through the remainder of the cell cycle (2.Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). Orderly progression through the mammalian cell cycle is dependent on the timed activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (5.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Each cell cycle phase is characterized by the presence of distinct cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes (6.Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 79: 547-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Cell cycle control by checkpoints functions through interference with activation of these complexes. For example, for the onset of mitosis the activation of cyclin B-cdc2 complexes is required (7.Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), whereas activation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint results in inhibition of these complexes, leading to an arrest in G2phase progression (8.Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Datta R. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1412-1414PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin B is first synthesized during S phase, and cyclin B-cdc2 complexes continue to accumulate throughout G2. These complexes are held in an inactive state by phosphorylation of cdc2 at Thr-14 and Tyr-15, which is mediated by the Wee1 protein kinases (7.Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,9.King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). At the end of G2, abrupt dephosphorylation of this site by the phosphatase Cdc25C triggers cdc2 activation (9.King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Cyclin B-cdc2 then phosphorylates and thereby further activates Cdc25C, which induces the full activation of cdc2 by forming a positive feedback loop by mutual activation (10.Hoffman I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 11.Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). At the same time, certain sites within the cytoplasmic retention signal in the N terminus of cyclin B are phosphorylated, which allows translocation to the nucleus (12.Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13.Li J. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Upon nuclear translocation, the cyclin B-cdc2 complex can phosphorylate critical substrates required for the initiation of mitosis. Completion of mitosis in turn depends on the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of cyclin B at the metaphase/anaphase transition (14.Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). We have investigated the mechanism of growth inhibition by bFGF1 in SK-N-MC cells, neuroepithelioma cells of embryonic neuroectodermal origin. We find that addition of bFGF delays cell cycle progression through the G2 phase of the cell cycle rather than during G1. This bFGF-induced delay in G2 progression resembles the G2 arrest seen after DNA damage, indicating the existence of a growth factor-sensitive point in G2. DISCUSSIONIn this study we demonstrate that bFGF can induce growth inhibition of SK-N-MC cells by a delay in G2 phase progression, a mechanism that appears similar to the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. We showed that treatment with bFGF increased the doubling time of SK-N-MC cells from â¼20 to â¼30 h, and we demonstrated that cells are delayed in G2/M by about 8 h. This indicates that the major, if not only, growth inhibitory effect of bFGF on SK-N-MC cells is exerted in the G2 phase and makes it unlikely that bFGF affects other cell cycle phases. This is remarkable because it is generally believed that extracellular factors can influence cell cycle progression during G1 and that cells become refractory to growth inhibitory signals after passage through the restriction point (2.Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). Our results clearly indicate that cells can be inhibited by growth inhibitory signals after passage through the restriction point, because the addition of bFGF to cells that are in S phase still results in a delay in G2/M progression of at least 8 h. Indeed, the addition of bFGF up to a point late in G2 still efficiently inhibited mitotic entry (data not shown).In addition to the results obtained with bFGF, stimulation of the Ret signaling pathway using a chimeric human epidermal growth factor receptor-Ret chimera receptor in SK-N-MC cells resulted in growth inhibition that was associated with a delay in G2 phase progression, similar to what is seen after bFGF treatment. 2V. A. J. Smits, M. A. van Peer, M. A. G. Essers, R. Klompmaker, G. Rijksen, and R. H. Medema, manuscript in preparation. These results indicate that this response is not restricted to a single growth factor receptor. Indeed, others have reported minor effects on G2progression by epidermal growth factor. Treatment of Hela and A431 cells with epidermal growth factor resulted in a short delay (1â2 h) in mitotic entry coupled with a delay in activation of cyclin B-cdc2 complexes (29.Kinzel V. Kaszkin M. Blume A. Richards J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7932-7936PubMed Google Scholar). However, in these cells no overall growth inhibition was observed with epidermal growth factor, in contrast to what we see with bFGF in SK-N-MC cells. Therefore, this is the first example of overall growth inhibition by an extracellular factor that appears to be confined to regulation of the G2/M transition. Nevertheless, the data obtained with epidermal growth factor in Hela and A431 cells suggest that negative growth regulation in G2 by extracellular factors might be a more general phenomenon. In addition to the extensively studied G1restriction point, growth regulation in G2 may therefore play an important role in the proliferation of some cells.It will be of interest to study the signaling molecules in the pathway by which bFGF and Ret induce growth inhibition of SK-N-MC cells. It should be noted that van Puijenbroek et al. (18.van Puijenbroek A.A.F.L. van Weering D.H.L. van den Brink C.E. Bos J.L. van der Saag P.T. de Laat S.W. den Hertog J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showed that growth inhibition by bFGF and Ret in these SK-N-MC cells is associated with sustained MAPK activation, whereas platelet-derived growth factor, which does not induce growth inhibition, also activates MAPK but gives rise to only a very transient activation of MAPK in these cells. Several studies support a role for MAPK in regulating progression through G2/M (30.Abrieu A. Fisher D. Simon M.N. Doree M. Picard A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6407-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31.Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Ueki K. Izumi T. Chatani Y. Kohno M. Kasuga M. Yazaki Y. Akanuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20293-20297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but other studies also suggest the involvement of other signaling molecules, for example, protein kinase C (32.Barth H. Kinzel V. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33.Hofmann J. O'Conner P.M. Jackman J. Schubert C. Ueberall F. Kohn K.W. Grunicke H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1994; 199: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34.Livneh E. Fishman D.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 35.Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, using pharmacological inhibitors of MAPK, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and p38 MAPK we have been unable to obtain evidence for a possible involvement of any of these signaling molecules in the observed bFGF-induced growth inhibition (data not shown).A possible mediator of the G2 arrest induced by bFGF is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 waf1. This p53-regulated protein has been described as inhibiting kinase activity of the cyclins E, A, and B, resulting in an arrest in both the G1 and G2phases of the cell cycle (36.Medema R.H. Klompmaker R. Smits V.A.J. Rijksen R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). SK-N-MC cells do not express functional p53 (37.Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), but activation of p21 waf1 expression can also occur independently of p53 (38.Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 39.Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). However, up-regulation of p21 waf1 could not be observed after bFGF treatment (data not shown), indicating that the inhibition of cyclin B kinase activity by bFGF must be due to another mechanism.Because Tyr-15 dephosphorylation is a critical step in the activation of the cyclin B-cdc2 complex, we investigated the effect of bFGF on this dephosphorylation event. We found that cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation, as well as activation of the Cdc25C phosphatase responsible for this dephosphorylation, was inhibited by bFGF. DNA damage also results in the inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation by blocking activation of Cdc25C, thereby leading to an arrest in G2 (8.Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Datta R. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1412-1414PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, caffeine could revert both DNA damage- and bFGF-induced inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation, indicating once more that these two pathways are remarkably similar. Moreover, our finding that caffeine can revert the effect of bFGF on cdc2 dephosphorylation makes it unlikely that the inhibition of cdc2 activation by bFGF is due to an arrest of cell cycle progression at an early point in G2, prior to cdc2 activation. Thus, our data indicate that bFGF directly interferes with the activation of cyclin B-cdc2 to inhibit cell proliferation.Our results suggested that bFGF would interfere with cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation via inhibition of Cdc25C. The inhibition of cdc2 activation induced by DNA damage results from Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of the Ser-216 site of Cdc25C, leading to the inability of Cdc25C to activate cyclin B-cdc2 complexes (23.Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 24.Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H.

Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We showed that expression of Cdc25C mutated on Ser-216 was able to rescue the bFGF-induced inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation (Fig. 5) and restored the cyclin B-cdc2 kinase activity (data not shown). Expression of this mutant, in contrast to wild type Cdc25C, resulted in a rescue of the bFGF-induced G2 delay as demonstrated by a BrdUrd pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 5). This demonstrates that regulation of Cdc25C phosphorylation is a critical factor in the bFGF-induced growth inhibition of SK-N-MC cells. Because we find a partial reversion, we cannot rule out other effects of bFGF during G2/M. Indeed, using a BrdUrd pulse-chase assay we showed that bFGF induced an â¼8 h delay in G2 progression (Fig. 1 C), whereas the mitotic entry was only inhibited for 4â6 h (Fig. 2), which could indicate that bFGF has additional effects on events later in mitosis.Besides Chk1-mediated inhibition of Cdc25C, other pathways are activated after DNA damage to enforce a delay in G2. For example, p53-regulated p21 expression results in a sustained G2 arrest in response to DNA damage (27.Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of the nuclear translocation of cyclin B by DNA damage blocks the access of cyclin B to its mitotic substrates (28.Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We found that expression of Cdc25C-S216A was unable to revert the inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation that occurs in response to the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin (Fig. 5 B), consistent with the existence of parallel pathways. Thus, although certain similarities were observed between the DNA damage response and the effects of bFGF described here, the efficient rescue of bFGF-induced G2arrest seen in cells expressing Cdc25C-S216A mutant indicates that the pathways affected by bFGF are not as diverse as those activated after DNA damage.A potentially interesting link between bFGF-induced growth inhibition in G2 and the DNA damage checkpoint is suggested by studies on the radioprotective effect of bFGF. It has been reported that exogenous bFGF can protect cells from the lethal effects of ionizing radiation (40.Haimovitz-Friedman A. Vlodavsky I. Chaudhuri A. Witte L. Fuks Z. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2552-2558PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Fuks Z. Persaud R.S. Alfieri A. McLoughin M. Ehleiter D. Schwartz J.L. Seddon A.P. Cordon-Cardo C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2582-2590PubMed Google Scholar). This radioprotective effect of bFGF is correlated with a pronounced increase in the duration of the G2 arrest after irradiation (42.Jung M. Kern F.G. Jorgensen T.J. McLeskey S.W. Blair O.C. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5194-6197PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, bFGF expression has been reported to be present in abundant amounts in primary brain tumors, which are known for their poor responsiveness to radiation therapy (43.Takahashi J.A. Mori H. Fukumoto M. Igarashi K. Jaye M. Oda Y. Kikuchi H. Hatanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5710-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Given the effects of bFGF that we describe here, it is a distinct possibility that tumors producing high levels of bFGF respond so poorly to radiotherapy because of the suggested resemblance between DNA damage and bFGF in regulating cdc2 activity. In this study we demonstrate that bFGF can induce growth inhibition of SK-N-MC cells by a delay in G2 phase progression, a mechanism that appears similar to the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. We showed that treatment with bFGF increased the doubling time of SK-N-MC cells from â¼20 to â¼30 h, and we demonstrated that cells are delayed in G2/M by about 8 h.

In addition to the results obtained with bFGF, stimulation of the Ret signaling pathway using a chimeric human epidermal growth factor receptor-Ret chimera receptor in SK-N-MC cells resulted in growth inhibition that was associated with a delay in G2 phase progression, similar to what is seen after bFGF treatment. 2V. A. J. Smits, M. A. van Peer, M. A. G. Essers, R. Klompmaker, G. Rijksen, and R. H. Medema, manuscript in preparation. These results indicate that this response is not restricted to a single growth factor receptor. Indeed, others have reported minor effects on G2progression by epidermal growth factor. Treatment of Hela and A431 cells with epidermal growth factor resulted in a short delay (1â2 h) in mitotic entry coupled with a delay in activation of cyclin B-cdc2 complexes (29.Kinzel V. Kaszkin M. Blume A. Richards J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7932-7936PubMed Google Scholar). However, in these cells no overall growth inhibition was observed with epidermal growth factor, in contrast to what we see with bFGF in SK-N-MC cells. Therefore, this is the first example of overall growth inhibition by an extracellular factor that appears to be confined to regulation of the G2/M transition. Nevertheless, the data obtained with epidermal growth factor in Hela and A431 cells suggest that negative growth regulation in G2 by extracellular factors might be a more general phenomenon. In addition to the extensively studied G1restriction point, growth regulation in G2 may therefore play an important role in the proliferation of some cells. It will be of interest to study the signaling molecules in the pathway by which bFGF and Ret induce growth inhibition of SK-N-MC cells. It should be noted that van Puijenbroek et al. (18.van Puijenbroek A.A.F.L. van Weering D.H.L. van den Brink C.E. Bos J.L. van der Saag P.T. de Laat S.W. den Hertog J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showed that growth inhibition by bFGF and Ret in these SK-N-MC cells is associated with sustained MAPK activation, whereas platelet-derived growth factor, which does not induce growth inhibition, also activates MAPK but gives rise to only a very transient activation of MAPK in these cells. Several studies support a role for MAPK in regulating progression through G2/M (30.Abrieu A. Fisher D. Simon M.N. Doree M. Picard A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6407-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31.Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Ueki K. Izumi T. Chatani Y. Kohno M. Kasuga M. Yazaki Y. Akanuma Y. J. Biol.

Kinzel V. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33.Hofmann J. O'Conner P.M. Jackman J. Schubert C. Ueberall F. Kohn K.W. Grunicke H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, using pharmacological inhibitors of MAPK, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and p38 MAPK we have been unable to obtain evidence for a possible involvement of any of these signaling molecules in the observed bFGF-induced growth inhibition (data not shown). A possible mediator of the G2 arrest induced by bFGF is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 waf1. This p53-regulated protein has been described as inhibiting kinase activity of the cyclins E, A, and B, resulting in an arrest in both the G1 and G2phases of the cell cycle (36.Medema R.H. Klompmaker R. Smits V.A.J. Rijksen R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). SK-N-MC cells do not express functional p53 (37.Moll U.M. Ostermeyer A.G. Haladay R. Winkfield B. Frazier M. Zambetti G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1126-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), but activation of p21 waf1 expression can also occur independently of p53 (38.Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 39.Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). However, up-regulation of p21 waf1 could not be observed after bFGF treatment (data not shown), indicating that the inhibition of cyclin B kinase activity by bFGF must be due to another mechanism. Because Tyr-15 dephosphorylation is a critical step in the activation of the cyclin B-cdc2 complex, we investigated the effect of bFGF on this dephosphorylation event. We found that cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation, as well as activation of the Cdc25C phosphatase responsible for this dephosphorylation, was inhibited by bFGF. DNA damage also results in the inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation by blocking activation of Cdc25C, thereby leading to an arrest in G2 (8.Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Datta R. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1412-1414PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, caffeine could revert both DNA damage- and bFGF-induced inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation, indicating once more that these two pathways are remarkably similar. Moreover, our finding that caffeine can revert the effect of bFGF on cdc2 dephosphorylation makes it unlikely that the inhibition of cdc2 activation by bFGF is due to an arrest of cell cycle progression at an early point in G2, prior to cdc2 activation. Thus, our data indicate that bFGF directly interferes with the activation of cyclin B-cdc2 to inhibit cell proliferation. Our results suggested that bFGF would interfere with cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation via inhibition of Cdc25C. The inhibition of cdc2 activation induced by DNA damage results from Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of the Ser-216 site of Cdc25C, leading to the inability of Cdc25C to activate cyclin B-cdc2 complexes (23.Furnari B. Rhind N. Russell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 24.Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H.

Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We showed that expression of Cdc25C mutated on Ser-216 was able to rescue the bFGF-induced inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation (Fig. 5) and restored the cyclin B-cdc2 kinase activity (data not shown). Expression of this mutant, in contrast to wild type Cdc25C, resulted in a rescue of the bFGF-induced G2 delay as demonstrated by a BrdUrd pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 5). This demonstrates that regulation of Cdc25C phosphorylation is a critical factor in the bFGF-induced growth inhibition of SK-N-MC cells. Because we find a partial reversion, we cannot rule out other effects of bFGF during G2/M. Indeed, using a BrdUrd pulse-chase assay we showed that bFGF induced an â¼8 h delay in G2 progression (Fig. 1 C), whereas the mitotic entry was only inhibited for 4â6 h (Fig. 2), which could indicate that bFGF has additional effects on events later in mitosis. Besides Chk1-mediated inhibition of Cdc25C, other pathways are activated after DNA damage to enforce a delay in G2. For example, p53-regulated p21 expression results in a sustained G2 arrest in response to DNA damage (27.Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of the nuclear translocation of cyclin B by DNA damage blocks the access of cyclin B to its mitotic substrates (28.Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We found that expression of Cdc25C-S216A was unable to revert the inhibition of cdc2-Tyr-15 dephosphorylation that occurs in response to the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin (Fig. 5 B), consistent with the existence of parallel pathways. Thus, although certain similarities were observed between the DNA damage response and the effects of bFGF described here, the efficient rescue of bFGF-induced G2arrest seen in cells expressing Cdc25C-S216A mutant indicates that the pathways affected by bFGF are not as diverse as those activated after DNA damage. A potentially interesting link between bFGF-induced growth inhibition in G2 and the DNA damage checkpoint is suggested by studies on the radioprotective effect of bFGF. It has been reported that exogenous bFGF can protect cells from the lethal effects of ionizing radiation (40.Haimovitz-Friedman A. Vlodavsky I. Chaudhuri A. Witte L. Fuks Z. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2552-2558PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Fuks Z. Persaud R.S. Alfieri A. McLoughin M. Ehleiter D. Schwartz J.L. Seddon A.P. Cordon-Cardo C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2582-2590PubMed Google Scholar). This radioprotective effect of bFGF is correlated with a pronounced increase in the duration of the G2 arrest after irradiation (42.Jung M. Kern F.G. Jorgensen T.J. McLeskey S.W. Blair O.C. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5194-6197PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, bFGF expression has been reported to be present in abundant amounts in primary brain tumors, which are known for their poor responsiveness to radiation therapy (43.Takahashi J.A. Mori H. Fukumoto M. Igarashi K. Jaye M. Oda Y. Kikuchi H. Hatanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5710-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Given the effects of bFGF that we describe here, it is a distinct possibility that tumors producing high levels of bFGF respond so poorly to radiotherapy because of the suggested resemblance between DNA damage and bFGF in regulating cdc2 activity.

One such system that has been well characterized is the morphogenesis of the E. coli bacteriophage Î». The 48-kilobase pair linear double-stranded DNA genome of bacteriophage Î» is contained within an icosahedral head that is assembled with the participation of 10 phage proteins and the Escherichia coli GroEL and GroES proteins. Head morphogenesis initiates with the assembly of the preconnector, a doughnut-shaped structure composed of 12 subunits of uncleaved gene product (gp)1 B, in a reaction that requires the presence of gpNu3, gpGroEL, and gpGroES (1.Murialdo H. Virology. 1979; 96: 341-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This structure then interacts with gpC, and acts as the starting point for the polymerization of 420 molecules of gpE into the head (2.Murialdo H. Becker A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 125: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Next, about three quarters of the gpB molecules are cleaved, all of the gpNu3 is degraded, and each of the gpC molecules participates in a fusion/cleavage reaction with gpE to form the proteins pX1 and pX2. DNA packaging by terminase (made up of gpNu1 and gpA) then occurs, during which time the head expands by approximately 20%, and 420 molecules of gpD are incorporated into the surface lattice (3.Imber R. Tsugita A. Wurtz M. Hohn T. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 277-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Once packaging is complete, gpW interacts with the DNA-filled heads, which allows the incorporation of gpFII and completion of the head. Finally, the tail, which is formed in a separate pathway (for review, see Ref. 4.Katsura I. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 171: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), spontaneously attaches to the completed head to form a mature infectious virion. gpW, the 68-residue head stabilizing protein, has a molecular weight of 7,614, and a calculated pI of 10.8. W â phage produce heads of the same diameter as wild type Î», DNA molecules of monomer length with cohesive ends, and active tails that are capable of efficiently complementing heads from a Jâ infection (5.Casjens S. Hohn T. Kaiser A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 64: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,6.McClure S.C. MacHattie L. Gold M. Virology. 1973; 54: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Katsura and Tsugita (7.Katsura I. Tsugita A. Virology. 1977; 76: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) detected a gpW complementing activity of approximately 10 kDa in guanidine hydrochloride dissociated phage ghosts, suggesting that it is a structural protein, although its precise stoichiometry is unknown. Partially purified gpW has been shown to interact with DNA-filled proheads in vitro after the incorporation of gpD. In the completed virion gpW probably interacts with both gpFII, as incorporation of gpW is necessary before gpFII can act, and some other component of the head. The most likely candidate is gpB, since this forms the portal collar where the tail attaches. The DNA inside heads in W â phage has an increased sensitivity to DNase treatment (8.Perucchetti R. Parris W. Becker A. Gold M. Virology. 1988; 165: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and is more likely to spontaneously come out of the head, suggesting that gpW may play a role either as a structural protein that forms a plug at the portal prohead vertex, or as a DNA-binding protein that interacts directly with the right end of the Î» DNA molecule, which protrudes into the tail in fully assembled phage. The multiple roles played by gpW, despite its small size, make it an attractive subject for detailed in vitro studies. Here we show that large amounts of active gpW can be easily purified using N- or C-terminal hexahistidine tags and that these tagged proteins display reversible two-state unfolding behavior indistinguishable from the untagged protein. Furthermore, we show that the three C-terminal residues of gpW are crucial for in vitro activity, but not for thermodynamic stability. Gene W was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from bacteriophage Î» DNA. Residues 1â68 were cloned into the expression vector pET21d (Novagen), which contains a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, in such a way that the second residue was changed from Thr to Val, and 16 extra residues encoding the FLAG epitope (9.Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar) and hexahistidine sequence used for protein purification (RLDYKDDDDK- His6) were fused to the C terminus. Changing the second residue from Thr to Val was considered a conservative mutation as Val is observed at this position in gene3 from the closely related bacteriophage 21 (10). An N-terminal tagged fusion construct was also created, which has a native C terminus, and 25 additional residues (HIS6-DYDIPTTENLYFQâG) fused to the N terminus that encode the hexahistidine tag used for purification of the protein, a protease cleavage site, and a 7-residue linker (Life Technologies, Inc.). The protease that cleaves this tag is isolated from the tobacco etch virus (TEV) and specifically cleaves the sequence Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln*Gly, leaving a single Gly fused to the N terminus. This vector also has the T2V substitution. Mutations were introduced into the N-terminal tagged vector by polymerase chain reaction-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using VentÂ®DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The DNA sequences of the wild type and mutant constructs used in this study were verified using the SequenaseÂ® version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). All proteins were expressed in the E. coli strain KM1502, a derivative of GJ1158 (11.Bhandari P. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4403-4406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the genotype of which is ompT hsdS gal dcmÎmalAp510 malP:: (proUp-T7 RNAP)malQ::lacZhyb11 Î(zhf-900::Tn10dTet) ÎslyD (kan r). This strain contains the gene for T7 RNA polymerase under the control of a salt-inducible promoter, and the slyD deletion, which prevents the expression of a 21-kDa histidine-rich E. coli protein that binds strongly to the nickel affinity resin used in this purification. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 200 mmNaCl to a culture with an optical density at 600 nm of approximately 1.0, followed by incubation at 37 Â°C for an additional 3 h. Unstable gpW mutants that were quickly degraded in KM1502 were expressed in the E. coli strain SG1146A (12.Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), and induced with 200 Î¼g/ml isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 Â°C. The cells were harvested and lysed in 6m GdnHCl, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and purified in the same buffer via batch method using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen). The pure proteins were eluted with 6 m GdnHCl, 0.2m acetic acid, and were refolded by dialysis into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl. All other experiments described in this work were performed in this buffer. After dialysis of the N-terminal tagged protein, TEV cleavage was performed according to the manufacturer's directions (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the proteins were loaded onto a second nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column in the TEV buffer, and were shaken at 4 Â°C for 1 h. The TEV protease is 6-His-tagged, so the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin binds the TEV protease, any uncleaved gpW(NT), and the cleaved 6-His tag. The unbound protein was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mmEDTA and was loaded onto an FPLC MonoS column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl was run, with the major protein peak eluting at 0.4 m NaCl. All proteins were determined to be greater than 98% pure by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining, and their concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 4500mâ1 cmâ1for gpW(CT), 9000 mâ1cmâ1 for gpW(NT), and 3000mâ1 cmâ1for gpW(+G). Extinction coefficients were calculated from the number of tyrosine residues present in each construct (13.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). Crude extracts of gpW(NT)-containing cells were prepared by sonication of cells resuspended in our standard buffer. The extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min to remove insoluble protein. Thermal and chemical denaturation experiments were performed in an Aviv 62A DS circular dichroism spectrometer. Fractional helicity of gpW(+G) in buffer was calculated by the formula ([Î¸222] + 2340)/30,300 (14.Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation was monitored by measuring the CD signal at 222 nm in a 0.1-cm cuvette on samples with protein concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 Î¼m. The proteins were heated from 25 Â°C to 109 Â°C in 2 Â°C increments, with a 1-min equilibration time and a 15-s averaging time for the CD measurement. Near UV denaturation experiments were performed in a 1-cm cuvette, monitoring the change in signal at 280 nm. The equilibration time was increased to 2 min, and the other parameters were unchanged. Urea denaturation experiments were carried out in a 1-cm cuvette using a Microlab 500 series automated titrator, and the software program IgorProâ¢. A 4 Î¼m protein solution in buffer was mixed in stepwise fashion into a 4 Î¼m protein solution in a high concentration of urea (8.5â9.0 m) at 25 Â°C. After each injection, the sample was mixed for 60 s, and the CD measurement at 225 nm was averaged over 30 s. Both thermal and urea denaturation curves were completely reversible under all conditions. These data were fit to the standard thermodynamic equations for a monomeric protein. A minimum of five thermal and three urea denaturation experiments were performed on each of the wild type constructs. The average error associated with these experiments was 0.7 Â°C and 0.24 kcal/mol, respectively. The change in heat capacity upon unfolding (ÎCp) of gpW(NT) was determined according to the method of Pace and Laurent (15.Pace C.N. Laurents D.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2520-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Averaged ÎGu values determined from the thermal unfolding transition zone of two temperature melts, as well 10 ÎGu values determined by performing urea denaturation experiments at temperatures between 15 Â°C and 35 Â°C were used to determine ÎGu values over a range of temperatures. A plot of ÎGuversus temperature was fit using the following equation, where ÎG(T) is the ÎG at a temperature T, Tm is the midpoint of the thermal denaturation curve, ÎHm is the unfolding enthalpy measured at the Tm , and ÎCp is the change in heat capacity upon unfolding (15.Pace C.N. Laurents D.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2520-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). ÎG(T)=ÎHm(1âT/Tm)âÎCp[TmâT)+T ln(T/Tm)]Equation 1 Fitting was performed using Kaleidagraph with ÎCp as the only free parameter. TheTm and ÎHm values used were 72.4 Â°C and 36.4 kcal/mol, respectively, as averaged from the manual fitting of two temperature-induced unfolding curves of gpW(NT) by the method of Breslauer (28.Breslauer K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 221-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation experiments were performed at 20 Â°C in a Beckman model XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with UV-visible absorbance optics. Samples of gpW(CT) at concentrations of 40, 100, and 300 Î¼m in buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl) were centrifuged at 25,000, 29,000, and 30,000 rpm until equilibrium was reached at each speed, and the absorption profiles at the appropriate wavelength were then recorded. The oligomerization state of gpW(NT) was also examined by equilibrium centrifugation. This protein was examined at a single concentration, 20 Î¼m, as at lower concentrations the scatter in the measurement was too high, and at higher concentrations the protein began to aggregate in the cuvette. Data were collected at 25,000, 30,000, and 35,000 rpm. The molecular weights of the proteins were calculated by fitting the resulting data sets using non-linear least squares regression (using the program Kaleidagraph) to Equation2. A=A(0)expÂ·[Ï2Mr(1âÎ½Ï)(r2âr(0) 2)/2RT]Equation 2 A is the absorbance at 280 nm at radius r,A(0) is the absorbance at 280 nm at reference radiusr(0), R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, Ï is the buffer density, Î½ is the partial specific volume of the protein calculated from the amino acid composition, Ï is the angular velocity, and M r is the molecular weight of the protein. The partial specific volumes as calculated from the amino acid compositions of gpW(CT) and gpW(NT) were 0.7030 cm3gâ2 and 0.7115 cm3gâ2, respectively, and the solution density was measured to be 1.011 g/ml. Gel filtration chromatography was performed at room temperature by FPLC on a 25-ml Superdex-75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) calibrated with bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), lysozyme (14 kDa), and insulin (3.5 kDa). The column was washed with two volumes of buffer with a 1 ml/min flow rate. A 2 mm sample of gpW(CT) was loaded on the column and eluted at 1 ml/min, using absorbance at 280 nm to detect protein. Virion extracts lacking gpW were prepared from the lysogenic E. coli strain 594(Î»Wam 403cI857Sam 7). 50 ml of LB was inoculated with 1 ml of overnight culture, and the cells were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of approximately 0.4, heat-induced at 45 Â°C for 15 min, and then grown 1 h at 37 Â°C. At the end of the induction period, the cells were collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 1 ml of RRM buffer (16.8 mm NH4Cl, 0.9 mm MgSO4, 18 mm KCl, 2.7 Î¼m FeCl3, 44.5 mm Na2HPO4, 19.8 mmKH2PO4, 0.25 mm CaCl2, 0.36% d-maltose, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Î²-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm putrescine) and 150 Î¼l of chloroform to induce lysis of the cells. Cellular debris was collected by centrifuging the tubes for 5 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 Â°C, and the upper aqueous phase was collected and stored at â80 Â°C. Equal volumes of acceptor extract and purified gpW at known concentrations were mixed in an Eppendorf tube and incubated at 37 Â°C for 1 h, then placed on ice, and serial dilutions of the reaction were titered for plaque-forming units on the indicator strain QD5003 (16.Yanofsky C. Ito J. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 21: 313-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The WT protein activity assays were repeated at least five times, and the results averaged. Each mutant assay was repeated at least twice, and, as the number of pfu/ml is dependent on the preparation and age of the extract used, wild type protein was assayed each time as a control. The wild type activity was then used to normalize the activities of the mutant gpW proteins. Repetitions of the activity assays for the mutant gpW proteins resulted in an average error of Â±30%. The sequence of gpW is shown in Fig. 1 A, aligned with homologous proteins from phage 21 (gene 3) and bacteriophage N15 (gene 3), which share sequence identity with gpW of 48% and 85%, respectively. This three sequence alignment was subjected to the PHD algorithm (17.Rost B. Sander C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), which uses multiple-sequence alignments to predict secondary structure. The 68-residue protein was predicted to have two Î±-helical regions, spanning residues 3â18 and 40â53, and two Î²-strands from residues 22â27 and residues 32â36. gpW has been previously purified in our laboratory from an overexpression vector, but the protocol is labor-intensive. 2H. Murialdo and M. Gold, unpublished results. As we wish to characterize a number of mutant forms of gpW to elucidate its structure and activities, a faster, more efficient protocol was required. For this reason, we constructed a vector to produce gpW fused to a polyhistidine sequence to allow rapid purification with nickel affinity chromatography. Using this construct, gpW was purified with an N-terminal 6-His tag that was subsequently removed by cleavage with TEV protease, leaving only one extra Gly residue at the N terminus of the protein (Fig. 1 B). A purified preparation of this protein, which was named gpW(+G), displayed a high level of activity in an in vitro assay of gpW function. Since its level of activity was similar to that observed with untagged wild type gpW (data not shown), we concluded that this purification strategy would provide an effective means to study gpW structure and function. Surprisingly, the uncleaved 6-His-tagged construct, gpW(NT), displayed equivalent activity to gpW(+G), even though it possesses 25 extra residues fused to its N terminus (Table I). Since gpW(NT) could be produced even more easily than gpW(+G), further functional studies were performed with this protein.Table ICharacterization of the three WT gpW constructsConstructT mÎG umIn vitro activity at (pfu/ml) protein concentration5 Î¼m15 Î¼mÂ°Ckcal/molkcal mol â1 m â1pfu/mlgpW(CT)71.6 Â± 0.4 aAveraged from seven experiments performed at protein concentrations of 10â300 Î¼m.2.91 Â± 0.11 cAveraged from three experiments at 10â50 Î¼m.647 Â± 258.5 Ã 1031.0 Ã 107gpW(NT)71.8 Â± 0.7 bAveraged from five experiments at 10â50 Î¼m.3.27 Â± 0.00 cAveraged from three experiments at 10â50 Î¼m.687 Â± 175.0 Ã 1088.0 Ã 108gpW(+G)70.8 Â± 0.7 bAveraged from five experiments at 10â50 Î¼m.2.77 Â± 0.11 cAveraged from three experiments at 10â50 Î¼m.648 Â± 425.0 Ã 1088.0 Ã 108Average71.5 Â± 0.73.01 Â± 0.24662 Â± 305.0 Ã 108 dAveraged from the N-terminal tagged constructs only.8.0 Ã 108 dAveraged from the N-terminal tagged constructs only.a Averaged from seven experiments performed at protein concentrations of 10â300 Î¼m.b Averaged from five experiments at 10â50 Î¼m.c Averaged from three experiments at 10â50 Î¼m.d Averaged from the N-terminal tagged constructs only. Open table in a new tab The reaction kinetics and concentration dependence of the gpW-mediatedin vitro reaction were studied in more detail. Fig.2 A shows that the maximal yield of phage is observed within 12 min of incubation of purified gpW with the extract, while an increase of 4 orders of magnitude is observed in only 2 min. In Fig. 2 B it can be seen that, as the concentration of gpW increases, the number of pfu produced increases in a logarithmic fashion, reaching a plateau at a concentration of 10 Î¼m protein. To ensure that the concentration of gpW was truly limiting when gpW was present at low concentrations, and that the results observed were not due to the phage components becoming inactivated before the reaction had time to proceed to completion, we added more phage extract to reaction mixtures after they had been incubated for 1 h (data not shown). When extra phage extract was added to reactions in which gpW was under limiting conditions (i.e. <10 Î¼m gpW), no increase in the number of phage particles produced was observed. Conversely, when extra phage extract was added to the reactions in which gpW was in excess (>10 Î¼m gpW), there was an increase in the number of phage produced. To ensure that the protein purification performed under denaturing conditions was not inactivating a large percentage of the molecules in our gpW preparations, we performed packaging assays on crude E. coli extracts containing gpW(NT). gpW(NT) was found predominantly in the soluble fraction of these extracts. E. coli cells expressing gpW(NT) were diluted and assayed for in vitroactivity. The intensity of the Coomassie Blue-stained band corresponding to gpW(NT) in the extract, as visualized by SDS-PAGE, was compared with known concentrations of purified gpW(NT) to estimate the concentration. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the level of activity in the crude gpW(NT) extract and its concentration dependence was identical to that of the purified gpW(NT), demonstrating that the purification protocol is not inactivating the protein. To assess whether the C terminus of gpW could also be tagged, we created a second construct, gpW(CT), which encodes full-length gpW fused to the FLAG epitope and six histidines (Fig. 1 B). This tag had previously been found to affect neither the structure or function of another protein studied in our laboratory (18.Maxwell K.L. Davidson A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16172-16182Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the in vitro activity of gpW(CT) was decreased by 80-fold compared with gpW(NT) (Table I) and its activity reached a plateau at 1.0 Ã 107 pfu/ml, even at protein concentrations as high as 170 Î¼m. Although gpW(CT) is not as active as the N-terminal tagged constructs, it is soluble at protein concentrations as high as 2 mm, while gpW(+G) and gpW(NT) are soluble only to concentrations of approximately 40 Î¼m. The high order dependence of the gpW-mediated assembly reaction on protein concentration (Fig. 2 B) implies that multiple copies of gpW are required for the production of one phage particle. For this reason, we hypothesized that gpW may be required to oligomerize for its assembly into phage, as do many structural proteins in viruses. To address this issue, analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were used to determine whether gpW exists as a multimer in solution. Both gpW(CT) and gpW(NT) were used for these experiments. Although gpW(CT) is somewhat less active than the N-terminally tagged gpW constructs, it possesses high solubility allowing native molecular weight to be determined at a wide range of protein concentrations. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at protein concentrations of 40, 100, and 300 Î¼m (Fig.3 A). When the data from these experiments were fitted as a single species, a molecular weight of 9,235 Â± 299 was calculated. The actual molecular weight of the monomer calculated from its amino acid sequence is 9,436, a deviation of only 2%. These experiments demonstrate that gpW(CT) remains monomeric even at concentrations 20-fold higher than that used in thein vitro gpW assay. Furthermore, gel filtration experiments confirmed that gpW(CT) exists in solution as a monomer at concentrations as high as 2 mm (data not shown). Since gpW(CT) is not fully active, we also determined the native molecular weight of gpW(NT). These experiments could be performed only at low protein concentration (20 Î¼m) due to the low solubility of this construct. When the data were fit as a single species, a molecular weight of 10,738 Â± 132 was calculated (Fig.3 B). The expected molecular weight of a gpW(NT) monomer is 10,707, showing that gpW(NT) is monomeric at 20 Î¼m, which is higher than the concentration required for maximal specific activity in the in vivo assay. These results imply that gpW activity does not require prior oligomerization of the protein. To determine whether the N- or C-terminal tags had any effect on the structure or stability of gpW, circular dichroism (CD) studies were undertaken. The far UV folded spectrum of gpW(+G) is typical of a helical protein (Fig.4 A), with minima observed at 222 and 208 nm. Identical spectra were observed for gpW(NT), gpW(+G), and gpW(CT), suggesting that all three assume the same structure with no contribution from the affinity tags (data not shown). Near UV CD spectra were also collected for gpW(CT). As the signal in the near UV region is much weaker than far UV gpW(CT) was the only protein that was soluble enough to be examined by this technique. gpW(CT) displays significant near UV protein spectrum, with a single maximum observed at 280 nm (Fig. 4 B). Since a large difference was seen between its folded and unfolded spectra (Fig. 4, A and B), CD provided a means to monitor gpW unfolding. All three tagged gpW variants showed fully reversible thermal denaturation curves that were independent of protein concentration (Fig. 5 A). The three proteins displayed almost identical transition midpoint temperature (Tm) values, which averaged to 71.5 Â°C. Additionally, the thermal denaturation of gpW(CT) following both near and far UV CD signal gives identical curves (Fig.5 A), illustrating that the thermal unfolding transition is independent of the monitoring method. To fully analyze the data from the thermal melts, the molar heat capacity change upon unfolding (ÎCp) was determined using the method of Pace and Laurents (15.Pace C.N. Laurents D.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2520-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For this purpose, eight urea melts were performed at various temperatures between 15 Â°C and 35 Â°C. The ÎGu values calculated from these melts were plotted and fit in combination with ÎGu values calculated from the transition regions of thermal denaturation experiments (Fig. 6). A ÎCp value of 0.570 kcal molâ1 Kâ1 was derived by fitting of this curve.Figure 6ÎG u versus temperature plot for gpW(NT). These data were gathered from the unfolding free energies calculated in the transition zone of a thermal melt (â), as well as eight urea denaturation experiments (â) performed at various temperatures between 15 and 35 Â°C. Fitting of this curve as described under âExperimental Proceduresâ yielded a ÎCp of 0.570 kcal molâ1Kâ1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Urea-induced denaturation curves were obtained for each of the tagged gpW constructs, and in each case a single transition between the folded and unfolded states was observed (Fig. 5 B). The free energy of unfolding in water (ÎGu) and the dependence of the free energy of unfolding on urea concentration (m) were found to be independent of protein concentration (data not shown) and were similar for each of the wild type tagged proteins (Table I), giving average values of 3.01 kcal molâ1 and 0.66 kcal molâ1mâ1 respectively. All thermodynamic data were fitted with the assumption, based on the native molecular weight determination described above, that gpW folds and unfolds as a monomer. The conclusion that gpW folds as a monomer is also supported by the observation that its stability, as measured by thermal and chemical denaturation, was independent of protein concentration. Since gpW(CT) was less active than both untagged and N-terminal tagged gpW, we postulated that the C terminus may be important for protein function. To further investigate the role of the C terminus in gpW stability and function, each of the last three positions of gpW(NT) were replaced with several different amino acids and an amber codon. The mutant proteins were subsequently purified and characterized. Each variant displayed the same CD spectrum as WT (data not shown), and retained WT thermal stability (Table II), indicating that no large structural rearrangements occurred"
