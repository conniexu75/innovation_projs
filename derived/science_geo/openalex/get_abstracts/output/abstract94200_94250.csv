https://openalex.org/W2170931103,"Calmodulin levels are elevated twofold at late G1 and/or early S phases during the growth cycle of CHO-K1 cells. These levels are maintained throughout the remainder of the cell cycle unit cytokinesis. The G1 daughter cells then contain half the intracellular calmodulin level found prior to cell division. Elevation of calmodulin at the G1-S boundary is independent of the length of G1, and the increase in calmodulin appears to be related to progression into S phase. The importance of calmodulin for G1-S progression is suggested by the ability of the anticalmodulin drug W13 to elicit specific and reversible progression delays into and through S phase."

Leukotriene C was 600 to 9500 times more potent than histamine on a molar basis in producing an equivalent decrement in the residual volume. The leukotriene C response was slow in onset and prolonged, reminiscent of the effects of aerosol allergen challenge in asthmatic allergic subjects."
https://openalex.org/W1993937892,"The DNA in a eucaryotic nucleus is arranged into a series of supercoiled loops that are anchored at their bases to the nuclear matrix. Using nuclease digestion, one can progressively cleave DNA from the loops, thereby isolating residual DNA that is progressively closer to the nuclear matrix anchorage sites. We have determined that the ovalbumin gene is preferentially associated with the nuclear matrix of chicken oviduct cells, but is not preferentially associated with the nuclear matrix of chicken liver cells. As a control, the beta-globin gene, which is not transcribed in oviduct cells, was found not to be preferentially associated with the oviduct nuclear matrix. The observation that the transcriptionally active ovalbumin gene is preferentially associated with the nuclear matrix may have significant implications for gene expression and the organization of nuclear DNA into supercoiled-loop domains."

In illuminated, structured visual localization and pointing are accurate but errors in auditory-to-visual matches remain. Defects in extraretinal eye position information are responsible for all errors. The influence of extraretinal eye position information on visual localization is suppressed by a structured visual field but is crucial both in darkness and for intersensory localization if visual capture is prevented."

https://openalex.org/W2056566990,X-ray diffraction and capacitance measurements have been used to calculate the depth to which water penetrates in fully hydrated bacterial phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers in the presence and absence of cholesterol. The data indicate that cholesterol decreases in depth of water penetration by about 2.5 angstroms.
https://openalex.org/W2068261356,"The respiratory tract epithelium of dogs, from the nose to the lungs, was examined for cytochrome P-450 and associated biotransformation activities. In the ethmoturbinates, where olfactory epithelium is located, the amount of cytochrome P-450 was comparable to that in the liver, when measured on the basis of activity per milligram of microsomal protein. The rest of the nasal region also contained large quantities of cytochrome P-450. The presence of these enzymes in the nose may be important in chemical-induced tumorigenesis. The nasal carcinogen hexamethyl-phosphoramide was shown to be metabolized by nasal microsomal enzymes to another nasal carcinogen, formaldehyde."
https://openalex.org/W2072458000,A genetic map of 31 biochemical loci located on 17 feline syntenic (linkage) groups has been derived by somatic cell genetic analysis of cat-rodent hybrids. Most of these syntenic groups have been assigned to one of the 19 feline chromosomes. Comparative linkage analysis of the feline biochemical loci and homologous human loci revealed considerable conservation of linkage associations between the primates and the Felidae (order Carnivora). Many of these same linkage groups have not been conserved in the murine genome. The genetic and evolutionary implications of comparative mapping analysis among mammalian species are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1560732693,"Endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) is a neural-derived mitogen capable of stimulating the proliferation of quiescent populations of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUV-EC). ECGF has been isolated from bovine hypothalamus in two forms: a high molecular weight from (high Mr ECGF, greater than 70,000) and a low molecular weight form form (low Mr ECGF, 17,000 to 25,000). Isoelectric focusing of high Mr ECGF and low Mr ECGF revealed that both Mr forms possess similar anionic isoelectric points (pI 4 to 6). High Mr ECGF can be converted into low Mr ECGF by mild acidification of the high Mr ECGF complex. Low Mr ECGF prepared by the high Mr to low Mr transition procedure is biologically active at 100 ng/ml in the low density HUV-EC growth assay and is capable of stimulating DNA synthesis in Balb/c 3T3 cells at 10 ng/ml. The two Mr forms of ECGF are related since they (i) share similar biological activity, (ii) possess similar isoelectric points, and (iii) high Mr ECGF can be converted into low Mr ECGF by mild treatment with acetic acid. Furthermore, the high Mr and low Mr forms of ECGF are not related to the cationic bovine brain fibroblast growth factor."

https://openalex.org/W2041222191,"We show, using a simple, rapid fractionation method, that the precursor to the filamentous phage major coat protein is an integral membrane protein. The method, which consists of treatment of Escherichia coli with 0.1 N NaOH followed by centrifugation, leaves a subset of inner and outer membrane proteins in the NaOH pellet. Most proteins partition into the NaOH pellet (membrane) or supernatant (cytoplasm and periplasm) in a manner consistent with their subcellular location as determined by more conventional techniques. We find no evidence for cytoplasmic filamentous phage pre-coat protein in either wild-type of mutant-infected cells. Our evidence suggests that a protein identified as ""soluble procoat"" by K. Ito, G. Mandell and W. Wickner may be the amber fragment of a different phage protein."
https://openalex.org/W1565659772,"The bovine uterus, like other estrogen-responsive organs of man and rat, synthesizes an unusual nonpolar metabolite of estradiol (Schatz, F., and Hochberg, R. B. (1981) Endocrinology 109, 697-703). This compound, the lipoidal derivative of estradiol (LE2), was synthesized from estradiol by bovine endometrial tissue in vitro, and it was purified by extensive chromatography on two adsorption columns, a reversed phase partition celite column and three different high pressure liquid chromatography columns. LE2 was separated into nine fractions which were analyzed by direct probe mass spectroscopy and by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy after cleavage of the lipoidal moieties. In this manner, 10 fatty acid esters of estradiol, exclusively esterified at C-17 of the steroid nucleus, were identified. The unsaturated fatty acid esters of estradiol comprise more than 85% of the total LE2 and estradiol 17 beta-arachidonate is the most abundant component. The cholesterol esters and phospholipids of the bovine endometrium were also purified and it was found that the distribution of fatty acids in these lipids is far different from that of LE2."
https://openalex.org/W1537153258,"Plasma lipoproteins with hydrated densities less than 1.063 g/ml, very low density, intermediate density, and low density lipoproteins, suppress mitogen-activated inductive biochemical events in lymphocytes. The ability of these lipoproteins to inhibit phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-enhanced incorporation of 32P into lymphocyte phospholipids correlates directly with the amount of associated apoprotein E (apo-E). Apo-E purified from the very low density lipoproteins of subjects with Types III, IV, and V hyperlipoproteinemia also inhibits PHA-induced 32P-phospholipid formation. With all of the apo-E preparations, 50% suppression occurs at approximately 2-4 microgram/ml and 100% suppression at 4-10 microgram/ml. Moreover, delipidated apo-E is an inhibitory as apo-E complexed with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine or with sphingomyelin. Other apoproteins, apo-AI, -AII, -CI, and -CIII, do not inhibit PHA-activated phospholipid turnover, indicating that suppression is due to a specific structural feature of apo-E. Suppression by apo-E is not due to a shift in the optimum concentration of PHA, nor is it the result of competition with PHA for mitogen receptors at the cell surface. These data, taken together with the results of previous studies (Hui, D. Y., and Harmony, J. A. K. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 4764-4768; Hui, D. Y., Harmony, J. A. K. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11775-11781), indicate that lipoprotein-associated apo-E serves as a recognition determinant for lymphocyte surface receptors and as a suppressive lipoprotein constituent."

https://openalex.org/W1525654309,"We have identified and purified TH3, a germ cell-specific histone. It has been characterized by amino acid analysis, tryptic peptide mapping, labeling with cystine, and by electrophoretic mobility as a variant of H3. On fully reduced Triton/acid/urea gels its mobility is retarded more than that of the somatic variants H3.2 and H3.3, but less than that of H3.1; it migrates between the H2As and H1s. Germinal cells from adult and sexually immature testes were purified by centrifugal elutriation followed by Percoll density gradient separation in order to study the distribution and synthesis of TH3. TH3 is found in significant levels in spermatogonia and in similar or slightly higher amounts in spermatocytes and round spermatids. The synthesis of TH3 takes place in the spermatogonia but not in spermatocytes, in contrast to the other testis-specific histones, TH2A, H1t, and TH2B. Therefore, TH3 may have a different role in spermatogenesis than do the other testis-specific histone variants."
https://openalex.org/W1965092010,"The biosynthesis of the erythrocyte anion transport protein, Band III (molecular weight 100,000), is of interest, as its NH2-terminal half is hydrophilic and faces the cytoplasmic surface, and its COOH-terminal half spans the phospholipid bilayer several times. To investigate the problem of insertion of Band III into membranes, we used erythroid precursor cells from the spleens of anemic mice as a source of messenger RNA for in vitro studies in the wheat germ and reticulocyte lysate cell-free system containing dog pancreatic microsomes. Immediately after synthesis, Band III was found to be inserted into intracellular membranes in its mature configuration, with the NH2-terminal portion exposed to the cytoplasm and its hydrophobic COOH-terminal portion spanning the lipid bilayer. The newly synthesized Band III was provided with a high mannose asparagine-linked oligosaccharide, which was sensitive to cleavage by endoglycosidase H; this is presumably the precursor of the very large and complex oligosaccharide found on the finished molecule. Band III was found to insert into dog pancreatic microsomes in a cotranslational manner; in synchronized translation studies microsomes could be added as late as the time when the hydrophilic NH2-terminal half of the protein had been synthesized and still allow normal transmembrane insertion and glycosylation. There is no cleavage of any NH2-terminal peptide during membrane insertion. The results suggest that Band III contains a sequence near the middle of the protein that directs its insertion into endopiasmic reticulum membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1603728184,"The activity of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase is affected in several ways depending on substrate concentrations and pH. At ph 6.5 and below, both oxidative deamination and reductive amination reactions are inhibited by ADP. At pH 7.0 and above both activatory and inhibitory effects can be observed depending on substrate concentrations. The effects are explicable in terms of a model with ADP binding at both a regulatory site and competing with coenzyme at the active site. The activatory effects of ADP result from destabilization of various abortive complexes by ADP binding to its regulatory site. The concerted effects of pH and ADP lead to a potentiation of either activation effects or inhibition effects depending on conditions. A consideration of in vivo concentrations of the various substrates involved and intramitochondrial pH and adenine nucleotide levels suggests that in vivo the reductive amination reaction is favored. It is suggested that glutamate dehydrogenase may be intimately involved with regulation of the urea cycle by responding to changes in the mitochondrial ammonia levels."

After purification by ion exchange and gel chromatography, it has a Mr of 70 x 10(3) and it does not form aggregates with hyaluronic acid. It contains about 60% protein, one chain of dermatan sulfate, and several oligosaccharide chains. The dermatan sulfate is high in iduronic acid (85% of the uronic acid) and there are no chains of chondroitin sulfate present. The oligosaccharides contain glucosamine, sialic acid, and neutral sugars."
https://openalex.org/W1519865990,"The self-assembly of tubulin devoid of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) has been studied using a MES buffer containing dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Between 6% and 12% v/v Me2SO, the tubulin forms polymers which resemble microtubules in their morphology and chemical properties. These Me2SO microtubules, like normal microtubules, require GTP for assembly and are sensitive to cold, calcium ions, colchicine, and hydrostatic pressure. The polymerization shows a critical concentration which is dependent on the concentration of Me2SO. 8% Me2SO was found to be the optimum concentration for microtubule assembly. In these conditions, a linear Van t'Hoff plot is obtained, with delta H0/kJ . mol-1 = 26.5 over the range of 10-35 degrees C, and delta S0/J . K-1 . mol-1 = 186, in contrast to the assembly with MAPS or glycerol. The kinetics of polymerization shows that the apparent stoichiometry coefficient of nucleation has the value of 2. Ultracentrifugation analysis shows that there are no oligomers present at low temperatures in the absence of free nucleotide, while in identical conditions, tubulin with MAPs does form oligomers. Although the solvent conditions used supported propagation of assembly, nucleation was found to be very dependent on the transiently locally high Me2SO concentrations formed when Me2SO was added to initiate assembly. It is concluded that Me2SO preferentially stabilizes the lateral interactions."

Other neurons appear to be unaffected by this treatment, including those that contain another monoamine neurotransmitter, dopamine. Embryos with ablations continue to develop into juvenile leeches, but as juveniles they are unable to make normal swimming movements. However, normal swimming movements can be instated in such leeches by injecting them with serotonin."

https://openalex.org/W1577202285,"The enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase has been purified from chicken liver mitochondria. This purification includes a pseudo-affinity column step utilizing Sepharose 4B-blue dextran which binds the enzyme. The enzyme elutes with ITP to yield protein which is greater than 98% pure. The enzyme has Mr = 75,400 +/- 200 estimated by high speed sedimentation equilibrium and 70,500 +/- 500 estimated by reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The enzyme is abnormally retarded on molecular exclusion resins yielding low apparent molecular weight values. The amino acid analysis indicates that the enzyme has a high proline content and a high tryptophan content and contains 9 mol of cysteine/mol of enzyme. No disulfide bonds were detected. The extinction coefficient (epsilon 1% 280 = 16.5 +/- 0.1) reflects the high tryptophan content. The Svedberg coefficient (s20,w = 4.63 +/- 0.03 S) is consistent with a globular protein of Mr = 70,500-75,400. The activation of the enzyme was investigated by steady state kinetics. The carboxylation reaction has an activation energy of 17.6 kcal/mol. There is no requirement of a monovalent cation for activity. A thiol is necessary for maximal activity, although apparently not to reduce disulfide bonds within the enzyme. Incubation with dithiothreitol stabilizes enzymatic activity but beta-mercaptoethanol facilitates loss of activity. The kinetics of activation by Mn2+ was performed. The Ks value for phosphoenolpyruvate (300 microM) decreases to an apparent Km of 67 microM with increasing concentrations of Mn2+. The concentration of Mn2+ does not affect the interaction of HCO-3 with the enzyme, however. Analysis of data in terms of free IDP indicates that increasing Mn2+ decreases the Km of IDP but analysis as MnIDP indicates the Km,app of MnIDP is independent of the Mn2+ concentration. The enzyme interacts with Mn2+ with a KA = 67 microM and the Km,app decreases to a value of 8 microM with saturating substrates. The substrate analogue (Z)-3-fluorophosphoenolpyruvate is a good substrate for the reaction (Km = 30 microM) with 27% Vmax compared to P-enolpyruvate (Km = 180 microM). Except for 3-bromophosphoenolpyruvate, other analogues have shown weak competitive or noncompetitive inhibition. Potential analogues of oxalacetate (succinate, citrate, isocitrate, malate, and alpha-ketoglutarate) all elicit weak (greater than 15 mM) inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1567449935,"The heparin-catalyzed inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin was examined using saturation kinetics and fractional reaction lifetimes. Based solely on kinetic analysis, the reaction binding sequence was determined to be heparin binding to antithrombin followed by binding of thrombin. Under readily accessible experimental conditions, the rate-determining step was zero order with respect to thrombin and varied from first order to zero order with respect to antithrombin as the concentration of antithrombin was increased. A saturation kinetics model was used to estimate a Km of 12 x 10(-8) M for formation of the kinetically active heparin-antithrombin complex, a kcat of 0.16 s-1 for the rate-limiting step, and an overall rate constant of 13.3 x 10(7) M-1 . s-1 for heparin-antithrombin interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1515161041,"A population of membrane vesicles derived from platelet-dense granules was isolated from platelet osmotic lysates by density gradient centrifugation. The preparation is relatively free from contamination by mitochondrial and soluble enzymatic activities and contains only traces of serotonin and adenine nucleotides, but retains significant amounts of Na+-dependent serotonin transport (plasma membrane) activity. In the presence of ATP and in the absence of Na+, these vesicles accumulate serotonin to intravesicular concentrations over 100 times that of the medium. Transport is a saturable process (Km = 1.15 microM) inhibited by reserpine, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, ammonia, and nigericin (in the presence of external potassium), but not by imipramine. When diluted into assay medium at pH 8.5, the interior of these vesicles remains relatively acidic. Addition of ATP further induced generation of a membrane potential (interior positive). The vesicles accumulate maximal concentrations of serotonin only when the vesicle interior is both acidic and positive with respect to the medium. These results are consistent with a transporter which catalyzes countertransport of at least two protons for each serotonin cation accumulated."

https://openalex.org/W1563332050,"A high molecular weight preparation of terminal transferase containing 58,000- and 44,000-dalton peptides has been purified from calf thymus glands. The relationship of these terminal transferase peptides to the low molecular weight form was established with an immunoblot procedure using rabbit antibody directed against the homogeneous calf thymus low molecular weight terminal transferase (32,000 daltons). The 58,000- and 44,000-dalton enzyme species are each shown to be enzymatically active by renaturation in situ after electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. These results suggest that the homogeneous terminal transferase previously described is derived from the higher molecular weight species by proteolysis during fractionation. Controlled degradation of the high molecular weight calf thymus terminal transferase with trypsin produces fully active enzyme containing alpha- and beta-peptides similar to those found in the 32,000-dalton species. Isoelectric focusing experiments show a decrease of isoelectric pH of the enzyme with proteolysis."

Normal growth and budding were obtained in symbiotic and aposymbiotic Hydra viridis. Two nonsymbiotic hydra species did not form buds under bacteria-free conditions. When these hydra were fed nonsterile Artemia, or if the medium was reinoculated with bacteria isolated from budding stock cultures, normal budding was resumed. An exogenous budding factor, which can be provided by nonsterile Artemia larvae, or even by some bacteria, appears to be required by these nonsymbiotic hydra. This factor is endogenous in Hydra viridis."
https://openalex.org/W2234096399,"4-Bromocrotonic acid was found to effectively inhibit respiration supported by either palmitoylcarnitine or acetoacetate in coupled rat heart mitochondria. Partial inhibition was observed when 3-hydroxybutyrate served as a substrate, whereas pyruvate-supported respiration was unaffected by the inhibitor. Thus, 4-bromocrotonic acid inhibits fatty acid oxidation and ketone body degradation. When the enzymes of beta-oxidation and ketone body degradation were assayed in mitochondria preincubated with 4-bromocrotonic acid, only 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase were found to be inactive. Evidence is presented for the enzymatic conversion of 4-bromocrotonic acid to 3-keto-4-bromobutyryl-CoA which effectively inhibits both thiolases. A kinetic evaluation of the inhibitions caused by 4-bromocrotonic acid in coupled rat heart mitochondria demonstrated that 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and respiration supported by palmitoyl carnitine are inactivated at equal rates. However, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase was inactivated more rapidly than was respiration supported by acetoacetate. It is suggested that the thiolase-catalyzed step is rate-limiting in beta-oxidation or is as slow as other reactions are. In contrast the thiolytic cleavage of acetoacetyl-CoA does not seem to be rate-limiting in ketone body degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2172080767,"Electrical subcutaneous nerve stimulation of radial, median, and saphenous nerves has been shown to produce prolonged analgesia. In a double blind study, such stimulation also suppressed clonus for 3 hours after stimulation ceased in subjects with spasticity. Since the effect is contralateral, each subject was his own control. Because stimulation of the nerve in the wrist suppressed ankle clonus, the mechanism mediating the effect must be centrifugal inhibition. These results suggest that subcutaneous nerve stimulation may also be a tool in the management of spasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1516823690,"Aspects of the molecular interaction and subunit structure of rabbit skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase, (alpha beta gamma delta)4, were investigated. Exogenous addition of the delta subunit (calmodulin) stimulated the activities of nonactivated phosphorylase kinase and the alpha gamma delta complex, but not the gamma delta complex. This stimulatory effect does not seem to affect the activity-pH profile of the native kinase and is expressed at least partly through an interaction of the calmodulin with the alpha subunit, resulting in an increase in the apparent Vm parameters. Low concentrations of trifluoperazine had only slight effect on the activities of the three forms of kinase, whereas high concentrations caused nonspecific inactivation. The effects of trifluoperazine and EGTA on the activities of the alpha gamma delta and gamma delta complexes were additive; together, they inactivated the two complexes to about 10% of their original activities. The delta subunit remained tightly bound to phosphorylase kinase and the alpha gamma delta complex, even in the presence of 8 M urea, but less so with the gamma delta complex. The nonactivated kinase is more stable towards heat inactivation at 37 degrees C than the alpha gamma delta complex, whereas the gamma delta complex is least stable. Similar to the holoenzyme, limited trypsin digestion activated the alpha gamma delta complex. The pH 6.8/8.2 activity ratio of this complex increased from 0.5 to 0.9, with concomitant degradation of the alpha subunit. In contrast, the gamma delta complex is fairly inert to limited proteolysis. By using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and pretreatment of the gamma delta complex with EGTA, results indicated that the gamma subunit may be a Ca2+-independent kinase, which has about 30% of the original phosphorylase kinase activity."

After olfactory bulbs were removed, discrimination was lost, but returned with the formation of synaptic connections between regenerated primary olfactory neurons and the cortex of the forebrain. The acquisition of a second olfactory-mediated task by long-term bulbectomized mice and controls was indistinguishable. The results emphasize the plasticity of the nervous system, correlate the presence of neural connections between olfactory mucosa and forebrain with the recovery of olfactory function, suggest that olfactory-mediated memory resides at least in part outside the olfactory bulbs, and demonstrate that the bulbs are not required for the acquisition of olfactory tasks."

https://openalex.org/W2088783136,The progeny of x-irradiated V79 cells are hypersensitive to PUVA-(8-methoxypsoralen plus longwave ultraviolet light) induced mutation at the locus for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase. This hypersensitivity is most evident at low doses of pUVA that do not induce mutation in non-x-irradiated cells. The hypersensitivity is evoked by x-irradiation delivered as a single dose or as multiple fractions over a long period and persists for at least 108 days of exponential growth. This radiation-induced hypersensitivity to subsequent mutation is a new phenomenon that may be relevant to multistage carcinogenesis.

As the pH is lowered from 5 to 3.5, the protein undergoes a conformational change resulting in expansion, known as the N = to F (partially acid expanded) transition. As the pH is lowered still further to 2, the protein continues to expand. In the present study, using the techniques of circular dichroism, fluorescence, and UV difference spectroscopy, lanthanide ions at concentrations between 1-30 mM have been shown to produce both changes in the albumin structure analogous to the N = to F transition and acid expansion of bovine serum albumin at a constant pH near 6."

https://openalex.org/W2165396058,"In addition to the three known forms of vitamin K (vitamin K quinone, vitamin K hydroquinone, and vitamin K epoxide), a fourth metabolite, hydroxyvitamin K, was found in reaction mixtures containing a vitamin K-dependent carboxylating enzyme system. When sulfite was added to such reaction mixtures, the formation of hydroxyvitamin K was substantially enhanced, whereas no epoxide was formed anymore. The vitamin K-dependent carboxylation was stimulated at these sulfite concentrations. Vitamin K hydroquinone could be replaced by t-butylhydroperoxide and also under these conditions the carboxylation was enhanced by sulfite. In the presence of peroxidase, the carboxylation reaction was blocked, whereas hydroxyvitamin K could still be detected in the reaction mixtures, even in the absence of sulfite. These observations lead us to the hypothesis that the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues is coupled to the heterolytic cleavage of a peroxide bond with the concurrent formation of vitamin epoxide."

https://openalex.org/W1505693419,"The effect of the carbonmonoxy forms of Hb S and Hb A on the solubility and kinetics of the aggregation of deoxy-Hb S in concentrated phosphate buffer was studied. The delay time was prolonged exponentially when the ratios of CO-Hb S and CO-Hb A to deoxy-Hb S were increased. This increase in the delay time prior to aggregation can be explained by the decrease in the concentration of deoxy-Hb S. As with deoxy-Hb A, the n value for the delay time prior to the aggregation of deoxy Hb S was unaffected by CO-Hb S and CO-Hb A. Electrophoretic and spectrophotometric analyses of the composition of CO- and deoxy-Hbs A and S in the solution before and after aggregation showed that CO-Hb S co-polymerized with deoxy-Hb S but that CO-Hb A did not. The amount of CO-Hb S in the polymer phase depended on the initial fraction of the CO form of Hb S. The participation of CO-Hb S in the polymer phase was further confirmed by direct measurement of the absorption spectra of the polymer phase after it was dissolved in deoxygenated phosphate buffer. From these results, we concluded that nuclei are formed only from deoxy-Hb S, but that once nuclei are formed, CO-Hb S and deoxy-Hb A co-polymerize with deoxy-Hb S."

Synthesis of the [14C]xylose-lipid was stimulated by exogenous dolichol phosphate whereas the addition of retinol plus ATP had no effect. The [14C]xylosyl-lipid was identified as [14C]xylosylphosphoryldolichol by chromatography on SG-81 paper and DEAE-cellulose and by acid hydrolysis. Addition of UDP-galactose and UDP-glucuronic acid to incubations of epiphyseal microsomes with UDP-[14C]xylose did not stimulate [14C]xylose incorporation into lipid nor into proteoglycan. Under several different conditions, [14C]xylose was not transferred from [14C]xylosylphosphoryldolichol to proteoglycan, indicating that [14C]xylosylphosphoryldolichol was not an intermediate in proteoglycan biosynthesis. Chick embryo epiphyseal microsomes also synthesized [14C]glucosylphosphoryldolichol. In addition, [14C]glucose was transferred from [14C]glucosylphosphoryldolichol into oligosaccharide lipids in the chloroform:methanol:water extract and into glycoproteins in the pellet fraction. Competition experiments with UDP-glucose and UDP-xylose suggested that xylosylphosphoryldolichol was synthesized by the glucosyltransferase involved with glucosylphosphoryldolichol biosynthesis."
