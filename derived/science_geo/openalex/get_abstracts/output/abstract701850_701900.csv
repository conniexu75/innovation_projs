https://openalex.org/W4302012043,"Background Weight loss, hyperglycaemia and diabetes are known features of pancreatic cancer. We quantified the timing and the amount of changes in body mass index (BMI) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), and their association with pancreatic cancer from five years before diagnosis. Methods A matched case-control study was undertaken within 590 primary care practices in England, United Kingdom. 8,777 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (cases) between 1 st January 2007 and 31 st August 2020 were matched to 34,979 controls by age, gender and diabetes. Longitudinal trends in BMI and HbA1c were visualised. Odds ratios adjusted for demographic and lifestyle factors (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with conditional logistic regression. Subgroup analyses were undertaken according to the diabetes status. Results Changes in BMI and HbA1c observed for cases on longitudinal plots started one and two years (respectively) before diagnosis. In the year before diagnosis, a 1 kg/m 2 decrease in BMI between cases and controls was associated with aOR for pancreatic cancer of 1.05 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.06), and a 1 mmol/mol increase in HbA1c was associated with aOR of 1.06 (1.06 to 1.07). ORs remained statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.001) for 2 years before pancreatic cancer diagnosis for BMI and 3 years for HbA1c. Subgroup analysis revealed that the decrease in BMI was associated with a higher pancreatic cancer risk for people with diabetes than for people without (aORs 1.08, 1.06 to 1.09 versus 1.04, 1.03 to 1.05), but the increase in HbA1c was associated with a higher risk for people without diabetes than for people with diabetes (aORs 1.09, 1.07 to 1.11 versus 1.04, 1.03 to 1.04). Conclusions The statistically significant changes in weight and glycaemic control started three years before pancreatic cancer diagnosis but varied according to the diabetes status. The information from this study could be used to detect pancreatic cancer earlier than is currently achieved. However, regular BMI and HbA1c measurements are required to facilitate future research and implementation in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W4302012177,"Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] is a crop with significant agronomic and nutritional value. In Togo, the crop is very appreciated by local people. It is the third food habit in Togo after maize and rice. However, several accessions of cowpea cultivated in Togo are now prone to extinction, creating a risk of genetic erosion. It is therefore urgent to assess the genetic diversity of accessions in order to set up a good conservation program. To achieve this, genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among 70 accessions of cowpea collected in the five (5) administrative regions of Togo were assessed using Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) molecular markers. The twenty-eight SSR primers used in this study generated a total of 164 alleles with an average of 5.82 alleles per locus. Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) values ranged from 0.20 to 0.89 with an average value of 0.58. Population structure analysis using model-based revealed that the cowpea germplasm was grouped into two subpopulations. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 98% of genetic variation existed among accessions within regions. The fixation index (Fst) value, which was 0.069 was low, indicating relatively low population differentiation. The phylogenetic analysis grouped the 70 accessions into two main groups that can be further divided into four groups independent of their origins. This study provides a foundation for a Togolese cowpea germplasm conservation program and can serve for the selection of parental material for further studies aimed at the genetic improvement of local germplasm."
https://openalex.org/W4302013472,"Protecting the future of forests in the United States and other countries depends in part on our ability to monitor and map forest health conditions in a timely fashion to facilitate management of emerging threats and disturbances over a multitude of spatial scales. Remote sensing data and technologies have contributed to our ability to meet these needs, but existing methods relying on supervised classification are often limited to specific areas by the availability of imagery or training data, as well as model transferability. Scaling up and operationalizing these methods for general broadscale monitoring and mapping may be promoted by using simple models that are easily trained and projected across space and time with widely available imagery. Here, we describe a new model that classifies high resolution (~1 m2) 3-band red, green, blue (RGB) imagery from a single point in time into one of four color classes corresponding to tree crown condition or health: green healthy crowns, red damaged or dying crowns, gray damaged or dead crowns, and shadowed crowns where the condition status is unknown. These Tree Crown Health (TCH) models trained on data from the United States (US) Department of Agriculture, National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), for all 48 States in the contiguous US and spanning years 2012 to 2019, exhibited high measures of model performance and transferability when evaluated using randomly withheld testing data (n = 122 NAIP state x year combinations; median overall accuracy 0.89-0.90; median Kappa 0.85-0.86). We present examples of how TCH models can detect and map individual tree mortality resulting from a variety of nationally significant native and invasive forest insects and diseases in the US. We conclude with discussion of opportunities and challenges for extending and implementing TCH models in support of broadscale monitoring and mapping of forest health."
https://openalex.org/W4302013548,"Fast surveillance strategies are needed to control the spread of new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and gain time for evaluation of their pathogenic potential. This was essential for the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) that replaced the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) and is currently the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant circulating worldwide. RT-qPCR strategies complement whole genome sequencing, especially in resource lean countries, but mutations in the targeting primer and probe sequences of new emerging variants can lead to a failure of the existing RT-qPCRs. Here, we introduced an RT-qPCR platform for detecting the Delta- and the Omicron variant simultaneously using a degenerate probe targeting the key ΔH69/V70 mutation in the spike protein. By inclusion of the L452R mutation into the RT-qPCR platform, we could detect not only the Delta and the Omicron variants, but also the Omicron sub-lineages BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5. The RT-qPCR platform was validated in small- and large-scale. It can easily be incorporated for continued monitoring of Omicron sub-lineages, and offers a fast adaption strategy of existing RT-qPCRs to detect new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants using degenerate probes."
https://openalex.org/W4302276723,"Understanding drivers of biodiversity patterns is essential to evaluate the potential impact of deep-sea mining on ecosystems resilience. While the South West Pacific forms an independent biogeographic province for hydrothermal vent fauna, different degrees of connectivity among basins were previously reported for a variety of species depending on their ability to disperse. In this study, we compared phylogeographic patterns of several vent gastropods across South West Pacific back-arc basins and the newly-discovered La Scala site on the Woodlark Ridge by analysing their genetic divergence using a barcoding approach. We focused on six genera of vent gastropods widely distributed in the region: Lepetodrilus, Symmetromphalus, Lamellomphalus, Shinkailepas, Desbruyeresia and Provanna. A wide-range sampling was conducted at different vent fields across the Futuna Volcanic Arc, the Manus, Woodlark, North Fiji, and Lau Basins, during the CHUBACARC cruise in 2019. The Cox1-based genetic structure of geographic populations was examined for each taxon to delineate putative cryptic species and assess potential barriers or contact zones between basins. Results showed contrasted phylogeographic patterns among species, even between closely related species. While some species are widely distributed across basins (i.e. Shinkailepas tollmanni, Desbruyeresia melanioides and Lamellomphalus) without evidence of strong barriers to gene flow, others are restricted to one (i.e. Shinkailepas tufari complex of cryptic species, Desbruyeresia cancellata and D. costata). Other species showed intermediate patterns of isolation with different lineages separating the Manus Basin from the Lau/North Fiji Basins (i.e. Lepetodrilus schrolli, Provanna and Symmetromphalus spp.). Individuals from the Woodlark Basin were either endemic to this area (though possibly representing intermediate OTUs between the Manus Basin and the other eastern basins populations) or, coming into contact from these basins, highlighting the stepping-stone role of the Woodlark Basin in the dispersal of the South West Pacific vent fauna. Results are discussed according to the dispersal ability of species and the geological history of the South West Pacific."
https://openalex.org/W4302012158,"Background Though clinically similar, Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease are caused by different viruses. Of the 30 documented outbreaks of these diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, eight were major outbreaks (≥200 cases; five caused by Zaire ebolavirus [EBOV], two by Sudan ebolavirus [SUDV], and one by Marburg virus [MARV]). Our purpose is to develop a multivalent vaccine regimen protecting against each of these filoviruses. This first-in-human study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of several multivalent two-dose vaccine regimens that contain Ad26.Filo and MVA-BN-Filo. Methods Ad26.Filo combines three vaccines encoding the glycoprotein (GP) of EBOV, SUDV, and MARV. MVA-BN-Filo is a multivalent vector encoding EBOV, SUDV, and MARV GPs, and Taï Forest nucleoprotein. This Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled healthy adults (18–50 years) into four groups, randomized 5:1 (active:placebo), to assess different Ad26.Filo and MVA-BN-Filo vaccine directionality and administration intervals. The primary endpoint was safety; immune responses against EBOV, SUDV, and MARV GPs were also assessed. Results Seventy-two participants were randomized, and 60 (83.3%) completed the study. All regimens were well tolerated with no deaths or vaccine-related serious adverse events (AEs). The most frequently reported solicited local AE was injection site pain/tenderness. Solicited systemic AEs most frequently reported were headache, fatigue, chills, and myalgia; most solicited AEs were Grade 1–2. Solicited/unsolicited AE profiles were similar between regimens. Twenty-one days post-dose 2, 100% of participants on active regimen responded to vaccination and exhibited binding antibodies against EBOV, SUDV, and MARV GPs; neutralizing antibody responses were robust against EBOV (85.7–100%), but lower against SUDV (35.7–100%) and MARV (0–57.1%) GPs. An Ad26.Filo booster induced a rapid further increase in humoral responses. Conclusion This study demonstrates that heterologous two-dose vaccine regimens with Ad26.Filo and MVA-BN-Filo are well tolerated and immunogenic in healthy adults. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02860650 ."
https://openalex.org/W4302013482,"This study investigates PhD candidates' (N = 391) perceptions about their research environment at a Dutch university in terms of the research climate, (un)ethical supervisory practices, and questionable research practices. We assessed whether their perceptions are related to career considerations. We gathered quantitative self-report estimations of the perceptions of PhD candidates using an online survey tool and then conducted descriptive and within-subject correlation analysis of the results. While most PhD candidates experience fair evaluation processes, openness, integrity, trust, and freedom in their research climate, many report lack of time and support, insufficient supervision, and witness questionable research practices. Results based on Spearman correlations indicate that those who experience a less healthy research environment (including experiences with unethical supervision, questionable practices, and barriers to responsible research), more often consider leaving academia and their current PhD position."
https://openalex.org/W4302012013,"Background The use of High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is increasing in admitted COPD-patients and could provide a step in between non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and standard oxygen supply. Recent studies demonstrated that HFNC is capable of facilitating secretion removal and reduce the work of breathing. Therefore, it might be of advantage in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). No randomized trials have assessed this for admitted COPD-patients on a regular ward and only limited data from non-randomized studies is available. Objectives The aim of our study was to identify the reasons to initiate treatment with HFNC in a group of COPD-patients during an exacerbation, further identify those most likely to benefit from HFNC treatment and to find factors associated with treatment success on the pulmonary ward. Material and methods This retrospective study included COPD-patients admitted to the pulmonary ward and treated with HFNC from April 2016 until April 2019. Only patients admitted with severe acute exacerbations were included. Patients who had an indication for NIV-treatment where treated with NIV and were included only if they subsequently needed HFNC, e.g. when they did not tolerate NIV. Known asthma patients were excluded. Results A total of 173 patients were included. Stasis of sputum was the indication most reported to initiate HFNC-treatment. Treatment was well tolerated in 83% of the patients. Cardiac and vascular co-morbidities were significantly associated with a smaller chance of successful treatment (Respectively OR = 0.435; p = 0.013 and OR = 0.493;p = 0.035). Clinical assessment judged HFNC-treatment to be successful in 61% of the patients. Furthermore, in-hospital treatment with NIV was associated with a higher chance of HFNC failure afterwards (OR = 0.439; p = 0.045). Conclusion This large retrospective study showed that HFNC-treatment in patients with an AECOPD was initiated most often for sputum stasis as primary reason. Factors associated with improved outcomes of HFNC-treatment was the absence of vascular and/or cardiac co-morbidities and no need for in-hospital NIV-treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4302012165,"We investigated the association between social inequality and participation in a mammography screening program (MSP). Since the German government offers mammography screening free of charge, any effect of social inequality on participation should be due to educational status and not due to the financial burden.The 'Gutenberg Health Study' is a cohort study in the Rhine-Main-region, Germany. A health check-up was performed, and questions about medical history, health behavior, including secondary prevention such as use of mammography, and social status are included. Two indicators of social inequality (equivalence income and educational status), an interaction term of these two, and different covariables were used to explore an association in different logistic regression models.A total of 4,681 women meeting the inclusion criteria were included. Only 6.2% never participated in the MSP. A higher income was associated with higher chances of ever participating in a mammography screening (odds ratios (OR): 1.67 per €1000; 95%CI:1.26-2.25, model 3, adjusted for age, education and an interaction term of income and education). Compared to women with a low educational status, the odds ratios for ever participating in the MSP was lower for the intermediate educational status group (OR = 0.64, 95%CI:0.45-0.91) and for the high educational status group (0.53, 95%CI:0.37-0.76). Results persisted also after controlling for relevant confounders.Despite the absence of financial barriers for participation in the MSP, socioeconomic inequalities still influence participation. It would be interesting to examine whether the educational effect is due to an informed decision."
https://openalex.org/W4302013561,"This paper reports a two-part study examining the relationship between fear of missing out (FoMO) and maladaptive behaviors in college students. This project used a cross-sectional study to examine whether college student FoMO predicts maladaptive behaviors across a range of domains (e.g., alcohol and drug use, academic misconduct, illegal behavior). Participants (N = 472) completed hard copy questionnaire packets assessing trait FoMO levels and questions pertaining to unethical and illegal behavior while in college. Part 1 utilized traditional statistical analyses (i.e., hierarchical regression modeling) to identify any relationships between FoMO, demographic variables (socioeconomic status, living situation, and gender) and the behavioral outcomes of interest. Part 2 looked to quantify the predictive power of FoMO, and demographic variables used in Part 1 through the convergent approach of supervised machine learning. Results from Part 1 indicate that college student FoMO is indeed related to many diverse maladaptive behaviors spanning the legal and illegal spectrum. Part 2, using various techniques such as recursive feature elimination (RFE) and principal component analysis (PCA) and models such as logistic regression, random forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), showcased the predictive power of implementing machine learning. Class membership for these behaviors (offender vs. non-offender) was predicted at rates well above baseline (e.g., 50% at baseline vs 87% accuracy for academic misconduct with just three input variables). This study demonstrated FoMO's relationships with these behaviors as well as how machine learning can provide additional predictive insights that would not be possible through inferential statistical modeling approaches typically employed in psychology, and more broadly, the social sciences. Research in the social sciences stands to gain from regularly utilizing the more traditional statistical approaches in tandem with machine learning."
https://openalex.org/W4302009138,"Estrogen signaling has been extensively studied, especially in cancers that express estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). However, little is known regarding the effect of estrogen on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Here, we explored the role of estrogen signaling of CAFs in gastric cancer (GC) progression. We investigated the phenotypic changes in CAFs upon 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment using ERα-negative/positive CAFs, and the conditioned media (CM) collected from these were compared with regard to cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. A paracrine factor was found using a cytokine array and was confirmed using qRT-PCR, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. ERα-CD147-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) axis was confirmed by knockdown experiments using specific siRNAs. We found that a subset of CAFs expressed ERα. ERα-positive CAFs were responsive to E2, inducing ERα expression in a dose-dependent manner. Although E2 did not induce the proliferation of ERα-positive CAFs, the CM from E2-bound ERα-positive CAFs significantly promoted cancer cell migration and invasion. Cytokine array revealed that CD147 was induced in ERα-positive CAFs upon E2 treatment; this was mediated via ERα. Increased CD147 upregulated MMP2 and MMP9 in CAFs, and also influenced cancer cells in a paracrine manner to increase MMPs and CD147 in cancer cells. High CD147 expression in tumor tissue was associated with a worse prognosis in GC patients. Our data suggest that estrogen signaling activation in CAFs and the byproduct CD147 are among the critical mediators between the interplay of CAFs and cancer cells to facilitate cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W4302011881,"Life satisfaction influences well-being. Medical students often experience more stress as compared to their counterparts in other disciplines as they are required to meet the demands of both academic workload and clinical responsibilities. However, during the current pandemic, in addition to academic changes, inability to complete clinical placements, loss of peer interaction and social connectedness and, deployment to areas in times of crisis could exacerbate their stress. This would impact their ability to cope with stress and eventually influence their life satisfaction. Students approach these challenges in various ways, either positively, religiously, or by avoiding. This study aimed to explore the association between resilience, coping mechanisms and life satisfaction in medical students during the pandemic.A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted from undergraduate medical students from year 1 to year 5. Three instruments were used to measure life satisfaction, resilience, and coping, namely The Brief Resilience Scale, The Satisfaction with Life Scale and the COPE inventory. Mean and standard deviation were calculated for all continuous variables. Robust linear regression model was used for analysis. Hierarchical (forward) stepwise model building technique was used for final model. Alpha cut off was kept at 0.05.A total of 351 students (out of 500 students) completed the questionnaires. A moderately negative, slightly linear correlation between life satisfaction and avoidant coping was reported. Life satisfaction showed moderately positive, slightly linear correlation with resilience score. Three variables stayed significant in the final model: Resilience, avoidant coping, and religion coping.Life satisfaction can be improved among medical students by focusing on strategies which enhance resilience. Religion is identified as a significant coping strategy among medical students. Students coping mechanism can vary and more research is needed to assess which types of coping strategies could contribute positively to the quality of their personal and professional lives."
https://openalex.org/W4302011893,"Health literacy is a powerful predictor of health outcomes, but remains a global challenge. There is a paucity of published data and limited understanding of the health literacy of patients in the Middle East. The purpose of this study was to assess the patient health literacy levels in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and identify associated demographic characteristics.A cross-sectional survey of adult patients attending public and private hospitals and primary care clinics was conducted across the UAE between January 2019 and May 2020. Chi-square test was used to analyze the association between health literacy and demographic variables. Ordinal regression was adopted to analyze the data for statistically significant independent variables.2349 of 2971 patients responded (79% response rate). Slightly less than one-quarter (23.9%) of patients surveyed demonstrated adequate health literacy. Over a third of women respondents (31.7%) possessed adequate health literacy, as compared to only 13% of men surveyed (p<0.001). Participant age was significantly (p<0.001) associated with health literacy levels, with approximately 50% of participants above age 50 years (51-75 years) demonstrating inadequate health literacy. Education was also positively correlated with health literacy. Adequate health literacy levels were twofold higher (30.5%, p<0.001) in patients with high school education, as compared to patients without secondary education.The high proportion of patients with inadequate health literacy in our study confirms that the health literacy deficit is a challenge in the UAE. Targeted interventions are needed to improve health literacy, particularly for older individuals, to optimize healthcare utilization and improve individual and population health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4302011923,"The motherhood penalty seemingly reflects a preference to hire female professionals who are not parents compared to mothers, however, little is known about whether this effect is attributable to parent stereotypes per se. Study 1 assessed the content of the parent-academia stereotypes of 180 individuals working in Education and revealed stronger stereotypical associations of fathers with academia than mothers. Study 2 investigated what parent-academia stereotypes predict in terms of endorsements for hiring men versus women in a mock hiring task set in an academic context. Academics (N = 112) evaluated mock job candidates for an Assistant Professor post while the gender, parental status and leave status of the candidates were manipulated. The findings showed that parents were significantly less likely to be endorsed to be hired than non-parents, regardless of gender. Parent-academia stereotypes led to biased hiring recommendations, such that a greater endorsement of parent-academia stereotypes predicted a reduced likelihood to endorse hiring parents compared to non-parents. Implications for reducing parent stereotypes in academic contexts are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4302012050,"Background Significant reductions in ambient pressure subject an individual to risk of decompression illness (DCI); with incidence up to 35 per 10,000 dives. In severe cases, the central nervous system is often compromised (&gt;80%), making DCI among the most morbid of diving related injuries. While hyperbaric specialists suggest initiating recompression therapy with either a Treatment Table 6 (TT6) or 6A (TT6A), the optimal initial recompression treatment for severe DCI is unknown. Methods Swine were exposed to an insult dive breathing air at 7.06 ATA (715.35 kPa) for 24 min followed by rapid decompression at a rate of 1.82 ATA/min (184.41 kPa/min). Swine that developed neurologic DCI within 1 hour of surfacing were block randomized to one of four United States Navy Treatment Tables (USN TT): TT6, TT6A-air (21% oxygen, 79% nitrogen), TT6A-nitrox (50% oxygen, 50% nitrogen), and TT6A-heliox (50% oxygen, 50% helium). The primary outcome was the mean number of spinal cord lesions, which was analyzed following cord harvest 24 hours after successful recompression treatment. Secondary outcomes included spinal cord lesion incidence and gross neurologic outcomes based on a pre- and post- modified Tarlov assessment. We compared outcomes among these four groups and between the two treatment profiles (i.e. TT6 and TT6A). Results One-hundred and forty-one swine underwent the insult dive, with 61 swine meeting inclusion criteria (43%). We found no differences in baseline characteristics among the groups. We found no significant differences in functional neurologic outcomes (p = 0.77 and 0.33), spinal cord lesion incidence (p = 0.09 and 0.07), or spinal cord lesion area (p = 0.51 and 0.17) among the four treatment groups or between the two treatment profiles, respectively. While the trends were not statistically significant, animals treated with TT6 had the lowest rates of functional deficits and the fewest spinal cord lesions. Moreover, across all animals, functional neurologic deficit had strong correlation with lesion area pathology (Logistic Regression, p &lt; 0.01, Somers’ D = 0.74). Conclusions TT6 performed as well as the other treatment tables and is the least resource intensive. TT6 is the most appropriate initial treatment for neurologic DCI in swine, among the tables that we compared."
https://openalex.org/W4302012086,"Pain can be significantly lessened by sex/orgasm, likely due to the release of endorphins during sex, considered potent analgesics. The evidence suggests that endorphins are also present during sexual arousal (that is, prior to sex/orgasm). It follows then that pain can be modulated during sexual arousal, independent of sex/orgasm, too. Accordingly, sexual arousal induced by erotic slides has been demonstrated to lessen pain in men, but not in women. One explanation could be that for women, the erotic slides were not potent enough to elicit a lasting primed state of sexual arousal by the time pain was induced. Thus, the current study aims to optimize the means of inducing a potent state of sexual arousal and subsequently examine the potentially analgesic influence of sexual arousal on pain in women. As a subsidiary aim, the study also assesses whether the anticipated analgesic effect of sexual arousal would be stronger than that of distraction or generalized (non-sexual) arousal.Female participants (N = 151) were randomly distributed across four conditions: sexual arousal, generalized arousal, distraction, neutral. Mild pain was induced using a cold pressor while participants were concurrently exposed to film stimuli (pornographic, exciting, distracting, neutral) to induce the targeted emotional states. A visual analogue scale was utilized to measure the subjective level of pain perceived by the participants.Sexual arousal did not reduce subjective pain. Generalized arousal and distraction did not result in stronger analgesic effects than the neutral condition.The present findings do not support the hypothesis that sexual arousal alone modulates subjective pain in women. This might be due to the possibility that genital stimulation and/or orgasm are key in pain reduction, or, that feelings of disgust may inadvertently have been induced by the pornographic stimulus and interfered with sexual arousal in influencing pain."
https://openalex.org/W4302012129,"Scientists play important roles in conducting public engagement, but evidence shows that scientists perceive great challenges in doing so. Drawing broadly from the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study examines factors predicting scientists’ willingness to conduct public engagement. This study further examines how perceived behavioral control (PBC) of conducting public engagement would moderate the relationships between the proposed predictors and scientists’ willingness to conduct public engagement. Using survey data collected from 706 scientists based in Singapore, this study found that attitude toward and personal norms of conducting public engagement, as well as PBC, significantly predicted scientists’ willingness to conduct public engagement. Notably, PBC interacted with attitude toward conducting public engagement, the perceived descriptive norms, the perceived positive media influence, and the perceived negative external norms of conducting public engagement, as well as personal norms of conducting public engagement to predict scientists’ willingness to conduct public engagement. We postulated the key role that the perception of the ease or difficulty plays in motivating scientists to conduct the skill-intensive endeavor explains the significant moderating effects. The theoretical implications on the TPB and the practical implications for public engagement are further discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4302013487,"iEngage is a modular health education and behavioural change program designed to help adolescents increase moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The program is delivered through the iEngage app which integrates activity trackers data (Misfit Ray © ) within 10 interactive learning modules. Key features include guidance to set goals, self-monitor and assess achievements, and experiential learning via the connected activity trackers which allows for continuous steps recording during the program. iEngage was implemented in two schools over 5 weeks with 10–12 years old adolescents (n = 57) and PA outcomes compared to control group (n = 26). Results show that adolescents successfully set goals and self-assessed achievements during the program, progressing toward higher physical activity (PA) levels as shown by the 30% increase in daily steps through the program (+ 2647 steps/day, P &lt; .001) with boys increasing goals and achievements faster than girls. The consistency in days totalling at least 11,000 steps/day increased from 35% at the start to 48% at the end of the program. The increase in PA is confirmed through the assessment of MVPA during schooldays pre- and post- program via research grade wrist accelerometers in both iEngage and control participants. Contrasting with the control group, MVPA was increased in the week following the program (~+5 min/day, P = .023) in short bouts, particularly during lunch time, recess and after school. This study shows that a digital program integrating activity trackers data, health education, goals setting and self-monitoring of PA, helped young adolescents enhance PA goals, improve achievements and increase MVPA."
https://openalex.org/W4302013488,"Travel time to treatment facilities may impede the receipt of guideline-concordant treatment (GCT) among patients diagnosed with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC). We investigated the relative contribution of travel time in the receipt of GCT among ES-NSCLC patients.We included 22,821 ES-NSCLC patients diagnosed in California from 2006-2015. GCT was defined using the 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, and delayed treatment was defined as treatment initiation >6 versus ≤6 weeks after diagnosis. Mean-centered driving and public transit times were calculated from patients' residential block group centroid to the treatment facilities. We used logistic regression to estimate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between patients' travel time and receipt of GCT and timely treatment, overall and by race/ethnicity and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES).Overall, a 15-minute increase in travel time was associated with a decreased risk of undertreatment and delayed treatment. Compared to Whites, among Blacks, a 15-minute increase in driving time was associated with a 24% (95%CI = 8%-42%) increased risk of undertreatment, and among Filipinos, a 15-minute increase in public transit time was associated with a 27% (95%CI = 13%-42%) increased risk of delayed treatment. Compared to the highest nSES, among the lowest nSES, 15-minute increases in driving and public transit times were associated with 33% (95%CI = 16%-52%) and 27% (95%CI = 16%-39%) increases in the risk of undertreatment and delayed treatment, respectively.The benefit of GCT observed with increased travel times may be a 'Travel Time Paradox,' and may vary across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups."
https://openalex.org/W4302275086,"The colloidal particle transport process in all porous media from laboratory to nature is affected by gravity. In this paper, a mathematical model of colloidal particle migration in a saturated porous medium with the gravity effect is established by combining the gap velocity (advection) with the settling velocity (gravity effect), and an analytical solution of the particle migration problem with time variation of the particle injection intensity is obtained using an integral transformation. The correctness and rationality of the analytical solution are verified by comparing the experimental and theoretical results of the particle migration problem in the point-source transient injection mode. The analytical solution can easily analyze the colloid transport experimental data in a variety of seepage directions. Analysis of the influence of seepage velocities in three different seepage directions on particle transport parameters shows: under the same seepage direction, the peak value of the breakthrough curve increased with an increase in the seepage velocity. The dispersion, adsorption coefficient, and deposition rate decreased with an increase in the seepage velocity. Under the same seepage velocity, the peak value of the breakthrough curve from large to small was vertically downward (VD)&gt; horizontal (H)&gt; vertically upward (VU), the order of dispersion from large to small was vertically downward (VD)&gt;horizontal (H) &gt;vertically upward (VU), the order of the adsorption coefficient and deposition rate of particles from large to small was vertically upward (VU)&gt; horizontal (H) &gt;vertically downward (VD), and the smaller the seepage velocity, the greater the relative differences in the peak value of the breakthrough curve, dispersion, the particle adsorption coefficient, and the deposition rate in the different seepage directions. Therefore, gravity is an important mechanism of particle migration in saturated porous media. The larger the particle size and density were, the smaller the seepage velocity was and the more obvious the effect of gravity. The findings of this study can help for better understanding of colloidal transport properties in porous media under the coupled effects of gravity and hydrodynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4302275202,"The experience of graduate degree lecturers in the natural sciences when they switched to online teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic is described. The shift to online teaching throughout the pandemic provided an opportunity to evaluate how lecturers integrate technology into their teaching and what they need to improve their remote teaching. This study used a twofold perspective of TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) and self-efficacy in online education. Its data were derived from pre-and post-questionnaires, comprising closed and open-ended questions, given at the start and end of the semester. We found that lecturers focused on learning and applying technological and techno-pedagogical knowledge but paid less attention to the integration of three components: technology, pedagogy, and scientific content. Although no statistically significant differences in lecturers' perceived self-efficacy was found between the start and the end of the semester, at the end of the semester we found a statistically significant correlation between the variables involved in building self-efficacy in online teaching: (1) satisfaction with online teaching and the belief that (2) technology promotes teaching, student interactions, participation, and engagement. Our results enabled us to identify the knowledge aspects that lecturers implemented initiatively and to better understand what aspects required more professional development training. In addition, the results emphasized the importance of developing the lecturers' self-efficacy for online teaching. These insights can help to improve and enhance online teaching in higher education."
https://openalex.org/W4302009474,"Intestinal inflammation and intestinal barrier damage are important pathological changes in Crohn's disease (CD). Vindoline is a natural monomer with anti-inflammatory effects. We employed CD model mice to explore the effect of Vindoline on CD-like colitis and the possible mechanism. Il-10-deficient (Il-10-/- ) mice and wild-type (WT) mice (both aged 15 weeks, male) were used to explore the effect of Vindoline on colitis and intestinal barrier damage, as well as macrophage-mediated inflammation. Bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and colonic organoids from mice were used to explore the inhibitory effect of Vindoline on macrophage-mediated inflammation and the protective effect on inflammation-induced intestinal barrier damage as well as the possible mechanism. We found that Vindoline significantly ameliorated colitis in CD mice, as evidenced by increased weight change and colon length and decreased the colon macroscopic injury score, histological inflammatory score, and the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Vindoline also protected against intestinal barrier damage in CD mice. Furthermore, Vindoline inhibited macrophage-mediated inflammation and protected against inflammation-induced intestinal barrier damage in the coculture system. In addition, Vindoline ameliorated colitis in CD mice by protecting against inflammation-induced intestinal barrier damage, which may be caused by inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway. This protective effect suggests that Vindoline has potential value for clinical application in the treatment of CD."
https://openalex.org/W4302011888,"Arabidopsis thaliana is one of the most studied model organisms of plant biology with hundreds of geographical variants called ecotypes. One might expect that this enormous genetic variety could result in differential response to pathogens. Indeed, we observed previously that the Bur ecotype develops much more severe symptoms (upward curling leaves and wavy leaf margins) upon infection with two positive-strand RNA viruses of different families (turnip vein-clearing virus, TVCV, and turnip mosaic virus, TuMV). To find the genes potentially responsible for the ecotype-specific response, we performed a differential expression analysis of the mRNA and sRNA pools of TVCV and TuMV-infected Bur and Col plants along with the corresponding mock controls. We focused on the genes and sRNAs that showed an induced or reduced expression selectively in the Bur virus samples in both virus series. We found that the two ecotypes respond to the viral infection differently, yet both viruses selectively block the production of the TAS3 -derived small RNA specimen called tasiARF only in the virus-infected Bur plants. The tasiARF normally forms a gradient through the adaxial and abaxial parts of the leaf (being more abundant in the adaxial part) and post-transcriptionally regulates ARF4, a major leaf polarity determinant in plants. The lack of tasiARF-mediated silencing could lead to an ectopically expressed ARF4 in the adaxial part of the leaf where the misregulation of auxin-dependent signaling would result in an irregular growth of the leaf blade manifesting as upward curling leaf and wavy leaf margin. QTL mapping using Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) suggests that the observed symptoms are the result of a multigenic interaction that allows the symptoms to develop only in the Bur ecotype. The particular nature of genetic differences leading to the ecotype-specific symptoms remains obscure and needs further study."
https://openalex.org/W4302011903,"Does listening to a foreign-accented speaker bias native speakers' behavior? We investigated whether the accent, i.e., a foreign accent versus a native accent, in which a social norm is presented affects native speakers' decision to respect the norm (Experiments 1 and 2) and the judgement for not respecting it (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, we presented 128 native Spanish speakers with new social norms, adapted from the measures imposed by the Spanish Government to fight the Covid-19 pandemic (e.g., 'To avoid the spread of the Covid-19 virus, keep your distance'), whereas in Experiment 2, we presented 240 native Spanish speakers with everyday social norms learned from childhood (e.g., 'Not littering on the street or in public places'), that have an intrinsic cultural and linguistic link. In Experiment 1, the norms were uttered either in a native accent, or in a foreign accent unfamiliar to our participants to avoid stereotypes. In Experiment 2, we added an accent negatively perceived in Spain to assess the role of language attitudes on decision making. Overall, accent did not directly impact participants' final decisions, but it influenced the decision-making process. The factors that seem to underlie this effect are emotionality and language attitudes. These findings add up to the recent Foreign Accent effect observed on moral judgements and further highlight the role of the speaker's identity in decision making."
https://openalex.org/W4302012006,"Over 95% of childhood injury deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) have twice the likelihood of dying in LMICs than in high-income countries (HICs). In Africa, TBI estimates are projected to increase to upwards of 14 million new cases in 2050; however, these estimates are based on sparse data, which underscores the need for robust injury surveillance systems. We aim to describe the clinical factors associated with morbidity and mortality in pediatric TBI at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) in Moshi, Tanzania to guide future prevention efforts.We conducted a secondary analysis of a TBI registry of all pediatric (0-18 years of age) TBI patients presenting to the KCMC emergency department (ED) between May 2013 and April 2014. The variables included demographics, acute treatment and diagnostics, Glasgow Coma Scores (GCSs, severe 3-8, moderate 9-13, and mild 14-15), morbidity at discharge as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS, worse functional status 1-3, better functional status 4-6), and mortality status at discharge. The analysis included descriptive statistics, bivariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression to report the predictors of mortality and morbidity. The variables used in the multivariable logistic regression were selected according to their clinical validity in predicting outcomes.Of the total 419 pediatric TBI patients, 286 (69.3%) were male with an average age of 10.12 years (SD = 5.7). Road traffic injury (RTI) accounted for most TBIs (269, 64.4%), followed by falls (82, 19.62%). Of the 23 patients (5.58%) who had alcohol-involved injuries, most were male (3.6:1). Severe TBI occurred in 54 (13.0%) patients. In total, 90 (24.9%) patients underwent TBI surgery. Of the 21 (5.8%) patients who died, 11 (55.0%) had severe TBI, 6 (30.0%) had moderate TBI (GCS 9-13) and 3 (15.0%) presented with mild TBI (GCS>13). The variables most strongly associated with worse functional status included having severe TBI (OR = 9.45) and waiting on the surgery floor before being moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR = 14.37).Most pediatric TBI patients were males who suffered RTIs or falls. Even among children under 18 years of age, alcohol was consumed by at least 5% of patients who suffered injuries, and more commonly among boys. Patients becoming unstable and having to be transferred from the surgery floor to the ICU could reflect poor risk identification in the ED or progression of injury severity. The next steps include designing interventions to reduce RTI, mitigate irresponsible alcohol use, and improve risk identification and stratification in the ED."
https://openalex.org/W4302012011,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have seen an elevated use in clinical works like regenerative medicine. Its potential therapeutic properties increases when used in tandem with complementary agents like bio-based materials. Therefore, the present study is the first to investigate the cytotoxicity of a highly valued medicinal plant, Moringa oleifera, on human Wharton's Jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJMSCs) and its effects on the cells' gene expression when used as a pre-treatment agent in vitro. M. oleifera leaves (MOL) were dried and subjected to UHPLC-QTOF/MS analysis, revealing several major compounds like apigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin in the MOL, with various biological activities like antioxidant and anti-cancer properties. We then treated the hWJMSCs with MOL and noticed a dose-dependant inhibition on the cells' proliferation. RNA-sequencing was performed to explain the possible mechanism of action and revealed genes like PPP1R1C, SULT2B1, CDKN1A, mir-154 and CCNB1, whose expression patterns were closely associated with the negative cell cycle regulation and cell cycle arrest process. This is also evident from gene set enrichment analysis where the GO and KEGG terms for down-regulated pathways were closely related to the cell cycle regulation. The Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software further predicted the significant activation of (p < 0.05, z-score > 2) of the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation pathway. The present study suggests that MOL exhibits an antiproliferative effect on hWJMSCs via cell cycle arrest and apoptotic pathways. We believe that this study provides an important baseline reference for future works involving MOL's potential to accompany MSCs for clinical works. Future works can take advantage of the cell's strong anti-cancer gene expression found in this study, and evaluate our MOL treatment on various cancer cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W4302012094,"Chemsex typically involves drugs such as GHB/GBL, crystal meth and mephedrone, and is increasingly common among MSM. The behaviour has been found to be associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and mental health problems. We aimed to assess the extent of chemsex engagement and associations with different aspects of health, among MSM attending a free specialist walk-in clinic for STIs in Oslo, Norway.Anonymous cross-sectional survey data was collected from June to October 2016. Differences in STI health (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, HIV diagnoses), mental health (depression/anxiety) and internalised homonegativity between MSM using and not using GHB/GBL, crystal meth, mephedrone, cocaine or ketamine with sex in the last year were assessed descriptively and in a multivariate logistic regression model. The predictors were number of self-reported chlamydia, gonorrhoea or syphilis diagnoses, HIV diagnosis, depression/anxiety, and degree of internalised homonegativity. We adjusted for age, education level and having lived abroad.Of the 518 MSM respondents, 17% reported sexualised use of either GHB/GBL, crystal meth, mephedrone, cocaine or ketamine in the last year (chemsex). We found significant positive associations between chemsex and self-reported HIV diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.26, 95%CI = 1.37-7.76), number of reported chlamydia, gonorrhoea or syphilis diagnoses in the last year (aOR = 1.63, 95%CI = 1.18-2.12), having lived more than one year abroad (aOR = 2.10, 95%CI = 1.20-3.65), but no significant association with depression/anxiety (aOR = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.53-1.93), nor internalised homonegativity (aOR = 0.62, 95%CI = 0.33-1.19).Chemsex engagement in Norway is relatively low compared to findings from STI clinics in other European countries, and GHB/GBL and cocaine the two most commonly used drugs with sex. Chemsex was more common among MSM having lived more than one year abroad, reporting HIV diagnoses and a higher number of either chlamydia, gonorrhoea or syphilis diagnoses in the last year. Health care providers need to be made aware of chemsex as a behavioural phenomenon among MSM, and special care should be afforded to MSM living with HIV and being diagnosed with STIs."
https://openalex.org/W4302012242,"The beginning of the Middle Magdalenian is marked by an increase in the density and geographic extension of evidences of human occupation across western Europe. The Early Middle Magdalenian (19,5–17,5 ka cal. BP) thereby extends from Poland to Spain, and the sharing of the flint-knapping concepts and the circulation of raw materials show the existence of networks active over this wide area. In parallel, part of the production of art, ornaments, microliths, bone industry, and the proportions of hunted ungulates vary regionally and allow to identify distinct technical traditions. Departing from a palethnographic approach at a regional scale, this paper aims at participating in renewing our understanding of the mechanisms of regionalisation during the period, and among past societies of hunter-gatherers. The reflection is based on the techno-functional analysis of stone tools from two cave sites of west-central France that are at the heart of the definition of two technical traditions: La Marche (Magdalenian with Lussac-Angles points) and the Blanchard cave (Magdalenian with navettes). Inter-site comparisons of the functioning and management of stone tools, and of subsistence strategies show the sharing of techno-economical norms, expressing the adhesion to a wider community of practice. The long-term occupation of at least part of the caves and the high density of sites in the Vienne, the Creuse, the Gartempe, and the Charente Valleys, indicate the strong regional implantation of human societies. This strong territoriality (effective and symbolic) is likely a major factor to understand the specificity of the EMM expressions in the area, as well as the sharing, in the same economic territory, of technical norms and of part of the system of symbolic representation."
https://openalex.org/W4302013471,"There is a broad range of known effects of animal contact on human mental and physical health. Neurological correlates of human interaction with animals have been sparsely investigated. We investigated changes in frontal brain activity in the presence of and during contact with a dog.Twenty-one healthy individuals each participated in six sessions. In three sessions, participants had contact with a dog, and in three control sessions they interacted with a plush animal. Each session had five two-minute phases with increasing intensity of contact to the dog or plush animal from the first to the fourth phase. We measured oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin and oxygen saturation of the blood in the frontal lobe/frontopolar area with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SenSmart Model X-100) to assess brain activity.In both conditions, the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin increased significantly from the first to the fourth phase by 2.78 μmol/l (CI = 2.03-3.53, p < .001). Oxygenated hemoglobin concentration was 0.80 μmol/l higher in the dog condition compared to in the control condition (CI = 0.27-1.33, p = .004). Deoxygenated-hemoglobin concentration, total hemoglobin concentration, and oxygen saturation showed similar patterns.Prefrontal brain activation in healthy subjects increased with the rise in interaction closeness with a dog or a plush animal. Moreover, interaction with a dog stimulated more brain activity compared to the control condition, suggesting that interactions with a dog can activate stronger attentional processes and elicit more emotional arousal than interacting with a nonliving stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W4302029207,"Instream wood plays important chemical, physical and ecological functions in aquatic systems, benefiting biota directly and indirectly. However, human activities along river corridors have disrupted wood recruitment and retention, usually leading to reductions in the amount of instream wood. In the tropics, where wood is believed to be more transient, the expansion of agriculture and infrastructure might be reducing instream wood stock even more than in the better studied temperate streams. However, research is needed to augment the small amount of information about wood in different biomes and ecosystems of neotropical streams. Here we present the first extensive assessment of instream wood loads and size distributions in streams of the wet-tropical Amazon and semi-humid-tropical Cerrado (the Brazilian savanna). We also compare neotropical wood stocks with those in temperate streams, first comparing against data from the literature, and then from a comparable dataset from temperate biomes in the USA. Contrary to our expectations, Amazon and Cerrado streams carried similar wood loads, which were lower than the world literature average, but similar to those found in comparable temperate forest and savanna streams in the USA. Our results indicate that the field survey methods and the wood metric adopted are highly important when comparing different datasets. But when properly compared, we found that most of the wood in temperate streams is made-up of a small number of large pieces, whereas wood in neotropical streams is made up of a larger number of small pieces that produce similar total volumes. The character of wood volumes among biomes is linked more to the delivery, transport and decomposition mechanisms than to the total number of pieces. Future studies should further investigate the potential instream wood drivers in neotropical catchments in order to better understand the differences and similarities here detected between biomes and climatic regions."
https://openalex.org/W4302275196,"The objectives of this study were to 1) assess the differences between youth soccer and basketball players with and without past year groin pain (GP) in hip adduction and abduction strength and several training characteristics (age at the start of regular training, weekly training frequency, warm-up and training duration, use of stretching and/or stabilisation exercises during warm-up, use of resistance training); 2) present strength reference values for youth soccer and basketball players. 227 players participated (age 16.9 ± 1.4 years; height 184.2 ± 8.5 cm; mass 75.5 ± 11.9 kg). Hip adduction and abduction strength was measured in supine position (hip, knee and ankle in neutral position) using a MuscleBoard dynamometer. Interlimb asymmetries and hip adduction:abduction ratios were calculated. Past year GP and training characteristics were assessed with a retrospective questionnaire. 11.9% of players reported past year GP (16.9% in soccer and 6.4% in basketball). The only significant difference between the past year GP and the control groups was found in the age of the players at the start of regular training (7.2 ± 1.8 years for the GP group vs. 8.5 ± 2.6 years for the control group). Additionally, soccer players without past year GP have significantly higher hip adduction strength (1.1 ± 0.2 Nm/kg vs. 1.0 ± 0.2 Nm/kg) and adduction:abduction strength ratio (1.10 ± 0.18 vs. 1.03 ± 0.16) compared to basketball players. Our results show that hip adduction and abduction strength, interlimb asymmetry and hip adduction:abduction ratio do not differentiate between players with and without past year GP (p = 0.29-0.90), which means that their adduction or abduction strength can be analysed regardless of the GP presence in the past year. Additionally, players with past year GP started regularly training at significantly lower age, which could indicate the problematic nature of early/premature sports specialisation."
https://openalex.org/W4302275266,"Purpose The objective of this study was to determine the association between hypothyroidism and overall and site-specific cancer in Spanish population. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed using the population-based database BDCAP (Base de Datos Clínicos de Atención Primaria, primary care clinical database) to analyze the relative risk of cancer in Spanish population with hypothyroidism. Results In a total of 2,414,165 patients diagnosed with hypothyroidism in BDCAP in 2019, the relative risk (OR) of cancer, compared to the non-hypothyroid population, was 1.73 (1.72–1.74) (P&lt;0.0001). The higher risk was observed in both men (OR 2.15 [2.13–2.17]; P&lt;0.0001) and women (OR 1.67 [1.636–1.68]; P&lt;0.0001). However, hypothyroid persons aged 65 years or older had a reduced risk of cancer (OR 0.98 [0.97–0.98]; P&lt;0.0001). In addition, hypothyroid patients aged 65 or over showed a decreased risk of cancers of the bladder, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic and prostate. Socioeconomic characteristics such as income level, municipality size, country of birth and employment situation had limited influence on the association between hypothyroidism and cancer. However, hypothyroid patients receiving replacement therapy exhibited higher cancer risk compared with patients without treatment (OR 1.30 [1.28–1.31]; P&lt;0.0001). Conclusion Spanish hypothyroid patients of both genders have a risk of overall cancer higher than that found in non-hypothyroid population. However, people over 65 years have a reduced risk of various malignancies. This peculiarity of hypothyroidism should be considered by the health authorities."
https://openalex.org/W4302275314,"The viral load of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 varies on logarithmic scales and possibly with age. Controversial claims have been made in the literature regarding whether the viral load distribution actually depends on the age of the patients. Such a dependence would have implications for the COVID-19 spreading mechanism, the age-dependent immune system reaction, and thus for policymaking. We hereby develop a method to analyze viral-load distribution data as a function of the patients' age within a flexible, non-parametric, hierarchical, Bayesian, and causal model. The causal nature of the developed reconstruction additionally allows to test for bias in the data. This could be due to, e.g., bias in patient-testing and data collection or systematic errors in the measurement of the viral load. We perform these tests by calculating the Bayesian evidence for each implied possible causal direction. The possibility of testing for bias in data collection and identifying causal directions can be very useful in other contexts as well. For this reason we make our model freely available. When applied to publicly available age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load data, we find a statistically significant increase in the viral load with age, but only for one of the two analyzed datasets. If we consider this dataset, and based on the current understanding of viral load's impact on patients' infectivity, we expect a non-negligible difference in the infectivity of different age groups. This difference is nonetheless too small to justify considering any age group as noninfectious."

In order to explore the fracture evolution characteristics close to a mined coal seam group, the F15.16-24130 working face in the Pingdingshan No. 10 coal mine was taken as the research background. The FLAC3D numerical simulation software was used to study the migration and failure characteristics of the overlying strata during mining of a coal seam group, and the fracture evolution process of the stope was investigated. The results show that as the advancing distance increased, the fracture density and fracture height increased continuously due to deformation and failure of the overlying rock. The displacement of the overlying rock initially increased and then decreased, and the displacement of the floor rock initially decreased and then increased. When working face F15.16 of the coal seam advanced to 75 m, a saddle-shaped plastic zone gradually formed in the upper part of the goaf and the floor of the goaf was formed. The pressure relief depth was proportional to the advancement distance. As the advancement distance of the working face increased, the pressure relief depth gradually extended to the F17 coal seam, which was conducive to the development and penetration of the fractures in the coal floor and rock mass and was convenient for pressure relief gas drainage from the F17 coal seam."

In the current research, we took a behavioral approach to analyze positive and negative perception tendencies between European Canadians, Asian Canadians and Koreans. In Study 1 and 2, participants were asked to bet on their expectation of success on a given task and then perform the task. The betting behaviors and actual performance were used to quantify positive and negative perception tendencies. In Study 1, we did not find cultural differences in positive and negative illusions. Positive self-perceptions were also not associated with higher self-reported well-being. In Study 2, we employed the same research design as Study 1, and we included a measure of perceived desirability to examine whether perceived desirability of the performance tasks are related to the two illusions indices. The results from Study 2 replicated the findings from Study 1, and perceived desirability did not influence the results. Our findings suggest that North Americans do not always exhibit more positive self-perceptions than Asians, suggesting that North Americans do not always view the self through rose-colored lenses."
https://openalex.org/W4302011986,"The pork tapeworm Taenia solium is a zoonotic food-borne parasite endemic in many developing countries causing human cysticercosis and taeniosis as well as porcine cysticercosis. It mainly affects the health of rural smallholder pig farmers and their communities, resulting in lower health status, reduced pork quality, and economic loss due to condemnation of pigs or low pricing of pork. This qualitative study aimed to identify key food related practices linked to consumption of pork at village level, of importance for transmission of taeniosis. We used an interpretivist-constructivist paradigm in a multiple case study of exploratory qualitative research design. Data was acquired through guided and probing interviews with 64 pork cooks, and 14 direct observations in four villages in a T. solium endemic area of Mbeya Region in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. The study showed that the informants were members of communities of practice through their pork cooking practices, one community of practice for the restaurant cooks and one for the home cooks, learning, sharing, and distributing their cooking skills. Furthermore, the analysis showed that the pork cooks generally had some awareness of there being something undesirable in raw pork, but they had very diverse understandings of what it was, or of its potential harm. Major potential transmission points were identified in restaurants and in home kitchens. It appears that the pork cooks act according to socio-cultural and economic factors guiding them in their actions, including pressure from customers in restaurants, the family values of tradition in the home kitchens, and the culturally guided risk perception and appraisal. These practices might generate potential transmission points. Future research on interventions aimed at preventing the spread of T. solium taeniosis should recognise the importance of tradition and culture in risky food practices."

https://openalex.org/W4302012017,"The Neotropical avian genus Thraupis (Passeriformes, Thraupidae) currently comprises seven species that are widespread and abundant throughout their ranges. However, no phylogenetic hypothesis with comprehensive intraspecific sampling is available for the group and, therefore, currently accepted species limits remain untested. We obtained sequence data for two mitochondrial (ND2, cyt-b) and three non-coding nuclear (TGFB2, MUSK, and βF5) markers from 118 vouchered museum specimens. We conducted population structure and coalescent-based species-tree analyses using a molecular clock calibration. We integrated these results with morphometric and coloration analyses of 1,003 museum specimens to assess species limits within Thraupis. Our results confirm that Thraupis is a monophyletic group and support its origin in the late Miocene and subsequent diversification during the Pleistocene. However, we found conflicts with previous phylogenies. We recovered Thraupis glaucocolpa to be sister to all other species in the genus, and T. cyanoptera to the remaining five species. Our phylogenetic trees and population structure analyses uncovered phylogeographic structure within Thraupis episcopus that is congruent with geographic patterns of phenotypic variation and distributions of some named taxa. The first genetic and phenotypic cluster in T. episcopus occurs east of the Andes and is diagnosed by the white patch on the lesser and median wing coverts, whereas the second group has a blue patch on the wing and distributes to the west of Colombia's eastern Andes. Finally, we present evidence of hybridization and ongoing gene flow between several taxa at different taxonomic levels and discuss its taxonomic implications."
https://openalex.org/W4302012049,"The integrated energy system (IES) optimal scheduling under the comprehensive flexible operation mode of pumping storage is considered. This system is conducive to the promotion of the accommodation of wind and solar energy and can meet the water, electricity and heat needs of coastal areas far away from the energy center. In this study, the joint dispatch between double pumped storage power stations is used to accommodate wind and solar energy better and smooth their fluctuations on the grid. Through the scheduling of water between the high and low reservoirs of double pumped storage power stations and the reservoir of the seawater desalination plant, the impact of storage capacity constraints on pumped storage power plants is reduced. Moreover, the objective function to build the IES optimization scheduling model is to achieve minimum economic cost. The results reveal that the integrated energy system accommodates all wind energy and solar energy. As such, the system increases the average working time of the pumped storage unit by 1.9 hours and reduces the economic cost by 31.50%. Based on the simulation results, the model can enhance the accommodation capability of wind energy and solar energy and improve the system economy."
https://openalex.org/W4302012061,"Introduction Inadequate, inefficient and slow processing of claims are major contributors to the cost of health insurance schemes, and therefore undermining their sustainability. This study uses the Technology, Organisation and Environment (TOE) framework to examine the preparedness of health facilities of the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) to implement a digital mobile health insurance claims processing software (CLAIM-it), which aims to increase efficiency. Methods The study used a cross-sectional mixed method design to collect data (technology and human capital capacity and baseline operational performance of claims management) from a sample of 20 CHAG health facilities across Ghana. While quantitative data was analysed using simple descriptive statistics statistics (frequencies, mean, minimum and maximum values), qualitative interviews were recorded, transcribed and abstracted into two major themes that were reported to re-enforce the quantitative findings. Results The quantitative results revealed challenges including inadequate computers and accessories, adequate numbers and skills for claims processing, poor intranets and internet access, absence of a robust post-implementation support system and inadequate standard operating procedures (SOPs) for seamless automation of claims processing. In addition to the above, the qualitative results emphasised the need to make CLAIM-it more flexible and capable of being integrated into third-party softwares. Notwithstanding the challenges, decision-makers in CHAG health facilities see the CLAIM-it software as having better functionality and superior capabilities compared to existing claims processing systems in Ghana. Conclusion Notwithstanding the challenges, the CLAIM-it software is more likely to be adopted by decision-makers, given the positive perception in terms of superior functionality. It is important that key actors in claims management at the National Health Insurance collaborate with relevant stakeholders to adopt the CLAIM-it software for claims processing and management in Ghana."

This impairment is modeled in effort-based decision tasks, and neuropharmacological studies implicate dopamine in this process. However, other transmitter systems such as opioidergic and cholinergic systems have received less attention. Here, in two separate studies we tested the acute effects of naltrexone and nicotine on effort-based decision-making in healthy adults. In Study 1, we compared naltrexone (50mg and 25mg) to placebo, and in Study 2, a pilot study, we compared nicotine (7mg) to placebo. In both studies, participants completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), which measured effort-based decision-making related to monetary rewards. Although subjects expended greater effort for larger reward magnitude and when there was a higher probability of receiving the reward, neither naltrexone nor nicotine affected willingness to exert effort for monetary rewards. Although the drugs produced significant and typical drug effects on measures of mood and behavior, they did not alter effort-based decision-making. This has implications both for the clinical use of these drugs, as well as for understanding the neuropharmacology of effort-related behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4302012081,"Dry hot wind (DHW) is one of the main agro-meteorological disasters that occur during the grain filling stage of winter wheat in northern China. In this study, three major winter wheat cultivars planted at the Mazhuang experimental station, Xinji city, Hebei Province, including Henong 6119 (HN6119), Gaoyou 5218 (GY5218), and Jimai 325 (JM325), were analyzed. Through natural DHW and artificially simulated DHW experiments, we investigated how the physiological parameters of the three cultivars were affected on the day with DHW and the day before and after DHW occurred. Comparative analysis of the different responses among the physiological parameters of the three cultivars demonstrated that HN6119 experienced less leaf water loss by reducing its stomata conductance and transpiration rate under natural DHW conditions, while GY5218 and JM325 experienced more leaf water loss by increasing their stomata conductance and transpiration rates under natural DHW conditions. The net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomata conductance of HN6119 recovered after the DHW conditions, while those of GY5218 and JM325 showed a continuously decreasing trend. The leaf photosynthetic water use efficiency decreased on DHW days because the net photosynthesis rate was reduced for HN6119, but the transpiration rate increased for GY5218 and JM325. HN6119 showed a significant positive correlation between physiological parameters, while GY5218 and JM325 showed a poor correlation after being affected by DHW conditions. The effect of artificial simulation under mild and severe DHW stress on the thousand kernel weight (TKW) of HN6119, GY5218 and JM325 was 0.01%, 3.51%, 3.57% and 0.36%, 8.12%, 8.84%, respectively. HN6119 showed better resistance to DHW, followed by GY5218, and JM325 showed the weakest resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4302012091,"During community ambulation, anticipatory adaptations in gait are key for navigating built, populated and natural environments. It has been argued that some instability in gait can be functionally beneficial in situations demanding high maneuverability, and while the mechanisms utilized to maintain locomotor balance are well understood, relatively less is known about how the control of gait stability changes to facilitate upcoming maneuvers in challenging environments. The double support phase may be important in this regard; since both feet can push off the ground simultaneously, there is greater control authority over the body’s movement during this phase. Our goal was to identify how this control authority is exploited to prepare for upcoming maneuvers in challenging environments. We used synergy indices to quantify the degree of coordination between the ground reaction forces and moments under the two feet for stabilizing the resultant force and moment on the body during the double support phase of curb descent. In contrast to our expectations, we observed that the kinetic synergy indices during curb descent were minimally influenced by expected foot targeting maneuvers for the subsequent step. Only the resultant moment in the frontal plane showed reduced stability when targeting was required, but the synergy index was still high, indicating that the resultant moment was stable. Furthermore, the synergy indices indicated that the main function of the ground reaction variables is to maintain stability of whole-body rotations during double support, and this prerogative was minimally influenced by the subsequent foot targeting tasks, likely because the cost of losing balance while descending a curb would be higher than the cost of mis-stepping on a visual target. Our work demonstrates the salience of stabilizing body rotations during curb negotiation and improves our understanding of locomotor control in challenging environments."
https://openalex.org/W4302012131,"miRNAs play a crucial role in the development and growth of plants by inhibiting the function of targeted genes at the post-transcription level. However, no miRNAs in Pseudostellaria heterophylla have been reported and their function in the morphogenesis of organs is still unclear. In this study, a total of 159 conserved miRNAs (belonging to 64 families) and 303 level miRNAs were identified from P. heterophylla. Some of them showed specifically up or down-regulated expression in different tissues and numbers of unigenes involved in Plant-pathogen interaction and MAPK signaling pathway-plant were targeted. The significant negative correlation of expression profiles between 30 miRNAs and their target genes (37 unigenes) was observed, respectively. Further, a large number of genes involved with signal transduction of auxin, zeatin, abscisic acid and, jasmonic acid were targeted. Predicated targets of two miRNAs were validated by 5'RLM-RACE, respectively. A large number of mRNAs from four pathogens were targeted by miRNAs from P. heterophylla and some of them were targeted by miR414. In summary, we reported a population of miRNAs from four different vegetative tissues of P. heterophylla by high throughput sequencing, which was analyzed by combining with the constructed transcriptome. These results may help to explain the function of miRNAs in the morphogenesis of organs and defense of pathogens, and may provide theoretical basis for breeding and genetic improvement of P. heterophylla."
https://openalex.org/W4302012136,"Numerous wearables are used in a research context to record cardiac activity although their validity and usability has not been fully investigated. The objectives of this study is the cross-model comparison of data quality at different realistic use cases (cognitive and physical tasks). The recording quality is expressed by the ability to accurately detect the QRS complex, the amount of noise in the data, and the quality of RR intervals.Five ECG devices (eMotion Faros 360°, Hexoskin Hx1, NeXus-10 MKII, Polar RS800 Multi and SOMNOtouch NIBP) were attached and simultaneously tested in 13 participants. Used test conditions included: measurements during rest, treadmill walking/running, and a cognitive 2-back task. Signal quality was assessed by a new local morphological quality parameter morphSQ which is defined as a weighted peak noise-to-signal ratio on percentage scale. The QRS detection performance was evaluated with eplimited on synchronized data by comparison to ground truth annotations. A modification of the Smith-Waterman algorithm has been used to assess the RR interval quality and to classify incorrect beat annotations. Evaluation metrics includes the positive predictive value, false negative rates, and F1 scores for beat detection performance.All used devices achieved sufficient signal quality in non-movement conditions. Over all experimental phases, insufficient quality expressed by morphSQ values below 10% was only found in 1.22% of the recorded beats using eMotion Faros 360°whereas the rate was 8.67% with Hexoskin Hx1. Nevertheless, QRS detection performed well across all used devices with positive predictive values between 0.985 and 1.000. False negative rates are ranging between 0.003 and 0.017. eMotion Faros 360°achieved the most stable results among the tested devices with only 5 false positive and 19 misplaced beats across all recordings identified by the Smith-Waterman approach.Data quality was assessed by two new approaches: analyzing the noise-to-signal ratio using morphSQ, and RR interval quality using Smith-Waterman. Both methods deliver comparable results. However the Smith-Waterman approach allows the direct comparison of RR intervals without the need for signal synchronization whereas morphSQ can be computed locally."
https://openalex.org/W4302028471,"The 2013–2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex outbreak ever, with a total number of cases and deaths higher than in all previous EBOV outbreaks combined. The outbreak was characterized by rapid spread of the infection in nations that were weakly prepared to handle it. EBOV ribonucleic acid (RNA) is known to persist in body fluids following disease recovery, and studying this persistence is crucial for controlling such epidemics. Observational cohort studies investigating EBOV persistence in semen require following up recently recovered survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD), from recruitment to the time when their semen tests negative for EBOV, the endpoint being time-to-event. Because recruitment of EVD survivors takes place weeks or months following disease recovery, the event of interest may have already occurred. Survival analysis methods are the best suited for the estimation of the virus persistence in body fluids but must account for left- and interval-censoring present in the data, which is a more complex problem than that of presence of right censoring alone. Using the Sierra Leone Ebola Virus Persistence Study, we discuss study design issues, endpoint of interest and statistical methodologies for interval- and right-censored non-parametric and parametric survival modelling. Using the data from 203 EVD recruited survivors, we illustrate the performance of five different survival models for estimation of persistence of EBOV in semen. The interval censored survival analytic methods produced more precise estimates of EBOV persistence in semen and were more representative of the source population than the right censored ones. The potential to apply these methods is enhanced by increased availability of statistical software to handle interval censored survival data. These methods may be applicable to diseases of a similar nature where persistence estimation of pathogens is of interest."
https://openalex.org/W4302275436,"The question of how people change their opinions through social interactions has been on the agenda of social scientific research for many decades. Now that the Internet has led to an ever greater interconnectedness and new forms of exchange that seem to go hand in hand with increasing political polarization, it is once again gaining in relevance. Most recently, the field of opinion dynamics has been complemented by social feedback theory, which explains opinion polarization phenomena by means of a reinforcement learning mechanism. According to the assumptions, individuals not only evaluate the opinion alternatives available to them based on the social feedback received as a result of expressing an opinion within a certain social environment. Rather, they also internalize the expected and thus rewarded opinion to the point where it becomes their actual private opinion. In order to put the implications of social feedback theory to a test, we conducted a randomized controlled laboratory experiment. The study combined preceding and follow-up opinion measurements via online surveys with a laboratory treatment. Social feedback was found to have longer-term effects on private opinions, even when received in an anonymous and sanction free setting. Interestingly and contrary to our expectations, however, it was the mixture of supportive and rejective social feedback that resulted in the strongest influence. In addition, we observed a high degree of opinion volatility, highlighting the need for further research to help identify additional internal and external factors that might influence whether and how social feedback affects private opinions."
https://openalex.org/W4302275772,"Germination and seedling establishment for transplanting into hydroponics often uses porous substrates, but fine roots grow into these substrates, and they cannot be removed without damaging these roots. Seedlings transplanted without removal of substrates can cause interactions with solution chemistry or addition of particulates to the nutrient solution. Germination of seeds on slant boards is clean, uniform, and reduces the time to transplanting. Slant boards facilitate development of long roots, which maximize exposure of the primary root to the nutrient solution after transplanting. The ""boards"" are made from thin acrylic or polycarbonate sheets with germination paper on top. Seeds are held in place by covering with thin paper before vertical placement of the boards in the container. Four to twelve days later, the seedlings with long roots can be removed from the paper without damage and transplanted into the hydroponic system. Here we describe slant board construction and procedures for rapid germination and transplanting in hydroponics."
https://openalex.org/W4302275963,"Background Globally, under-five mortality rates have dropped, but in Ethiopia, the under-five mortality rate is still high. In Amhara region, the death of children under the age of five is still a public health problem. This study assessed the risk factors of mortality among children under age five in Awi Zone. Method A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from December 1, 2020, up to April 30, 2021. Data entry and analysis were conducted using SPSS version 26 and Stata version 16, respectively. A zero-inflated Poisson regression model was fitted to identify the risk factors of under-five mortality. Result Out of the 1,340 mothers in the Awi zone, 11.9% of women lost at least one child. Single births (IRR = 0.598, 95% CI: 0.395, 0.906), fathers whose level of education is secondary or above(IRR = 0.223, 95% CI: 0.064, 0.782), mothers who completed their secondary and above education level(IRR = 0.116, 95% CI: 0.014, 0.971), mothers who have birth interval greater than 24 months (IRR = 0.619,95% CI: 0.417, 0.917), 8 and above family size the households (IRR = 0.543, 95% CI: 0.302, 0.976), 31 and above mother age groups (IRR = 0.296, 95% CI: 0.093, 0.943), medium households of mothers (IRR = 0.540, 95% CI: 0.316, 0.920), working mothers (IRR = 1.691, 95% CI: 1.040, 2.748) and mothers who had not antenatal visits during pregnancy (IRR = 2.060, 95% CI: 1.259, 3.371) were significant factors of under-five mortality. Conclusion Mother’s age group, preceding birth interval, family size, wealth index, duration of pregnancy, antenatal visits during pregnancy, types of birth, mother’s education level, husband’s education level, and place of delivery were significant factors of under-five mortality in Awi zone. So, Awi zone public health institute, Awi zone children’s and youth office, and other relevant bodies should work to reduce under-five mortality by focusing on child mortality issues."
https://openalex.org/W4302275992,"Euonymus hamiltonianus and its relatives (Celastraceae family) are used for ornamental and medicinal purposes. However, species identification in Euonymus is difficult due to their morphological diversity. Using plastid genome (plastome) data, we attempt to reveal phylogenetic relationship among Euonymus species and develop useful markers for molecular identification. We assembled the plastome and nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) sequences from five Euonymus lines collected from South Korea: three Euonymus hamiltonianus accessions, E . europaeus , and E . japonicus . We conducted an in-depth comparative analysis using ten plastomes, including other publicly available plastome data for this genus. The genome structures, gene contents, and gene orders were similar in all Euonymus plastomes in this study. Analysis of nucleotide diversity revealed six divergence hotspots in their plastomes. We identified 339 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 293 insertion or deletions among the four E . hamiltonianus plastomes, pointing to abundant diversity even within the same species. Among 77 commonly shared genes, 9 and 33 were identified as conserved genes in the genus Euonymus and E . hamiltonianus , respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on plastome and nrDNA sequences revealed the overall consensus and relationships between plastomes and nrDNAs. Finally, we developed six barcoding markers and successfully applied them to 31 E . hamiltonianus lines collected from South Korea. Our findings provide the molecular basis for the classification and molecular taxonomic criteria for the genus Euonymus (at least in Korea), which should aid in more objective classification within this genus. Moreover, the newly developed markers will be useful for understanding the species delimitation of E . hamiltonianus and closely related species."
