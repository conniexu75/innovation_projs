https://openalex.org/W1981726010,"Exon circularization has been identified from many loci in mammals, but the detailed mechanism of its biogenesis has remained elusive. By using genome-wide approaches and circular RNA recapitulation, we demonstrate that exon circularization is dependent on flanking intronic complementary sequences. Such sequences and their distribution exhibit rapid evolutionary changes, showing that exon circularization is evolutionarily dynamic. Strikingly, exon circularization efficiency can be regulated by competition between RNA pairing across flanking introns or within individual introns. Importantly, alternative formation of inverted repeated Alu pairs and the competition between them can lead to alternative circularization, resulting in multiple circular RNA transcripts produced from a single gene. Collectively, exon circularization mediated by complementary sequences in human introns and the potential to generate alternative circularization products extend the complexity of mammalian posttranscriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2046178144,"Cancer cells can divert metabolites into anabolic pathways to support their rapid proliferation and to accumulate the cellular building blocks required for tumour growth. However, the specific bioenergetic profile of invasive and metastatic cancer cells is unknown. Here we report that migratory/invasive cancer cells specifically favour mitochondrial respiration and increased ATP production. Invasive cancer cells use the transcription coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A, also known as PGC-1α) to enhance oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial biogenesis and the oxygen consumption rate. Clinical analysis of human invasive breast cancers revealed a strong correlation between PGC-1α expression in invasive cancer cells and the formation of distant metastases. Silencing of PGC-1α in cancer cells suspended their invasive potential and attenuated metastasis without affecting proliferation, primary tumour growth or the epithelial-to-mesenchymal program. Inherent genetics of cancer cells can determine the transcriptome framework associated with invasion and metastasis, and mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration induced by PGC-1α are also essential for functional motility of cancer cells and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2090211843,"Current antibiotics tend to be broad spectrum, leading to indiscriminate killing of commensal bacteria and accelerated evolution of drug resistance. Here, we use CRISPR-Cas technology to create antimicrobials whose spectrum of activity is chosen by design. RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs) targeting specific DNA sequences are delivered efficiently to microbial populations using bacteriophage or bacteria carrying plasmids transmissible by conjugation. The DNA targets of RGNs can be undesirable genes or polymorphisms, including antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Delivery of RGNs significantly improves survival in a Galleria mellonella infection model. We also show that RGNs enable modulation of complex bacterial populations by selective knockdown of targeted strains based on genetic signatures. RGNs constitute a class of highly discriminatory, customizable antimicrobials that enact selective pressure at the DNA level to reduce the prevalence of undesired genes, minimize off-target effects and enable programmable remodeling of microbiota."

https://openalex.org/W2047918294,"The intrinsic ability to exhibit self-organizing morphogenetic properties in ex vivo culture may represent a general property of tissue stem cells. Here we show that single luminal stem/progenitor cells can generate prostate organoids in a three-dimensional culture system in the absence of stroma. Organoids generated from CARNs (castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells) or normal prostate epithelia exhibit tissue architecture containing luminal and basal cells, undergo long-term expansion in culture and exhibit functional androgen receptor signalling. Lineage-tracing demonstrates that luminal cells are favoured for organoid formation and generate basal cells in culture. Furthermore, tumour organoids can initiate from CARNs after oncogenic transformation and from mouse models of prostate cancer, and can facilitate analyses of drug response. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the feasibility of organoid studies of human prostate tissue. Our studies underscore the progenitor properties of luminal cells, and identify in vitro approaches for studying prostate biology. Shen and colleagues report the in vitro generation of organoids from mouse luminal epithelial progenitor cells and normal or transformed prostate tissue, and extend this approach to the formation of normal and tumour organoids of human origin"
https://openalex.org/W2033263745,"The lateral habenula (LHb) is involved in reward, aversion, addiction and depression through descending interactions with several brain structures, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The VTA provides reciprocal inputs to LHb, but their actions are unclear. Here we show that the majority of rat and mouse VTA neurons innervating LHb coexpress markers for both glutamate signaling (vesicular glutamate transporter 2; VGluT2) and GABA signaling (glutamic acid decarboxylase; GAD, and vesicular GABA transporter; VGaT). A single axon from these mesohabenular neurons coexpresses VGluT2 protein and VGaT protein and, surprisingly, establishes symmetric and asymmetric synapses on LHb neurons. In LHb slices, light activation of mesohabenular fibers expressing channelrhodopsin2 driven by VGluT2 (Slc17a6) or VGaT (Slc32a1) promoters elicits release of both glutamate and GABA onto single LHb neurons. In vivo light activation of mesohabenular terminals inhibits or excites LHb neurons. Our findings reveal an unanticipated type of VTA neuron that cotransmits glutamate and GABA and provides the majority of mesohabenular inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2067915400,"Native AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the mammalian brain are macromolecular complexes whose functional characteristics vary across the different brain regions and change during postnatal development or in response to neuronal activity. The structural and functional properties of the AMPARs are determined by their proteome, the ensemble of their protein building blocks. Here we use high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry to analyze the entire pool of AMPARs affinity-isolated from distinct brain regions, selected sets of neurons, and whole brains at distinct stages of postnatal development. These analyses show that the AMPAR proteome is dynamic in both space and time: AMPARs exhibit profound region specificity in their architecture and the constituents building their core and periphery. Likewise, AMPARs exchange many of their building blocks during postnatal development. These results provide a unique resource and detailed contextual data sets for the analysis of native AMPAR complexes and their role in excitatory neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W2066446030,"Emerging evidence suggests that cancer is populated and maintained by tumour-initiating cells (TICs) with stem-like properties similar to those of adult tissue stem cells. Despite recent advances, the molecular regulatory mechanisms that may be shared between normal and malignant stem cells remain poorly understood. Here we show that the ΔNp63 isoform of the Trp63 transcription factor promotes normal mammary stem cell (MaSC) activity by increasing the expression of the Wnt receptor Fzd7, thereby enhancing Wnt signalling. Importantly, Fzd7-dependent enhancement of Wnt signalling by ΔNp63 also governs tumour-initiating activity of the basal subtype of breast cancer. These findings establish ΔNp63 as a key regulator of stem cells in both normal and malignant mammary tissues and provide direct evidence that breast cancer TICs and normal MaSCs share common regulatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2119707473,"Confidence judgments are a central example of metacognition-knowledge about one's own cognitive processes. According to this metacognitive view, confidence reports are generated by a second-order monitoring process based on the quality of internal representations about beliefs. Although neural correlates of decision confidence have been recently identified in humans and other animals, it is not well understood whether there are brain areas specifically important for confidence monitoring. To address this issue, we designed a postdecision temporal wagering task in which rats expressed choice confidence by the amount of time they were willing to wait for reward. We found that orbitofrontal cortex inactivation disrupts waiting-based confidence reports without affecting decision accuracy. Furthermore, we show that a normative model can quantitatively account for waiting times based on the computation of decision confidence. These results establish an anatomical locus for a metacognitive report, confidence judgment, distinct from the processes required for perceptual decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2050543389,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurological disorder characterized by synaptic loss and dementia. The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is an essential coreceptor for Wnt signaling, and its genetic variants have been linked to AD risk. Here we report that neuronal LRP6-mediated Wnt signaling is critical for synaptic function and cognition. Conditional deletion of Lrp6 gene in mouse forebrain neurons leads to age-dependent deficits in synaptic integrity and memory. Neuronal LRP6 deficiency in an amyloid mouse model also leads to exacerbated amyloid pathology due to increased APP processing to amyloid-β. In humans, LRP6 and Wnt signaling are significantly downregulated in AD brains, likely by a mechanism that depends on amyloid-β. Our results define a critical pathway in which decreased LRP6-mediated Wnt signaling, synaptic dysfunction, and elevated Aβ synergistically accelerate AD progression and suggest that restoring LRP6-mediated Wnt signaling can be explored as a viable strategy for AD therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1969193847,"The epicardium supports cardiomyocyte proliferation early in development and provides fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells to the developing heart. The epicardium has been shown to play an important role during tissue remodeling after cardiac injury, making access to this cell lineage necessary for the study of regenerative medicine. Here we describe the generation of epicardial lineage cells from human pluripotent stem cells by stage-specific activation of the BMP and WNT signaling pathways. These cells display morphological characteristics and express markers of the epicardial lineage, including the transcription factors WT1 and TBX18 and the retinoic acid-producing enzyme ALDH1A2. When induced to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the cells give rise to populations that display characteristics of the fibroblast and vascular smooth muscle lineages. These findings identify BMP and WNT as key regulators of the epicardial lineage in vitro and provide a model for investigating epicardial function in human development and disease."

A similar attention field suggests that spatial attention transforms different neural response selectivities throughout the visual hierarchy in a similar manner. Voluntary attention directed at a visual location, i.e., endogenous spatial attention, represents a major influence of our cognitive state on neural processing and visual perception (Anton-Erxleben and Carrasco, 2013Anton-Erxleben K.

USA. 1999; 96: 2585-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Models based on Gaussian interactions capture many aspects of these attentional effects. These models incorporate a multiplication of two Gaussian components (Reynolds and Heeger, 2009Reynolds J.H. Heeger D.J. The normalization model of attention.Neuron. 2009; 61: 168-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, Womelsdorf et al., 2008Womelsdorf T. Anton-Erxleben K. Treue S. Receptive field shift and shrinkage in macaque middle temporal area through attentional gain modulation.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8934-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the case of spatial attention, the first of these, the stimulus-driven receptive field, represents each neuron’s response selectivity in the absence of attention. The second component, the attention field, represents attention’s influence and is centered at the attended location, regardless of the receptive fields with which it interacts. The product of these two components predicts the neural receptive field measured under the influence of attention. Specifically, this Gaussian multiplication predicts a shrinkage of receptive fields and a reweighting of the spatial response selectivity toward the attended location (Figure 1 B). Indeed, such reweighting of response selectivity toward attended locations has been observed in individual neurons in macaque V4 (Connor et al., 1996Connor C.E. Gallant J.L. Preddie D.C. Van Essen D.C. Responses in area V4 depend on the spatial relationship between stimulus and attention.J.

Dynamic shifts of visual receptive fields in cortical area MT by spatial attention.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1156-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, Womelsdorf et al., 2008Womelsdorf T.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8934-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), leading to attraction of position preferences toward the attended location. However, neither the entire visual field nor other visual areas were sampled. Gaussian interaction models predict that this reweighting of response selectivity, leading to changes in preferred position, should occur in all receptive fields throughout the visual field representation and visual hierarchy. Here, we ask whether preferred position changes are evident (i) in humans, (ii) throughout the visual field, and (iii) throughout the visual hierarchy. Capturing these effects with Gaussian interaction models allows us to examine (iv) how well these models describe changes in preferred position and (v) how the attention field changes throughout the visual hierarchy. To characterize these changes in response selectivity, we used high-field functional MRI (fMRI) (7T) to measure population receptive fields (pRFs) (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008Dumoulin S.O. Wandell B.A. Population receptive field estimates in human visual cortex.Neuroimage. 2008; 39: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) in five human subjects. Subjects fixated on the center of a display showing a visual field mapping stimulus (Amano et al., 2009Amano K. Wandell B.A. Dumoulin S.O.

Modeling center-surround configurations in population receptive fields using fMRI.J. Vis. 2012; 12: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) while performing an attention-demanding contrast discrimination task to the left or right of the display (Figure 1A). At these task locations lay circular patches of changing contrast-defined pink noise that randomly and independently increased in contrast. Subjects were instructed to report contrast increments of one covertly attended noise pattern, alternating sides between scanning runs (see Experimental Procedures and Movie S1). The pRF describes the aggregate spatial response selectivity of the neural population within a given cortical location in terms of preferred position (in horizontal and vertical dimensions) and spatial extent of the tuning function (σ) for both attention conditions separately. We assume that performing the task induces an attention field centered at the task location (Womelsdorf et al., 2008Womelsdorf T. Anton-Erxleben K. Treue S. Receptive field shift and shrinkage in macaque middle temporal area through attentional gain modulation.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8934-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Despite an identical stimulus and stimulus-driven pRF in both conditions (Figure 1B; SD pRF), Gaussian interaction models predict a change in the measured pRF position preference (Figure 1B; pRFl and pRFr) because of the change in attention field position (Figure 1B; AFl and AFr) between the two conditions. This change reflects the reweighting of the underlying spatial response selectivity toward the attended location. The hypothesized change in pRF preferred positions between the two conditions that produce equally sized attention fields at different locations is captured by the equationpRFpreferredpositionchange=(μAFr−μAFl)σSD2σAF2+σSD2,Equation 1 where the σSD is the stimulus-driven pRF size, σAF is the attention field size, and (μAFr − μAFl) represents the distance between the two attention field positions (see Experimental Procedures). Comparing between symmetrical attended locations cancels out the effects of distance to the attended location (Equation 10) such that the observed change in position preference does not depend on visual field position. Therefore, this approach highlights the changes in pRF preferred position due to spatial attention. Because we know both attended locations and because the stimulus-driven pRF size can be calculated from the measured pRF size and the attention field size (Equation 5), this Gaussian interaction model only has one parameter to fit: the attention field size (Equation 1). This parameter represents the magnitude of attention’s influence on spatial response selectivity, with smaller attention field sizes producing larger changes in preferred position. We found attention-induced changes in pRF preferred positions across all visual field positions and all visual field maps measured (V1 to IPS4). These preferred position changes increase up the visual hierarchy and are strongly correlated with pRF size. A Gaussian interaction model (Equation 1) captures these preferred position changes well and estimates the extent of the attention field that would predict the changes seen in each visual field map. The extent of the attention field does not show a systematic progression through the visual hierarchy. Indeed, a model constraining the attention field to be common across all visual field maps does similarly well in explaining the observed changes in pRF preferred position. As such, our model suggests that the increase in pRF preferred position changes up the visual hierarchy may be captured by similar transformations of the visual field representation. Thus, variations in the extent of preferred position change arise primarily from variations in the stimulus-driven pRF size. The similarity of this transformation suggests biological constancies in the implementation of spatial attention throughout the visual hierarchy. To examine the effect of the attentional manipulation on the raw fMRI time series, we computed the average response to each bar sweep relative to the center of each cortical location’s pRF (see Experimental Procedures). We averaged the responses to all bar crossings and attend-left and attend-right conditions separately. Figure 2 presents the average time series obtained from voxels in V3a within 2.5° of eccentricity in one subject when the subject attended the target on the left (black dashed line) or right (green dashed line) of fixation. When the bar moved from left to right (Figure 2A), the response rose and peaked earlier when the subject attended to the left compared to when they attended to the right of the display. However, fMRI responses are not affected by attended location when the bar moved from the top to the bottom of the stimulus display (Figure 2B). This indicates that the pRF’s response profile changes in the direction of the attentional manipulation, i.e., in the horizontal direction. We summarize these fMRI responses using pRF models (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008Dumoulin S.O. Wandell B.A. Population receptive field estimates in human visual cortex.Neuroimage. 2008; 39: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). For each cortical location and in each attention condition, these models describe a 2D difference of Gaussians function with four parameters: horizontal position (x), vertical position (y), size (standard deviation) of the positive Gaussian (σ1), and size (standard deviation) of the negative Gaussian (σ2) representing the suppressive surround (Zuiderbaan et al., 2012Zuiderbaan W. Harvey B.M. Dumoulin S.O. Modeling center-surround configurations in population receptive fields using fMRI.J. Vis. 2012; 12: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We used the position and size parameters of the positive Gaussian to compare the spatial response selectivity of each cortical location between the two attended locations. To summarize the pRF preferred position changes, we divided the cortical locations in each visual field map into 16 bins based on the mean pRF position preference across both conditions. For each section, we compared the mean pRF position when the subject attended the left and right targets (Figure 3 A; Figure S1, available online, shows the steps involved in the binning procedure). Preferred positions change with attended location across the entire sampled visual field, with the direction of change centered along the horizontal axis. To quantify the observed position changes, we describe the relationship between visual field eccentricity and preferred position change or pRF size using a linear function. We extract the middle of the stimulus eccentricity range (2.5°) from this function and use this as a representative value for pRF size or position change in each visual field map. Figures 3B and 3C illustrate the pRF preferred position change in each visual field map for one example subject and the average across all subjects, respectively. Positive values indicate preferred position changes in the direction that the attended location changed. pRF preferred position changes are significantly larger than zero (dependent samples t test, all p values < 10−6, corrected for upsampling and corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rates [FDRs]; Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. Controlling the False Discovery Rate: a Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing.J. R. Statist. Soc. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar) for each visual field map when data from all subjects are combined. The pRF preferred position change increases up the visual hierarchy, demonstrating an increasing effect of attention. Similarly, pRF sizes increase across the visual hierarchy (Figure 3D), consistent with previous reports (Amano et al., 2009Amano K. Wandell B.A. Dumoulin S.O. Visual field maps, population receptive field sizes, and visual field coverage in the human MT+ complex.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 102: 2704-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Harvey and Dumoulin, 2011Harvey B.M. Dumoulin S.O. The relationship between cortical magnification factor and population receptive field size in human visual cortex: constancies in cortical architecture.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13604-13612Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The pRF sizes in each visual field map correlate with the preferred position changes (Figures 3E and S3C) (Pearson’s correlation coefficient: r = 0.93, p < 10−5, n = 15). To examine the dependency of the preferred position changes on attention task and stimulus design, the experiment was repeated in three subjects (two of which participated in the main experiment) with a different stimulus and task (Movie S2). Despite the different task and mapping stimulus, the pRF preferred position changes measured during this experiment are highly correlated with those measured in the main experiment (Figures S3A and S3B; Pearson’s correlation coefficient: r = 0.88, p < 10−5). This demonstrates that pRF preferred position changes are not limited to our specific stimulus setup or task. Finally, we examined how much the cortical location of the stimulus’s neural representation changes between our two conditions due to these changes in pRF preferred positions. To calculate the pRF preferred position changes in millimeters along the cortical surface (Figure 3F), we computed the cortical magnification factor (see Experimental Procedures) of each cortical location on the gray/white matter boundary and multiplied this with its pRF preferred position change. Again, we use a linear function to describe the relation between the cortical shifts and eccentricity and extract a representative value at 2.5° eccentricity. Like the changes in pRF preferred positions, the shift in activation along the cortical surface increases up the visual hierarchy. Prior to fMRI scanning, subjects were trained to perform the task with minimal eye movements. Only if the subjects were able to do the task while keeping eye movements within a standard deviation of 0.25° did they continue to do the fMRI scanning sessions. We did not record the eye movement during the scanning sessions because of technical constraints. Because eye movements toward the attended targets might move pRF preferred position estimates toward the attended location, we simulated the effect of eye movements. We created three sets of simulated data by using a single data set from each participant and incorporated eye movements toward the attended target of 0.2°, 1°, and 2° (Levin et al., 2010Levin N. Dumoulin S.O. Winawer J. Dougherty R.F. Wandell B.A. Cortical maps and white matter tracts following long period of visual deprivation and retinal image restoration.Neuron. 2010; 65: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Next, we computed the pRF preferred position changes for each visual field map and plotted these changes as a function of pRF size (Figure 3E, gray dashed lines). Simulated directionally biased eye movements induce changes in pRF preferred positions but without a strong increase up the visual hierarchy or relationship with pRF size. To confirm these simulation results with experimental data, we collected fMRI data for two of our subjects while they viewed the same pRF mapping stimulus. The fixation point was positioned 0.5° either left or right of the center of the mapping stimulus, resulting in a 1° difference in eye position between the two conditions. Participants responded to color changes of the fixation point. Again, we computed the pRF preferred position changes and determined the linear fit between average pRF sizes and preferred position changes in each visual field map (Figure 3E, solid gray line [median fit]; Figure S3C, black data points). Again, pRF preferred position changes resulting from different gaze positions do not change with pRF size or visual field map. Thus, eye movements toward the attended targets induce a near-constant change in pRF preferred position regardless of pRF size and cannot explain the increase in pRF preferred position change with pRF size. Furthermore, a relationship between preferred position change and pRF size was also observed within every visual field map, including V1, V2, and V3 (Pearson’s correlation coefficient: r = 0.18, 0.29, and 0.32, respectively; all p values < 10−6, corrected for upsampling), which again is inconsistent with the pRF size-independent effect of eye movements. As eye movements toward the targets effectively add a constant to all changes in preferred position, the maximum eye movement-induced addition to changes in pRF preferred position can be estimated from the change in pRF preferred position in the smallest pRFs in V1. We estimate this as 0.17° (95% confidence interval [c.i.]: 0.16°–0.19°). When measured outside the scanner, subjects’ eye positions moved toward the attended target by a mean of 0.06° (95% c.i.: −0.04°–0.16°). Consequently, eye movements cannot explain the observed relationship between pRF size and pRF preferred position change either within or between visual field maps. Gaussian interaction models of attention explain the pRF preferred position changes using two components: the stimulus-driven pRF and the attention field. The increasingly large change in pRF preferred position seen up the hierarchy could be explained by an increase in stimulus-driven pRF size and/or a decrease in attention field size up the hierarchy. To examine these two possibilities, we estimated both components from the measured pRF sizes and preferred position changes. For each visual field map and subject (and data grouped across subjects), we determined the attention field size that captured the most variance in the pRF preferred positions between conditions across all cortical locations. The attention field estimation procedure (see Experimental Procedures) used changes in binned pRF preferred positions and the mean pRF size across both attention conditions. To quantify the variance explained by attention field models, we used a 400-fold cross-validation procedure, fitting an attention field to randomly selected halves of the binned data and evaluating the fit on the complementary half of the data. To quantify the maximum explainable variance given the noise in the data, the noise ceiling (Machens et al., 2004Machens C.K. Wehr M.S. Zador A.M. Linearity of cortical receptive fields measured with natural sounds.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, Mante et al., 2005Mante V. Frazor R.A. Bonin V. Geisler W.S. Carandini M. Independence of luminance and contrast in natural scenes and in the early visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1690-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), we measured how much of the binned pRF preferred position changes in one hemifield are captured by the preferred position changes in the complementary hemifield. Figure 4 A shows the measured pRF preferred position changes from Figure 3A overlaid with the change predicted by the best-fitting attention field for each visual field map. Figure 4B shows the estimated attention field size (AF size, dark gray bars) and stimulus-driven pRF size (SD pRF size, light gray bars) for each visual field map. The attention field sizes shown are the median and 95% confidence intervals of all fitting iterations; SD pRF sizes are a representative value extracted at the middle of the stimulus eccentricity range (2.5°). SD pRF sizes increase systematically up the visual hierarchy, whereas the AF sizes are similar across many visual field maps, with no clear tendency to increase or decrease (perhaps increasing through early visual field maps and decreasing through later maps). As such, SD pRF sizes predict differences in pRF preferred position changes between visual field maps, while AF sizes do not. The expected decrease in AF size up the hierarchy (which would increasingly strongly attract pRF preferred positions) was not found. Yet, differences in AF size between visual field maps were found. To examine whether there are any significant differences between the estimated attention fields, we first determined the overlap between the bootstrap distributions seen in Figure 4B, i.e., the probability that the attention field estimates are different for any two visual field maps. Probabilities were corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. Controlling the False Discovery Rate: a Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing.J. R. Statist. Soc. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). This reveals that attention field estimates in V1 and IPS1–IPS4 are significantly smaller than those in other visual field maps (Figure 4C). However, when excluding pRFs whose centers lay outside the stimulus window in either attention condition, the IPS maps do not have significantly different attention field sizes. At the same time, the lack of systematic changes in AF size up the hierarchy raises the possibility that AF size is similar in all visual field maps. To examine the amount of variance captured by differences in attention field size, we reran our attention field modeling procedure constrained to fit a common attention field to all visual field maps. A common attention field model (Figure 4D) explains 70.7% (95% c.i.: 66.7%–74.3%) of the variance in pRF preferred positions between conditions, which is not significantly different from attention fields for each individual visual field map, which explains 72.2% (95% c.i.: 67.0%–76.1%) of the variance (p = 0.64, Figure 4E). When examining the variance explained for separate visual field maps (Figure S4), no robustly significant reductions in variance explained are found when fitting a common attention field (all p values > 0.46, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons). However, statistical results from V1 depend on the analysis parameters. Consequently, the data suggest that an area-specific attention field may fit better in V1, but we do not have the statistical power to strongly accept or refute this difference. Thus, the variance explained by area-specific attention fields is not significantly greater than that explained by a common attention field fit to all visual field maps, except perhaps in V1. Although the Gaussian attention field model explains the observed preferred position changes well, we examined whether two other relationships can explain the observed changes. First, to test whether variance in pRF size affects preferred position changes, we fitted a constant preferred position change (constant PPC) in each visual field map irrespective of the pRF size. Gaussian attention field models, whether area specific or common, explain significantly more variance than constant preferred position change models (p = 0.001) (Figure 4E). Furthermore, the effect of pRF size on preferred position change within a visual field map is also supported by significant correlations between the pRF sizes and preferred position changes of cortical locations within every visual field map (all p values < 10−6). Second, to test whether the relationship between pRF size and preferred position change is described by a linear function (rather than the slightly nonlinear function predicted by Gaussian models), we tested models with the best-fitting linear relationship in each visual field map. This linear ratio model perform very similarly to Gaussian attention field models, as the Gaussian models closely approximate a linear function over small ranges of pRF sizes (Figure 4E). However, unlike for AF models, constraining the linear ratio model to use the same ratio for all visual field maps significantly reduces the variance explained by the model (75."

Consequently, compounds known to activate AMPK have been proposed as cancer therapeutics. However, the extent to which the anti-neoplastic properties of these agonists are mediated by AMPK is unclear. Here we examined the AMPK dependence of six commonly used AMPK agonists (metformin, phenformin, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), salicylate and A-769662) and their influence on cellular processes often deregulated in tumor cells. We demonstrate that the majority of these agonists display AMPK-independent effects on cell proliferation and metabolism with only the synthetic activator, A-769662, exerting AMPK-dependent effects on these processes. We find that A-769662 promotes an AMPK-dependent increase in mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity. Finally, contrary to the view of AMPK activity being tumor suppressive, we find that A-769662 confers a selective proliferative advantage to tumor cells growing under nutrient deprivation. Our results indicate that many of the antigrowth properties of these agonists cannot be attributed to AMPK activity in cells, and thus any observed effects using these agonists should be confirmed using AMPK-deficient cells. Ultimately, our data urge caution not only regarding the type of AMPK agonist proposed for cancer treatment but also the context in which they are used."
https://openalex.org/W1994403598,"Striatal dopamine transmission underlies numerous goal-directed behaviors. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are a major target of dopamine in the striatum. However, as dopamine does not directly evoke a synaptic event in MSNs, the time course of dopamine signaling in these cells remains unclear. To examine how dopamine release activates D2-receptors on MSNs, G protein activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK2; Kir 3.2) channels were virally overexpressed in the striatum, and the resulting outward currents were used as a sensor of D2-receptor activation. Electrical and optogenetic stimulation of dopamine terminals evoked robust D2-receptor inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in GIRK2-expressing MSNs that occurred in under a second. Evoked D2-IPSCs could be driven by repetitive stimulation and were not occluded by background dopamine tone. Together, the results indicate that D2-receptors on MSNs exhibit functional low affinity and suggest that striatal D2-receptors can encode both tonic and phasic dopamine signals."
https://openalex.org/W2081115093,"Aberrant signaling through the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase has been associated with a myriad of human diseases, most notably metastatic cancer, identifying Axl and its ligand Gas6 as important therapeutic targets. Using rational and combinatorial approaches, we engineered an Axl 'decoy receptor' that binds Gas6 with high affinity and inhibits its function, offering an alternative approach from drug discovery efforts that directly target Axl. Four mutations within this high-affinity Axl variant caused structural alterations in side chains across the Gas6-Axl binding interface, stabilizing a conformational change on Gas6. When reformatted as an Fc fusion, the engineered decoy receptor bound Gas6 with femtomolar affinity, an 80-fold improvement compared to binding of the wild-type Axl receptor, allowing effective sequestration of Gas6 and specific abrogation of Axl signaling. Moreover, increased Gas6 binding affinity was critical and correlative with the ability of decoy receptors to potently inhibit metastasis and disease progression in vivo."

Here the authors show that Nf1 heterozygous mice have deficits in social memory associated with alterations in amygdala plasticity and Map kinase signaling. Global deletion or amygdala-specific pharmacological inhibition of Pak1 rescued social deficits in Nf1 heterozygous mice. Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are increasingly recognized as having a high prevalence of social difficulties and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We demonstrated a selective social learning deficit in mice with deletion of a single Nf1 allele (Nf1+/−), along with greater activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in neurons from the amygdala and frontal cortex, structures that are relevant to social behaviors. The Nf1+/− mice showed aberrant amygdala glutamate and GABA neurotransmission, deficits in long-term potentiation and specific disruptions in the expression of two proteins that are associated with glutamate and GABA neurotransmission: a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 22 (Adam22) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), respectively. All of these amygdala disruptions were normalized by the additional deletion of the p21 protein-activated kinase (Pak1) gene. We also rescued the social behavior deficits in Nf1+/− mice with pharmacological blockade of Pak1 directly in the amygdala. These findings provide insights and therapeutic targets for patients with NF1 and ASDs."

https://openalex.org/W2038237495,"Primary cilia are important sensory organelles. They exist in a wide variety of lengths, which could reflect different cell-specific functions. How cilium length is regulated is unclear, but it probably involves intraflagellar transport (IFT), which transports protein complexes along the ciliary axoneme. Studies in various organisms have identified the small, conserved family of ros-cross hybridizing kinases (RCK) as regulators of cilium length. Here we show that Intestinal Cell Kinase (ICK) and MAPK/MAK/MRK overlapping kinase (MOK), two members of this family, localize to cilia of mouse renal epithelial (IMCD-3) cells and negatively regulate cilium length. To analyze the effects of ICK and MOK on the IFT machinery, we set up live imaging of five fluorescently tagged IFT proteins: KIF3B, a subunit of kinesin-II, the main anterograde IFT motor, complex A protein IFT43, complex B protein IFT20, BBSome protein BBS8 and homodimeric kinesin KIF17, whose function in mammalian cilia is unclear. Interestingly, all five proteins moved at ∼0.45 µm/s in anterograde and retrograde direction, suggesting they are all transported by the same machinery. Moreover, GFP tagged ICK and MOK moved at similar velocities as the IFT proteins, suggesting they are part of, or transported by the IFT machinery. Indeed, loss- or gain-of-function of ICK affected IFT speeds: knockdown increased anterograde velocities, whereas overexpression reduced retrograde speed. In contrast, MOK knockdown or overexpression did not affect IFT speeds. Finally, we found that the effects of ICK or MOK knockdown on cilium length and IFT are suppressed by rapamycin treatment, suggesting that these effects require the mTORC1 pathway. Our results confirm the importance of RCK kinases as regulators of cilium length and IFT. However, whereas some of our results suggest a direct correlation between cilium length and IFT speed, other results indicate that cilium length can be modulated independent of IFT speed."
https://openalex.org/W2006022605,"Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-associated deaths in men, and signaling via a transcription factor called androgen receptor (AR) is an important driver of the disease. Consequently, AR target genes are prominent candidates to be specific for prostate cancer and also important for the survival of the cancer cells. Here we assess the levels of all hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) enzymes in 15 separate clinical gene expression data sets and identify the last enzyme in the pathway, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1), to be highly overexpressed in prostate cancer. We analyzed 3261 prostate cancers on a tissue microarray and found that UAP1 staining correlates negatively with Gleason score (P=0.0039) and positively with high AR expression (P<0.0001). Cells with high UAP1 expression have 10-fold increased levels of the HBP end-product, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). UDP-GlcNAc is essential for N-linked glycosylation occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and high UAP1 expression associates with resistance against inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation (tunicamycin and 2-deoxyglucose) but not with a general ER stress-inducing agent, the calcium ionophore A23187. Knockdown of UAP1 expression re-sensitized cells towards inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation, as measured by proliferation and activation of ER stress markers. Taken together, we have identified an enzyme, UAP1, which is highly overexpressed in prostate cancer and protects cancer cells from ER stress conferring a growth advantage."
https://openalex.org/W2058714876,"Advances in sequencing have led to a rapid accumulation of mutations, some of which are associated with diseases. However, to draw mechanistic conclusions, a biochemical understanding of these mutations is necessary. For coding mutations, accurate prediction of significant changes in either the stability of proteins or their affinity to their binding partners is required. Traditional methods have used semi-empirical force fields, while newer methods employ machine learning of sequence and structural features. Here, we show how combining both of these approaches leads to a marked boost in accuracy. We introduce ELASPIC, a novel ensemble machine learning approach that is able to predict stability effects upon mutation in both, domain cores and domain-domain interfaces. We combine semi-empirical energy terms, sequence conservation, and a wide variety of molecular details with a Stochastic Gradient Boosting of Decision Trees (SGB-DT) algorithm. The accuracy of our predictions surpasses existing methods by a considerable margin, achieving correlation coefficients of 0.77 for stability, and 0.75 for affinity predictions. Notably, we integrated homology modeling to enable proteome-wide prediction and show that accurate prediction on modeled structures is possible. Lastly, ELASPIC showed significant differences between various types of disease-associated mutations, as well as between disease and common neutral mutations. Unlike pure sequence-based prediction methods that try to predict phenotypic effects of mutations, our predictions unravel the molecular details governing the protein instability, and help us better understand the molecular causes of diseases."

Our study aimed to resolve the lncRNA profile of larynx squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and to determine its clinical significance. The global lncRNA expression profile in LSCC tissues was measured by lncRNA microarray. Distinctly expressed lncRNAs were identified and levels of AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 lncRNAs in 87 LSCC samples and paired adjacent normal tissue were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The clinical significance of these lncRNAs in laryngeal cancer was analyzed and survival data were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and the log-rank test. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to check the diagnostic value. In the lncRNA expression profile of tumor samples, 684 lncRNAs were upregulated and 747 lncRNAs were downregulated (fold-change >2.0). Of these, AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 were distinctly dysregulated, with AC026166.2-001 exhibiting lower expression in cancer tissues and RP11-169D4.1-001 higher expression. We verified that both AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 were expressed at a lower level in cervical lymph nodes compared with paired laryngeal cancer tissues and paired normal tissues. RP11-169D4.1-001 levels were positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.007). From the survival analysis, decreased levels of AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 were associated with poorer prognosis. The area under the ROC curve was up to 0.65 and 0.67, respectively, and the cut-off point of ΔCt was 11.23 and 10.53, respectively. AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 may act as novel biomarkers in LSCC and may be potential therapeutic targets for LSCC patients.

Here, we describe an ER-localized HaloTag (ERHT) protein that can be conditionally destabilized using a small-molecule hydrophobic tag (HyT36). Treatment of ERHT-expressing cells with HyT36 induces acute, resolvable ER stress that results in transient UPR activation without induction of apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1980982863,"Progesterone (P4) has emerged as an important hormone-regulating mammary stem cell (MaSC) populations. In breast cancer, P4 and synthetic analogs increase the number of stem-like cells within luminal estrogen receptor (ER)- and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast cancers. These cells gain expression of de-differentiated cell markers CD44 and cytokeratin 5 (CK5), lose luminal markers ER and PR, and are more therapy resistant. We previously described that P4 downregulation of microRNA (miR)-29a contributes to the expansion of CD44(high) and CK5(+) cells. Here we investigated P4 downregulation of miR-141, a member of the miR-200 family of tumor suppressors, in facilitating an increase in stem-like breast cancer cells. miR-141 was the sole member of the miR-200 family P4-downregulated at the mature miRNA level in luminal breast cancer cell lines. Stable inhibition of miR-141 alone increased the CD44(high) population, and potentiated P4-mediated increases in both CD44(high) and CK5(+) cells. Loss of miR-141 enhanced both mammosphere formation and tumor initiation. miR-141 directly targeted both PR and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (Stat5a), transcription factors important for MaSC expansion. miR-141 depletion increased PR protein levels, even in cell lines where PR expression is estrogen dependent. Stat5a suppression via small interfering RNA or a small-molecule inhibitor reduced the P4-dependent increase in CK5(+) and CD44(high) cells. These data support a mechanism by which P4-triggered loss of miR-141 facilitates breast cancer cell de-differentiation through deregulation of PR and Stat5a, two transcription factors important for controlling mammary cell fate."

Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) are known to promote metastasis, but the mechanisms underlying their collaboration with tumor cells remain unknown. Here, we report an oncogenic role for microRNA (miR) in driving M2 reprogramming in TIMs, characterized by the acquisition of pro-tumor and pro-angiogenic properties. The expression of miR-21, miR-29a, miR-142-3p and miR-223 increased in myeloid cells during tumor progression in mouse models of breast cancer and melanoma metastasis. Further, we show that these miRs are regulated by the CSF1-ETS2 pathway in macrophages. A loss-of-function approach utilizing selective depletion of the miR-processing enzyme Dicer in mature myeloid cells blocks angiogenesis and metastatic tumor growth. Ectopic expression of miR-21 and miR-29a promotes angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation through the downregulation of anti-angiogenic genes such as Col4a2, Spry1 and Timp3, whereas knockdown of the miRs impedes these processes. miR-21 and miR-29a are expressed in Csf1r+ myeloid cells associated with human metastatic breast cancer, and levels of these miRs in CD115+ non-classical monocytes correlates with metastatic tumor burden in patients. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-21 and miR-29a are essential for the pro-tumor functions of myeloid cells and the CSF1-ETS2 pathway upstream of the miRs serves as an attractive therapeutic target for the inhibition of M2 remodeling of macrophages during malignancy. In addition, miR-21 and miR-29a in circulating myeloid cells may potentially serve as biomarkers to measure therapeutic efficacy of targeted therapies for CSF1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2006882960,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is a highly malignant brain tumor that occurs primarily in children. Although surgery, radiation and high-dose chemotherapy have led to increased survival, many MB patients still die from their disease, and patients who survive suffer severe long-term side effects as a consequence of treatment. Thus, more effective and less toxic therapies for MB are critically important. Development of such therapies depends in part on identification of genes that are necessary for growth and survival of tumor cells. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein that regulates cell cycle progression and resistance to apoptosis, is frequently expressed in human MB and when expressed at high levels predicts poor clinical outcome. Therefore, we hypothesized that Survivin may have a critical role in growth and survival of MB cells and that targeting it may enhance MB therapy. Here we show that Survivin is overexpressed in tumors from patched (Ptch) mutant mice, a model of Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-driven MB. Genetic deletion of survivin in Ptch mutant tumor cells significantly inhibits proliferation and causes cell cycle arrest. Treatment with small-molecule antagonists of Survivin impairs proliferation and survival of both murine and human MB cells. Finally, Survivin antagonists impede growth of MB cells in vivo. These studies highlight the importance of Survivin in SHH-driven MB, and suggest that it may represent a novel therapeutic target in patients with this disease."

Previous research suggests that casein kinase 2 (CK2) may be a promising therapeutic target for GBMs. CK2 has enhanced expression or activity in numerous cancers, including GBM, and it has been demonstrated that inhibitors of CK2 regressed tumor growth in GBM xenograft mouse models. Our studies demonstrate that the CK2 subunit, CK2α, is overexpressed in and has an important role in regulating brain tumor-initiating cells (BTIC) in GBM. Initial studies showed that two GBM cell lines (U87-MG and U138) transduced with CK2α had enhanced proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Inhibition of CKα using siRNA or small-molecule inhibitors (TBBz, CX-4945) reduced cell growth, decreased tumor size, and increased survival rates in GBM xenograft mouse models. We also verified that inhibition of CK2α decreased the activity of a well-known GBM-initiating cell regulator, β-catenin. Loss of CK2α decreased two β-catenin-regulated genes that are involved in GBM-initiating cell growth, OCT4 and NANOG. To determine the importance of CK2α in GBM stem cell maintenance, we reduced CK2α activity in primary GBM samples and tumor spheres derived from GBM patients. We discovered that loss of CK2α activity reduced the sphere-forming capacity of BTIC and decreased numerous GBM stem cell markers, including CD133, CD90, CD49f and A2B5. Our study suggests that CK2α is involved in GBM tumorigenesis by maintaining BTIC through the regulation of β-catenin."

Peripheral nerve injury leading to chronic pain is one of the most challenging types of pain to manage. Chronic pain is associated with a marked imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, leading to a state of persistent pain. In these conditions, pain arises spontaneously, noxious stimuli evoke an exaggerated and prolonged response (hyperalgesia), and innocuous stimuli become painful (allodynia) (Latremoliere and Woolf, 2009Latremoliere A.

Together, these arguments suggest that an efficient treatment of pain requires an extensive understanding of nociceptive neuronal physiology as well as the mechanisms that operate under pathological conditions to perpetuate pain perception. Furthermore, targeting painkiller drugs to primary nociceptive neurons might be particularly advantageous as they would bypass side effects related to central activity. The heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest and most diverse family of cell surface receptors. Their cellular localization and mode of action make them the most targeted receptors for pain therapy. Among these, GABAB receptors (GABAB-Rs) are of particular interest. GABAB-Rs are found at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the brain (Remondes and Schuman, 2003Remondes M. Schuman E.M.

Peripheral baclofen-mediated analgesia is caused by a strong inhibition of L-glutamate release from primary afferent terminals, namely the C-unmyelinated fibers (Ataka et al., 2000Ataka T.

Moreover, several studies have demonstrated an impairment of GABAergic inhibition in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in several nerve injury models, such as chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (CCI) and spared nerve injury (SNI) (Engle et al., 2012Engle M.P.

Whether primary sensory neurons are involved in this impairment of GABAergic signaling in pathological conditions remains under intense investigation. Here we describe the identification of GINIP, a plant homeodomain (PHD) and EF-hand containing protein that preferentially interacts with Gα inhibitory proteins. GINIP is expressed in two distinct subsets of nonpeptidergic nociceptors: the cutaneous free nerve ending MRGPRD-expressing neurons and TAFA4-expressing C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) (Delfini et al., 2013Delfini M.C.

Topographically distinct epidermal nociceptive circuits revealed by axonal tracers targeted to Mrgprd.Neuron. 2005; 45: 17-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). GINIP null mice exhibit prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity in models of inflammation and neuropathy without affecting thermal hyperalgesia. Importantly, GINIP null mice selectively resist reversal of SNI-evoked mechanical hyperalgesia by baclofen, but not by delta or mu opioid receptor agonists. Consistently, GINIP-deficient dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons display significantly lower baclofen-evoked inhibition of high-voltage-activated calcium channels that resulted in a defective baclofen-induced presynaptic inhibition of lamina IIi spinal cord interneurons. In an attempt to increase the repertoire of markers defining discrete subsets of primary nociceptive neurons, we used Affimetrix microarrays to compare global gene expression profiles of DRG of wild-type and trkAtrkC/trkC knockin mice at birth (Moqrich et al., 2004Moqrich A.

Among the several hundred potential markers identified, mkiaa1045 named GINIP (for Gα inhibitory interacting protein) encodes a highly conserved vertebrate 400 amino acid protein of unknown function (Figure 1 A). SMART program analysis showed that GINIP is endowed with two functional domains: a plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger and two putative EF hand domains. In order to assign a potential function to GINIP, we launched a yeast two-hybrid assay using the full-length GINIP as bait to screen an adult mouse brain cDNA library. Out of 134 million interactions tested, we identified 83 potential protein-protein interactions. Out of the 83 interactions, 44 contained Gαi1 encoded by 11 independent clones, 38 contained Gαi3 encoded by 6 independent clones, and 1 clone encoded a non-ATPase subunit of the proteasome Psmd11. As our yeast two-hybrid screen used a mouse brain cDNA library, we first checked the expression pattern of the three Gαi genes (gnai1, gnai2, and gnai3) in DRG neurons. In situ hybridization with a probe specific to endogenous gnai1, gnai2, and gnai3, followed by immunofluorescent labeling with a newly generated rat anti-GINIP antibody, demonstrated that Gαi1 is predominantly expressed in large-diameter neurons and largely excluded from GINIP+ neurons (12.8% ± 0.16% of GINIP+ neurons express Gαi1, and 14.5% ± 0.18% of Gαi1+ neurons express GINIP), whereas Gαi2 and Gαi3 were mainly expressed in smaller-diameter neurons and showed a significant overlap with GINIP+ neurons (55.1% ± 0.17% and 44% ± 0.15% of GINIP+ neurons express Gαi2 and Gαi3, respectively, and 48.5% ± 0.11% of Gαi2+ and 54% ± 0.15% of Gαi3+ neurons express GINIP) (Figure 1B). To validate interactions of GINIP with the three known Gαi proteins, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay was performed using GST-GINIP and human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cell extracts. The three Gαi proteins were fused to Venus protein and expressed in HEK293T cells as wild-type, a constitutively inactive GDP-bound mutant (G203A), or a constitutively active GTP-bound mutant (Q204L). Western blot using anti-GFP antibody to detect Venus-tagged proteins showed that GINIP interacts only with the constitutively active form of all Gαi proteins, but not with their respective wild-type or GDP-bound forms (Figure 1C and data not shown). Very interestingly, there was no interaction between GINIP and s, q, or o types of Gα subunits, indicating that GINIP exclusively participates in downstream signaling triggered by activation of Gαi proteins. To characterize the population of neurons expressing GINIP, we performed double fluorescent labeling experiments, using rat anti-GINIP antibody (see Figure 2 A for specificity) in combination with a variety of subtype-specific markers of adult DRG neurons. GINIP is excluded from TrkA+, TrkB+, and TrkC+ neurons and labels a subset of small-diameter Ret+ neurons, namely those expressing GFRα2 (Figure 2A). Further molecular characterization showed that GINIP+ neurons can be split into GINIP+/IB4+ neurons (72.3% ± 0.8%, n = 3) and GINIP+/IB4– neurons (27.7% ± 0.4%, n = 3) (Figure 2A). Interestingly, GINIP+/IB4+ neurons express mrgprD, whereas GINIP+/IB4– neurons express TH and tafa4, two previously identified markers of C-LTMRs (Figure 2A and data not shown) (Delfini et al., 2013Delfini M.C. Mantilleri A. Gaillard S. Hao J. Reynders A. Malapert P. Alonso S. François A. Barrere C.

GINIP was excluded from TRPV1+, trpm8 +, mrgprA1 +, and mrgprB4 + neurons, as well as from the subpopulation of neurons expressing high levels of trpa1, and showed a partial overlap with mrgprA3 + neurons (Figure S1, available online). In line with its expression profile, GINIP-expressing afferents selectively target lamina II (PKCγ+ and IB4+), but not lamina I (CGRP+), layers of the dorsal horn spinal cord (Figures 2B and 2C). Importantly, GINIP is not expressed in spinal cord neurons (Figures 2B and 2C). Together, our expression data show that GINIP defines two distinct subpopulations of nonpeptidergic neurons: the cutaneous free nerve ending MRGPRD-expressing neurons and C-LTMRs. To gain insights into the role of GINIP in the development, maturation, and function of GINIP+ neurons, we generated a knockin mouse model where the ginip locus has been manipulated to trigger ginip gene inactivation and enables genetic marking and tissue-specific neuronal ablation of GINIP-expressing neurons (Figure S2A). In this study, we focus on the GINIP loss-of-function phenotype. GINIPflx/+ mice were crossed with mice driving CRE recombinase in a ubiquitous manner (Schwenk et al., 1995Schwenk F. Baron U. Rajewsky K. A cre-transgenic mouse strain for the ubiquitous deletion of loxP-flanked gene segments including deletion in germ cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5080-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar) to produce GINIP+/mcherry mice. GINIP+/mcherry mice were then intercrossed to generate GINIPmcherry/mcherry and wild-type littermates (hereafter GINIP–/– and WT mice, respectively). GINIP–/– mice were viable and fertile, born in a Mendelian ratio, and indistinguishable from their control littermates. Immunolabeling using anti-GINIP antibody showed that GINIP protein was completely eliminated in GINIP–/– mice (Figure S2B). Thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of different DRG neuronal subpopulations in adult GINIP–/– mice revealed no difference between WT and GINIP–/– mice. Using SCG10 as a pan-neuronal marker, we showed that DRG neuronal counts of GINIP–/– and WT mice were similar (Figure S2C). Consistently, quantification of TrkA+, TrkB+, TrkC+, and Ret+ neurons showed no difference between GINIP–/– and WT DRG, and the total number of mrgprD +, IB4+, and gfrα2 + neurons in L5 neurons was indistinguishable between GINIP–/– and WT mice (Figure S2C). Together, these results suggest that GINIP is dispensable for the developmental specification of DRG neurons, including the neuronal class expressing this PHD and EF-hand containing protein. To gain insights into the functional role of GINIP in GINIP+ neurons, we subjected GINIP–/– mice to a large battery of somatosensory tests under acute and tissue or nerve injury conditions. GINIP–/– mice appeared normal in body weight, open-field, and rotarod profiles, demonstrating that GINIP–/– mice do not have abnormalities in motor activity or anxiety (Figures S3A and S3B and data not shown). We then subjected GINIP–/– mice to a variety of thermal tests, including the thermotaxis gradient assay, hot and cold plate, and Hargreaves tests. In all these paradigms, we found no behavioral difference between GINIP–/– mice and their WT littermates (Figures S3C–S3F), suggesting that GINIP is dispensable for acute and injury-induced temperature sensation. To test the ability of GINIP–/– mice to sense chemical pain, we used the formalin test. Intraplantar injection of 10 μl of 2% formalin triggered a robust first pain response in both genotypes, but the appearance of the second pain response occurred much earlier in GINIP–/– compared to control littermates. However, when the total time spent in flinching, biting, and licking behavior was scored, we found no significant difference between the two genotypes during the first and the second phase (Figure 3 A). We then tested GINIP–/– mice for their ability to sense mechanical stimuli under inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions. In both paradigms, acute mechanical sensation was unaffected in GINIP–/– mice (Figures 3B and 3C). In the Carrageenan model, both genotypes developed massive mechanical hypersensitivity that started at 1 hr postinjection and reached its maximal effect between 6 and 24 hr postinflammation. Carrageenan-induced mechanical hypersensitivity returned to baseline levels at day 3 postinflammation in WT mice, whereas it persisted in GINIP–/– mice at this time point. Mechanical sensitivity of GINIP–/– mice returned to baseline levels only 7 days postinflammation (Figure 3B). In the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model using the 2 × 5 stimulations with increasing monofilaments method (Delfini et al., 2013Delfini M.C. Mantilleri A. Gaillard S. Hao J. Reynders A. Malapert P. Alonso S. François A. Barrere C.

In GINIP–/– mice, CCI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity persisted during the 30 days trial, with all tested monofilaments (Figure 3C), suggesting that GINIP is predominantly required for modulation of tissue injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. What are the mechanisms behind the prolonged injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity observed in GINIP–/– mice? Knowing that GINIP specifically interacts with Gαi proteins, we tested the ability of GINIP–/– mice to respond to the analgesic effect of three GPCR selective agonists: SNC-80 for the delta opioid receptor (DOR), DAMGO for the mu opioid receptor (MOR), and baclofen for metabotropic GABAB receptors (GABAB-Rs). These agonists were tested under inflammatory and neuropathic pain. To model inflammatory pain, Carrageenan was injected in the hind paw of the mice, and to model neuropathic pain, we used the spared nerve injury model (Decosterd and Woolf, 2000Decosterd I. Woolf C.J. Spared nerve injury: an animal model of persistent peripheral neuropathic pain.Pain. 2000; 87: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) (Figure 4 ). At 1 day after Carrageenan injection, WT and GINIP–/– mice exhibited similar pronounced mechanical hypersensitivity (Figures 4A–4C). In agreement with a previous study (Smith et al., 1994Smith G.D. Harrison S.M. Birch P.J. Elliott P.J. Malcangio M. Bowery N.G.

Carlson E.T. Connor C.E. Medial axis shape coding in macaque inferotemporal cortex.Neuron. 2012; 74: 1099-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we used an adaptive stimulus algorithm to localize and densely sample sparse IT tuning functions within the virtually infinite domain of 3D shape. The algorithm was initialized with random, abstract shapes, which evolved through multiple generations, guided by differential neural responses to stimuli. Stimuli were segregated into two independent lineages, which could then be compared to evaluate repeatability and significance of results. This is an efficient search method for characterizing pure shape coding, free from semantic confounds and statistical biases in photographic stimuli. Here, we used an adaptive algorithm to test stimuli ranging continuously from small object shapes to large environmental shapes. “Object” stimuli were topologically spheroidal—closed (i.e., like a ball rather than a bowl) and bounded (completely contained) within the field of view. “Environmental” stimuli were topologically planar—open and extending beyond the field of view, like landscapes. Overall surface curvature of some environments, like small caves, could imply closure behind the viewer. Since the goal was to contrast responses to objects and environments, the adaptive method was critical for a fair comparison between optimized object stimuli and optimized environmental stimuli. A random selection of objects and environments could easily fail to sample the maximum response range in the dominant category. In addition, the parallel, independent lineages were essential for testing consistency of any response differences. While previous IT research has focused on objects, we found that the large majority of neurons in the TEd channel were more responsive to environmental shape. These responses were critically dependent on 3D shape cues, especially texture flows and shading. In contrast to TEd, the majority of neurons in the STSv channel were more responsive to object shape. This object/environment dichotomy is a functional counterpart to differences in anatomical connectivity with other brain regions. In particular, object-sensitive STSv, unlike TEd, provides major inputs to ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) regions involved in object working memory and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) regions that process object value (Kravitz et al., 2013Kravitz D.J.

The response bias in TEd shows that environmental shape information, which has been localized previously to more posterior and dorsal cortical modules (Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998Epstein R.

As with face and color information (Tsao et al., 2003Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Knutsen T.A. Mandeville J.B. Tootell R.B. Faces and objects in macaque cerebral cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, Lafer-Sousa and Conway, 2013Lafer-Sousa R. Conway B.R. Parallel, multi-stage processing of colors, faces and shapes in macaque inferior temporal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), environmental shape information remains at least partially segregated at these advanced processing stages. (Our anatomical sampling range largely spared regions where face and color modules have been identified.) However, the strong cross-connectivity between STSv and TEd would support integration of object information into environmental contexts. We studied 76 TEd neurons and 65 STSv neurons in two monkeys performing a passive fixation task. We measured responses to abstract 3D shapes, projected stereoscopically on a screen subtending 77° of visual angle horizontally and 61° vertically. Position and structure in depth were conveyed by binocular disparity (stereopsis), shading (consistent with a light source from the viewing direction at infinite distance), and surface texture (hexagonal grids applied to the stimulus surface). 3D stimulus shapes were generated by randomly distorting an initially spherical nonuniform rational b-spline (NURBS) surface. Stimuli varied in scale and topology (Figure 1 A) from small, closed objects subtending a few degrees of visual angle to large, open surfaces resembling landscapes or cave interiors (these were the visible portions of large stimuli extending beyond the screen boundaries). We studied each neuron with two independently evolving stimulus lineages in order to verify repeatability of results. The first generation of each lineage comprised 40 random 3D shapes. Successive stimulus generations included “descendant” stimuli that were partially morphed versions of “ancestor” stimuli from previous generations. The “fitness” of an ancestor stimulus—its probability of producing one or more descendants in the current generation—was defined by its neural response level, averaged over five presentations. Descendants were created by morphing the shape, position, orientation, and/or scale of the ancestor (Figure 1B). Scale changed probabilistically, but the distribution of scales within each generation was constrained for equal sampling of object-sized stimuli (subtending 4°–22° of visual angle), environmental stimuli (subtending 80°–142°, i.e., greater than screen width), and intermediate stimuli (subtending 22°–80°). Neurons were typically studied with 5–8 stimulus generations, for a total of 400–640 stimuli. TEd neurons were typically selective for large structures extending past the screen boundary (i.e., subtending > 80° of visual angle), as illustrated by the examples in Figures 1C and 1D (see also Figure S1A available online). Response rates (averaged across the 750 ms presentation period) of these example neurons were maximal in the environmental scale range and fell to background levels for object-scale stimuli. Scale-tuning functions were strongly correlated across lineages (r values in Figure 1C), demonstrating consistent evolution in the adaptive stimulus algorithm. The response bias of each neuron toward environmental stimuli (subtending > 80°) over object stimuli (subtending < 22°) was highly significant (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In contrast, STSv neurons were typically selective for small, object-like stimuli with closed, bounded surfaces, as illustrated by the examples in Figures 1E and 1F (see also Figure S1B). Response rates of these example neurons were maximal in the object scale range and fell to background levels for environmental stimuli. Scale-tuning functions were strongly correlated across lineages (Figure 1F), and the response bias of each neuron toward object stimuli was highly significant (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Responsiveness in STSv to 3D, object-like stimuli, defined in part by their surface curvatures, is consistent with previous studies (Janssen et al., 2000Janssen P. Vogels R. Orban G.A. Selectivity for 3D shape that reveals distinct areas within macaque inferior temporal cortex.Science. 2000; 288: 2054-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, Yamane et al., 2008Yamane Y.

Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Differential processing of object versus environmental shape between the two channels was strong and significant at the population level (Figure 2 ). The scale-tuning function for each neuron in our sample is depicted by a colored strip (Figure 2A), in which color represents the stimulus range (red = objects, green = environments) and brightness represents average response strength at each point along the stimulus continuum. Neurons are ordered according to recording location around the circumference of IT in the coronal plane. Thus, from left to right, recording locations progress laterally across ventral bank STS, from fundus to lip, and then ventromedially across the surface of the gyrus (see MRI images). In the anterior-posterior direction, these recording locations spanned a range from +8 to +22 mm (anterior to the interaural line), mostly between the expected locations of the middle and anterior face and color patches. Only two recording sites fell within the expected location of the AL face patch (Figure S2A) (Freiwald and Tsao, 2010Freiwald W.A. Tsao D.Y. Functional compartmentalization and viewpoint generalization within the macaque face-processing system.Science. 2010; 330: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). There were no significant anterior-posterior or mediolateral trends in scale tuning in either STS or TEd (Figure S2A caption). There was, however, a major difference between channels (Figure 2B). The majority of STSv neurons (49/65; 75%) were significantly (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) more responsive to object stimuli (red dots, Figure 2B). Only eight STSv neurons were significantly more responsive to environmental stimuli (green dots). Conversely, the majority of TEd neurons (50/76; 66%) were significantly (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) more responsive to environmental stimuli (green dots). Only 16 TEd neurons were significantly more responsive to object stimuli (red dots). In both channels, scale-tuning functions were highly correlated across independent stimulus lineages (Figure 2C). This correlation was significant (p < 0.01) for 60/65 STSv neurons and 71/76 TEd neurons. The average normalized response across STSv neurons (Figure 2D, red) was highest in the small object range and declined gradually to a minimum at stimulus diameters near 70°. In contrast, the average normalized response across TEd neurons (Figure 2D, green) was low, up to 70°, then climbed abruptly, at precisely the point at which stimuli became large enough to exceed the viewing frame, thus becoming topologically open and unbounded, i.e., environmental. Neurons in both channels were highly selective for stimulus shape within these different ranges (Figures S1C and S1D). We conclude that the STSv channel was predominantly sensitive to object shape, as expected; the TEd channel contained some object-responsive neurons but was predominantly sensitive to environmental shape. Since the prevalence of environmental shape processing in TEd was unexpected, we performed a number of additional tests (when recording time permitted) to confirm that TEd neurons were responding to 3D environmental shape rather than some associated, lower-level stimulus factor. We selected a high-response 3D environmental stimulus from the adaptive search and tested how responses to this stimulus depended on multiple factors. First, we compared responses to equivalent 2D stimuli, in which 3D structure was destroyed by eliminating binocular disparities, shading, and texture flows (by alternatively flattening the hexagonal grid onto the plane of the projection screen, by randomizing the orientations of the constituent texture lines, or by removing texture entirely). Destroying 3D structure in this way largely abolished responses in most cases (Figure 3 A; similar results for STSv neurons are shown in Figure S3A). Thus, these neurons were specifically responsive to shape-in-depth, which is especially definitive for environments. This shows that responses did not depend simply on the presence of a large 2D shape or texture. It also shows that responses did not depend simply on stimulation of more peripheral parts of the visual field. In other words, large receptive fields, while certainly necessary, are not sufficient to explain selective responses to environmental stimuli. This was further confirmed by testing responses to high-response object stimuli at peripheral locations (Figure S3B). We further tested dependence on 3D cues by presenting all combinations of binocular disparity, shading, and texture flows (Figure S3C). Texture flow was the most significant 3D cue for environmental stimuli (F(1,21) = 16.8; p < 0.002, three-way repeated-measures ANOVA), followed by shading (F(1,21) = 10.4; p < 0.005). Stereoscopic cues did not have a significant effect on environmental shape responses (F(1,21) = 1,8; p = 0.194), which makes sense because binocular disparity differences become negligible at large distances and thus do not provide precise information about large-scale shape-in-depth. Texture flows provide strong cues for 3D shape independent of stereoscopic depth (Ben-Shahar and Zucker, 2001Ben-Shahar, O., and Zucker, S.W. (2001).

Zaidi Q. Three-dimensional shape from non-homogeneous textures: carved and stretched surfaces.J. Vis. 2004; 4: 860-878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The low responses to 2D stimuli that preserved but distorted textures helps address the concern that neurons might simply respond to higher spatial frequencies in environmental stimulus textures (Rajimehr et al., 2011Rajimehr R. Devaney K.J. Bilenko N.Y. Young J.C. Tootell R.B. The “parahippocampal place area” responds preferentially to high spatial frequencies in humans and monkeys.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1000608Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To further rule out this concern, we tested responses when the spatial frequency of the texture in the 3D stimuli was decreased or increased by a factor of 2 (Figure 3B). These manipulations did not significantly affect responses (F(2,32) = 0.16; p = 0.85), showing that the neurons were not merely sensitive to a specific spatial frequency range. Another concern could be that IT responses are known to be somewhat size invariant (Ito et al., 1995Ito M. Tamura H. Fujita I. Tanaka K. Size and position invariance of neuronal responses in monkey inferotemporal cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 73: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, Brincat and Connor, 2004Brincat S.L. Connor C.E. Underlying principles of visual shape selectivity in posterior inferotemporal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Given this, high-response shapes might by chance evolve at a particular scale but might evoke equally strong responses at a very different scale. This concern is addressed by the strong and in most cases (131/141) significant (p < 0.01) correlation between scale-tuning functions across entirely independent lineages (Figure 2C). But we also selected high-response stimuli for some neurons and tested them across the entire scale range (see example in Figure 3C). Scale selectivity remained strong and consistent with the results of the adaptive experiment in all cases (Figures S3D and S3E). We also tested the effect of lighting direction, which determines the pattern of shading across the stimulus. During the adaptive search procedure, the implicit light source was at infinite distance from the viewer’s direction. We additionally tested responses when the light source was above, below, to the right, or to the left. The results (Figure 3D) show that the 3D environmental shape selectivity of these TEd neurons was remarkably consistent (F(4,84) = 0.64, p = 0.64) across these manipulations, which produced very different image contrast patterns. Our results reveal a surprising specialization for environmental shape processing in the middle channel (TEd) of anterior IT cortex in macaque monkeys. The majority of TEd neurons were substantially more responsive to large, open, unbounded 3D surface shapes. These responses were critically dependent on depth cues, especially texture flows (Ben-Shahar and Zucker, 2001Ben-Shahar, O., and Zucker, S.W. (2001). On the perceptual organization of texture and shading flows: From a geometrical model to coherence computation. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2001. CVPR 2001.

Zaidi Q. Three-dimensional shape from non-homogeneous textures: carved and stretched surfaces.J. Vis. 2004; 4: 860-878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This makes sense since environments are more defined by 3D shape-in-depth than by 2D self-occlusion boundaries. Texture flows are likely to be an essential 3D shape cue for environments, which occupy more distant depth ranges where binocular disparity differences become negligible. A previous study showed that TEd neurons are not sensitive to stereoscopic depth in object-size stimuli and concluded that TEd represents only 2D shape (Janssen et al., 2000Janssen P. Vogels R. Orban G.A. Selectivity for 3D shape that reveals distinct areas within macaque inferior temporal cortex.Science. 2000; 288: 2054-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To the contrary, we found that TEd is very sensitive to 3D shape but on the scale of environments, a scale on which stereoscopic depth cues provide little shape information. TEd selectivity for environments contrasted with STS selectivity for objects, which have long been considered the primary domain of IT processing. This is a clear functional distinction between the anatomically defined channels in anterior ventral pathway described by Kravitz et al., 2013Kravitz D.J. Saleem K.S. Baker C.I. Ungerleider L.G. Mishkin M. The ventral visual pathway: an expanded neural framework for the processing of object quality.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2013; 17: 26-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar. These channels differ in connectivity with prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and medial temporal lobe memory structures. Our finding that STS is more specialized for object shape is consistent with its stronger connection to object-sensitive ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (Kravitz et al., 2013Kravitz D.J. Saleem K.S. Baker C.I. Ungerleider L.G. Mishkin M. The ventral visual pathway: an expanded neural framework for the processing of object quality.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2013; 17: 26-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). It should be noted that we observed some selectivity for objects in TEd as well, consistent with prior studies of object processing in this region. Channeling of environmental and object shape processing in anterior IT is a new feature of modular organization in ventral pathway cortex. Face and color modules occur at intervals along the inferior temporal lobe (Tsao et al., 2003Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Knutsen T.A. Mandeville J.B. Tootell R.B. Faces and objects in macaque cerebral cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, Moeller et al., 2008Moeller S. Freiwald W.A. Tsao D.Y.

Conway B.R. Parallel, multi-stage processing of colors, faces and shapes in macaque inferior temporal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Our anterior-posterior sampling range fell mostly in between reported locations for middle and anterior face and color patches. Our sampling also largely spared the lip of the sulcus, where face patches tend to be located. Thus, our findings expand on rather than conflict with prior understanding of anterior IT modularity. Our discovery of environmental shape processing in anterior IT contrasts with previous work that localized processing of place information (scenes and buildings) mainly to more posterior and dorsal visual regions. Beginning with the identification of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) (Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998Epstein R. Kanwisher N.

Deconstructing visual scenes in cortex: gradients of object and spatial layout information.Cereb. Cortex. 2013; 23: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Posterior scene-sensitive patches in macaque monkey cortex have been identified with fMRI, and specialization of individual neurons in posterior IT (TEO and/or TFO) for place processing has recently been confirmed by Kornblith and colleagues (Kornblith et al., 2013Kornblith S.

Nakamura K. Visual response properties of neurons in the parahippocampal cortex of monkeys.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 876-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These posterior IT neurons were particularly sensitive to surface textures, analogous to our finding in TEd that texture flows were the most critical cues for shape-in-depth. Our data reveal that in addition to these posterior modules, information about place structure is also processed in anterior stages of the ventral pathway. The ventral pathway is specialized for fine shape discrimination and thus could support accurate recognition of familiar environments—rooms, neighborhoods, landscapes—even when the objects or landmarks they contain are rearranged or removed. Perhaps more importantly, object information must ultimately be organized within representations of the spatial environment to support scene comprehension and physical interactions with the world. The strong connectivity between object-sensitive STS and environment-sensitive TEd would enable such integration. Consistent with this idea, MacEvoy and Epstein, 2011MacEvoy S.P. Epstein R.A. Constructing scenes from objects in human occipitotemporal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1323-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar have shown that, in human cortex, ventral pathway area LO, but not PPA, combines information about scenes and scene-associated objects. Our findings are consistent with some fMRI evidence for more anterior sensitivity to scene information. In addition to finding a homolog to human PPA in monkey posterior temporal cortex (mPPA), Nasr et al., 2011Nasr S. Liu N. Devaney K.J. Yue X. Rajimehr R. Ungerleider L.G. Tootell R.B. Scene-selective cortical regions in human and nonhuman primates.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13771-13785Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar showed some activation in more anterior locations (Figure 8 in Nasr et al., 2011Nasr S. Liu N. Devaney K.J. Yue X. Rajimehr R. Ungerleider L.G. Tootell R.B. Scene-selective cortical regions in human and nonhuman primates.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13771-13785Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In humans, a recent study shows that semantic information about scene categories is represented beyond the boundaries of previously described functional regions (Stansbury et al., 2013Stansbury D.E. Naselaris T. Gallant J.L. Natural scene statistics account for the representation of scene categories in human visual cortex.Neuron. 2013; 79: 1025-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is also worth noting that neural recording can reveal substantial selectivity in regions where fMRI differences are weak or absent: Kornblith et al., 2013Kornblith S. Cheng X. Ohayon S. Tsao D.Y. A network for scene processing in the macaque temporal lobe.Neuron. 2013; 79: 766-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar found that neural place selectivity was prominent not only in a lateral place patch (LPP), which emerged in an fMRI contrast between places and other stimuli, but also in a more medial place patch (MPP), which was identified only through stimulation of LPP. Our results might also relate to the parallel organization of large and small object representations in human cortex described by Konkle and Oliva, 2012Konkle T. Oliva A. A real-world size organization of object responses in occipitotemporal cortex.Neuron. 2012; 74: 1114-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar. They found that smaller objects are represented in superior/lateral ventral pathway, while larger object representations occur in a more inferior/medial swath. This organization depended on the real-world size of the familiar object stimuli, not on their retinal size. This result seems consistent with our finding that small, abstract objects are represented in a more superior channel and large environments in a more inferior channel. Representations of large objects and large environments are likely to colocalize, since they are statistically related in the natural world. Also, both depend on inputs from more peripheral parts of the visual field. Anterior IT does not appear to be retinotopic (Lafer-Sousa and Conway, 2013Lafer-Sousa R. Conway B.R. Parallel, multi-stage processing of colors, faces and shapes in macaque inferior temporal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but the ventral location of large object/environment processing might reflect the ventral origin of peripheral upper field inputs from early visual cortex (Kravitz et al., 2013Kravitz D.J.

Under natural viewing conditions where nearby objects are foveated at ground level, the upper field periphery is likely to contain the most information about surrounding environmental structure. Our results leave open the question of whether environmental information in TEd is more structural or categorical/semantic in nature. These two domains are difficult to dissociate because they are statistically correlated in the natural world and necessarily entwined at the neural processing level and in perception (Kourtzi and Connor, 2011Kourtzi Z. Connor C.E. Neural representations for object perception: structure, category, and adaptive coding.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 45-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our stimuli were entirely abstract and thus serve to show that there is at least some level of structural processing in TEd. But further experiments involving photographs of familiar environments would be required to distinguish representation of structure from structural processing in support of place recognition and categorization. It is also conceivable that photographic object and scene stimuli would reveal a different pattern of anatomical organization. Our results establish a clear dichotomy in structural processing, but semantic representation of familiar stimuli can be independent of structural metrics, including scale (Konkle and Oliva, 2012Konkle T. Oliva A. A real-world size organization of object responses in occipitotemporal cortex.Neuron. 2012; 74: 1114-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Two head-restrained male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were trained to maintain fixation within 1° (radius) of a 0.1° diameter spot for 4 s to obtain a juice reward. Eye position was monitored with an infrared eye tracker (EyeLink). 3D shape stimuli were rendered with shading, surface texture, and binocular disparity cues using openGL. Two precisely aligned high-resolution (1,400 × 1,050) color projectors were used to back project differentially polarized right and left eye images on a screen subtending 77° of visual angle horizontally and 61° vertically with the monkey seated at a viewing distance of 55 cm. The fixation target appeared at screen center, with one of four right/left image disparities corresponding to fixation at 55 cm (screen depth), 100 cm, 10 m, or 100 m. The stimulus was always tangent to the fixation point, at 0 disparity, so the monkey was always fixating a point on the stimulus surface. During fixation, randomly ordered stimuli were flashed on the screen with a period of 1 s (250 ms prestimulus blank, 750 ms stimulus presentation), for a total of four stimuli per trial. Prior to each experimental session, binocular fusion and stereoscopic depth perception were verified with a random dot stereogram saccade target detection task. The electrical activity of well-isolated single neurons was recorded with epoxy-coated tungsten electrodes (Microprobe or FHC). Action potentials of individual neurons were amplified and electrically isolated using a Tucker-Davis Technologies recording system. Recording positions were determined on the basis of structural MRIs and the sequence of sulci and response characteristics observed while lowering the electrode. All animal procedures were approved by the Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to U.S. National Institutes of Health and U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines. Each stimulus was based on a 3D ellipsoidal shape defined by a dense polar grid of nonuniform rational b-splines (NURBS) control points, which can be rendered as a smooth surface with the OpenGL NURBS utility. Large-scale shape variation was created by randomly altering the positions, orientations, sizes, and aspect ratios of two to five latitudinal rings in the polar grid and interpolating the positions of intervening NURBs control points. Smaller-scale variation in surface shape was created by defining points and paths where surface height was altered with random polynomial functions, creating hills, valleys, ridges, canyons, etc. Global surface smoothness was varied to span from the curvilinear structure of natural landscapes to the rectilinear structure of manmade environments. Each successive generation in the adaptation procedure comprised 40 stimuli in each of two lineages, for a total of 80 stimuli. In each generation, 80% of stimuli were partially morphed descendants of ancestors drawn from the entire pool of previously tested stimuli, and 20% were new, randomly defined stimuli. The probability of a given stimulus producing a descendant was based on its average response rate. The current response range of the neuron was divided into five percentile ranges. Thirty percent of ancestors were from the top range (90%–100% of maximum response), 20% each from the three middle ranges (70%–90%, 50%–70%, 30%–50%), and 10% from the bottom range (0%–30%). To produce each descendant, one to three morphing transformations were applied. The number and magnitude of morphing transformations were probabilistic functions of response rate, to produce more alteration of low-response ancestors and less alteration of high-response ancestors. The probabilities of specific morphing transformations were heavily weighted toward scaling, since this produced the transition from object to environmental shapes. The scale distribution within each generation was constrained for equal sampling in the object range (4°–22° of visual angle), intermediate range (subtending 22°–80°), and environmental range (80°–142°). The morphing probabilities were scaling 35%, fixation depth 5%, rotation 10% (equal probability for x, y, and z axis rotation), translation 10%, longitudinal scaling of the NURBs grid 5%, translation/rotation of one latitudinal ring 5%, change in elliptical aspect ratio of one latitudinal ring 5%, global latitudinal curvature 5%, global longitudinal curvature 5%, height function of a surface distortion 5%, path shape of a surface distortion 5%, position of a surface distortion 2.5%, and removal of a surface distortion 2.5%. All stimuli were adjusted in depth such that the surface was tangent to the fixation point at 0 disparity. Closer fixation depths were prohibited when they would cause the stimulus surface to intersect the surface of the projection. Response rates for each stimulus were averaged across the 750 ms presentation period and across five repetitions. Baseline response was averaged over randomly scheduled null stimulus presentations during the adaptive experiment. Baseline was subtracted from each stimulus response for the population analyses presented in Figure 2. Selectivity for object versus environmental stimuli was characterized with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Pearson correlation was used to evaluate consistency of scale tuning across independent lineages. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to evaluate the effects of control test manipulations. Details of analyses are described in Results.

https://openalex.org/W2010895681,"The Pim protein kinases contribute to transformation by enhancing the activity of oncogenic Myc and Ras, which drives significant metabolic changes during tumorigenesis. In this report, we demonstrate that mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking all three isoforms of Pim protein kinases, triple knockout (TKO), cannot tolerate the expression of activated K-Ras (K-RasG12V) and undergo cell death. Transduction of K-RasG12V into these cells markedly increased the level of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of N-acetyl cysteine attenuated ROS production and reversed the cytotoxic effects of K-RasG12V in the TKO MEFs. The altered cellular redox state caused by the loss of Pim occurred as a result of lower levels of metabolic intermediates in the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways as well as abnormal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. TKO MEFs exhibit reduced levels of superoxide dismutase (Sod), glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) and peroxiredoxin 3 (Prdx3) that render them susceptible to killing by K-RasG12V-mediated ROS production. In contrast, the transduction of c-Myc into TKO cells can overcome the lack of Pim protein kinases by regulating cellular metabolism and Sod2. In the absence of the Pim kinases, c-Myc transduction permitted K-RasG12V-induced cell growth by decreasing Ras-induced cellular ROS levels. These results demonstrate that the Pim protein kinases have an important role in regulating cellular redox, metabolism and K-Ras-stimulated cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2013935749,"Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC), the major cause of gynaecological cancer death, is a heterogeneous disease classified into five subtypes. Each subtype has distinct clinical characteristics and is associated with different genetic risk factors and molecular events, but all are treated with surgery and platinum/taxane regimes. Tumour progression and chemoresistance is generally associated with major metabolic alterations, notably altered mitochondrial function(s). Here, we report for the first time that the expression of the mitochondrial regulators PGC1α and TFAM varies between EOC subtypes; furthermore, we have identified a profile in clear-cell carcinoma consisting of undetectability of PGC1α/TFAM, and low ERα/Ki-67. By contrast, high-grade serous carcinomas were characterised by a converse state of PGC1α/TFAM, ERα positivity and a high Ki-67 index. Interestingly, loss of PGC1α/TFAM and ERα was found also in a non-clear cell EOC cell line made highly resistant to platinum in vitro. Similar to clear-cell carcinomas, these resistant cells also showed accumulation of glycogen. Altogether, our data provide mechanistic insights into the chemoresistant nature of ovarian clear-cell carcinomas. Furthermore, these findings corroborate the need to take into account the diversity of EOC and to develop subtype specific treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1972499812,"NEDD9 is an established marker of invasive and metastatic cancers. NEDD9 downregulation has been shown to dramatically reduce cell invasion and metastasis in multiple tumors. The mechanisms by which NEDD9 regulates invasion are largely unknown. In the current study, we have found that NEDD9 is required for matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) enzymatic recovery/recycling through the late endosomes to enable disengagement of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) and tumor invasion. Depletion of NEDD9 decreases targeting of the MMP14/TIMP2 complex to late endosomes and increases trafficking of MMP14 from early/sorting endosomes back to the surface in a small GTPase ADP ribosylation factor-6 (Arf6)-dependent manner. NEDD9 directly binds to Arf6-GTPase-activating protein, ARAP3 and Arf6-effector GGA3, thereby facilitating the Arf6 inactivation required for MMP14/TIMP2 targeting to late endosomes. Re-expression of NEDD9 or a decrease in Arf6 activity is sufficient to restore MMP14 activity and the invasive properties of tumor cells. Importantly, NEDD9 inhibition by Vivo-Morpholinos, an antisense therapy, decreases primary tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft models of breast cancer. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel mechanism to control tumor-cell dissemination through NEDD9/Arf6-dependent regulation of MMP14/TIMP2 trafficking, and validate NEDD9 as a clinically relevant therapeutic target to treat metastatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1969353966,"P2Y receptors are expressed in virtually all epithelia and are responsible for the control of fluid and electrolyte transport. In asthmatic inflammation, the bronchial epithelia are damaged by eosinophil-derived, highly toxic cationic proteins, such as major basic protein (MBP). Consequently, extracellular nucleotides are released into the extracellular space from airway epithelial cells, and act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to regulate immune functions. Our data show damage to the human bronchial epithelial cell line, 16HBE14o-, by poly-L-arginine-induced UDP release into the extracellular medium. Activation of P2Y6 receptor by its natural ligand, UDP, or its specific agonist, MRS 2693, led to the production of two proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. This may have resulted from increased IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression, and activation of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK, and NF-κB pathways. Our previous study demonstrated that UDP stimulated transepithelial Cl- secretion via both Ca2+- and cAMP-dependent pathways in 16HBE14o- epithelia. This was further confirmed in this study by simultaneous imaging of Ca2+ and cAMP levels in single cells using the Fura-2 fluorescence technique and a FRET-based approach, respectively. Moreover, the P2Y6 receptor-mediated production of IL-6 and IL-8 was found to be dependent on Ca2+, but not the cAMP/PKA pathway. Together, these studies show that nucleotides released during the airway inflammatory processes will activate P2Y6 receptors, which will lead to further release of inflammatory cytokines. The secretion of cytokines and the formation of such ""cytokine networks"" play an important role in sustaining the airway inflammatory disease."
https://openalex.org/W2020305317,"The peptide hormone relaxin has striking effects on the vascular system. Specifically, endogenous relaxin treatment reduces myogenic reactivity through nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasorelaxation and increases arterial compliance in small resistance arteries. However, less is known about the vascular roles of endogenous relaxin, particularly in males. Therefore, we used male wild-type (Rln+/+) and relaxin knockout (Rln−/−) mice to test the hypothesis that passive wall properties and vascular reactivity in mesenteric arteries would be compromised in Rln−/− mice. Passive compliance was determined in arteries (n = 8–9) mounted on a pressure myograph and in Ca2+-free Krebs containing 2 mM EGTA. Passive volume compliance was significantly (P = 0.01) decreased in the mesenteric arteries of Rln−/− mice. Vascular reactivity was assessed using wire myography. In mesenteric arteries (n = 5) of Rln−/− mice, there was a significant (P<0.03) increase in sensitivity to the vasoconstrictors phenylephrine and thromboxane-mimetic U41669. This enhanced responsiveness to vasoconstrictors was abolished by endothelial denudation, and attributed to impaired NO and prostanoid pathways in Rln−/− mice. Sensitivity to the endothelial agonist acetylcholine was significantly (n = 7–9, P≤0.03) decreased, and this was abolished in the presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (2 µM). This indicates that prostanoid vasoconstrictor pathways were upregulated in the mesenteric arteries of Rln−/− mice. In summary, we demonstrate endothelial dysfunction and impaired arterial wall remodeling in male mice deficient in relaxin. Thus, our results highlight a role for endogenous relaxin in the maintenance of normal mesenteric artery structure and function in males."
https://openalex.org/W1983640448,"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a circulating hormone important in phosphate homeostasis. Abnormal serum levels of FGF23 result in systemic pathologies in humans and mice, including renal phosphate wasting diseases and hyperphosphatemia. We sought to uncover the role FGF23 plays in the auditory system due to shared molecular mechanisms and genetic pathways between ear and kidney development, the critical roles multiple FGFs play in auditory development and the known hearing phenotype in mice deficient in klotho (KL), a critical co-factor for FGF23 signaling. Using functional assessments of hearing, we demonstrate that Fgf mice are profoundly deaf. Fgf mice have moderate hearing loss above 20 kHz, consistent with mixed conductive and sensorineural pathology of both middle and inner ear origin. Histology and high-voltage X-ray computed tomography of Fgf mice demonstrate dysplastic bulla and ossicles; Fgf mice have near-normal morphology. The cochleae of mutant mice appear nearly normal on gross and microscopic inspection. In wild type mice, FGF23 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the cochlea. Measurements from Fgf mice do not match the auditory phenotype of Kl−/− mice, suggesting that loss of FGF23 activity impacts the auditory system via mechanisms at least partially independent of KL. Given the extensive middle ear malformations and the overlap of initiation of FGF23 activity and Eustachian tube development, this work suggests a possible role for FGF23 in otitis media."
https://openalex.org/W2011734208,"House dust mite (HDM) is a primary allergen in allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma. Neutrophil apoptosis is associated with allergic diseases and innate immunity to infection. The present study examined how HDM affects constitutive neutrophil apoptosis in normal and AR subjects. Total IgE increased in AR subjects when compared to normal subjects, and patients with AR were HDM-specific IgE positive (+), which is specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronissinus and Dermatophagoides farinae. In normal and AR subjects, neutrophil apoptosis was inhibited by extract of Dermatophagoides pteronissinus (DP), but not by extract of Dermatophagoides farina (DF). Aprotinin (serine protease inhibitor) and E64 (cysteine protease inhibitor) have no effect on neutrophil apoptosis due to DP. The anti-apoptotic effect of DP was blocked by TLR4i, an inhibitor of TLR4, rottlerin, an inhibitor of PKCδ, PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK, and BAY-11-7085, an inhibitor of NF-κB. DP induced PKCδ, ERK, and NF-κB activation in a time-dependent manner. DP inhibited the cleavage of procaspase 3 and procaspase 9. The expression of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and CCL2 increased in the supernatant collected from the normal and AR neutrophils after DP treatment and the supernatant inhibited the apoptosis of normal and AR neutrophils. In summary, DP has anti-apoptotic effects on neutrophils of normal and AR subjects through the TLR4/PKCδ/ERK/NF-κB pathway, and this finding may contribute to solution of the pathogenic mechanism of allergic diseases triggered by DP."
https://openalex.org/W2078989529,"High activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is characteristic for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The activity of the master regulator of this pathway, PTEN, is often impaired in T-ALL. However, experimental evidence suggests that input from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is required for sustained mTOR activation, even in the absence of PTEN. We previously reported the expression of Neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinases (TRKs) and their respective ligands in primary human leukemia samples. In the present study we aimed to dissect the downstream signaling cascades of TRK-induced T-ALL in a murine model and show that T-ALLs induced by deregulated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling acquire activating mutations in Notch1 and lose PTEN during clonal evolution. Some clones additionally lost one allele of the homeodomain transcription factor Cux1. All events independently led to a gradual hyperactivation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling. We dissected the role of the individual mTOR complexes by shRNA knockdown and found that the separate depletion of mTORC1 or mTORC2 reduced the growth of T-ALL blasts, but was not sufficient to induce apoptosis. In contrast, knockdown of the mTOR downstream effector eIF4E caused a striking cytotoxic effect, demonstrating a critical addiction to cap-dependent mRNA-translation. Although high mTORC2-AKT activation is commonly associated with drug-resistance, we demonstrate that T-ALL displaying a strong mTORC2-AKT activation were specifically susceptible to 4EGI-1, an inhibitor of the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction. To decipher the mechanism of 4EGI-1, we performed a genome-wide analysis of mRNAs that are translationally regulated by 4EGI-1 in T-ALL. 4EGI-1 effectively reduced the ribosomal occupancy of mRNAs that were strongly upregulated in T-ALL blasts compared with normal thymocytes including transcripts important for translation, mitochondria and cell cycle progression, such as cyclins and ribosomal proteins. These data suggest that disrupting the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction constitutes a promising therapy strategy in mTOR-deregulated T-cell leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2001926560,"Top-predators contribute to ecosystem resilience, yet individuals or populations are often subject to lethal control to protect livestock, managed game or humans from predation. Such management actions sometimes attract concern that lethal control might affect top-predator function in ways ultimately detrimental to biodiversity conservation. The primary function of a predator is predation, which is often investigated by assessing their diet. We therefore use data on prey remains found in 4,298 Australian dingo scats systematically collected from three arid sites over a four year period to experimentally assess the effects of repeated broad-scale poison-baiting programs on dingo diet. Indices of dingo dietary diversity and similarity were either identical or near-identical in baited and adjacent unbaited treatment areas in each case, demonstrating no control-induced change to dingo diets. Associated studies on dingoes' movement behaviour and interactions with sympatric mesopredators were similarly unaffected by poison-baiting. These results indicate that mid-sized top-predators with flexible and generalist diets (such as dingoes) may be resilient to ongoing and moderate levels of population control without substantial alteration of their diets and other related aspects of their ecological function."
https://openalex.org/W1990871631,"It has been shown that virus infections, often symptomless, significantly limit sweetpotato productivity, especially in regions characterized by low input agricultural systems. In sweetpotatoes, the successful emergence and development of lateral roots (LRs), the main determinant of root architecture, determines the competency of adventitious roots to undergo storage root initiation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of some plant viruses on root architecture attributes during the onset of storage root initiation in ‘Beauregard’ sweetpotatoes that were grown with or without the presence of nitrogen. In two replicate experiments, virus-tested plants consistently failed to show visible symptoms at 20 days regardless of nitrogen treatment. In both experiments, the severity of symptom development among infected plants ranged from 25 to 118% when compared to the controls (virus tested plants grown in the presence of nitrogen). The presence of a complex of viruses (Sweet potato feathery mottle virus, Sweet potato virus G, Sweet potato virus C, and Sweet potato virus 2) was associated with 51% reduction in adventitious root number among plants grown without nitrogen. The effect of virus treatments on first order LR development depended on the presence or absence of nitrogen. In the presence of nitrogen, only plants infected with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus showed reductions in first order LR length, number, and density, which were decreased by 33%, 12%, and 11%, respectively, when compared to the controls. In the absence of nitrogen, virus tested and infected plants manifested significant reductions for all first order LR attributes. These results provide evidence that virus infection directly influences sweetpotato yield potential by reducing both the number of adventitious roots and LR development. These findings provide a framework for understanding how virus infection reduces sweetpotato yield and could lead to the development of novel strategies to mitigate virus effects on sweetpotato productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2001498238,"Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal primary malignant brain tumor in adults. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN is deleted, mutated or hypermethylated in more than 60% of glioblastoma cases resulting in hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway, which leads to sustained PI(3,4,5)P3 signaling, and thereby hyperactivation of Akt and other effectors. PI(3,4,5)P3 is also hydrolyzed to PI(3,4)P2 by inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases such as SKIP, but the role this pathway has in glioblastoma is unknown. Microarray expression profiling of SKIP in human glioblastoma has revealed both increased and decreased SKIP gene expression. Here we have screened PTEN-deficient glioblastoma for SKIP protein expression by immunohistochemistry and report that SKIP expression is increased in some cases or decreased relative to normal brain. Using the U-87MG PTEN-deficient cell line we show that SKIP knockdown did not further enhance cell proliferation or survival. However, SKIP overexpression in U-87MG cells suppressed anchorage-independent cell growth and growth factor-induced PI(3,4,5)P3/Akt signaling. Although, SKIP knockdown did not affect cell proliferation or survival, cell migration was significantly retarded, associated with significantly increased PI(4,5)P2 signals, and decreased phosphorylation of the actin-regulatory protein cofilin, a PI(4,5)P2-binding protein. Notably, overexpression of SKIP also inhibited migration of U-87MG cells to a similar degree as observed with PTEN reconstitution, however, via distinct mechanisms. PTEN reconstitution promoted sustained lamellipodia generation and focal adhesion formation. In contrast, SKIP overexpression reduced sustained lamellipodia formation, talin incorporation into focal adhesions and recruitment of PI(4,5)P2-binding proteins to the plasma membrane. Notably, analysis of two independent ONCOMINE microarray data sets revealed a significant correlation between increased SKIP mRNA expression in glioblastoma and improved long-term survival. Therefore, SKIP expression in glioblastoma may affect the local invasion of PTEN-deficient tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2071790869,"Cross-presentation of tumor antigen is essential for efficient priming of naïve CD8+ T lymphocytes and induction of effective anti-tumor immunity. We hypothesized that the subcellular location of a tumor antigen could affect the efficiency of cross-presentation, and hence the outcome of anti-tumor responses to that antigen. We compared cross-presentation of a nominal antigen expressed in the nuclear, secretory, or cytoplasmic compartments of B16 melanoma tumors. All tumors expressed similar levels of the antigen. The antigen was cross-presented from all compartments but when the concentration was low, nuclear antigen was less efficiently cross-presented than antigen from other cellular locations. The efficiency of cross-presentation of the nuclear antigen was improved following chemotherapy-induced tumor cell apoptosis and this correlated with an increase in the proportion of effector CTL. These data demonstrate that chemotherapy improves nuclear tumor antigen cross-presentation and could be important for anti-cancer immunotherapies that target nuclear antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2010598501,"Injury to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons leads to selective loss of RGCs and vision. Previous studies have shown that exogenous neurotrophic factors promote RGC survival. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of oncostatin M (OSM), a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines, on pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and RGC survival after optic nerve crush (ON-crush) in the mouse. BALB/C mice received ON-crush in the left eyes for either 4-second or 1-second duration (4-s or 1-s). Fluoro-gold retrograde labeling was used to identify RGCs. RGC function was assessed by PERG measurement. OSM or CNTF protein was injected intravitreally immediately after ON-crush. OSM responsive cells were identified by localization of increased STAT3 phosphorylation. Significant higher RGC survival (46% of untreated control) was seen in OSM-treated eyes when assessed 2 weeks after 4-s ON-crush as compared to that (14% of untreated control) of the PBS-treated eyes (P<0.001). In addition, PERG amplitude was significantly higher in eyes treated with OSM or CNTF 1 week after 1-s ON-crush (36% of baseline) as compared with the amplitude of PBS-treated eyes (19% of the baseline, P = 0.003). An increase in STAT3 phosphorylation was localized in Müller layer after OSM treatment, suggesting that Müller cells mediate the effect of OSM. Our results demonstrate that one single injection of either OSM or CNTF after ON-crush improves RGC survival together with their electrophysiological activity. These data provide proof-of-concept for using neurotrophic factors OSM and CNTF for RGC degenerative diseases, including glaucoma and acute optic nerve trauma."
https://openalex.org/W2055145870,"The effects of rhizodeposition on soil C and N availabilities lead to substantial changes of microbial community composition and processes in the rhizosphere of plants. Under heterogeneous light, photosynthates can be translocated or shared between exposed and shaded ramets by clonal integration. Clonal integration may enhance the rhizodeposition of the shaded ramets, which further influences nutrient recycling in their rhizosphere. To test the hypothesis, we conducted a pot experiment by the stoloniferous herb Glechoma longituba subjected to heterogeneous light. Microbial biomass and community composition in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets, assessed by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis, were markedly altered by clonal integration. Clonal integration positively affected C, N availabilities, invertase and urease activities, N mineralization (Nmin) and nitrification rates (Nnitri) in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. However, an opposite pattern was also observed in phenoloxidase (POXase) and peroxidase (PODase) activities. Our results demonstrated that clonal integration facilitated N assimilation and uptake in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. The experiment provides insights into the mechanism of nutrient recycling mediated by clonal integration."
https://openalex.org/W1963646072,"In addition to conventional antibodies, camelids produce immunoglobulins G composed exclusively of heavy chains in which the antigen binding site is formed only by single domains called VHH. Their particular characteristics make VHHs interesting tools for drug-delivery, passive immunotherapy and high-throughput diagnosis. Hantaviruses are rodent-borne viruses of the Bunyaviridae family. Two clinical forms of the infection are known. Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) is present in the Old World, while Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is found on the American continent. There is no specific treatment for HPS and its diagnosis is carried out by molecular or serological techniques, using mainly monoclonal antibodies or hantavirus nucleoprotein (N) to detect IgM and IgG in patient serum. This study proposes the use of camelid VHHs to develop alternative methods for diagnosing and confirming HPS. Phage display technology was employed to obtain VHHs. After immunizing one Lama glama against the recombinant N protein (prNΔ₈₅) of a Brazilian hantavirus strain, VHH regions were isolated to construct an immune library. VHHs were displayed fused to the M13KO7 phage coat protein III and the selection steps were performed on immobilized prNΔ₈₅. After selection, eighty clones recognized specifically the N protein. These were sequenced, grouped based mainly on the CDRs, and five clones were analyzed by western blot (WB), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) device, and ELISA. Besides the ability to recognize prNΔ85 by WB, all selected clones showed affinity constants in the nanomolar range. Additionaly, the clone KC329705 is able to detect prNΔ₈₅ in solution, as well as the native viral antigen. Findings support the hypothesis that selected VHHs could be a powerful tool in the development of rapid and accurate HPS diagnostic assays, which are essential to provide supportive care to patients and reduce the high mortality rate associated with hantavirus infections."
https://openalex.org/W1997827764,"Driven by genomic somatic variation, tumour tissues are typically heterogeneous, yet unbiased quantitative methods are rarely used to analyse heterogeneity at the protein level. Motivated by this problem, we developed automated image segmentation of images of multiple biomarkers in Ewing sarcoma to generate distributions of biomarkers between and within tumour cells. We further integrate high dimensional data with patient clinical outcomes utilising random survival forest (RSF) machine learning. Using material from cohorts of genetically diagnosed Ewing sarcoma with EWSR1 chromosomal translocations, confocal images of tissue microarrays were segmented with level sets and watershed algorithms. Each cell nucleus and cytoplasm were identified in relation to DAPI and CD99, respectively, and protein biomarkers (e.g. Ki67, pS6, Foxo3a, EGR1, MAPK) localised relative to nuclear and cytoplasmic regions of each cell in order to generate image feature distributions. The image distribution features were analysed with RSF in relation to known overall patient survival from three separate cohorts (185 informative cases). Variation in pre-analytical processing resulted in elimination of a high number of non-informative images that had poor DAPI localisation or biomarker preservation (67 cases, 36%). The distribution of image features for biomarkers in the remaining high quality material (118 cases, 104 features per case) were analysed by RSF with feature selection, and performance assessed using internal cross-validation, rather than a separate validation cohort. A prognostic classifier for Ewing sarcoma with low cross-validation error rates (0.36) was comprised of multiple features, including the Ki67 proliferative marker and a sub-population of cells with low cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio of CD99. Through elimination of bias, the evaluation of high-dimensionality biomarker distribution within cell populations of a tumour using random forest analysis in quality controlled tumour material could be achieved. Such an automated and integrated methodology has potential application in the identification of prognostic classifiers based on tumour cell heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2034069951,"Objective To investigate whether bioelectrical impedance analysis could be used to identify overweight individuals at increased cardiometabolic risk, defined as the presence of metabolic syndrome and/or diabetes. Design and Methods Cross-sectional study of a Scottish population including 1210 women and 788 men. The diagnostic performance of thresholds of percentage body fat measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis to identify people at increased cardiometabolic risk was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic curves. Odds ratios for increased cardiometabolic risk in body mass index categories associated with values above compared to below sex-specific percentage body fat thresholds with optimal diagnostic performance were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analyses. The validity of bioelectrical impedance analysis to measure percentage body fat in this population was tested by examining agreement between bioelectrical impedance analysis and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in a subgroup of individuals. Results Participants were aged 16-91 years and the optimal bioelectrical impedance analysis cut-points for percentage body fat for identifying people at increased cardiometabolic risk were 25.9% for men and 37.1% for women. Stratifying by these percentage body fat cut-points, the prevalence of increased cardiometabolic risk was 48% and 38% above the threshold and 24% and 19% below these thresholds for men and women, respectively. By comparison, stratifying by percentage body fat category had little impact on identifying increased cardiometabolic risk in normal weight and obese individuals. Fully adjusted odds ratios of being at increased cardiometabolic risk among overweight people with percentage body fat ≥25.9/37.1% compared with percentage body fat <25.9/37.1% as a reference were 1.93 (95% confidence interval: 1.20–3.10) for men and 1.79 (1.10–2.92) for women. Conclusion Percentage body fat measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis above a sex-specific threshold could be used in overweight people to identify individuals at increased cardiometabolic risk, who could benefit from risk factor management."

Methods Data on patients with pathologically-confirmed T3/4 or N1/2 rectal cancer who accepted radical surgery at our center from January 2002 to June 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. The patients' 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed by comparing those who accepted radical surgery only (Group S) with those who accepted radical surgery and oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy (Group SO). Results A total of 236 patients were analyzed (Group S 135; Group SO 101). Group S patients were older and had a higher proportion with stage II disease and more perioperative complications than those in Group SO (P<0.05). The OS and DSS of patients with stage III disease under 50 years of age or with mucinous adenocarcinoma were higher in Group SO than Group S (P<0.05). In addition, the OS of patients with stage N2b disease was higher in Group SO than Group S (P = 0.016), and the OS of patients with stage N1a or N2b disease who received more than 8 weeks of oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy was also higher in Group SO than Group S (P<0.05). Although the OS and DSS of patients with stage II disease in Group SO showed a tendency towards improvement, the differences between the groups were not statistically significant. Conclusion Adjuvant oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy can improve the survival of patients with locally-advanced low and middle rectal cancers in comparison with observation. Randomized, prospective trials are warranted to confirm this benefit of oxaliplatin for rectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2083130843,"Background Many studies try to identify cancer diagnostic biomarkers by comparing peripheral whole blood (PWB) of cancer samples and healthy controls, explicitly or implicitly assuming that such biomarkers are potential candidate biomarkers for distinguishing cancer from nonmalignant inflammation-associated diseases. Methods Multiple PWB gene expression profiles for lung cancer/inflammation-associated pulmonary diseases were used for differential mRNAs identification and comparison and for proportion estimation of PWB cell subtypes. Results The differentially expressed genes (DE genes) between lung cancer/inflammation-associated pulmonary patients and healthy controls were reproducibly identified in different datasets. For these DE genes observed in lung cancer/inflammation-associated pulmonary diseases, more than 90.2% were differentially expressed between myeloid cells and lymphoid cells, with at least 96.8% having consistent directions of regulation (up- or down-regulations) in myeloid cells compared to lymphoid cells, explainable by the shifted populations of PWB cell subtypes under the disease conditions. The comparison of DE genes for lung cancer and inflammation-associated pulmonary diseases showed that the overlapping genes were 100% consistent in the sense of direction of regulation. Conclusions The differential blood mRNAs observed in lung cancer and in inflammation-associated pulmonary diseases were similar, both mainly reflecting the difference between myeloid cells and lymphoid cells predominantly determined by PWB cell population shifts. Thus, the strategy of comparing cancer with healthy controls may provide little information of the ability of the identified candidate biomarkers in discriminating cancer from inflammation-associated pulmonary diseases."
