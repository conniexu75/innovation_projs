https://openalex.org/W2048419737,"THE key carbohydrate intermediate, glucose 6-phosphate, which may follow several alternative metabolic pathways including the 6-phosphogluconate oxidative cycle and the glycolytic sequence, enters the latter route by the phosphoglucose isomerase reaction. This reaction, in which glucose 6-phosphate is reversibly converted into fructose 6-phosphate, could conceivably play a part in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, although it has seldom been considered from this point of view, doubtless because of the extremely high activity of the enzyme in most tissues and because the reaction has so far appeared to be very little affected by extraneous influences. The present evidence suggesting that the enzyme is strongly inhibited by 6-phosphogluconic acid, an intermediate in the direct oxidative pathway, may therefore be of interest in connexion with studies on the mechanism responsible for the partitioning of carbohydrate between the direct oxidative pathway and the glycolytic route."

https://openalex.org/W2065436085,"IT is not yet known for certain whether the physiological responses to bee venom include the formation of antibodies. Earlier investigators have obtained divergent results when investigating immunization against different effects of the venom. This is probably in part due to the fact that a series of pharmacological and enzymatic reactions are caused by quite different constituents of the venom1. In recent years, several proteins with various biological properties have been isolated: first, the pharmacologically highly active toxin-fraction (so-called ‘fraction I’)2 ; then the enzymes phospholipase A 3 and hyaluronidase4, which on electrophoresis migrate in the so-called ‘fraction II’. From these findings arises the question whether antigenic properties may be found with these substances."

Evidence suggests that the mast cells do not produce the histamine but have a specific faculty of storing this compound. However, storage does not occur until metachromatically staining granules of heparin become visible in the cytoplasm of the cells. Experiments have been carried out, therefore, to study the affinity of histamine and heparin for one another."

https://openalex.org/W4236246269,"THE clarification of agar has always presented technical difficulties. The problem has become even more acute with the application of agar gels as a supporting medium for the interaction of antigen–antibody systems. A clear, transparent gel is essential for reading and photographing the lines, often fine and faint, formed by the antigen–antibody precipitates. That the classical microbiological methods of clarification, for example, filtration through sand and paper pulp, egg albumin coagulation, are insufficient is obvious from the elaborate, laborious methods devised in attempts to produce clear agar1,2."

https://openalex.org/W2009907701,"IT is known that histamine liberators such as 48/80, egg white and dextran produce in rat skin œdema and capillary changes which lead to accumulation of circulating colloidal dye. These changes show a characteristic distribution and occur in skin regions, such as those of feet and face, which are particularly rich in histamine1. However, the part of histamine in these changes has been questioned. When discussing these changes it is necessary to deal separately with the œdema formation and the dye accumulation. The œdema is a sign of greatly increased capillary permeability. Concerning the accumulation of a circulating colloidal dye such as trypan blue, the present concept is that the dye is bound in the bloodstream to plasma proteins which penetrate the dilated capillary wall, moving through the dilated capillaries into the damaged area. The mechanism for this penetration is the phagocytic activity of the endothelial cells, histiocytes and fibriocytes which take up the proteins. The accumulation of circulating dye thus indicates an increased local phagocytic activity. The present experiments show that release of histamine is responsible for the œdema formation but that the accumulation of circulating dye is independent of histamine release."

Since they might possibly occur in the skin of other extremities the following investigation was carried out."

https://openalex.org/W1979977918,"POLYETHYLENE glycol seems to be particularly suitable as an embedding medium for demonstrating several enzymes. Certain polyethylene glycols and their monostearates (polyethylene glycol 1,000 and ‘Nonex 63’, both obtainable from Gemec Chemicals Co., 120 Moorgate, London, E.C.2; ‘Polywachs 1,000’ and ‘Produkt V 2,275’. both manufactured by C. W. H. Marl, Kreis Recklinghausen, Germany) are available as wax-like compounds, which in consistency strongly resemble paraffin, but have a lower melting point and are soluble in water, are very suitable for demonstrating non- or slightly diffusible enzymes. The polyethylene glycol embedding has the great advantage over paraffin embedding that the procedure takes only a short period of time (4–5 hr.) and the enzyme is exposed for 2–3 hr. at 42° C. In addition, substances such as ethanol which may inactivate the enzymes can be avoided."

It affects the enzymic activity of isolated mitochondria and lyses red blood cells3. Unfractionated welchii toxin caused histological changes in fragments of tissues and organs, including the release of fat globules, lysis of nuclei, and general break-up, that agreed more or less with the clinical picture4, and destroyed guinea pig spleen in culture5."
