https://openalex.org/W2046758551,Nanoelectromechanical systems were fabricated from single- and multilayer graphene sheets by mechanically exfoliating thin sheets from graphite over trenches in silicon oxide. Vibrations with fundamental resonant frequencies in the megahertz range are actuated either optically or electrically and detected optically by interferometry. We demonstrate room-temperature charge sensitivities down to 8 × 10 –4 electrons per root hertz. The thinnest resonator consists of a single suspended layer of atoms and represents the ultimate limit of two-dimensional nanoelectromechanical systems.
https://openalex.org/W1979029367,"Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between a quantum emitter (for example an atom or a quantum dot) and a single mode from a radiation field. When the two are strongly coupled it is possible to realize key quantum information processing tasks. In the solid state this could be achieved by coupling semiconductor quantum dots to optical microcavities. However, validating the efficacy of quantum dots in quantum information applications requires confirmation of the quantum nature of the quantum-dot–cavity system in the strong coupling regime. A collaboration between labs at ETH Zurich and the University of California, Santa Barbara, now provides this sought-after confirmation. The experiments involve a photonic crystal nanocavity in which one, and only one, quantum dot is located precisely at the cavity electric field maximum. A series of experiments that provide confirmation of the quantum nature of the quantum–dot–cavity system in the strong coupling regime by studying a photonic crystal nanocavity in which one, and only one, quantum dot is located precisely at the cavity electric field maximum. Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between a quantum emitter and a single radiation-field mode. When an atom is strongly coupled to a cavity mode1,2, it is possible to realize important quantum information processing tasks, such as controlled coherent coupling and entanglement of distinguishable quantum systems. Realizing these tasks in the solid state is clearly desirable, and coupling semiconductor self-assembled quantum dots to monolithic optical cavities is a promising route to this end. However, validating the efficacy of quantum dots in quantum information applications requires confirmation of the quantum nature of the quantum-dot–cavity system in the strong-coupling regime. Here we find such confirmation by observing quantum correlations in photoluminescence from a photonic crystal nanocavity3,4,5 interacting with one, and only one, quantum dot located precisely at the cavity electric field maximum. When off-resonance, photon emission from the cavity mode and quantum-dot excitons is anticorrelated at the level of single quanta, proving that the mode is driven solely by the quantum dot despite an energy mismatch between cavity and excitons. When tuned to resonance, the exciton and cavity enter the strong-coupling regime of cavity QED and the quantum-dot exciton lifetime reduces by a factor of 145. The generated photon stream becomes antibunched, proving that the strongly coupled exciton/photon system is in the quantum regime. Our observations unequivocally show that quantum information tasks are achievable in solid-state cavity QED."

We investigated neural correlates of loss aversion while individuals decided whether to accept or reject gambles that offered a 50/50 chance of gaining or losing money. A broad set of areas (including midbrain dopaminergic regions and their targets) showed increasing activity as potential gains increased. Potential losses were represented by decreasing activity in several of these same gain-sensitive areas. Finally, individual differences in behavioral loss aversion were predicted by a measure of neural loss aversion in several regions, including the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex."

We found that smokers with brain damage involving the insula, a region implicated in conscious urges, were more likely than smokers with brain damage not involving the insula to undergo a disruption of smoking addiction, characterized by the ability to quit smoking easily, immediately, without relapse, and without persistence of the urge to smoke. This result suggests that the insula is a critical neural substrate in the addiction to smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2046778918,"A mutualistic association between a fungal endophyte and a tropical panic grass allows both organisms to grow at high soil temperatures. We characterized a virus from this fungus that is involved in the mutualistic interaction. Fungal isolates cured of the virus are unable to confer heat tolerance, but heat tolerance is restored after the virus is reintroduced. The virus-infected fungus confers heat tolerance not only to its native monocot host but also to a eudicot host, which suggests that the underlying mechanism involves pathways conserved between these two groups of plants."
https://openalex.org/W1999132350,"Vitamin A has diverse biological functions. It is transported in the blood as a complex with retinol binding protein (RBP), but the molecular mechanism by which vitamin A is absorbed by cells from the vitamin A–RBP complex is not clearly understood. We identified in bovine retinal pigment epithelium cells STRA6, a multitransmembrane domain protein, as a specific membrane receptor for RBP. STRA6 binds to RBP with high affinity and has robust vitamin A uptake activity from the vitamin A–RBP complex. It is widely expressed in embryonic development and in adult organ systems. The RBP receptor represents a major physiological mediator of cellular vitamin A uptake."

https://openalex.org/W2057671118,"Responsive behavior, which is intrinsic to natural systems, is becoming a key requirement for advanced artificial materials and devices, presenting a substantial scientific and engineering challenge. We designed dynamic actuation systems by integrating high-aspect-ratio silicon nanocolumns, either free-standing or substrate-attached, with a hydrogel layer. The nanocolumns were put in motion by the ""muscle"" of the hydrogel, which swells or contracts depending on the humidity level. This actuation resulted in a fast reversible reorientation of the nanocolumns from tilted to perpendicular to the surface. By further controlling the stress field in the hydrogel, the formation of a variety of elaborate reversibly actuated micropatterns was demonstrated. The mechanics of the actuation process have been assessed. Dynamic control over the movement and orientation of surface nanofeatures at the micron and submicron scales may have exciting applications in actuators, microfluidics, or responsive materials."
https://openalex.org/W2054552883,"We observed Shubnikov–de Haas oscillation and the quantum Hall effect in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas in polar ZnO/Mg x Zn 1– x O heterostructures grown by laser molecular beam epitaxy. The electron density could be controlled in a range of 0.7 × 10 12 to 3.7 × 10 12 per square centimeter by tuning the magnesium content in the barriers and the growth polarity. From the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude, the effective mass of the two-dimensional electrons was derived as 0.32 ± 0.03 times the free electron mass. Demonstration of the quantum Hall effect in an oxide heterostructure presents the possibility of combining quantum Hall physics with the versatile functionality of metal oxides in complex heterostructures."
https://openalex.org/W2086810512,"Adult stem cells often divide asymmetrically to produce one self-renewed stem cell and one differentiating cell, thus maintaining both populations. The asymmetric outcome of stem cell divisions can be specified by an oriented spindle and local self-renewal signals from the stem cell niche. Here we show that developmentally programmed asymmetric behavior and inheritance of mother and daughter centrosomes underlies the stereotyped spindle orientation and asymmetric outcome of stem cell divisions in the Drosophila male germ line. The mother centrosome remains anchored near the niche while the daughter centrosome migrates to the opposite side of the cell before spindle formation."
https://openalex.org/W1965558704,"In the developing fly wing, secreted morphogens such as Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Wingless (Wg) form gradients of concentration providing positional information. Dpp forms a longer-range gradient than Wg. To understand how the range is controlled, we measured the four key kinetic parameters governing morphogen spreading: the production rate, the effective diffusion coefficient, the degradation rate, and the immobile fraction. The four parameters had different values for Dpp versus Wg. In addition, Dynamin-dependent endocytosis was required for spreading of Dpp, but not Wg. Thus, the cellular mechanisms of Dpp and Wingless spreading are different: Dpp spreading requires endocytic, intracellular trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2077965112,"The normal synovium forms a membrane at the edges of joints and provides lubrication and nutrients for the cartilage. In rheumatoid arthritis, the synovium is the site of inflammation, and it participates in an organized tissue response that damages cartilage and bone. We identified cadherin-11 as essential for the development of the synovium. Cadherin-11-deficient mice have a hypoplastic synovial lining, display a disorganized synovial reaction to inflammation, and are resistant to inflammatory arthritis. Cadherin-11 therapeutics prevent and reduce arthritis in mouse models. Thus, synovial cadherin-11 determines the behavior of synovial cells in their proinflammatory and destructive tissue response in inflammatory arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W1974805319,"During normal development, the epidermis and hair follicle are distinct lineage compartments maintained by independent stem cell populations. Both epidermal and follicular keratinocytes are recruited to participate in epidermal repair in response to injury. However, it is generally thought that follicular cells contribute to the wound epidermis only transiently and are ultimately replaced by the progeny of stem cells derived from the original epidermal compartment prior to wounding. Here we use inducible and constitutive cre recombinase expressed from the Sonic hedgehog locus (Shh) for in vivo lineage tracing. This analysis confirms that follicular cells participate in the initial resurfacing of the wound but also reveals that their progeny persist in wound epidermis for months after the wound is healed. It further demonstrates that Shh is not induced in keratinocytes during the wound healing process. We conclude that follicular cells can undergo reprogramming to become long-term repopulating epidermal progenitors following wounding."
https://openalex.org/W2003271076,"There has been considerable speculation about the role of water and water complexes in chemical gas-phase reactions, including the conjecture that water may act as a molecular catalyst through its ability to form hydrogen bonds. Here, we present kinetic studies in which the effect of water on the rate of the reaction between hydroxyl radicals and acetaldehyde has been measured directly in Laval nozzle expansions at low temperatures. An increasing enhancement of the reaction rate by added water was found with decreasing temperatures between 300 and 60 kelvin. Quantum chemical calculations and statistical rate theory support our conclusions that this observation is due to the reduction of an intrinsic reaction barrier caused by specific water aggregation. The results suggest that even single water molecules can act as catalysts in radical-molecule reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2115078227,"Marine biogenic dimethylsulfide (DMS) is the main natural source of tropospheric sulfur, which may play a key role in cloud formation and albedo over the remote ocean. Through a global data analysis, we found that DMS concentrations are highly positively correlated with the solar radiation dose in the upper mixed layer of the open ocean, irrespective of latitude, plankton biomass, or temperature. This is a necessary condition for the feasibility of a negative feedback in which light-attenuating DMS emissions are in turn driven by the light dose received by the pelagic ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2006130551,"Primary pneumonic plague is transmitted easily, progresses rapidly, and causes high mortality, but the mechanisms by which Yersinia pestis overwhelms the lungs are largely unknown. We show that the plasminogen activator Pla is essential for Y. pestis to cause primary pneumonic plague but is less important for dissemination during pneumonic plague than during bubonic plague. Experiments manipulating its temporal expression showed that Pla allows Y. pestis to replicate rapidly in the airways, causing a lethal fulminant pneumonia; if unexpressed, inflammation is aborted, and lung repair is activated. Inhibition of Pla expression prolonged the survival of animals with the disease, offering a therapeutic option to extend the period during which antibiotics are effective."
https://openalex.org/W2054701523,"Cys2/His2-type zinc finger proteins, which contain the EAR transcriptional repressor domain, are thought to play a key role in regulating the defense response of plants to biotic and abiotic stress conditions. Although constitutive expression of several of these proteins was shown to enhance the tolerance of transgenic plants to abiotic stress, it is not clear whether the EAR-motif of these proteins is involved in this function. In addition, it is not clear whether suppression of plant growth, induced in transgenic plants by different Cys2/His2 EAR-containing proteins, is mediated by the EAR-domain. Here we report that transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing the Cys2/His2 zinc finger protein Zat7 have suppressed growth and are more tolerant to salinity stress. A deletion or a mutation of the EAR-motif of Zat7 abolishes salinity tolerance without affecting growth suppression. These results demonstrate that the EAR-motif of Zat7 is directly involved in enhancing the tolerance of transgenic plants to salinity stress. In contrast, the EAR-motif appears not to be involved in suppressing the growth of transgenic plants. Further analysis of Zat7 using RNAi lines suggests that Zat7 functions in Arabidopsis to suppress a repressor of defense responses. A yeast two-hybrid analysis identified putative interactors of Zat7 and the EAR-domain, including WRKY70 and HASTY, a protein involved in miRNA transport.

Transcriptional repressors are emerging as central regulators of development and stress responses in different organisms. By suppressing defense responses and keeping developmental programs under control they are thought to prevent excessive waste of resources and the activation of programmed cell death caused by metabolic imbalances or runaway response pathways (1Kazan K.

Transcriptional repressors were shown in some cases to be activated by the same signals they control, generating an efficient regulatory circuit. They can also be constantly present in cells, but removed in response to a specific signal by proteolytic degradation (1Kazan K.

Passive repressors are thought to function by competing with transcriptional activators for DNA binding or by binding and displacing coactivators required for transcriptional activation. They typically do not have an intrinsic repressing activity or a distinguished repression domain. By contrast, active repressors exhibit intrinsic repression activity that targets chromatin organization. They function via modifying histone deacetylation, or altering histone methylation and inducing heterochromatin formation (3Thiel G. Lietz M. Hohl M. Eur. J.

Zat12 was initially identified as a light stress response protein (6Iida A. Kazuoka T. Torikai S. Kikuchi H. Oeda K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 191-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was found to be involved in the defense response of plants to cold and oxidative stress, and was shown to be required for the expression of the defense enzyme cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 1 (APX1) during oxidative stress (7Rizhsky L.

Thomashow M.F. Plant J. 2005; 41: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of Zat12 results in the enhanced expression of a defense regulon that includes different transcripts involved in plant acclimation to high light and osmotic stress (9Davletova S. Schlauch K. Coutu J. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In accordance, transgenic plants constitutively expressing Zat12 are more tolerant to high light, osmotic and oxidative stresses, and knock-out plants lacking Zat12 are more sensitive to osmotic stress and salinity (7Rizhsky L. Davletova S. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11736-11743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 9Davletova S. Schlauch K. Coutu J. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Zat10 was initially identified as a salt-, drought-, and cold-response protein (10Sakamoto H. Araki T. Meshi T. Iwabuchi M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It was shown to contain a functional EAR-motif and to suppress the transcription of different reporter and defense genes (5Ohta M. Matsui K. Hiratsu K. Shinshi H. Ohme-Takagi M.

Constitutive expression of Zat10 was found to result in growth suppression and enhanced tolerance of plants to drought stress, osmotic stress, and salinity (12Sakamoto H. Maruyama K. Sakuma Y.

Interestingly, Zat10 loss-of-function lines are also more tolerant to osmotic and salinity stress, suggesting that Zat10 plays a dual role in modulating the defense response of plants to abiotic stresses (13Mittler R.

Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 109-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, it is not clear whether the enhanced tolerance of transgenic plants expressing different Zat proteins to abiotic stresses is mediated by the EAR-motif, and whether or not growth suppression observed in some of these plants is also a result of transcriptional repression by the EAR-motif. Here we report that transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the C2H2 zinc finger protein Zat7 (At3g46090) are more tolerant to salinity stress. Transgenic plants expressing Zat7 are suppressed in their growth. A deletion or a mutation of the EAR-motif of Zat7 abolishes salinity tolerance without affecting growth suppression. These results demonstrate that the EAR-motif of Zat7 is directly involved in enhancing the tolerance of transgenic plants to salinity stress.

For the Zat7-RNAi5′ construct, a 120-bp fragment corresponding to coding sequence at the 5′-end of Zat7 was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with ZAT7IR-3 (5′-CTCGAGGGATCCATGGTTGCGAGAAGTGAGGA-3′) and ZAT7IR-4 (5′-GGTACCATCGATGAAAACACGTTCATCTCCCC-3′) primers and cloned into pCRScript (Stratagene). After verification of the sequence, each of these Zat7 fragments was then subcloned into pHannibal in the sense and antisense directions (14Wesley S.V. Helliwell C.A. Smith N.A. Wang M.B. Rouse D.T.

For the 35S::Zat7Δ construct, Zat7 was amplified from genomic DNA using ZAT7-3 and ZAT7-7 (5′-TTAACAAGCCACTCTCTTCCCAC-3′) and cloned into pCRScript. After verification of the sequence, Zat7Δ was subcloned as a XhoI/NotI fragment into 35SpBARN. The resulting plasmid was transformed into Agrobacterium strain GV3101. 35S::Zat7m was made using overlap extension PCR. In the first round of PCR, two partially overlapping pieces of Zat7 were amplified using ZAT7-3 and ZAT7-9 (5′-ATCTAAGGCCGCAGCCAAACAAGCCACTCTCTTCC-3′) for one piece and ZAT7-8 (5′-TGTTTGGCTGCGGCCTTAGATTCGATGGAGAGTTT-3′) and ZAT7-2 for the other piece. A second round of PCR was carried out with these two PCR products and the outer primers (ZAT7-3 and ZAT7-2). After verification of the sequence, Zat7m was subcloned as a XhoI/NotI fragment into 35SpBARN. The resulting plasmid was transformed into Agrobacterium strain EHA105.Arabidopsis Ler plants were transformed using the floral dip method, and transformants were selected on Gamborg's B5 medium supplemented with the herbicide Basta.

Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Plates were placed at 4 °C for 48 h and maintained vertically in a growth chamber for 5 days (21-22 °C, constant light, 100 μmol m-2 s-1). Root length was scored at 3, 4, and 5 days after vernalization. Four- or five-day-old seedlings grown on 0.5× MS agar plates were also subjected to heat (38 °C) or cold stress (4 °C) for different times, allowed to recover for 24 h and analyzed (9Davletova S. Schlauch K. Coutu J. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar).For soil stress experiments, 7-day-old seedlings of wild type and three independent 35S::Zat7, Zat7m, Zat7Δ lines were transferred to vermiculite, watered for 5 days with 0.1-0.5× Peter's fertilizer 20-20-20 solution and subjected to salinity stress by watering with 0, 50, 75, 100, or 150 mm NaCl prepared in 0.1-0.5× Peter's fertilizer 20-20-20 solution for 20 days. Plants were then photographed and sampled for RNA blot analysis. All experiments were performed with 3-5 technical replications, each containing 15-30 seedlings or plants per line, and repeated at least 3 times. Statistical analysis was performed as described in Ref. 23Suzuki N. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Mittler R.

A Gateway™ cassette was introduced into the yeast two-hybrid vector pXDGATCY86 containing cycloheximide-sensitive gene (CYHS) (24Ding X. Cory G. Song W.Y. Anal. Chem. 2004; 331: 195-197Google Scholar). Recombination between pENTR vectors and destination vectors were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After confirming that baits were in-frame with the DNA binding domain, constructs were transformed into MaV204K yeast strain (25Ito T. Tashiro K. Muta S. Ozawa R. Chiba T. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto K. Kuhara S. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) (MAT α, leu2-3,112; trp1-901; his3 Δ200; ade2-101; cyh2R; can1R; gal4 Δ; gal80 Δ; GAL1::lacZ; HIS3UASGAL1::[email protected]; SPAL10::URA3) as described in the Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. Baits were checked for autoactivation of the reporter genes by growth on synthetic dropout (SD) -His/-Trp supplemented with 0, 1, 5, 7, 10, and 20 mm 3-AT (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole).Construction of the Yeast Prey Library—The Matchmaker™ Library Construction and Screening kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was used to construct a prey library in the pGADT7-Rec vector according to manufacturer's instructions. A mixture of total RNA isolated from 14-day-old Arabidopsis Col-0 seedlings exposed to various treatments including NaCl (150 mm), sorbitol (440 mm), 4 °C, 42 °C, high light (>300 μE/m2/sec), darkness, salicylic acid (100 μm), ABA (100 μm), benzylaminopurine (100 μm), methyl jasmonate (100 μm), indole acetic acid (100 μm), gibberellic acid (100 μm), paraquat (10 μm), wounding (with a needle), 2,4-D (100 μm), brassinolide (100 μm), hydrogen peroxide (20 mm), desiccation (RT, 60% RH), and cell suspension (7-day-old cultures), control and water deficit-stressed roots, flowers, and siliques was used. Tissues for RNA extraction were pooled from samples collected 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the start of each treatment. The cDNA prey library was introduced into AH109 yeast cells (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ, MEL1) by in vivo recombination.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Bait strains were mated with the prey library according to manufacturer's recommendations, followed by selection of interacting partners on solid SD medium lacking Ade, His, Trp, and Leu supplemented with 10 mm 3-AT. Positive and negative controls for interaction and mating were performed following the manufacturer's recommendations. Positive interactions grew on solid SD media were selected three times on SD -Ade/-His/-Trp/-Leu supplemented with 10 mm 3-AT. Bait plasmid was cured from positive clones that passed three rounds of selection by adding 1 μg/ml of cycloheximide and grown overnight with shaking. Curing of bait plasmids was confirmed by PCR followed by plasmid preparation from cured clones containing only prey plasmids. Plasmids were then amplified from yeast using Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) with the TempliPhi 100 Amplification kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The RCA products were used to transform yeast strains containing specific baits to verify interaction (26Ding X. Snyder A.K. Shaw R. Song W.Y. Biotech. 2003; 35: 774-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Clones containing only prey were tested for autoactivated by growing them on SD: -Leu/His and 10 mm 3-AT for 4 days. Preys capable of autoactivation of the reporter gene were excluded, and verified clones were sequenced.Validation and β-Galactosidase Assays—Yeast stains with WRKY or HASTY genes as preys were mated one-on-one in parallel against the yeast expressing the full-length Zat7 bait and the last 25 amino acids of Zat7 as bait as well as mating between the empty prey vector as a negative control. AH109 strain harboring the pGADT7-RecT vector was mated with the MaV204K strain harboring the pGBKT7-53 vector as a positive interaction control. Mating was performed in 1:1 ratios between each bait and prey pairs on 2× YPAD medium for 24 h followed by plating on SD medium lacks Ade, His, Trp, and Leu supplemented with 10 mm 3-AT. Growth assays were performed in positive interaction pairs as well as empty bait vector grown on SD medium lacking Ade, His, Trp, and Leu plus 10 mm 3-AT for 16 h. A600 was measured for three independent 100-μl cultures and then assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the yeast β-galactosidase assay kit (cat. 75768; Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. A600 and A420 were measured using the PerkinElmer Victor 3v multiplate reader. The β-galactosidase activity was calculated using the equation: β-galactosidase activity = 1000 × A420/T × V × A600 where T is time (in minutes) of incubation and V is volume of cells (ml) used in the assay.RESULTSExpression of Zat7 in Arabidopsis and Phenotype of Transgenic Plants with Constitutive Expression of Zat7—Transcripts encoding at least four different members of the Zat protein family show broad response to biotic and abiotic stresses (Zat6, 10, 11, and 12; Ref 13Mittler R. Kim Y.S. Song L. Coutu J. Coutu A. Ciftci-Yilmaz S. Lee H. Stevenson B. Zhu J.-K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6537-6542Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of Zat7 appears to be more specific, with enhanced expression mainly in roots during salinity stress (supplemental Fig. S1A, generated from transcriptome profiling data available at Ref. 18Zimmermann P. Hirsch-Hoffmann M. Hennig L. Gruissem W. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2621-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). In contrast to the early and transient expression of Zat12 during stress (9Davletova S. Schlauch K. Coutu J. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 17Davletova S. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shengqiang Z. Oliver D.J. Coutu J. Shulaev V. Schlauch K. Mittler R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), the expression of Zat7 in Arabidopsis roots subjected to salinity stress is enhanced at 6, 12, and 24 h, suggesting that Zat7 functions relatively late during salinity stress (supplemental Fig. S1B). Expression of Zat7 was enhanced at concentrations as low as 50 mm NaCl (Fig. 1A). Expression of Zat7 was previously reported to be enhanced in Arabidopsis plants subjected to heat stress (23Suzuki N. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shuman J. Shulaev V. Mittler R. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), as well as in knock-out Apx1 plants grown under controlled growth conditions (16Pnueli L. Hongjian L. Mittler R. Plant J. 2003; 34: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Davletova S. Rizhsky L. Liang H. Shengqiang Z. Oliver D.J. Coutu J. Shulaev V. Schlauch K. Mittler R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), suggesting that Zat7 expression could also be associated with heat or hydrogen peroxide stress.In a previous report we expressed Zat7 in Arabidopsis thaliana cv. Columbia and found that expression of Zat7 resulted in growth suppression of transgenic plants (7Rizhsky L. Davletova S. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11736-11743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Different studies on the expression of Zat12 in transgenic plants produced conflicting reports on the suppression of growth induced by this protein in transgenic plants (7Rizhsky L. Davletova S. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11736-11743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 8Vogel J.T. Zarka D.G. Van Buskirk H.A. Fowler S.G. Thomashow M.F.

The discrepancies in phenotypes were linked to Zat12 expression level in the different plants, as well as to the use of different cultivars (7Rizhsky L. Davletova S. Liang H. Mittler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11736-11743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 8Vogel J.T. Zarka D.G. Van Buskirk H.A. Fowler S.G. Thomashow M.F. Plant J. 2005; 41: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). To test whether Zat7 expression would also induce growth suppression in A. thaliana cv Landsberg erecta (Ler), used in this study, we generated transgenic Ler lines with different levels of Zat7 expression. As shown in Fig. 1B, high level of Zat7 expression resulted in growth suppression. Constitutive expression of Zat7, therefore, could cause growth suppression in Columbia as well as in Landsberg erecta cultivars.Constitutive expression of different Zat proteins was shown to result in the enhanced expression of transcripts encoding different regulatory and defense proteins in transgenic plants (8Vogel J.T. Zarka D.G. Van Buskirk H.A. Fowler S.G. Thomashow M.F. Plant J. 2005; 41: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 9Davletova S. Schlauch K. Coutu J. Mittler R.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6537-6542Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The enhanced expression of Zat7 in response to salinity stress (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1), prompted us to test whether Zat7 expression in transgenic plants, grown under controlled conditions, is also associated with the elevated expression of different defense transcripts involved in the response of plants to salinity stress. As shown in Fig. 1C, the expression of different transcripts associated with salinity tolerance in plants (27Blumwald E. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 2003; 20: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Apse M.P. Aharon G.S. Snedden W.A. Blumwald E. Science. 1999; 285: 1256-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar) was elevated in transgenic plants expressing Zat7, grown under controlled conditions.Mutational Analysis of the EAR-motif of Zat7—To perform functional characterization of the EAR-motif of Zat7 we generated transgenic lines expressing two different variants of Zat7: a deletion of the C-terminal 25 amino acids region that contains the EAR-motif (Zat7Δ), and a site-specific mutagenesis converting the LDLDL EAR-motif at position 144-148 to LAAAL at the same position (144-148; Zat7m). As shown in Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2, deletion or mutation of the EAR-domain had no significant effect on the growth suppression phenotype of Zat7. In contrast, expression of defense transcripts, associated with salinity tolerance, was not enhanced in transgenic plants with constitutive expression of Zat7Δ or Zat7m (Fig. 2D)."

We have measured the current loss rate due to the solar wind interaction for different species: Q(O + ) = 1.6·10 23 per second = 4 grams per second (g s –1 ), Q(O + 2 ) = 1.5·10 23 s –1 = 8 g s –1 , and Q(CO + 2 ) = 8·10 22 s –1 = 6 g s –1 in the energy range of 30 to 30,000 electron volts per charge. These rates can be propagated backward over a period of 3.5 billion years, resulting in the total removal of 0.2 to 4 millibar of carbon dioxide and a few centimeters of water. The escape rate is low, and thus one has to continue searching for water reservoirs and carbon dioxide stores on or beneath the planetary surface and investigate other escape channels."

https://openalex.org/W2152316062,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) acts as an extracellular ligand for a family of G-protein coupled receptors that are crucial in cell migration. S1P5 is exclusively expressed in oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which migrate considerable distances during brain development. The current studies suggest a physiological role for S1P and S1P5 in regulation of OPC migration. mRNA expression levels of S1P2 and S1P5 are comparable in OPCs, but S1P binding specifically to the S1P5 receptor blocked OPC migration (IC50=29 nM). Thus, knocking down S1P5 using siRNA prevented the S1P-induced decrease in OPC migration, whereas knocking down S1P2 did not have any effect. S1P-induced modulation of OPC migration was insensitive to pertussis toxin, suggesting that S1P5-initiated signaling is not mediated by the G alpha(i)-protein coupled pathway. Furthermore, S1P5 appears to engage the G alpha(12/13) protein coupled Rho/ROCK signaling pathway to impede OPC migration. To modulate OPC motility, extracellular S1P could be derived from the export of intracellular S1P generated in response to glutamate treatment of OPCs. These studies suggest that S1P could be a part of the neuron-oligodendroglial communication network regulating OPC migration and may provide directional guidance cues for migrating OPCs in the developing brain."

We elucidate here that an anti-oxidative response leads to induction of UGT1A1 through the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway. When human HepG2 cells were treated with the prooxidants tert-butylhydroquinone and β-naphthoflavone, cellular UGT1A1 glucuronidation activities were increased. The induction of UGT1A1 proceeded following the overexpression of Nrf2 and was blocked following overexpression of Keap1, demonstrating that Keap1 suppresses Nrf2 activation of the UGT1A1 gene. Loss of function analysis for Nrf2 conducted by small interfering RNA revealed that induction of UGT1A1 was not seen in Nrf2 knock-out cells. To examine the contribution of oxidants toward the regulation of human UGT1A1 in vivo, transgenic mice bearing the human UGT1 locus (Tg-UGT1) were treated with tert-butylhydroquinone. Human UGT1A1 was markedly increased in small and large intestines as well as in liver. Gene mapping experiments including transfections of UGT1A1 reporter gene constructs into HepG2 cells coupled with functional analysis of Nrf2 expression and binding to anti-oxidant-response elements (ARE) resulted in identification of an ARE in the phenobarbital-response enhancer module region of the UGT1A1 gene. The ARE flanks the recently identified Ah receptor xenobiotic-responsive element. The results suggest that Nrf2-Keap1-dependent UGT1A1 induction by prooxidants might represent a key adaptive response to cellular oxidative stress that defends against a variety of environmental insults, including electrophile attacks and chemical carcinogenesis.

Glucuronide formation plays a central role in cellular protection by transforming the substrates into more water-soluble forms, thus facilitating the excretion of the metabolites into the urine and bile. This highly efficient detoxification process is carried out by 19 functional UGTs in humans, 9 of which are encoded by the UGT1 locus on chromosome 2 and the remainder by individual UGT2 genes on chromosome 4 (2Mackenzie P.I.

Keap1 has been shown to bind to both Nrf2 and the actin cytoskeletion to retain Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the Keap1 protein, which negatively regulates Nrf2 by facilitating its proteasomal degradation (19McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21592-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). When oxidative or xenobiotic stimuli occur, Nrf2 and Keap1 dissociate, and Nrf2 migrates to the nucleus where it functions as a strong transcriptional activator of selected target genes (20Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Therefore, agents that inhibit the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2 lead to an accumulation of the Nrf2 transcription factor in the nucleus followed by enhanced expression of target genes (16Thimmulappa R.K.

The DNA binding domain of the UGT1A1 promoter for all of these activated transcriptional factors resides approximately–3300 bp from the start of transcription within a 300-bp region identified as the phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module. In this study, we demonstrate that UGT1A1 is regulated in response to oxidative stress and that the Nrf2-Keap1 complex has a central role in this process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), β-naphthoflavone (BNF), and hydroperoxide were purchased from Sigma. l-Sulforaphane (SULF) was purchased from LKT Laboratories (St. Paul, MN).

The preparation of polyclonal antisera recognizing residues 29–159 of the human UGT1A1 protein has been described (25Ritter J.K. Kessler F.K. Thompson E.T. Grove A.D. Auyeung D.J. Fisher R.A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The antibodies for Western blot analyses of Keap1, Keap1 (N-19), and Nrf2, Nrf2 (H-300), were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Real time quantitative PCR was performed using the QuantiTect™ SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and the reactions were run in an MX400 Multiplex QPCR machine (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).Tissue Culture—Human hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Chemicals for HepG2 treatments were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) with Me2SO concentrations in media never exceeding 0.1% (v/v). For transient transfection experiments, 2 × 105 cells/well were seeded on 12-well plates a day before transfection, with transfections carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions.Glucuronidation Activity by TLC Assay—UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities were determined using 1-naphthol and 17α-ethynylestradiol as substrates by TLC assay according to the method of Bansal and Gessner (26Bansal S.K. Gessner T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, HepG2 cell lysates were prepared by washing and scraping with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline after 24–72 h of treatment. Cell pellets were then homogenized in a 5-fold volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 10 mm MgCl2. Each UGT assay was run in a total volume of 100 μl and contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm substrate, 500 μm uridine 5-diphosphoglucuronic acid, 0.04 μCi of UDP[14C]glucuronic acid, 8.5 mm saccharolactone, and 100 μg of total cell extract. The reactions were performed at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for 60 min. At the end of incubation, 100 μl of cold ethanol was added, and the resulting cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The remaining supernatant was applied to TLC plates, and chromatography performed in a mixture of (35:35:10:20 v/v) of n-butanol:acetone:acetic acid: water. The location of the glucuronides in the TLC plates was visualized with a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and resident glucuronides were removed and placed in scintillation fluid for quantification with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA).Quantitation of UGT1A1, Nrf2, Keap1, and NQO1 Gene Transcripts—Total RNA was isolated from treated HepG2, mouse primary hepatocytes, or mouse tissues using TRIzol as recommended by the supplier. Northern blot analysis was conducted by applying RNA on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels followed by electrophoresis with the resolved RNA being transferred to Genescreen membrane by capillary diffusion. An oligonucleotide probe specific for UGT1A1 (34-mers: 5′-aaacattatgcccgagactaacaaaagactcttt) was 5′-end-labeled using γ-[32P]ATP in the presence of polynucleotide kinase. Following labeling, the probe was purified by filtering through MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The RNA blot was prehybridized with ULTRAhyb-Oligo hybridization buffer (Ambion) at 42 °C for 1 h, followed by hybridization with the radioisotope-labeled oligonucleotide probe at 42 °C overnight. The membrane was then washed twice in 0.5% SDS, 2× SSC for 30 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. For detection of gene transcripts by RT-PCR, total RNA (2 μg) was used for the generation of cDNA with Omniscript reverse transcriptase in a 20-μl reaction according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following cDNA synthesis, 2 μl of the cDNA reaction was used in 20 μl of PCR containing 0.4 μm UGT1A1-specific primer pair (27Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), 0.4 μm mouse or human β-actin primers, and 10 μl of Hotstart Mastermix. For Nqo1 gene expression analysis, the following primers were used: forward, 5′-atggtcggcagaagagcactgatcg-3′, and reverse, 5′-ttttctagctttgatctggttgtcagttggg-3′. The mouse (mouse forward, 5′-atggccactgccgcatcctc, and reverse, 5′-gggtacatggtggtaccacc) or human (27Strassburg C.P. Oldhafer K. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) β-actin RNA was amplified with sequence-specific primers and used as an internal control gene. Real time PCRs were conducted with a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) by the MX4000 Multiplex QPCR as described previously (4Chen S. Beaton D. Nguyen N. Senekeo-Effenberger K. Brace-Sinnokrak E. Argikar U. Remmel R.P. Trottier J. Barbier O. Ritter J.K. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37547-37557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2-μl reaction of cDNA synthesis with total RNA by reverse transcriptase was used in a real time PCR. The polymerase was activated at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of amplification that consisted of the following: 95 °C for 30 s and variable annealing temperature, ranging from 57 to 63 °C and 1 min followed by 72 °C for 45 s. Amplification was followed by DNA denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min and a 41-cycle dissociation curve starting at 55 °C and ramping 1 °C every 30 s. Three fluorescent data points at the end of each annealing plateau were taken, and each sample was performed in triplicate. The disassociate curve was performed, and the quantity for each sample was derived from ΔCt = Ct(target gene) – Ct(β-actin reference). The data were log-transformed, and the difference of each sample relative to their concomitant Me2SO control sample was calculated. For the detection of human UGT1A1 RNA, the forward primer was 5′-aacaaggagctcatggcctcc and the reverse primer was 5′-gttcgcaagattcgatggtcg. For quantitation of RNA levels of Nrf2 and Keap1, the primers were as follows: Nrf2 forward, 5′-tgcccctggaagtgtcaaaca, and Nrf2 reverse, 5′-caacagggaggttaatgattt; Keap1 forward, 5′-catccaccctaaggtcatgga, and Keap1 reverse, gacaggttgaagaactcctcc.Protein Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis—Following exposure by chemical treatment, HepG2 cells were harvested by washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell lysates were prepared for detection of Nrf2-Keap1 expression by dissolving cell pellets in 1× RIPA lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) on ice for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected by centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Microsomal proteins were isolated by homogenizing cell suspensions in 4 volumes of ice-cold 1.15% KCl solution 20 times with a motorized homogenizer, and homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman TL100 tabletop ultracentrifuge. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 10% glycerol, 100 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm butylated hydroxytoluene, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were determined and 20 μg heated at 70 °C in loading buffer. Electrophoresis was conducted at 200 V for 50 min. The resolved protein was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by using an electrotransfer apparatus (Invitrogen) at 30 V for 60 min. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline solution (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated with a specific primary antibody prepared in Tris-buffered saline with 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline solution followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling) for 1 h at room temperature. Protein was visualized using Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by exposure to the x-ray film.Nrf2 Gene Knockdown by Short Hairpin RNA—To decipher the role of Nrf2 for up-regulation of UGT1A1, Nrf2 siRNAs were generated to silence Nrf2 at the post-transcriptional level (28McManus M.T. Sharp P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). The Nrf2 siRNAs were a generous gift from Dr. Karin (University of California, San Diego). Preparation of recombinant lentivirus was carried out by transient transfections with a packaging cell line. Briefly, human 293T cells were cotransfected with packaging plasmids together with a lentivirus expression plasmid containing siRNA insertion by using Lipofectamine 2000. Infectious recombinant lentiviruses were harvested at 72 h post-transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter to get rid of cell debris. HepG2 cells were plated in 6-well plates, and recombinant lentiviruses were directly used in infection of cells with Polybrene for 3 h. The culture medium was changed after infection. Western blot analysis was performed to monitor NRF2 gene knockdown. RNA analysis was performed for UGT1A1 expression in response to tBHQ treatment.Studies with Transgenic UGT1A (Tg-UGT1) Mouse—Generation of the Tg-UGT1 mouse is described previously (4Chen S. Beaton D. Nguyen N. Senekeo-Effenberger K. Brace-Sinnokrak E. Argikar U. Remmel R.P. Trottier J. Barbier O. Ritter J.K. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37547-37557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Wild type or Tg-UGT1 mice (n = 3) were treated by intraperitoneal injection every 24 h with either Me2SO or tBHQ (40 mg/kg). After 48 h, the tissues, including liver, lung, kidney, and small and large intestines, from each treatment group were combined and pulverized in liquid nitrogen and used for preparation of microsomes and total RNA. Microsomal fractions were prepared as described previously (4Chen S. Beaton D. Nguyen N. Senekeo-Effenberger K. Brace-Sinnokrak E. Argikar U. Remmel R.P. Trottier J. Barbier O. Ritter J.K. Tukey R.H.

Total RNA for Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR was isolated using TRIzol.Isolation of Primary Hepatocytes from Tg-UGT1 Mice—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from both wild type and Tg-UGT1 mice. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation. The needle containing the catheter was inserted slowly into the portal vein, and the tubing was placed into the catheter to allow Hanks' balanced salt solution (without Ca+2/Mg+2) containing 0.2 mm EGTA and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, to flow through the liver for 2 min followed by a perfusion with 40 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (with Ca+2/Mg+2) containing 35 μg/μl Liberase Blendzyme and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, at 4 ml/min. The liver was dissected into a Petri dish and washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The hepatocytes were filtered through a sterile 70-μm filter and washed twice by centrifugation at 50 × g for 5 min. The cells were cultured in 6-well plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was replaced by fresh medium to eliminate dead cells 4 h after plating. The hepatocytes were treated with 100 μm tBHQ for 48 h after seeding for further studies.Identification of the Response Element in the UGT1A1 Promoter Region—A 11-kb region of the UGT1A1 promoter region was amplified by PCR from a human BAC library, as described previously (11Yueh M.F. Huang Y.H. Hiller A. Chen S.J. Nguyen N. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15001-15006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and subcloned into either PGL basic vector or PGL promoter vectors. For transient transfections, HepG2 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate (2 × 105 cells/well) 1 day before transfections and grown overnight to 50% confluence. Luciferase reporter constructs containing the UGT1A1 promoter (UGT1A1–2512/–7), UGT1A1 enhancers, or 5′ or 3′ deletion mutants were mixed with pRL-SV40 DNA as an internal control for DNA transfection efficiency. Using DNA fragments spanning –3430 to –3201 (forward, 5′-aaattgagctctaacggttcataaa; reverse, 5′-ttaaactcgagccattctggatcc), site-directed mutagenesis was carried out, altering two bases (underlined) on the ARE core sequences (ARE-1 mutant, forward, 5′-cccggacttgaagcttggtaag, and reverse, 5′-cttaccaagcttcaagtccggg; ARE-2 mutant, forward, 5′-ttggcgcttggccagcacgcaatg, and reverse, 5′-cattgcgtgctggccaagcgccaa; ARE-3 mutant, forward, 5′-cgcaatgaacagcaatagtaagctgg, and reverse, 5′-ccagcttactattgctgttcattgcg). Transient transfections were carried out by Lipofectamine 2000 based on the manufacturer's instructions. Following 48 h of treatment with tBHQ or Me2SO, cells were harvested with lysis buffer (Promega), and the supernatant was collected by brief centrifugation. Transcription activity was determined by the expression of firefly luciferase and was normalized to the Renilla luciferase levels by using a dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extract preparation and mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (29Yueh M.F. Bonzo J.A. Tukey R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 400: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), with the exception that all buffers contained the protease inhibitors aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (200 μm). Nuclear proteins were isolated from Me2SO- and tBHQ-treated HepG2 cells. The cell pellet was washed three times by resuspending in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2 and centrifuging at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. Preparation of nuclear protein was carried out by resuspending the cells in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 400 mm KCl, and incubating on ice for 30 min. Nuclei were pelleted for 15 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was adjusted to a glycerol concentration of 10%. This solution was then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C, and the nuclear protein was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until further use. Complementary pairs of oligonucleotides containing the core sequence of the UGT1A1 ARE were synthesized (sense, 5′-gatcaaacccggacttggcgcttggtaagcacg-3′, and antisense, 5′-gatccgtgcttaccaagcgccaagtccgggttt-3′)."

Here we present structures of a calcium-free state with bound cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and magnesium fluoride at 2.65Å resolution and a calcium-free state with bound CPA and ADP at 3.4Å resolution. In both structures, CPA occupies the calcium access channel delimited by transmembrane segments M1–M4. Inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase is stabilized by a polar pocket that surrounds the tetramic acid of CPA and a hydrophobic platform that cradles the inhibitor. The calcium pump residues involved include Gln56, Leu61, Val62, and Asn101. We conclude that CPA inhibits the calcium pump by blocking the calcium access channel and immobilizing a subset of transmembrane helices. In the E2(CPA) structure, ADP is bound in a distinct orientation within the nucleotide binding pocket. The adenine ring is sandwiched between Arg489 of the nucleotide-binding domain and Arg678 of the phosphorylation domain.

Ca2+-ATPase is the best characterized member of the P-type ATPases. The members of this family convert ATP into a high energy aspartylphosphate, which is subsequently used in the concentrative transport of cations across the membrane. The Ca2+-ATPase moves calcium out of the cytoplasm in a process that is central to the use of this cation as an intracellular signaling molecule. During the muscle contraction-relaxation cycle, the recovery phase relies on transport of calcium into the SR by the action of Ca2+-ATPase. In the last 7 years, we have experienced remarkable insights into the Ca2+-ATPase structure and mechanism of transport (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

The Ca2+-ATPase is an integral membrane protein of 994 amino acids that consists of three cytoplasmic domains containing the ATP binding site and ten transmembrane helices (M1–M10) containing the two calcium binding sites. A phosphorylation domain (P domain) is coupled to the calcium sites through transmembrane helices M4 and M5 and contains the invariant Asp351 residue. A nucleotide binding domain (N domain) is connected to the P domain and contains the nucleotide binding pocket. An actuator domain (A domain) is connected to the M1–M3 helices and communicates the conformational rearrangements that regulate the binding and release of calcium. At present, we have a sophisticated understanding of calcium transport (8Moller J. Nissen P. Sorensen T. Maire M.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 269-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10Stokes D. Green N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 425-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The reaction cycle of Ca2+-ATPase is characterized by calcium-bound E1 and calcium-free E2 forms. The phosphorylated calcium-free form (E2-P) is a low energy state following a conformational change from a high energy phosphorylated form (E1∼P). The energy captured from ATP is released in the concentrative transport of two calcium ions into the SR. Subsequent hydrolysis of the phosphorylated enzyme results in the formation of a protonated ground state. This E2 ground state is ready to countertransport protons, bind calcium and ATP, and begin the cycle anew. In the transition from the E2-P to the E2 state, modest domain movements serve to open a cavity around Asp351, allowing the hydrolysis and release of inorganic phosphate. The potential drawbacks associated with these “static” images from crystallographic studies include structural changes caused by the inhibitors and nucleotide analogues used to stabilize the different conformational states of the enzyme. For instance, an electron cryomicroscopy structure originally visualized an exit pathway from the calcium transport sites to the lumen of the SR (11Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N. Stokes D. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 12Xu C. Rice W. He W. Stokes D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and this channel was postulated to close in the presence of an inhibitor (13Young H. Xu C. Zhang P. Stokes D. J. Mol.

However, a luminal exit channel has not been observed in the available crystal structures (4Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 6Olesen C. Sorensen T. Nielsen R. Moller J. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).

Chem. 2006; 281: 3360-3369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that luminal access to the calcium binding sites is dependent on the inhibitors and/or phosphate analogues used to stabilize the complex. Despite these complications, the inhibitors and substrate analogs are necessary to stabilize calcium-free conformations for crystallization. To prevent calcium-free forms from denaturing, Ca2+-ATPase has been crystallized with the inhibitors thapsigargin (TG) (2Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 4Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 6Olesen C. Sorensen T.

Sugita Y. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In addition, the enzyme has been further stabilized by phosphate analogs, such as aluminum fluoride (6Olesen C. Sorensen T. Nielsen R. Moller J. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and magnesium fluoride (4Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) is another specific inhibitor of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases, yet the structure of this inhibitory complex is unknown. Comparatively, CPA and TG have dissociation constants in the nanomolar range, although CPA has a 1000-fold lower affinity (Ki = 120 nm) than TG (Ki = 0.1 nm) (16Seidler N. Jona I. Vegh M.

CPA is a toxic indole tetramic acid produced by certain fungi (Penicillium or Aspergillus) (20Holzapfel C. Tetrahedron. 1968; 24: 2101-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) that are found as contaminants in foods (21Wilson D. Mubatanhema W. Jurjevic Z. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 504: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Inhibitor binding occurs for the calcium-free conformations of the enzyme (17Soler F. Plenge-Tellechea F. Fortea I. Fernandez-Belda F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4266-4274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the inhibitory mechanism may be similar to that used by TG. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the CPA and TG binding sites on Ca2+-ATPase are distinct with some possible overlap (18Ma H. Zhong L. Inesi G. Fortea I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15522-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Wootton L. Michelangeli F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6970-6976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CPA inhibits all sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases but does not affect other cation pumps, such as the Na+/K+-ATPase, the gastric H+/K+-ATPase pump, and the plasma membrane calcium pump (16Seidler N. Jona I. Vegh M. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17816-17823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have determined the structure of Ca2+-ATPase in the presence of CPA. Herein, we describe crystal structures of calcium-free conformations of Ca2+-ATPase solved to 2.65 Å resolution with bound CPA and magnesium fluoride and solved to 3.4 Å resolution with bound CPA and ADP. These structures provide a molecular description of CPA inhibition. In addition, a distinct mode of adenine recognition is identified in the E2 calcium-free conformation with bound ADP. Protein Purification and Crystallization—Ca2+-ATPase was prepared from sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from rabbit hind leg muscle (23Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and purified by Reactive-Red affinity chromatography after solubilization in octaethyleneglycol mono-n-dodecylether (C12E8) as described previously (24Stokes D.L. Green N.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All Ca2+-ATPase preparations used for crystallization trials contained 10 mm ADP as a result of the Reactive-Red affinity chromatography elution buffer. Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 11 °C using 4 μl of a 1:1 ratio of protein solution to reservoir solution. For E2(CPA) crystals, purified Ca2+-ATPase (5.5 mg/ml) was mixed with phosphatidylcholine, 330 μm CPA, and 3 mm EGTA. Initial crystallization trials utilized conditions reported for E2 crystals in the presence of TG (2Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), which were then refined with additive and detergent screens (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). Optimal crystallization conditions consisted of 25% glycerol, 2.75–3% polyethylene glycol 3350, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% NaN3, and 20 mm MES, pH 6.1, with the detergents CYMAL-1 or n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylglycine used as additives (0.04%). For E2P(CPA) crystals, purified Ca2+-ATPase (4.5 mg/ml) was mixed with phosphatidylcholine, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm KF, 280 μm CPA, and 1 mm EGTA. Optimal conditions consisted of 21% glycerol, 8% polyethylene glycol 3350, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% NaN3, and 20 mm MES, pH 6.1. For E2(TG) crystals, purified Ca2+-ATPase (7 mg/ml) was mixed with phosphatidylcholine, 100 μm TG, and 3 mm EGTA. Initial crystallization trials utilized conditions reported for E2 crystals in the presence of TG (2Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), which were then refined. Optimal crystallization conditions consisted of 25% glycerol, 10–12% polyethylene glycol 400, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% NaN3, and 20 mm MES, pH 6.1. Crystals grew between 3 and 8 days to a size of about 350 × 100 × 100 μm for E2(CPA) and E2P(CPA) and 150 × 150 × 50 μm for E2(TG). Crystals were mounted directly from mother liquor in nylon loops and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection—Numerous data sets were collected at 100 K on beam lines 8.2.2, 8.3.1, and 12.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA). Data were processed and merged using the HKL package (HKL Research, Inc., Charlottesville, VA). For E2(CPA), the crystals possessed P21 symmetry, and the diffraction intensities from the three best crystals were merged. For E2P(CPA), the crystals possessed C2 symmetry, and data from the single best crystal were used. For E2(TG), the crystals possessed P41 symmetry, and data from the single best crystal were used. The E2(CPA) and E2P(CPA) crystals contain one Ca2+-ATPase molecule per asymmetric unit, and the E2(TG) crystals contain two molecules per asymmetric unit. The solvent content for the E2(CPA) and E2P(CPA) crystals were 71.0% (Matthews' Vm coefficient, 4.24 Å3 Da–1) and 67.8% (Matthews' Vm coefficient, 3.82 Å3 Da–1), respectively.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) and the E2P(TG) Ca2+-ATPase structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1WPG) (4Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) as the search model. The initial model was subjected to rigid body refinement using refmac5 in the CCP4 program suite (26P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the structure was refined with alternate cycles of restrained refinement with TLS (parameterization of the translation, libration, and screw rotation displacements of pseudorigid bodies) in refmac5 (27Winn M. Isupov M. Murshudov G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) and manual rebuilding using XtalView (28McRee D. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) after inspection of both 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc maps. Extensive model building was done in the following regions: helices M1/M2 and their associated cytoplasmic loops and a loop in the nucleotide binding domain (Ala501–Gly509). The Rwork and Rfree values were monitored closely throughout the refinement. The chemical structure of CPA was obtained from the PubChem Compound index (CID 65261), which is a slightly different isomer from that originally reported (20Holzapfel C. Tetrahedron. 1968; 24: 2101-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The molecular structure of CPA was generated with the program CORINA (29Tetko I. Gasteiger J. Todeschini R. Mauri A. Livingstone D. Ertl P. Palyulin V. Radchenko E. Zefirov N. Makarenko A. Tanchuk V. Prokopenko V. J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Des. 2005; 19: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar) and added to the model after several rounds of refinement. CPA was located as outstanding electron density between the transmembrane segments M1 and M4 in both the Fo – Fc and 2Fo – Fc maps (density extending to the 6σ level). At 2.65 Å resolution, the overall conformation and orientation of CPA were well defined based on refinement statistics; however, we could not differentiate between the tautomers mentioned above. The Ca2+-ATPase molecule was well defined in the electron density map except for the M3/M4 luminal loop (Ile276–Ile289), for which there was no observed density. The final model at a resolution of 2.65 Å (Rcryst = 0.246, Rfree = 0.287) consisted of Ca2+-ATPase, Mg2+, Na+, MgF2–4, CPA, and 75 water molecules. All residues were in the most favored and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (87.4/12.2/0.3/0) as evaluated by PROCHECK (30Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The model of E2(CPA) was built in a similar manner as described above. The structure of E2(CPA) was solved by molecular replacement using the E2(TG+BHQ) Ca2+-ATPase structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 2AGV) (5Obara K. Miyashita N. Xu C. Toyoshima I. Sugita Y. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) as the search model. Restrained refinement in refmac5 used bulk solvent correction and incorporated a TLS refinement only in the later cycles. The final model at a resolution of 3.4 Å (Rcryst = 0.290, Rfree = 0.328) includes Ca2+-ATPase, Mg2+, ADP, and CPA. ADP was located as outstanding electron density sandwiched between Arg489 and Arg678 in both the Fo – Fc and 2Fo – Fc maps (density extending to the 7σ level). All residues are in the most favored and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (82.5/17.2/0.2/0) as evaluated by PROCHECK (30Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). For the E2(TG) crystals, an isomorphous difference map was calculated for the sole purpose of identifying bound ligands (using Protein Data Bank accession code 2AGV) (5Obara K. Miyashita N. Xu C. Toyoshima I. Sugita Y. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14489-14496Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Activity and Fluorescence Measurements—All biochemical measurements were performed with detergent-solubilized, affinity-purified Ca2+-ATPase to allow comparison with the crystal structures. The ATPase activity of purified Ca2+-ATPase was measured by a coupled enzyme assay (34Warren G.B. Toon P.A. Birdsall N.J.M. Lee A.G. Metcalfe J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of Ca2+-ATPase were incubated with or without inhibitor in assay buffer (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.18 mm NADH, 0.6 mg/ml C12E8, 9.6 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 9.6 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase) containing varying concentrations of ATP from 1.6 μm to 4 mm. The reaction was started by the addition of calcium to give a final free calcium concentration of 10 μm (pCa = 5). The absorbance of NADH was monitored at 340 nm at an assay temperature of 25 °C. Data were plotted as ATPase-specific activity (μmol of ATP hydrolyzed min–1 mg–1 of Ca2+-ATPase) versus ATP concentration (mm). The KATP and Vmax were calculated based on fitting the data to the four-parameter logistic curve using Sigma Plot software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Errors shown for the control are the S.E. for four independent measurements. The ATPase activities in the presence of either 150 nm CPA or 17 nm thapsigargin, concentrations similar to those used in crystallization, were the average of two independent experiments. The binding of a fluorescent nucleotide analogue, TNP-ATP, to purified Ca2+-ATPase was measured using an established method (35Stewart R. VanBruggen R. Ellefson D. Wolfe A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12269-12279Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared in fluorescence buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) that promoted the E2 conformation of Ca2+-ATPase in the absence and presence of inhibitors. Standard 1 × 1-cm fluorescence cuvettes were used, and the temperature was maintained at 22 °C. Ca2+-ATPase (15.4 μm) in solubilization buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1% C12E8) was added to fluorescence buffer to give a final concentration of 4 μm. The inhibitors CPA (100 μm) and TG (30 μm) were preincubated with Ca2+-ATPase for 5 min at room temperature. Fluorescence emission was recorded using a QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, London, Canada) with the excitation wavelength set at 408 nm, the emission wavelength set at 530 nm, and a slit width of 5 nm. For analysis of titration data, the observed emission intensity of each sample was corrected by subtraction of the signal observed with an appropriate blank: buffer plus detergent, TNP-ATP, with and without inhibitors. A blank titration was performed for each Ca2+-ATPase titration experiment (i.e. no Ca2+-ATPase). Therefore, the observed fluorescence change (ΔF/Fo%) represents the enhancement of fluorescence emission intensity due to formation of the complex between Ca2+-ATPase and TNP-ATP. The fluorescence emission intensity due to formation of the complex between Ca2+-ATPase and 10 μm TNP-ATP was set to 100%. In the absence of Ca2+-ATPase, TNP-ATP had a fluorescence emission intensity that was proportional to the nucleotide concentration up to a concentration of 10 μm (data not shown). Higher TNP-nucleotide concentrations were avoided, because inner filter effects caused this relationship to deviate from linearity. Our current understanding of Ca2+-ATPase includes several structures in the absence of calcium and in the presence of phosphate analogues and/or inhibitors (2Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 4Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 5Obara K. Miyashita N.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The maximum resolution of these structures is 2.3 Å; however, a variety of other Ca2+-ATPase intermediates have been solved in the range of 2.4–3.3 Å resolution. The crystal structures presented herein are the first for Ca2+-ATPase bound to the specific inhibitor CPA. Overall Structure of E2P—In the absence of calcium and in the presence of magnesium fluoride (E2·MgF2–4), the Ca2+-ATPase adopts a transition state that represents the dephosphorylated enzyme immediately following hydrolysis with inorganic phosphate still bound. This structure represents an E2·PO4 state of the calcium pump; however, this conformation is commonly designated E2P, and we will use this convention herein. The structure of E2P at 2.65 Å resolution reveals a well defined Ca2+-ATPase molecule and bound ligands (Mg2+, MgF2–4, and CPA) in the electron density map (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Despite crystallization in the presence of 10 mm ADP, no density was observed for this ligand. A comparison of our E2P(CPA) structure with previously determined E2P(TG) structures (4Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 6Olesen C. Sorensen T. Nielsen R. Moller J. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) revealed an overall conservation of the molecular structure. The root mean square deviations after alignment of all peptide backbone atoms were 0.6 Å (versus 1WPG) (4Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and 1.2Å(versus 1XP5) (6Olesen C. Sorensen T. Nielsen R. Moller J. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Our E2P(CPA) structure resembles previous structures, and our goal is not to reiterate its detailed description. Rather, we will focus on the observed structural differences. Our structure of E2P(CPA) differs from the previous structures in the relative positions of M1–M3 and in the disordered M3/M4 luminal loop. These differences are explained by the use of inhibitors to stabilize this intermediate, CPA, in our structure and TG in previous structures (4Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 6Olesen C. Sorensen T. Nielsen R. Moller J. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Despite changes in transmembrane helices M1–M3 and the associated loops (Fig. 2), the position of the A domain remains unchanged. It is unlikely that the position of the A domain is altered by crystal contacts, because our C2 crystal lattice is distinct from the previously determined structures (4Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 6Olesen C. Sorensen T. Nielsen R. Moller J. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the conformational coupling between the A domain and M1–M3 accommodates significant plasticity. Helix M2 undergoes a bending displacement that leaves the luminal end of the helix in place but moves the cytoplasmic end of the helix by ∼10 Å (12° change in inclination). The associated loop adopts a different conformation extending to Ala112, where the rest of the loop and the A domain occupy their expected positions. The short cytoplasmic helix of M1 undergoes a 26° rotation along the membrane surface in the direction of the movement of M2. The associated loop adopts a distinct conformation that begins at Glu45, whereas the remainder of the loop and the A domain are unchanged. The conformational changes in M1 and M2 are explained by the binding of CPA to a site above Glu309 that locks these helices against M4. CPA fills the calcium access channel in the E2 calcium-free form of the enzyme and stabilizes M1 and M2 in positions that are incompatible with calcium binding. Although the movements of M1 and M2 are due to CPA binding, this does not explain the position of M3 or the disordered M3/M4 loop. In our structure, M3 is shifted upward by approximately one-half of a turn of the helix, and the M3/M4 loop is disordered between residues Asn275 and Arg290 (Fig. 2). In contrast, M4 is well defined, and its position is unchanged in comparison with previous structures (4Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 6Olesen C. Sorensen T. Nielsen R. Moller J. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Electron cryomicroscopy of helical crystals revealed that TG binding causes a small downward movement of M3 and a restructuring of the M3/M4 loop (13Young H. Xu C. Zhang P. Stokes D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Young H. Stokes D. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 198: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We believe that the position of M3 observed in previous structures (4Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 6Olesen C. Sorensen T. Nielsen R. Moller J. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and in the helical crystals (13Young H. Xu C. Zhang P. Stokes D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is a characteristic of TG inhibition. The M3 helix has been shown to be a major component of the TG binding site (2Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). In addition, the M3/M4 loop participates"
https://openalex.org/W2024257620,"No animals are known to possess both ultraviolet (UV) reflectance and fluorescence that are sex-specific. We provide evidence for this separation in the jumping spider Cosmophasis umbratica, which has UV reflectance and UV-induced green fluorescence restricted to males and females, respectively. During courtship, many of the studied pairs failed to show typical display posturing when UV light was blocked. Occluding the UV component of sunlight to only one of each pair also caused atypical behavior: Females showed no interest in non‐UV-reflective courting males, and males either ignored or were lackluster in courting nonfluorescing females. These results demonstrate the importance of both sex-specific hues as sexual signals for effective intraspecific communication."
https://openalex.org/W2077766083,"How do integral membrane proteins evolve in size and complexity? Using the small multidrug-resistance protein EmrE from Escherichia coli as a model, we experimentally demonstrated that the evolution of membrane proteins composed of two homologous but oppositely oriented domains can occur in a small number of steps: An original dual-topology protein evolves, through a gene-duplication event, to a heterodimer formed by two oppositely oriented monomers. This simple evolutionary pathway can explain the frequent occurrence of membrane proteins with an internal pseudo-two-fold symmetry axis in the plane of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2065625648,"In Escherichia coli the Cpx sensor regulator system senses different kinds of envelope stress and responds by triggering the expression of periplasmic folding factors and proteases. It consists of the membrane-anchored sensor kinase CpxA, the response regulator CpxR, and the periplasmic protein CpxP. The Cpx pathway is induced in vivo by a variety of signals including pH variation, osmotic stress, and misfolded envelope proteins and is inhibited by overproduced CpxP. Because it is not clear how the Cpx pathway is able to recognize and correspond to so many different signals we overproduced, solubilized, purified, and incorporated the complete membrane-integral CpxA protein into proteoliposomes to analyze its biochemical properties in more detail. Autokinase and phosphotransfer activities of the reconstituted CpxA-His6 protein were stimulated by KCl. NaCl also stimulated the activities but to a lesser extent. Other osmotic active solutes as glycine betaine, sucrose, and proline had no effect. The system was further characterized by testing for susceptibility to sensor kinase inhibitors. Among these, Closantel inhibited the activities of solubilized but not of the reconstituted CpxA-His6 protein. We further analyzed the effect of CpxP on CpxA activities. Purified tagless CpxP protein reduced the phosphorylation status of CpxA to 50% but had no effect on CpxA phosphotransfer or phosphatase activities. As the in vitro system excludes the involvement of other factors our finding is the first biochemical evidence for direct protein-protein interaction between the sensor kinase CpxA and the periplasmic protein CpxP resulting in a down-regulation of the autokinase activity of CpxA. In Escherichia coli the Cpx sensor regulator system senses different kinds of envelope stress and responds by triggering the expression of periplasmic folding factors and proteases. It consists of the membrane-anchored sensor kinase CpxA, the response regulator CpxR, and the periplasmic protein CpxP. The Cpx pathway is induced in vivo by a variety of signals including pH variation, osmotic stress, and misfolded envelope proteins and is inhibited by overproduced CpxP. Because it is not clear how the Cpx pathway is able to recognize and correspond to so many different signals we overproduced, solubilized, purified, and incorporated the complete membrane-integral CpxA protein into proteoliposomes to analyze its biochemical properties in more detail. Autokinase and phosphotransfer activities of the reconstituted CpxA-His6 protein were stimulated by KCl. NaCl also stimulated the activities but to a lesser extent. Other osmotic active solutes as glycine betaine, sucrose, and proline had no effect. The system was further characterized by testing for susceptibility to sensor kinase inhibitors. Among these, Closantel inhibited the activities of solubilized but not of the reconstituted CpxA-His6 protein. We further analyzed the effect of CpxP on CpxA activities. Purified tagless CpxP protein reduced the phosphorylation status of CpxA to 50% but had no effect on CpxA phosphotransfer or phosphatase activities. As the in vitro system excludes the involvement of other factors our finding is the first biochemical evidence for direct protein-protein interaction between the sensor kinase CpxA and the periplasmic protein CpxP resulting in a down-regulation of the autokinase activity of CpxA. The bacterial cell wall is involved in a multitude of diverse structural, physiological, and adaptive processes including transport, elaboration of virulence factors, and cell division. These processes require specific sets of proteins whose correct folding and assembly is controlled by periplasmic folding catalysts and proteases. In Escherichia coli and related species, expression of some of the corresponding genes is regulated by the Cpx sensor regulator system (reviewed in Ref. 1Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 591-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The Cpx pathway consists of the sensor kinase CpxA, the response regulator CpxR, and the periplasmic CpxP protein (1Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 591-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The cpxA gene was originally reported as a gene regulating F donor activity in bacterial conjugation (2McEwan J. Silverman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It encodes the 52-kDa histidine kinase CpxA, which is an integral membrane protein of the cytoplasmic membrane that contains both periplasmic and cytoplasmic domains (3Weber R.F. Silverman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The 26-kDa response regulator CpxR is predicted to encode an OmpR-like cytosolic transcriptional activator (4Dong J. Iuchi S. Kwan H.S. Lu Z. Lin E.C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Signals activating the Cpx pathway include elevated pH (5Nakayama S.I. Watanabe H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 180: 3522-3528Crossref Google Scholar, 6Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 831-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), altered membrane composition (7Mileykovskaya E.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2038-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of signal transduction used by the Cpx sensor regulator system is not clear. CpxA functions as an autokinase, a CpxR kinase, and a CpxR-P phosphatase in vivo (13Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). CpxA deletion mutants are uninducible, demonstrating that CpxA is necessary for signaling (14Danes P.N. Snyder W.B. Cosma C.L. Davis J.B. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Indeed, cpx* gain of function mutations located in the central region of the periplasmic domain of CpxA are insensitive to normally activating signals and probably define a sensory domain (15Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7724-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Activation of the Cpx pathway results in increased production of proteins involved in protein folding and degradation in the periplasm, such as the heat shock protease DegP, the peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases PpiA and PpiD, and the disulfide oxidoreductase DsbA (1Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 591-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that CpxR∼P represses motility and chemotaxis genes (16De Wulf P. Kwon O. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6772-6778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, overproduction of the small (19-kDa) periplasmic CpxP protein leads to decreased expression of Cpx-regulated genes and prevents Cpx activation by inducing signals (1Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 591-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This effect depends on an intact CpxA sensory domain (15Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7724-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because an MBP-CpxP fusion was able to inhibit Cpx signal transduction during spheroplast formation, a strong Cpx-inducing signal, it was suggested that the interaction between CpxA and CpxP might be direct (17Raivio T.L. Laird M.W. Joly J.C. Silhavy T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1186-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the basis of the observation that the cpx* mutants were constitutively activated (15Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7724-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), it was proposed that the presumed CpxA sensory domain normally functions to maintain the kinase in a down-regulated state mediated by direct interaction with CpxP. When CpxP is titrated out by misfolded envelope proteins, the Cpx response is activated (1Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 591-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 18Isaac D.D. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.C. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17775-17779Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The finding that the Cpx response can be further activated in a cpxP deletion strain indicates that CpxP is not required for signal transduction (19Raivio T.L. Popkin D.L. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5263-5272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CpxP might be responsible for fine-tuning the response. A recent study showed that single amino acid substitutions in a predicted α-helix in the N-terminal domain of the CpxP protein affect its inhibitory function indicating that the N-terminal domain of CpxP is critical for interaction with the sensor CpxA and might be the site of inhibitory activity (20Buelow D.R. Raivio T.L. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6622-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Most of the analysis on Cpx pathway signal transduction was done in vivo. Here we describe an efficient method to solubilize, purify, and reconstitute the complete Cpx sensor regulator system into proteoliposomes to study the biochemical properties of the signaling cascade in more detail. This in vitro system was further characterized by testing the effect of known inhibitors of sensor regulator systems of Gram-positive bacteria (21Stephenson K. Yamaguchi Y. Hoch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38900-38904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Finally, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of the periplasmic CpxP protein on the system. Our results provide first biochemical evidence for a direct protein-protein interaction between CpxA and CpxP resulting in inhibition of the CpxA autokinase activity. Materials—[γ-32P]ATP, peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from GE Healthcare. Ethodin and Ofloxacin were obtained from Sigma. Vanadate was from Strem Chemicals. Closantel and TCS were gifts from Thomas Schmülling (Free University, Berlin). Ni2+-NTA resin and His5 antibody were from Qiagen and Protino-Ni from Macherey & Nagel.

Trypsin and trypsin inhibitor were obtained from Roth. Synthetic oligonucleotide primers were from Invitrogen, vectors pIVEX2.3 and pIVEX2.4 from Roche Applied Science and vector pET15b from Novagen. All other reagents were reagent grade and obtained from commercial source. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli JM109 [recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi hsdR17 supE44 λ– relA1 Δ(lac-proAB)/F' traD36 proA+B+ lacIq lacZΔM15] (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a carrier for the described plasmids. E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 [F– λ–] (22Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6056) Google Scholar) was used as parent strain for the PCR-based amplification of the cpxA, cpxR, and cpxP genes. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) <pLysS> (Novagen) was used for expression of cpxA, cpxR, and cpxP under the control of the T7 promoter. Construction of cpxA-His6, His6-cxpR, and His6-cpxP—Construction of pI3cpxA was achieved by amplifying the cpxA coding region using primers CpxA5 (5′-ATCATA TGA TAG GCA GCT TAA CCG CG-3′) and CpxA3 (5′-ATC CCG GGA CTC CGC TTA TAC AGC GGC AAC C-3′). The resulting fragment was cloned into the NdeI and SmaI sites of pIVEX2.3. The cpxR coding region was amplified using primers CpxR5 (5′-GGC CAT GGA TAA AAT CCT GTT AGT TGA TG-3′) and CpxR3 (5′-CCG GAT CCT CAT GAA GCA GAA ACC ATC AG-3′) and cloned into the NcoI and BamHI sites of pIVEX2.4, resulting in pI4cpxR. Construction of pRF6 was achieved by amplifying the cpxP coding region using primers 5XhoI_EcoCpxP (5′-GAG ACT CGA GGC TGA AGT CGG TTC AGG CGA TAA C-3′) and 3BamHI_EcoCpxP (5′-GAG TGG ATC CCT ACT GGG AAC GTG AGT TGC TAT C-3′). The product was digested with XhoI and BamHI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET15b. The resulting constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Expression of Proteins and Preparation of Cytosolic Fraction and Membrane Vesicles—E. coli strain BL21(DE3) <pLysS> was transformed either with pI3cpxA, pI4cpxR, or pRF6, respectively, and grown at 30 °C with aeration in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Gene expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–4 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer Z (50 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were fractionated by sonication on ice and ultracentrifugation into membrane fraction (pellet) and cytosolic fraction (supernatant). The membrane fraction resuspended in buffer Z, and the cytosolic fraction were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Purification of His6-CpxR—His6-CpxR fusion protein was purified by means of Ni-affinity chromatography in batch. Binding of the protein (∼500 mg of cytosolic proteins/2.5 ml of Ni-NTA resin) was done in buffer R (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bound His6-CpxR was eluted with an imidazole concentration of 150 mm in buffer R. His6-CpxR-containing fractions were mixed and further purified with a Protino Ni 2000 prepacked column kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Macherey & Nagel). Purified His6-CpxR protein was passed through a PD10 column (GE Healthcare) to remove imidazole and stored at –80 °C until use. Purification of CpxP—His6-CpxP fusion protein was purified by means of Ni-affinity chromatography in batch. Binding of the protein (600 mg of cytosolic protein/3 ml Ni-NTA) was done in the presence of 5 mm imidazole in buffer P (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After washing with buffer P containing 20 mm imidazole His6-CpxP was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 150 mm. His6-CpxP-containing fractions were passed through a PD10 column to remove imidazole and further purified by an SP-Sephadex column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound His6-CpxP was washed extensively with buffer P2 (50 mm MOPS/K+ pH 6) containing increasing concentrations of NaCl (50 mm-200 mm), eluted with buffer P2 containing 0.5 m NaCl and buffered into buffer P3 (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v)) by passing through a PD10 column. The His6-fusion from the N terminus of CpxP was cleaved by thrombin using the THROM-BIN CleanCleaveKit essentially as described (Sigma). Purification of CpxA-His6—For detergent selection, the following detergents were tested: 1% Triton X-100, 1% lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO); 1% decylmaltoside (DM); 1% dodecylmaltoside (DDM), and 1% octyl-glucoside (OG). After incubation on ice for 60 min, mixtures were centrifuged, and aliquots of the supernatant containing solubilized proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. The yield of CpxA-His6 solubilization (%) is used as measure for the distribution of the amounts of CpxA-His6 between the soluble and the membrane fraction after treatment of membrane vesicles with detergent. 1 ml of 10× DM was added to 9 ml of membrane vesicles (∼10 mg/ml) prepared from BL21(DE3) <pLys/pI3cpxA>. Samples were incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 200,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant fraction containing solubilized CpxA-His was purified by affinity chromatography. Ni2+-NTA resin equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1% DM (w/v), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Binding of CpxA-His6 was carried out by incubating the solubilized fraction and Ni2+-NTA resin at 4 °C for 1 h. The protein-resin complex was packed into a column, and unbound proteins were removed by stepwise washing with buffer A containing 10 and 50 mm imidazole. CpxA-His6 was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 150 mm. CpxA-His6-containing fractions were passed through a PD10 column to remove imidazole and stored in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1% DM (w/v) at –80 °C. Preparation of Proteoliposomes—Purified CpxA-His6 was incorporated into liposomes essentially as described (23Jung K. Hamann K. Revermann A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40896-40902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli phospholipids (Avanti) were dried under a stream of nitrogen, and slowly redissolved in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.47% Triton X-100 (v/v) over a period of 2 h. To this mixture purified CpxA-His6 was added (ratio of lipid to protein, 100:1 w/w). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min. Bio-Beads were added in a bead/detergent ratio of 10:1 (w/w), and the mixture was gently stirred at 4 °C overnight. After 16 h, fresh Bio-Beads were added additionally, and the mixture was stirred for another 2 h. The proteoliposome solution was pipetted off, and proteoliposomes were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 200,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The efficiency of CpxA incorporation into liposomes was calculated as the ratio between the amount of protein in proteoliposomes and in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation. Proteoliposomes were either used instantly or stored in liquid nitrogen. CpxP-containing proteoliposomes were prepared as described above, but before Bio-Bead treatment, purified CpxP protein was added at a 5–10-fold molar excess to the CpxA protein-lipid mixture. Proteolysis with Trypsin—Proteoliposomes were incubated with trypsin (15 ng/μl) at a protease/protein ratio of 1:100 at room temperature. At different times, the reaction was stopped by trypsin inhibitor (2 μg/μl), and the proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis. MalK protein of Salmonella typhimurium was incorporated into proteoliposomes to control their impermeability for trypsin. Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation Assays—To test autophosphorylation, solubilized CpxA, CpxA in membrane vesicles or CpxA in proteoliposomes was incubated with 40 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1.2 Ci/mmol) in phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol (v/v), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) at room temperature. When indicated various solutes were additionally added. At different time points, aliquots were removed and mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer. To analyze phosphotransfer, purified His6-CpxR was added to this mixture after 10 min, additional samples were taken, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5× SDS sample buffer. To test dephosphorylation, purified His6-CpxR was phosphorylated as described above with CpxA-His6-containing proteoliposomes. After incubation for 25 min, the phosphorylation mixture was centrifuged for 30 min (13,000 × g, 4 °C), and ATP was removed by the addition of 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm glucose, and 5.4 units of hexokinase. Dephosphorylation of His6-CpxR∼P was initiated by the addition of fresh CpxA-His6 in proteoliposomes. At the indicated times, aliquots were taken, and the reaction was stopped as described above. To test the whole signaling cascade in vitro, CpxA-His6-containing proteoliposomes (0.5 μm) and purified CpxR (2 or 4 μm) were incubated in phosphorylation buffer at room temperature. Phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 100 μm [γ-32P] ATP (0.48 Ci/mmol). Samples were taken at times indicated and mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer. To analyze CpxA-His6 phosphatase activity 1 mm ADP was added after 30 min, additional aliquots were removed at times indicated and stopped as described above. All samples were immediately subjected to SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and phosphorylated proteins were detected by a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Imager Fx, and Software Quantity One, Bio-Rad) using [γ-32P]ATP as a standard. Inhibitor Studies—Inhibitors (except vanadate) were dissolved in Me2SO. Vanadate solutions were prepared in water at pH 10 as described (25Goodno C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2620-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation assays were performed as described above in the presence of the indicated inhibitors. To reflect the presence of Me2SO as a solvent, it was also included in control reactions in an equivalent final concentration (10% (v/v)). Immunological Analysis—For Western blot analysis protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electroblotted, and immunoblots were probed with antiserum to penta-His fusion (mouse) to visualize full-length CpxA-His6 or with antiserum to MalK (rabbit). Immunodetection was performed by using the ECL-kit (GE Healthcare) with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG. Analytical Methods—Protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine relative protein content of proteoliposomes, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12.5% acrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. Different amounts of the corresponding purified proteins were used as a standard on the same gel. Gels were scanned with the Molecular Imager Fx (Bio-Rad), and protein bands were quantified with Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Purification of Cpx Components—To allow easy purification of CpxA a hexa-His tag was attached at its C terminus. The activity of the CpxA-His6 protein was comparable to the native protein: both autokinase and kinase activities in membrane fractions were only slightly lower than in authentic CpxA (data not shown). Thus, CpxA-His6 was used for further in vitro analysis. As a prerequisite for CpxA-His6 purification by affinity chromatography the protein had to be efficiently solubilized. Because the yield of solubilized CpxA-His6 was found to be 80% when decylmaltoside was used as detergent (69% n-dodecylmaltoside, 38% Triton X-100, 25% octyl-glucoside), this detergent was used for all purification steps. Interestingly, the different detergents did not alter autokinase activity of the soluble CpxA-His6 significantly (data not shown). The highest degree of purified CpxA-His6 was achieved when the protein was bound to the Ni2+-NT-agarose in the presence of 50 mm imidazole and 0.15 m NaCl. In a typical experiment about 1 mg of CpxA-His6 was obtained from a 1-liter culture. As demonstrated by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1A), the purity of CpxA-His6 was nearly 90%. For CpxR purification a hexa-His tag was attached at its N terminus. The activity of the protein was comparable to native CpxR as it was shown previously (11Hirakawa H. Inazumi Y. Masaki T. Hirata T. Yamaguchi A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1113-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The His6-CpxR protein was purified by the use of two affinity chromatography steps. This procedure yielded 95% pure His6-CpxR protein (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and 3). For the purification of CpxP we constructed an expression plasmid in which the 5′-sequence of cpxP corresponding to the signal peptide was replaced by six His codons. C-terminal fusions with the full-length protein in different vector systems could not be stably expressed in the periplasm even in a degP strain (data not shown). Therefore, the protein was overproduced and purified from the cytosol. After purification by Nichelate chromatography the N-terminal histidine residues were cut off using a thrombin cleavage site resulting in a tagless CpxP protein (Fig. 1C). Purified CpxP preparations contained an additional protein with an approximate size of 70 kDa. MS spectrometry identified this protein as the chaperone DnaK (data not shown). Because DnaK was not found in proteoliposomes after reconstitution (Fig. 7A, lane 3) the preparation was not purified further. Incorporation of CpxA-His6 into Proteoliposomes—Purified CpxA-His6 protein was incorporated into E. coli phospholipids using the detergent-mediated method as described (26Rigaud J.-L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The efficiency of CpxA-His6 incorporation into liposomes was ∼40% (data not shown). To analyze the orientation of CpxA-His6 in proteoliposomes the susceptibility of its C-terminal domain to trypsin was tested. In intact cells, the C terminus is on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Because 82% of the CpxA-His6 in the proteoliposomes lost a C-terminal peptide as a result of trypsin treatment (as shown by Western blotting using an anti-His antibody and calculated from the average of two independent experiments), the majority of the CpxA-His6 protein in proteoliposomes is in the inside-out orientation (supplemental Fig. S1). As a control for the integrity of the proteolipsomes, soluble MalK ATPase was incorporated along with CpxA-His6. No proteolytic cleavage of MalK was detected after 1.5 min, while the freely accessible MalK protein was fully degraded by trypsin after 1 min (27Schneider E. Wilken S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20456-20461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of CpxA-His6 Activities in Proteoliposomes— CpxA-His6 proteoliposomes were autophosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature. The autophosphorylation increased almost linearly for 10 min (Fig. 2A). Autokinase activity of CpxA-His6 proteoliposomes was 1.5 times higher compared with that of CpxA-His6 in detergent (data not shown). Next, we tested transfer of the phosphoryl group from CpxA-His6 proteoliposomes to purified His6-CpxR. In this experiment CpxA-His6 in proteoliposomes was phosphorylated for 10 min, and subsequently His6-CpxR was added. The mixture was incubated, and samples were taken at the times indicated. Transfer of the phosphoryl group to His6-CpxR was observed within 0.1 min (Fig. 2B). Next we studied the phosphatase activity of CpxA-His6 in proteoliposomes. First, we tested the intrinsic stability of phospho-CpxR. Purified His6-CpxR protein was phosphorylated by CpxA-His6-containing proteoliposomes as described above. Then, His6-CpxR∼32P was separated from the reaction mixture and incubated in the presence and absence of ADP. Samples were taken at various time points. Phosphorylated His6-CpxR was stable for a period of 60 min independently of the presence of ADP (Fig. 2C). To test now the dephosphorylation of His6-CpxR∼32Pby CpxA, CpxA-His6-containing proteoliposomes were added, and dephosphorylation was monitored over a period of 60 min. The half-life of His6-CpxR∼32P was 55 min. In the presence of ADP the half-life was shortened to 20 min (Fig. 2C). In samples lacking ADP the level of His6-CpxR∼32P increased over the first 5 min. This effect was constantly observed but, as it lies in the range of the standard deviation, it was not studied further. Apparently, ADP seems to trigger the phosphatase activity of CpxA. A similar effect was reported for EnvZ and its cognate response regulator OmpR (23Jung K. Hamann K. Revermann A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40896-40902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Taken together, CpxA-His6-proteoliposomes and His6-CpxR catalyzed all known enzymatic activities. Influence of Various Solutes and pH Variations on the Autophosphorylation Activity of CpxA-His6 in Proteoliposomes—In vivo data suggested that the Cpx system might be involved in sensing environmental osmolarity (12Jubelin G.

To prove this hypothesis we tested the autokinase activity of CpxA-His6 in proteoliposomes in the presence of various solutes. It was found that this activity of CpxA-His6 was significantly stimulated in the presence of KCl and RbCl (Fig. 3A). NH4Cl also had a stimulatory effect but to a lower extent. In contrast, other osmotic active solutes as NaCl, sucrose, and trehalose did not influence CpxA autokinase activity. Furthermore, the compounds glycine betaine, proline, and glutamate that are accumulated in cells exposed to an osmotic upshift had no stimulatory effect. We also analyzed the concentration-dependent effect of KCl on CpxA-His6 autophosphorylation activity using a concentration range between 0.5 and 500 mm KCl. The stimulatory effect of KCl was found to be linear until a concentration"

Microfibrils are supramolecular aggregates of several protein and nonprotein components. Recently, a large region in the N-terminal portion of fibrillin-1 was characterized as a multifunctional protein interaction site, including binding sites for fibulin-2 and -5 among others. Using a panel of recombinant fibrillin-1 swapped domain and deletion fragments, we demonstrate here that the conserved first hybrid domain in fibrillin-1 is essential for binding to fibulin-2, -4, and -5. Fibulin-3 and various isoforms of fibulin-1 did not interact with fibrillin-1. Although the first hybrid domain in fibrillin-1 is located in close vicinity to the self-assembly epitope, binding of fibulin-2, -4, and -5 did not interfere with self-assembly. However, these fibulins can associate with microfibrils at various levels of maturity. Formation of ternary complexes between fibrillin-1, fibulins, and tropoelastin demonstrated that fibulin-2 and -5 but much less fibulin-4, are able to act as molecular adaptors between fibrillin-1 and tropoelastin.

The microfibril/elastic fiber system provides tissues, such as lung, blood vessels, and skin, with elastic properties. Microfibrils with a diameter of 10–12 nm are typically located on the outer surface of elastic fibers and are thought to play an essential role in elastogenesis (1Mecham R.P. Davis E. Yurchenco P.D. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., New York1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar). Whereas elastic fibers are always associated with microfibrils, microfibrils themselves can occur in the absence of elastin in certain tissues such as ocular ciliary zonules, the kidney, or in close proximity to various basement membranes. The microfibril/elastic fiber system is a multicomponent assembly in the extracellular matrix, and for both, the microfibrils and the elastic fibers, a number of constituents have been described (for a review, see Ref 2Kielty C.M. Sherratt M.J. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2817-2828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For most of the associated molecules, the exact relationship in terms of physical interaction with microfibrils and/or elastic fibers, and their functional relevance is not clear. The best described components of the microfibrils are a family of proteins consisting of three highly homologous members, fibrillin-1, -2, and -3 (3Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J.

Fibrillins, like many other extracellular glycoproteins, are characterized by a number of tandemly arranged domains. The most prominent domain is an epidermal growth factor-like domain (EGF), 2The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor-like domain; cbEGF, calcium-binding EGF; TB, transforming growth factor β-binding protein domain; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. which occurs 46–47 times in fibrillins. These domains are stabilized by three intramolecular disulfide bonds, and the majority (42–43 domains) contain a consensus sequence for calcium binding (cbEGF) (10Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron M.

The tandemly arranged EGF and cbEGF domains are interspersed by two other types of domains, the transforming growth factor β-binding protein (TB) or 8-Cys domains and the hybrid domains. The seven TB/8-Cys domains are characterized by four intramolecular disulfide bonds, and a similar arrangement is predicted for the two hybrid domains, although no structural data are available for this domain (12Lee S.S.

Sequence data have shown that the first hybrid domain in all fibrillins contains nine cysteine residues as compared with eight in the second hybrid domain. This 9-cysteine pattern is highly conserved in all species, ranging from invertebrates to humans. Previously, we have determined that cysteine 204 in human fibrillin-1 and cysteine 233 in human fibrillin-2 is unpaired and available for intermolecular disulfide bonding, which is essential for initial fibrillin assembly (14Reinhardt D.P.

Genetic mutations in fibrillins cause a number of related connective tissue disorders, including Marfan syndrome (fibrillin-1), Beals-Hecht syndrome (fibrillin-2), Weill-Marchesani syndrome (fibrillin-1 and potentially fibrillin-3), and others (for a review, see Ref. 15Robinson P.

The clinical symptoms that characterize these connective tissue disorders exemplify the important roles for fibrillins in development and homeostasis of the cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular systems. More specifically, for the cardiovascular system, it has been demonstrated by murine gene deletion experiments that fibrillin-1 and -2 are important for proper elastogenesis (16Carta L. Pereira L.

They are characterized by common homologous C-terminal domains of 120–140 amino acid residues preceded by an array of cbEGF domains. Fibulin-1 and -2 are larger in size as compared with other fibulins, with anaphylatoxin domains N-terminal of the tandem cbEGF stretches (20Argraves W.S. Tran H. Burgess W.H. Dickerson K. J.

In respect to the relationship of fibulins with the microfibril/elastic fiber system, it has been shown that several fibulins are associated with this system. Immunohistochemical experiments at the light and electron microscopic level revealed that (i) fibulin-1 is associated with the amorphous elastin core of elastic fibers (29Roark E.F. Keene D.R.

Fibulin-2, -4, and -5 show similar binding to the N-terminal region of fibrillin-1, whereas other fibulins did not interact. A panel of swapped domain constructs established that the first hybrid domain in fibrillin-1 is essential but not sufficient for binding to fibulin-2, -4, and -5. Whereas these fibulins are able to associate with microfibrils, they do not interfere with the ability of fibrillin-1 to self-interact. However, fibulin-2 and -5 can promote ternary complexes between fibrillin-1 and tropoelastin, indicating that they act as molecular adaptors between microfibrils and elastic fibers.

All fibrillin-1 expression plasmids were designed with a sequence for a signal peptide from the BM40 protein to ensure secretion into the culture medium and a sequence for a C-terminal hexahistidine tag to facilitate protein purification. Due to the cloning strategy, the recombinant proteins are expressed with an additional Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala sequence at their N terminus.

The plasmid for rF1G has been designed to express the identical region compared with rF1F but with swapped domains cbEGF 8 and 9 replacing cbEGF 1 and 2. For the cloning strategy, it was necessary to modify the polylinker region of the cloning plasmid pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) to introduce additional ClaI and AgeI restriction sites.

The amplified DNA was ligated with the pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the 283-bp BtgI-NsiI fragment isolated form this plasmid was subcloned into the BtgI-NsiI-restricted pBS3-rF1F, resulting in plasmid pBS3-rF1G.

The rF16H construct is identical to wild-type rF16 coding for the region in fibrillin-1 between the N terminus and cbEGF22 (43Jensen S.A. Reinhardt D.P. Gibson M.A. Weiss A.S. J. Biol.

A 1355-bp NheI-AgeI fragment from plasmid pDNSP-rF1H was subcloned into the NheI-AgeI restricted pDNSP-rF16 (43Jensen S.A. Reinhardt D.P. Gibson M.A. Weiss A.S. J. Biol.

The 279-bp BamHI-HpaI-restricted fragment from this plasmid was ligated into the BamHI-HpaI-restricted pDNSP-rF51, resulting in the expression plasmid pDNSP-rF51H. Generation of stable recombinant cell clones using human embryonic kidney cells 293, production of recombinant medium, and purification of the histidine-tagged proteins by chelating chromatography was performed as described previously for other fibrillin-1 and -2 fragments with minor modifications (46Lin G.

Briefly, cDNA coding for each fibulin was inserted into the pCEP-Pu or pCEP-Pu/AC7 vector, and 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were transfected by standard methods. Fibulins were purified from serum-free culture medium as described previously with minor modifications (25Giltay R. Timpl R. Kostka G. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recombinant tropoelastin was kindly provided by Dr. Anthony S. Weiss (49Martin S.L. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Gene. 1995; 154: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Solid Phase Microwell Assays—For protein-protein interaction assays, multiwell plates (Maxisorp, 96 wells; Nalge Nunc International) were coated with purified proteins (10–20 μg/ml; 50–100 μl/well) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), at 4 °C overnight. All subsequent steps were performed at 20 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1–2 h with 100 μl of TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk (binding buffer). The wells were washed three times with TBS, including 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (washing buffer). The coated proteins were typically incubated with either a single or with a duplicate serial dilution of the soluble ligands starting at 100–150 μg/ml for 2 h. In some cases, a second protein (fibulins or fibrillin-1 fragments) was added at constant concentrations in order to either test inhibitory effects of fibrillin self-assembly or enhancing effects on the fibrillin-1-tropoelastin interactions. After ligand incubation, the wells were washed three times with washing buffer and incubated for 2 h with 100 μl of the primary antibodies against the respective soluble ligands (diluted 1:500–1:1000 in binding buffer). After washing, the wells were incubated with 100 μlof horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:800 diluted in binding buffer) for 1.5 h. Color development was performed with 1 mg/ml 5-aminosalicylic acid in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, including 0.045% (v/v) H2O2 (100 μl/well) for 3–5 min and stopped by adding 100 μlof 2 m NaOH to each well. Color yields were determined at 490 nm using a Microplate EL310 autoreader (Bio-Tek Instruments). All solid phase interaction assays were repeated 3–7 times, resulting in similar binding profiles each time. Nonspecific binding of the soluble ligands to either the blocking reagents or the plastic surface was subtracted from binding profiles. Blot Overlay Assay—Extraction of authentic fibulin-2 followed an established procedure (31Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent layers of human skin fibroblasts were first washed two times with TBS, including protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide), and the extracellular layer was then extracted with 0.1 ml/cm2 TBS, including protease inhibitors and 10 mm EDTA for 10 min at 20 °C. Proteins in 1-ml aliquots of the EDTA extracts were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in nonreducing SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS gel electrophoresis (5% (w/v) acrylamide). The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) in 10 mm sodium borate, pH 9.2, at a constant current of 0.4 A for 45 min at 4 °C. All of the following incubations were performed at 20 °C. The membranes were first incubated for 1 h with TBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk to block nonspecific binding sites and then with 100 μg/ml recombinant fibrillin-1 fragments as soluble ligands for3 h in TBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk and 2 mm CaCl2 (binding buffer). Incubation with binding buffer alone served as a negative control. After washing three times with TBS, including 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 2 mm CaCl2, the membranes were incubated for 2 h with monoclonal antibody 26 (∼5 μg/ml in binding buffer) against the soluble ligands. The membranes were incubated for 1.5 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibodies (1:800 diluted in binding buffer). The color was developed in TBS, 17% methanol, including 0.02% (v/v) H2O2 and 0.5 mg/ml 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Bio-Rad). Antibodies—The following polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have been generated and characterized previously. Polyclonal antisera anti-rF16 and anti-rF6H were raised in rabbits against the recombinant N- and C-terminal halves of human fibrillin-1, respectively (50Tiedemann K. Bätge B. Müller P.K.

Recent studies have found that diverse cellular mechanisms are employed to control the activity of DUBs. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) is a highly expressed neuronal DUB linked to Parkinson disease; however, little is known about its specific functions or modes of regulation. Here, we demonstrate that UCH-L1 is post-translationally modified by monoubiquitin in cells, at lysine residues near the active site. This modification restricts enzyme activity by preventing binding to ubiquitinated targets, and permanent monoubiquitination, as mimicked by a ubiquitin-UCH-L1 fusion, inhibits UCH-L1 in its capacity to increase free ubiquitin levels in cells. Interestingly, UCH-L1 catalyzes its own deubiquitination in an intramolecular manner, thereby regulating the lifetime of this modification. Our results illustrate monoubiquitination as a reversible regulatory mechanism for DUB activity involving auto-deubiquitination.

Our results illustrate monoubiquitination as a reversible regulatory mechanism for DUB activity involving auto-deubiquitination. Protein ubiquitination is a central regulator in numerous cellular processes, including protein degradation, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). The enzymatic system for conjugating ubiquitin to protein substrates is well characterized and results in conjugation of ubiquitin to the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues or in some cases to the N-terminal amino group of target proteins (2Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 3Ciechanover A. Ben-Saadon R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 103-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Proteins can be modified by monomeric ubiquitin (termed monoubiquitination) or by ubiquitin chains formed by conjugation of additional ubiquitin molecules to various lysines within ubiquitin (referred to as polyubiquitination). The number and conformation of appended ubiquitin molecules determine the fate of the target protein. While Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains typically target proteins for proteasomal degradation, monoubiquitination at one or more lysines triggers a variety of effects depending on the substrate protein, including endocytosis, gene silencing, and DNA repair (4Schnell J.D. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35857-35860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 5Huang T.T. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the many functions associated with ubiquitination continues to grow with the identification of additional protein substrates targeted by this versatile modification. Like protein phosphorylation, ubiquitination is reversible, and deubiquitination plays an important role in regulating ubiquitin-dependent pathways. Removal of ubiquitin is accomplished by DUBs, 2The abbreviations used are: DUB, deubiquitinating enzyme; AD, Alzheimer disease; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PD, Parkinson disease; UBD, ubiquitin binding domain; UCH, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase; UCH-L1, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1; WT, wild-type; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; UBB, ubiquitin binding buffer; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. a diverse class of nearly 80 enzymes in humans, which cleave ubiquitin from proteins, peptides, or small molecules (6Amerik A.Y.

Cell. 2005; 123: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). Although specific substrates have been identified for relatively few DUBs, the importance of this enzyme class is highlighted by recent studies which reveal tight regulation of their activity. Transcriptional regulation, protein-protein interactions, and post-translational modifications are known to regulate DUB activity (7Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A. Brummelkamp T.R. Dirac A.M. Sixma T.K. Bernards R. Cell. 2005; 123: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar, 8Wing S.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 590-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For example, the DUB USP1 (ubiquitin-specific protease-1) is inactivated by a UV irradiation-induced auto-cleavage event, allowing for accumulation of monoubiquitinated PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and activation of DNA repair (9Huang T.T. Nijman S.M. Mirchandani K.D. Galardy P.J. Cohn M.A. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Ploegh H.L. Bernards R. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In addition, transient phosphorylation inactivates the DUB CYLD (cylindromatosis gene product), which functions as a tumor suppressor by deubiquitinating key signaling molecules such as TRAF2 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2) (10Reiley W. Zhang M. Wu X. Granger E. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3886-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These examples demonstrate the importance of post-translational modifications in the regulation of DUB activity. UCH-L1 is a 223-amino acid, primarily neuronal-specific member of the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) family of DUBs, and is involved in several neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. UCH-L1 is present in neuronal inclusions associated with Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and Lewy body disease (11Lowe J. McDermott H. Landon M. Mayer R.J. Wilkinson K.D. J.

Jia J. Brain Res. 2006; 1087: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, UCH-L1 overexpression occurs in many cancers, including lung and colorectal carcinoma, and may be related to tumor progression (16Hibi K. Westra W.H. Borges M. Goodman S. Sidransky D.

Nagasaka T. Nakao A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its importance in disease, little is known about the normal function of UCH-L1 or its mode of regulation. Physiological substrates are unknown, but in vitro studies suggest that UCHs are involved in the cleavage of α- and ϵ-amino linked peptides or small molecules from the C terminus of ubiquitin, and in the co-translational processing of pro-ubiquitin and ribosomal proteins translated as ubiquitin fusions (18Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In vivo studies suggest that UCH-L1 is involved in regulating ubiquitin homeostasis, apoptosis, and learning and memory; however, the precise role of UCH-L1 in these processes is not clear (19Osaka H. Wang Y.L. Takada K. Takizawa S. Setsuie R. Li H. Sato Y. Nishikawa K. Sun Y.J. Sakurai M. Harada T. Hara Y. Kimura I. Chiba S. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Noda M. Aoki S. Wada K. Hum. Mol.

As one of the most abundant neuronal proteins, estimated to comprise 1-2% of soluble brain protein (23Doran J.F. Jackson P. Kynoch P.A. Thompson R.J. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 1542-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), it is likely that UCH-L1 activity is regulated at the post-translational level. In our efforts to understand the regulation of UCH-L1 activity, we have identified and characterized a monoubiquitinated species of UCH-L1, which to our knowledge represents the first example of a monoubiquitinated UCH enzyme. We show that monoubiquitination inhibits ubiquitin binding in vitro and prevents UCH-L1 from regulating free ubiquitin levels in cells. Monoubiquitination of the enzyme is dependent on its ubiquitin binding site, which directly interacts with the conjugated ubiquitin. Furthermore, the stability of this modification is governed by an auto-deubiquitination reaction, in which ubiquitin is cleaved from UCH-L1 in an intramolecular manner. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of UCH-L1 structure and function and the emerging role of monoubiquitination in regulating the machinery of the ubiquitin pathway. Chemicals and Reagents—MG-132 and lactacystin were obtained from Calbiochem. Ni-NTA-agarose beads and plasmid purification kits were purchased from Qiagen. Electrophoresis and transfer reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid Construction—All plasmids were constructed using pcDNA3.1zeo(+) (Invitrogen) as vector. PCR mutagenesis and standard molecular biology techniques were used to generate the following constructs: N-terminally His6-tagged UCH-L1 (epitope = MGHHHHHHGS), N-terminally FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (epitope = MDYKDDDDK), and ubiquitin-UCH-L1 fusions. Single and double amino acid changes were generated by standard PCR mutagenesis as described previously (24Papworth C. Bauer J.C. Braman J. Wright D.A. Strategies. 1996; 9: 3-4Crossref Google Scholar) using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Multiple amino acid mutations were generated using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Templates for PCR and subcloning were human UCH-L1 and human ubiquitin. Restriction enzymes, DNA ligase, and dNTP mix were purchased from New England Biolabs. XL-10 Gold Ultracompetent cells were purchased from Stratagene. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Tissue culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen and ATCC. Pulldown Assays—COS-7 cells were transfected with Histagged UCH-L1 constructs in 12-well plates. 24-48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in denaturing lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1% Nonidet P-40, 8 m urea, pH 8), sonicated briefly on ice using a Fisher Scientific sonic dismembrator model 500 with microtip attachment, and incubated with Ni-NTA beads for 1-2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with His tag wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8), and protein was eluted using SDS-PAGE sample buffer and loaded onto gels or stored at -20 °C until analysis by Western blot. Western Blots and Immunostaining—Cell lysates or protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, subjected to immunoblotting, and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The following primary antibodies were used: UCH-L1 (AB1761) and actin (MAB1501R) from Chemicon; ubiquitin (MMS-257P) from Covance, and parkin (2132) from Cell Signaling. Anti-rabbit (W401B) and anti-mouse (W402B) secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Promega. Densitometric analysis was performed using the public domain NIH Image program (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). For fluorescence immunostaining, cells were grown on #1.5 glass coverslips (Warner Instruments) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) overnight at 4 °C or in 70% ethanol at -20 °C for at least 20 min. After washing in PBS, cells were immunostained with anti-His (sc-803, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ubiquitin (MMS-257P, Covance), and anti-UCH-L1 (AB1761, Chemicon) antibodies in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton-X100. Rhodamine red anti-rabbit (111-295-144) and Cy-2 anti-mouse (115-225-146) from Jackson ImmunoResearch were used as secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted on slides with Prolong gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Molecular Probes), prior to analysis using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with Y-FL epifluorescence and differential interference contrast attachments and SPOT RT-Slider digital camera and software. Purification of Ubiquitinated UCH-L1—COS-7 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding His-tagged UCH-L1 and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin. 24-48 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed with PBS and resuspended in native lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 1% Tween 20, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), sonicated at 15% amplitude for 3 × 15 s, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated overnight with EZview Red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel beads (Sigma). Beads were washed with lysis buffer, and protein was eluted by incubation with 200 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in His tag wash buffer for 2-4 h. Eluate was incubated with Ni-NTA beads for 1-2 h, and beads were washed with His tag wash buffer and eluted in appropriate buffer for analysis by either mass spectrometry or in vitro deubiquitination assay. For mass spectrometric analysis, one to three 15-cm plates of cells were used per sample, and protein was eluted from Ni-NTA beads using SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and stained with Colloidal Blue staining kit (Invitrogen) prior to excision of bands for analysis by microcapillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School. For in vitro deubiquitination assays, one 10-cm plate of cells was used per sample, lysis buffer was supplemented with 0.5 mm ubiquitin (Sigma U6253) to displace non-covalently associated FLAG-ubiquitin from UCH-L1, and protein was eluted from Ni-NTA beads using UCH enzyme assay buffer supplemented with imidazole (40 mm Tris-Cl, 250 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8). All lysis and purification steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C for both procedures. Ubiquitin Binding Assays—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with UCH-L1 expression plasmids and were harvested 24-48 h post-transfection. For ubiquitin binding assays using purified His-UCH-L1, cells were resuspended in native lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8) and sonicated briefly on ice. Following incubation of lysates with Ni-NTA beads at 4 °C for 1-2 h, beads were washed, and proteins were eluted using ubiquitin binding buffer (UBB) (50 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8) supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. Eluates were diluted in UBB and incubated with ubiquitin-agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C. Following incubation, unbound fraction was set aside, beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Unbound fraction was diluted in UBB supplemented with 300 mm NaCl and incubated with Ni-NTA beads for 1-2 h. Ni-NTA beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted using SDS-PAGE sample buffer, prior to analysis by Western blotting. For ubiquitin binding assays performed directly with cell lysates, cells were lysed in UBB, sonicated briefly on ice, and incubated with ubiquitin-agarose beads. Beads were washed, and protein was eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using MINITAB statistical software. UCH-L1 Is Monoubiquitinated in Cell Culture—To identify post-translational modifications of UCH-L1, we undertook studies of UCH-L1 transiently transfected in COS-7 monkey kidney cells, which express only very low levels of UCH-L1 endogenously. In Western blots of transfected cell lysates, the majority of UCH-L1 migrated at the expected mobility of 25 kDa; however, long exposures revealed an additional 33-kDa species (Fig. 1A). This modified form of UCH-L1 was stable to SDS, reducing agents, and boiling (data not shown), suggesting a covalent linkage, and the shift in mobility implied addition of a protein modifier such as ubiquitin. To determine whether the modified species was monoubiquitinated UCH-L1, we performed nickel-affinity pulldown assays using Ni-NTA beads, from cells expressing His-tagged wild-type UCH-L1 (His-UCH-L1WT). A catalytically inactive mutant of UCH-L1, in which the active site cysteine is mutated to serine (His-UCH-L1C90S), was also analyzed because it exhibited higher levels of the modified form. Analysis of the isolated proteins by Western blotting for UCH-L1 and ubiquitin confirmed that the modified species was monoubiquitinated UCH-L1 (Fig. 1B). To test whether polyubiquitination of UCH-L1 occurs upon proteasomal inhibition, transfected cells were treated with lactacystin or MG-132, and pulldown assays were performed. Although high molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins accumulated in total cell lysates of lactacystin- and MG-132-treated cells, UCH-L1 did not accumulate, and no high molecular weight forms of UCH-L1 were detected (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that monoubiquitination of UCH-L1 is unrelated to the formation of polyubiquitin chains for proteasomal degradation and may serve as a novel regulatory mechanism for UCH-L1. Monoubiquitination Inhibits Ubiquitin Binding by UCH-L1—We next wished to determine the effect of monoubiquitination on UCH-L1 activity. Substrate recognition by UCHs is mediated by a ubiquitin binding site on the enzyme (25Johnston S.C. Riddle S.M. Cohen R.E. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3877-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 26Misaghi S. Galardy P.J. Meester W.J. Ovaa H. Ploegh H.L. Gaudet R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1512-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and UCH-L1 binds free ubiquitin in brain and cell lysates (19Osaka H. Wang Y.L. Takada K. Takizawa S. Setsuie R. Li H. Sato Y. Nishikawa K. Sun Y.J. Sakurai M. Harada T. Hara Y. Kimura I. Chiba S. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Noda M. Aoki S. Wada K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1945-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To determine whether monoubiquitination affects the ability of the enzyme to bind ubiquitin, we performed ubiquitin binding assays with unmodified and monoubiquitinated His-UCH-L1WT and His-UCH-L1C90S purified from COS-7 cells. In contrast to unmodified UCH-L1, monoubiquitinated UCH-L1 did not appreciably bind ubiquitin-agarose beads (Fig. 2A). We hypothesized that inhibition of ubiquitin binding may result from the conjugated ubiquitin occupying the ubiquitin binding site of UCH-L1. If so, disrupting the interaction between conjugated ubiquitin and the ubiquitin binding site should restore binding between free ubiquitin and the enzyme. To test this hypothesis, we first generated a monoubiquitin-UCH-L1 translational fusion protein, UbVV-UCH-L1, in which the C terminus of ubiquitin was linked to Lys-4 of UCH-L1, and the last two amino acids of ubiquitin were mutated from glycine to valine (G75,76V) to prevent cleavage by endogenous DUBs (27Zhu Q. Wani G. Wang Q.E. El-mahdy M. Snapka R.M. Wani A.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 307: 436-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). To determine whether UbVV-UCH-L1 effectively mimics post-translationally ubiquitinated UCH-L1, we confirmed that UbVV-UCH-L1 was deficient in ubiquitin binding (Fig. 2C). To address the mechanism of this inhibition, and to concurrently control for the possibility that inhibition of ubiquitin binding by UbVV-UCH-L1 was due to improper folding, we generated a second fusion protein, UbVV/L8A-UCH-L1, which contains an L8A mutation in the ubiquitin moiety of this fusion protein. The L8A mutation, which disrupts binding of ubiquitin to UCH-L1 in vitro (28Luchansky S.J. Lansbury P.T. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14717-14725Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was introduced to prevent interaction of the translationally fused ubiquitin with the ubiquitin binding site of UCH-L1. In contrast to UbVV-UCH-L1, UbVV/L8A-UCH-L1 efficiently bound ubiquitin-agarose beads (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the fusion proteins are properly folded and, furthermore, that monoubiquitinated UCH-L1 is unable to interact with ubiquitinated targets or free ubiquitin because conjugated ubiquitin occupies the ubiquitin binding site of the enzyme. We next wished to determine whether the lack of ubiquitin binding exhibited in vitro by monoubiquitinated UCH-L1 would affect UCH-L1 function in cells. It has been shown that UCH-L1 variants capable of binding ubiquitin increase monoubiquitin levels in cultured cells and neurons in vivo (19Osaka H. Wang Y.L. Takada K. Takizawa S. Setsuie R. Li H. Sato Y. Nishikawa K. Sun Y.J. Sakurai M. Harada T. Hara Y. Kimura I. Chiba S. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Noda M. Aoki S. Wada K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1945-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We tested this effect in COS-7 cells and found that expression of His-UCH-L1WT or His-UCH-L1C90S, but not His-UCH-L1D30K (a UCH-L1 mutant deficient in ubiquitin binding (19Osaka H. Wang Y.L. Takada K. Takizawa S. Setsuie R. Li H. Sato Y. Nishikawa K. Sun Y.J. Sakurai M. Harada T. Hara Y. Kimura I. Chiba S. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Noda M. Aoki S. Wada K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1945-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar)), significantly increased monoubiquitin levels by ∼50% relative to control cells expressing vector only (Fig. 3). UbVV-UCH-L1 was unable to increase cellular monoubiquitin levels, but this effect was retained by UbVV/L8A-UCH-L1. These results suggest that permanently monoubiquitinated UCH-L1 is deficient in the capacity to increase cellular monoubiquitin levels because it is unable to bind free ubiquitin. Thus, monoubiquitination is capable of impairing functions of UCH-L1 that are dependent on ubiquitin binding, both in vitro and in a cellular system. Auto-deubiquitination Regulates the Monoubiquitination of UCH-L1—Although permanent monoubiquitination rendered the enzyme deficient in a cellular assay of UCH-L1 function, the stability of this modification on UCH-L1 was not clear. Because the C90S mutation increased cellular levels of monoubiquitinated UCH-L1, we hypothesized that UCH-L1 may deubiquitinate itself. To examine this idea, we first tested whether a separate crippling active site mutation, H161D (29Larsen C.N. Price J.S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6735-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), would also increase levels of monoubiquitinated UCH-L1 in cells. Pulldown assays from COS-7 cells revealed that whereas an estimated 5-10% of total His-UCH-L1WT was monoubiquitinated, ∼30% of both His-UCH-L1H161D and His-UCH-L1C90S were monoubiquitinated (Fig. 4A), thus confirming that inhibition of catalytic activity is associated with higher levels of monoubiquitinated UCH-L1 in cells. To determine whether this could be explained by auto-deubiquitination of the active enzyme, an in vitro deubiquitination assay was performed using FLAG-monoubiquitinated His-UCH-L1 (Ub-UCH-L1) purified from COS-7 cells. While Ub-UCH-L1WT was hydrolyzed almost completely to the unmodified form, no hydrolysis of Ub-UCH-L1C90S was observed (Fig. 4B, left and center panels), indicating that enzymatically active UCH-L1 is required for the reaction and that hydrolysis was not caused by contaminating DUBs or nonspecific degradation. Furthermore, addition of iodoacetamide, a cysteine protease inhibitor, to the reaction prevented deubiquitination (supplemental Fig. 1). We next wished to determine whether deubiquitination occurs intramolecularly, within a single molecule of ubiquitinated UCH-L1, or intermolecularly, whereby one molecule of ubiquitinated UCH-L1 is hydrolyzed by a second molecule of UCH-L1. No hydrolysis was observed when the in vitro deubiquitination assay was repeated with Ub-UCH-L1C90S in the presence of recombinant UCH-L1WT (Fig. 4B, rightmost panel), suggesting that UCH-L1 cannot hydrolyze monoubiquitinated UCH-L1 in an intermolecular manner. To further test this idea, we examined whether additional UCH-L1WT would affect monoubiquitinated UCH-L1 levels in a cellular system. Reflecting the in vitro results, co-expression of untagged UCH-L1WT had no effect on levels of monoubiquitinated His-UCH-L1WT or His-UCH-L1C90S in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4C). Overall, these results suggest that intramolecular deubiquitination, which is dependent on the hydrolytic activity of UCH-L1, regulates the lifetime of this modification, thereby affecting the cellular level of monoubiquitinated UCH-L1. Monoubiquitination Targets Residues Near the UCH-L1 Active Site—To determine how intramolecular deubiquitination would be feasible on a structural level, we analyzed the ubiquitination sites of UCH-L1. Monoubiquitinated His-UCH-L1WT and His-UCH-L1C90S were purified from COS-7 cells and analyzed for post-translational modifications by microcapillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Ubiquitination sites were detected at four conserved lysines in both proteins: Lys-4, Lys-65, Lys-71, and Lys-157 (supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). As shown in Fig. 5A, Lys-4 is located in a flexible N-terminal loop which passes over the active site of UCH-L1; Lys-65 and Lys-71 are positioned in a region containing an α-helix spanning residues 57-69, immediately adjacent to the active site cleft; and Lys-157 is located in a flexible loop (residues 148-159) which crosses directly over the active site of UCH-L1. Lys-4, Lys-65, Lys-71, and Lys-157 are distanced 17, 23, 24, and 14 Å, respectively, from the active site thiol in the unliganded structure of UCH-L1 (30Das C. Hoang Q.Q. Kreinbring C.A. Luchansky S.J. Meray R.K. Ray S.S. Lansbury P.T. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4675-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine the relative importance of each ubiquitination site and whether additional sites exist, a panel of single and multiple lysine to arginine mutants of UCH-L1 were generated and analyzed for ubiquitination level in COS-7 cells. Because mutation of ubiquitination sites may affect both the rates of ubiquitin conjugation (by a ubiquitin ligase) and deconjugation (by UCH-L1), we analyzed the effect of mutations in both catalytically active and inactive (C90S) UCH-L1, the latter of which should only reflect changes in the rate of ubiquitin conjugation. We found that the only single lysine mutant to noticeably reduce monoubiquitination level was C90S/K157R (Fig. 5B, lane 14), suggesting that Lys-157 may be the preferred ubiquitination site. Mutation of all four detected sites, plus an additional adjacent residue, Lys-64, (5KR, Fig. 5B, lanes 6 and 15), failed to eliminate ubiquitination of UCH-L1, indicating that alternate sites are possible, but their relevance under physiological conditions is unclear. Mutation of all 16 lysines in UCH-L1 to arginine (ΔK, Fig. 5B, lanes 9 and 18) greatly reduced, but did not completely eliminate, monoubiquitination, suggesting that N-terminal ubiquitination of UCH-L1 may occur. It should be noted that binding of ΔLys mutants to ubiquitin was preserved (supplemental Fig. 4), suggesting that these mutants are properly folded. Furthermore, ΔLys was comparable with WT in the monoubiquitin level assay (Fig. 3). Overall, these results suggest that the major ubiquitination site(s) of UCH-L1 are located near the active site and are thus consistent with an intramolecular auto-deubiquitination reaction.

Our understanding of Dlx gene function is limited by the current paucity of established transcriptional targets of Dlx genes. We have commenced isolating and characterizing candidate Dlx gene targets in the developing mouse, particularly in the forebrain, using chromatin immunoaffinity purification (ChIP) of embryonic tissues that regionally express Dlx genes. We have optimized the ChIP protocol using embryonic ganglionic eminence tissues and specific affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the proteins encoded by the Dlx1 and Dlx2 genes (1Eisenstat D.D.

The semaphorins (Sema) 3A and 3F, by binding to their receptors Neuropilin-1 and Neuropilin-2, respectively, provide strong repulsive guidance cues and mediate sorting of tangentially migrating interneurons from the ganglionic eminences to the cortex and striatum (15Marin O. Yaron A. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Rubenstein J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 872-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Different models to assess the function of members of the neuropilin family have been generated. A dominant negative form of Nrp-1 increases interneuron migration from the MGE to the striatum and reduces migration to the neocortex in vitro (15Marin O. Yaron A. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Rubenstein J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 872-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In Nrp-2 knock-out mice, sympathetic and hippocampal neurons have reduced repulsive responses to Sema3F but not to Sema3A. There are also axonal pathfinding defects of specific cranial and sensory nerves and hippocampal mossy fiber projections (27Chen H. Bagri A. Zupicich J.A. Zou Y. Stoeckli E. Pleasure S.J.

However, similar to the Nrp-1 dominant negative experiments, there are increased numbers of interneurons invading the developing and postnatal striatum in these mice (15Marin O. Yaron A. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Rubenstein J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 872-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Evidence of ectopic expression of Neuropilin-2 (Nrp-2) in the Dlx1/Dlx2 mutant forebrain (15Marin O. Yaron A. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Rubenstein J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 872-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) provided a rationale to test whether direct DLX1 and/or DLX2 directly regulate Neuropilin-1/2 expression. Herein, using ChIP of mid-gestation ganglionic eminences, we demonstrate that DLX1 and DLX2 directly bind to a specific region of the Nrp-2 but not to the Nrp-1 promoter in vivo. Furthermore, both DLX1 and DLX2 inhibit transcription of Nrp-2 in vitro. Moreover, loss of Dlx1 and Dlx2 function leads to the increased and ectopic expression of Neuropilin-2 as subventricular ectopias in the medial and lateral ganglionic eminences. These results support our hypothesis that a subpopulation of late-born Dlx-expressing interneurons (Neuropilin-2 low/non-expressing) successfully bypass semaphorin repulsive cues to migrate to the neocortex. Conversely, loss of Dlx1 and Dlx2 function results in increased and aberrant Neuropilin-2 expression in this population, and their resultant responsiveness to semaphorin signaling may contribute to block tangential interneuron migration from the basal telencephalon. These data delineate part of the molecular mechanism by which migrating interneurons may bypass inhibitory cues to reach their correct destinations in the forebrain. Animals—Mice with null mutations of Dlx1 and Dlx2 (a kind gift from Dr. J. Rubenstein, University of California, San Francisco) were maintained in a CD1 background at Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology following protocols approved by the University of Manitoba under the auspices of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Dlx1/Dlx2 mutants were genotyped using published protocols (7Qiu M. Bulfone A. Ghattas I. Meneses J.J. Christensen L. Sharpe P.T. Presley R. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. Dev.

Embryonic age was determined by the day of appearance of the vaginal plug (E0.5), and tissues were processed as previously described (3de Melo J. Qiu X. Du G. Cristante L. Eisenstat D.D. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 461: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For comparative studies all mutant embryos were paired with wild-type littermate controls. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—ChIP was performed under the following conditions as described (17Zhou Q.P. Le T.N. Qiu X. Spencer V. de Melo J. Du G. Plews M. Fonseca M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Eisenstat D.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 884-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 1-2 × 107 E13.5 ganglionic eminence cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 90 min at room temperature. Sonication of cells (Sonifier cell disruptor 350) in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA) on ice generated soluble chromatin complexes with DNA fragment lengths ranging between 100 and 300 bp. Specific polyclonal high affinity DLX antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate genomic DNA targets cross-linked to DLX1 or DLX2 homeoproteins. Genomic DNA from an E13.5 mouse embryo was used as a positive control. DNA derived from E13.5 hindbrain was used as a negative control because this tissue does not express any Dlx family members. Thermal Cycling/Polymerase Chain Reaction—We generated oligonucleotide primer pairs to two regions of the mouse Neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) sequence (GenBank™ AF482432), designated Nrp-1i and Nrp-1ii. For Nrp-1i, the sense primer was 5′-GGAACCGGACTACATGG-3′ and the antisense primer was 5′-AAGACTGGCAACGACCC-3′. For Nrp-1ii, the sense primer was 5′-AACCTCAGGCTGACACC-3′ and the antisense primer was 5′-ACGAGATCTCTGCACCC-3′. We also designed oligonucleotide primer pairs to two regions of the mouse Neuropilin-2 promoter (Nrp-2) sequence (GenBank™ AF022854) that were designated Nrp-2i and Nrp-2ii. For Nrp-2i, the sense primer was 5′-GAGATCACACAGCTGCC-3′ and the antisense primer was 5′-CCTACAACATCACGAGG-3′. For Nrp-2ii, the sense primer was 5′-CGTTGATCGTTAGAGACC-3′ and the antisense primer was 5′-GACAGAGAGGCTCTCTC-3′. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—We used a region (444-562 nt) of the Neuropilin-2 promoter (Nrp-2ii) (GenBank™ AF022854) and labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides with [α-P32]dATP using the Klenow large fragment of DNA Polymerase I (Promega). The binding reaction mixture (20 μl total volume) contained labeled probes (80,000 cpm) in binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and purified recombinant proteins or nuclear extracts derived from E13.5 ganglionic eminences. The binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. We added unlabeled probes for “cold competition” assays and specific polyclonal DLX1 or DLX2 antibodies for “supershift” assays and polyclonal Secretory Component antibody (Dako, Mississauga, Ontario) to control for nonspecific binding (17Zhou Q.P.

Reporter Gene Assays—We used the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) to transiently co-transfect luciferase gene reporters (1 μg) into 106 human embryonic kidney 293 cells with pRSV-β galactosidase (Promega) (0.4 μg) as an internal control and harvested cell lysates 36 h later. Subsequently, luciferase activities were measured with the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), normalizing luciferase activity with β-galactosidase activity. The Nrp-2 luciferase reporter contains the Nrp-2 promoter (444-562 nt) (GenBank™ AF022854) directing expression of the luciferase gene. We expressed DLX1 and DLX2 (Dlx1 and Dlx2 cDNAs were a kind gift from Dr. J. Rubenstein, UCSF) and their derivatives from the pcDNA3 expression plasmid (Invitrogen). We generated Q50E variants using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). DLX-VP16 and DLX-Engrailed fusion constructs were generated as follows: we excised the N-terminal domain of either Dlx1 or Dlx2 by HindIII/PpuMI or EcoRI/BsmBI (New England Biolabs) restriction enzyme digestions, respectively, and maintained the nuclear localization signal, homeodomain, and C-terminal domains. Engrailed (888-bp) and VP16 (255-bp) domains (30Kessler D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13017-13022Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) were ligated to the 5′-end of these N-terminal-modified Dlx constructs. Tissue Preparations and in Situ Hybridization—Tissues were prepared as previously described (1Eisenstat D.D. Liu J.K. Mione M. Zhong W. Yu G. Anderson S.A. Ghattas I. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. J.

E13.5 tissues (whole embryos) were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and cryopreserved using sucrose gradients followed by embedding in OCT medium (Tissue Tek), whereas central nervous system tissues from E16.5 and E18.5 embryos were prepared following dissection. Tissue samples were also sectioned coronally at a thickness of 15 μm using a cryostat (Cryotome, ThermoShandon, Cheshire, UK). Digoxigenin in situ hybridization was carried out as described (1Eisenstat D.D. Liu J.K. Mione M. Zhong W. Yu G. Anderson S.A. Ghattas I. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. J. Comp.

Tessier-Lavigne, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). Immunohistochemistry, Immunofluorescence, and Immunoblotting—Immunohistochemistry and single and double immunofluorescence experiments were performed as described (1Eisenstat D.D. Liu J.K. Mione M.

For immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence we used the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-DLX1 (1:100, N114 affinity-purified), rabbit anti-DLX2 (1:300, C199 affinity-purified) (DLX1 and DLX2 polyclonal antisera were kind gifts from Dr. J.

Secondary antibodies were fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:100; Sigma), biotin-SP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), streptavidin-conjugated Oregon Green-488 (1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and streptavidin-conjugated Texas Red (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For immunoblotting, we followed established protocols (17Zhou Q.P. Le T.N. Qiu X. Spencer V. de Melo J. Du G. Plews M. Fonseca M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Eisenstat D.D.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6370-6383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DLX1 and DLX2 Homeobox Proteins Bind to a Neuropilin-2 Promoter Region in Embryonic Forebrain in Vivo—Marin et al. (15Marin O. Yaron A. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Rubenstein J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 872-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) established that the Class III semaphorins, semaphorins 3A and 3F, and their receptors, Neuropilin-1 and Neuropilin-2, play important roles in the sorting of interneurons that are migrating to the neocortex and the striatum. The promoters of both of these genes, Neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) and Neuropilin-2 (Nrp-2), contain putative TAAT/ATTA homeodomain DNA binding sites. Hence, we considered Nrp-1 and Nrp-2 as candidate transcriptional targets of several homeobox genes regionally expressed in the subcortical telencephalon, including members of the Dlx gene family. To test this hypothesis, we assayed for the direct binding to both Nrp promoters by DLX1 and/or DLX2 in vivo. E13.5 ganglionic eminences were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link protein-DNA complexes. Using a modified ChIP procedure, soluble nucleoprotein complexes of ∼100-300 base pair fragments were immunoprecipitated using anti-DLX1 and/or DLX2 antibodies. We then used PCR to amplify candidate homeodomain binding regions in the Nrp-1 and Nrp-2 loci. These regions were chosen based on the presence of consensus homeodomain binding motifs and were designated Nrp-1i (nucleotides 104-283), Nrp-1ii (nucleotides 711-900), Nrp-2i (nucleotides 138-255), and Nrp-2ii (nucleotides 444-562) (Fig. 1A). Notably, ChIP assays revealed that both DLX1 and DLX2 bound only to Nrp-2 promoter region 2 (Nrp-2ii) in embryonic striatum but there was no evidence for binding with the other promoter regions in vivo (Fig. 1B). The resulting amplicons were subcloned and sequenced to verify their identity and for subsequent biochemical analyses. As expected, control ChIP assays performed without antibody or with anti-DLX antibodies and chromatin derived from embryonic hindbrain tissues where Dlx genes are not expressed were negative. DLX1 and DLX2 Bind to the Neuropilin-2 Promoter in Vitro—To determine whether DLX1 and DLX2 specifically bind to the Nrp-2 promoter region 2 in vitro, we used recombinant DLX1 and DLX2 proteins and radiolabeled Nrp-2ii promoter regions isolated from the ChIP assay. An electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed binding of both DLX1 and DLX2 to Nrp-2ii (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 6) that was competitively inhibited by unlabeled Nrp-2ii probe (lanes 3, 7). Moreover, the addition of specific anti-DLX1 or anti-DLX2 antibodies to the protein-DNA complex resulted in significant band mobility shifts (lanes 4, 8), whereas a nonspecific polyclonal antibody failed to produce such a “supershift” (lanes 5, 9). Neither DLX1 nor DLX2 bind to the first TAAT motif of the Nrp-2ii in vitro. However, both recombinant Dlx proteins bind to the second motif (Fig. 1A, box, supplemental Fig. S2, and data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that DLX1 and DLX2 specifically bind to the Nrp-2 promoter region 2 in vitro. As well, binding of DLX1 and DLX2 to this region may be mutually exclusive. EMSA with nuclear extracts derived from embryonic ganglionic eminences showed that endogenous DLX1 and DLX2 proteins can bind to the Nrp-2 promoter (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Unlabeled probe can compete with radiolabeled oligonucleotides for both proteins (lane 3). Experiments using specific DLX1 or DLX2 antibodies and a control antibody confirmed the identity of the Dlx complexes (lanes 4-6). The recombinant and endogenous DLX proteins do not have identical molecular weights, perhaps reflecting different binding partners or post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation in vivo (32Park G.T. Denning M.F. Morasso M.I. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 4X. Qiu and D. Eisenstat, unpublished observations. These experiments demonstrate that DLX1 and DLX2 specifically bind to the Nrp-2 promoter region 2 in vitro. DLX1 and DLX2 Repress Neuropilin-2 Promoter Expression in Vitro—The functional significance of DLX1 and DLX2 binding to the Nrp-2 promoter was assessed using luciferase reporter gene experiments. We co-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells or P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (data not shown) with an expression vector encoding Dlx1 or Dlx2 and a vector in which region 2 of the Nrp-2 promoter (444-562 nt) drives luciferase expression. Co-transfection with either wild-type Dlx1 or Dlx2 expression constructs resulted in significant reductions of luciferase activity compared with controls (∼1.7-fold for Dlx1 and ∼6-fold for Dlx2, p < 0.001; Fig. 3C), indicating that both DLX1 and DLX2 proteins can act as transcriptional repressors of Nrp-2 promoter expression. We generated several different mutant constructs of DLX1 and DLX2 homeodomain proteins to explore the consequences of modifying specific DLX protein domains on activity of the reporter gene (Fig. 3A). The first set of constructs included a mutation that converts glutamine (Q) to glutamate (E) at amino acid position 50 (Q50E) of the DLX homeodomain. This Q50E mutant homeodomain is predicted to abrogate DNA binding, and the mutant protein may act in a dominant negative fashion (33Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wuthrich K. Cell. 1994; 78: 211-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). EMSA assays confirmed that the Q50E mutants do not bind to the Nrp-2 promoter (Fig. 3B). In co-transfection assays, mutant Dlx1 and Dlx2 (Q50E) were unable to repress luciferase gene expression when compared with the wild-type Dlx expression constructs (Fig. 3C). The DNA binding mutant affects a similar level of transcriptional activity for both Dlx1 and Dlx2; however, because the repression of Dlx1 on the Nrp-2 promoter is less than by Dlx2 in the first place, the difference in Dlx1 rescue (from repression) is not as significant as we found in Dlx2 rescue by the Q50E DNA binding mutants. The second group of constructs included an N-terminal domain exchange of DLX1 and DLX2 with either a VP16 activator domain or an Engrailed repressor domain (30Kessler D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13017-13022Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). N-terminal DLX1 and DLX2-Engrailed chimeric fusion proteins further repressed transcription of the Nrp-2 promoter region 2 compared with the wild-type Dlx constructs. Conversely, N-terminal DLX1 and DLX2-VP16 chimeric fusion proteins activated transcription of the Nrp-2 promoter region, overcoming all o"

ZNF217 has been purified in complexes that contain repressor proteins such as CtBP2, suggesting that it acts as a transcriptional repressor. However, the function of ZNF217 has not been well characterized due to a lack of known target genes. Using a global chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip approach, we identified thousands of ZNF217 binding sites in three tumor cell lines (MCF7, SW480, and Ntera2). Further analysis of ZNF217 in Ntera2 cells showed that many promoters are bound by ZNF217 and CtBP2 and that a subset of these promoters are activated upon removal of ZNF217. Thus, our in vivo studies corroborate the in vitro biochemical analyses of ZNF217-containing complexes and support the hypothesis that ZNF217 functions as a transcriptional repressor. Gene ontology analysis showed that ZNF217 targets in Ntera2 cells are involved in organ development, suggesting that one function of ZNF217 may be to repress differentiation. Accordingly we show that differentiation of Ntera2 cells with retinoic acid led to down-regulation of ZNF217.

Initial comparative genomic hybridization studies showed that ZNF217 is amplified and overexpressed in ∼40% of breast cancer cell lines and 18% of primary breast tumors (8Kallioniemi A. Kallioniemi O.P. Piper J. Tanner M. Stokke T. Chen L. Smith H.S. Pinkel D. Gray J.W. Waldman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2156-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Further comparative genomic hybridization studies of various tumor specimens report that ZNF217 amplification and overexpression at the 20q13 locus can display tumor type-specific profiles. For example, an analysis of 22 sporadic colorectal carcinomas detected DNA copy number changes for ZNF217 in 45% of the CIN (chromosomal instability)-type but not the MIN (microsatellite instability)-type sporadic colorectal carcinoma colon tumors (6Lassmann S. Weis R. Makowiec F. Roth J. Danciu M. Hopt U. Werner M. J. Mol. Med. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence in support of a causal role for ZNF217 in tumor formation comes from studies using normal human mammary epithelial cells. Nonet et al. (9Nonet G.H. Stampfer M.R. Chin K. Gray J.W. Collins C.C. Yaswen P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1250-1254PubMed Google Scholar) showed that introduction of ZNF217 into early passage human mammary epithelial cells can lead to a rare event of immortalization. It has been proposed that overexpression of ZNF217 may give a selective advantage to tumor cells by interfering with pathways associated with normal regulation of cell growth, cell death, differentiation, or DNA repair. DNA sequence analysis suggests that ZNF217 encodes a transcription factor having eight C2H2 Kruppel-like zinc finger DNA binding motifs and a proline-rich transactivation domain at the C terminus (1Collins C. Rommens J.M. Kowbel D. Godfrey T. Tanner M. Hwang S.I. Polikoff D. Nonet G. Cochran J. Myambo K. Jay K.E. Froula J. Cloutier T. Kuo W.L. Yaswen P. Dairkee S. Giovanola J. Hutchinson G.B. Isola J.

Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Although both biochemical and structural studies have linked ZNF217 to transcriptional regulation, a detailed analysis of its role in transcription has been limited due to a lack of known ZNF217 target genes. Therefore, we used a ChIP-chip method to identify thousands of ZNF217 target genes in three cancer cell lines: the breast cancer line MCF7, the colon cancer line SW480, and Ntera2, a teratocarcinoma line that can differentiate into neurons. To investigate the role of ZNF217 in transcriptional regulation, we examined the expression level of ZNF217 target genes in Ntera2 cells before and after reduction of the levels of ZNF217 using siRNAs and examined colocalization of ZNF217 with CtBP family members using ChIP-chip assays. Gene ontology analysis indicated that some ZNF217 target genes in Ntera2 cells are transcription factors that are involved in cell differentiation and organ development. We show that ZNF217 was down-regulated upon treatment of Ntera2 cells with retinoic acid, suggesting that the inappropriate expression of ZNF217 in differentiated adult cells may suppress differentiation, leading to tumorigenesis. Cell Culture—SW480 cells were grown in McCoy's 5A modified medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (NovaTech) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). MCF7 and Ntera2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For ZNF217 knockdown ChIP assays, ZNF217 siRNA (SMART-pool; Dharmacon, catalog number M-004987-00) or si-GLO RISC-Free (Dharmacon, catalog number D-001600-01) as a nonspecific control was transiently transfected into Ntera2 cells (100 nm) plated on 100-mm dishes. Transfections were carried out using Invitrogen Lipofectamine2000 according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 72 h, cells were replated at 30–50% density for retransfection and harvested after another 72 h. For ZNF217 knockdown RNA analysis, Ntera2 cells were transfected with the siRNAs (100 nm) in 6-well dishes, and RNA was harvested at 72 h (experiments A and B) or retransfected and harvested 48 h later (experiment C); RNA was prepared using a Qiagen RNAeasy kit (catalog number 74104). Ntera2 cells were differentiated using 10–5 m retinoic acid (Sigma). Antibodies used on Western blots were anti-ZNF217 polyclonal (17Huang G. Krig S. Kowbel D. Xu H. Hyun B. Volik S. Feuerstein B. Mills G.B. Stokoe D. Yaswen P. Collins C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3219-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and anti-OCT4 goat polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number 8628 N-19). ChIP Assays and Amplicon Preparation—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (18Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang M.Q. Zhang T. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A complete protocol can be found in Oberley et al. (19Oberley M.J. Tsao J. Yau P. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 316-335Google Scholar). Antibodies used in this study include a ZNF217 rabbit polyclonal antibody that was generated using a glutathione S-transferase fusion peptide sequence (17Huang G. Krig S. Kowbel D. Xu H. Hyun B. Volik S. Feuerstein B. Mills G.B. Stokoe D. Yaswen P. Collins C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3219-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunoserum was purified on a Pierce Aminolink peptide column constructed with the fusion peptide sequence. CtBP1 (catalog number 612043) and CtBP2 (catalog number 612044) antibodies were purchased from BD Transductions. The secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG (catalog number 55436) was purchased from MP Biomedicals. Standard PCRs using 2 μl of the immunoprecipitated DNA were performed. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide intercalation. Amplicons, prepared using 50–80% of a ChIP sample, were generated using a Sigma Whole Genome Amplification kit; see our published ChIP protocol (20O'Geen H. Nicolet C.M. Blahnik K. Green R. Farnham P.J. BioTechniques. 2006; 41: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) for details. ChIP-Chip Assays—ENCODE and promoter arrays were produced by NimbleGen Systems, Inc. (Madison, WI). The 5-kb human promoter array design is a two-array set, containing 5.0 kb of each promoter region (from build HG17) that extends 4.2 kb upstream and 800 bp downstream of the transcription start site. Where individual 5.0-kb regions overlap, they are merged into a single larger region, preventing redundancy of coverage. The promoter regions thus range in size from 5.0 to 50 kb. These regions are tiled at a 110-bp interval using variable length probes with a target Tm of 76 °C. NimbleGen ENCODE oligonucleotide arrays contained ∼380,000 50-mer probes per array, tiled every 38 bp. The regions included on the arrays encompassed the 30 Mb of the repeat masked ENCODE sequences, representing ∼1% of the human genome. All NimbleGen arrays were hybridized, and the data were extracted according to standard operating procedures by NimbleGen Systems Inc. Signal Map software provide by NimbleGen Systems, Inc. was used to visualize the array peaks. PCR Analysis of Target Genes—Primers were designed to flank ZNF217 binding sites identified on the arrays. PCR was performed using low cycle numbers to ensure linear amplification of the input. Bio-Rad Quantity One software was used for quantification of gene enrichment over input DNA. RNA Illumina Expression Arrays—RNA samples were harvested using a Qiagen RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) and then assayed using the Agilent Systems Bioanalyzer to ensure that high quality RNA was used for the array experiments. The Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kit from Ambion (AMIL1791) was used to generate biotinylated, amplified RNA for hybridization with the Illumina Sentrix Expression BeadChips, Human 6-v1. The Sentrix gene expression beadchips used for this study consisted of a six-array, two-stripe format comprising ∼48,000 probes/array. In this collection 24,000 probes were from RefSeq sequences, and 24,000 were from other GenBank™ sequences (Illumina). Arrays were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions, scanned at medium photomultiplier tube (PMT) settings as recommended by the manufacturer, and analyzed using Bead Studio Software version 2.3.41. Data were normalized using the “average” method that simply adjusts the intensities of two populations of gene expression values such that the means of the populations become equal. Differential expression was calculated for the control versus siZNF217 data sets using an algorithm provided by Bead Studio. -Fold enrichment values were used to obtain the list of candidates with greater than 1.5-fold change. DAVID Analysis—Functional annotations were performed using the program DAVID 2.1 (Ref. 21Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see also david.abcc. ncifcrf.gov/). The same parameters were used for all analyses presented in this study. These parameters were gene ontology molecular function term, level 2; Interpro name in the Protein Domains section; and SP_PIR_Keywords in the Functional Categories section. Before performing the analyses, hypothetical genes and genes with no known function were removed from the list. After performing the analyses, all categories that represented less than 4% of the total number of genes were eliminated. In addition, redundant terms (e.g. transcriptional regulation and transcription factor activity) and non-informative terms (e.g. multigene family) were also eliminated. Peak Finding—For identification of the ZNF217 binding sites on the ENCODE arrays, we used the Tamalpais program described in Bieda et al. (22Bieda M. Xu X. Singer M. Green R. Farnham P.J. Genome Res. 2006; 16: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and chose the L1 set of high confidence peaks for further analysis. Briefly these binding sites are identified as peaks that have a minimum of six consecutive probes in the top 2% of all probes on the array. Only those peaks that were identified in at least two of three biological replicates were considered to be binding sites. The human 5-kb promoter array consists of a set of two arrays encompassing a total of ∼24,000 human promoters. We refer to the two arrays in the set as “promoter 1” and “promoter 2” arrays. Most promoters encompass ∼5 kb of genomic sequence tiled with a 50-mer probe every ∼100 nt. Given that amplicons were ∼300–500 nt in length, a binding site should be the center of a hill waveform of ∼600–1000 nt in total length for an average of 6–10 probes per binding sites. Given that the probes on the “edges” of the hill will have little amplification, we reasoned that the center four probes (∼400 nt) should be well enriched above background. Hence we assigned a value to each promoter based on the highest mean of four consecutive probes, a procedure we termed “Maxfour.” To calculate these “Maxfour values,” custom software was written in Perl and bash shell. 5M. C. Bieda, L. G. Acevedo, and P. J. Farnham, manuscript in preparation. A small portion of promoters were represented by <4 probes, and hence no Maxfour value was possible; we considered analysis of these promoters to be unreliable, and these promoters were assigned “–100” as a value. Further statistical exploration of this procedure will be presented elsewhere. 5M. C. Bieda, L. G. Acevedo, and P. J. Farnham, manuscript in preparation. Location Analysis of ZNF217 Binding in the Human Genome— Although ZNF217 is predicted to contain eight zinc fingers and thus is thought to be a DNA-binding protein, its role in transcriptional regulation has not been well characterized due to a lack of known target genes. Using the ChIP-chip approach, previous studies have identified target genes of transcription factors in a global and unbiased manner (23Ren B. Robert F. Wyrick J.J. Aparicio O. Jennings E.G. Simon I. Zeitlinger J. Schreiber J. Hannett N. Kanin E. Volkert T.L. Wilson C.J. Bell S.P. Young R.A. Science. 2000; 290: 2306-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, 24Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H.-M. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Commonly used platforms for ChIP-chip are arrays that contain CpG islands (25Heisler L.E. Torti D. Boutros P.C. Watson J. Chan C. Winegarden N. Takahashi M. Yau P. Huang T.H. Farnham P.J. Jurisica I. Woodgett J.R. Bremner R. Penn L.Z. Der S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2952-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), core promoters, or 5–10 kb of upstream promoter sequences (26Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M. Murray H.L. Jenner R.G. Gifford D.K. Melton D.A. Jaenisch R. Young R.A. Cell. 2005; 122: 947-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). However, we did not know whether ZNF217 binds to CpG islands or close to transcription start sites. Therefore, to initiate our studies we first needed to perform an unbiased location analysis of ZNF217 binding. For these ChIP-chip analyses, we used ENCODE oligonucleotide arrays that represent 1% of the human genome and include ∼400 genes and intergenic regions (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to ZNF217, we performed ChIP assays in three different human cancer cell lines: the MCF7 breast cancer line, the SW480 colon cancer line, and the teratocarcinoma cell line Ntera2. Our classification of a peak as a binding site on ENCODE arrays required that the region be bound in at least two of three independent experiments (see Ref. 22Bieda M. Xu X. Singer M. Green R. Farnham P.J. Genome Res. 2006; 16: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Therefore, three biological replicate ChIP samples from each of the three cell lines were hybridized to ENCODE arrays (see supplemental Table S1). After array normalization, the ZNF217 hybridization signals were divided by the total input signals to provide a -fold enrichment value for each 50-bp oligomer on the array. Sites that were bound by ZNF217 were identified with the Tamalpais peaks program (22Bieda M. Xu X. Singer M. Green R. Farnham P.J. Genome Res. 2006; 16: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) at the L1 level (p < 0.0001); this requires that at least six oligos in a row be in the top 2% of all probes on the array. We identified a total of 61 ZNF217 binding sites in SW480 cells, 175 binding sites in MCF7 cells, and 178 binding sites in Ntera2 cells. To determine the location of the binding sites relative to the nearest gene, we used the Gencode Database (27Harrow J. Denoeud F. Frankish A. Reymond A. Chen C.K. Chrast J. Lagarde J. Gilbert J.G. Storey R. Swarbreck D. Rossier C. Ucla C. Hubbard T. Antonarakis S.E. Guigo R. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: S4.1-S4.9Crossref Google Scholar). This analysis identified 44 genes in SW480 cells, 103 genes in MCF7 cells, and 101 genes in Ntera2 cells. We found that a significant percentage of the binding sites (39% in SW480, 41% in MCF7, and 49% in Ntera2) fell within 2 kb upstream or downstream of the transcription start site of the nearest gene, although binding was also observed in the regions greater than 2 kb upstream from the start site as well as within genes and in intergenic regions (Fig. 1A). Although most of the binding sites covered about 500 bp to 1 kb, there was one region on the ENCODE array of more than 150 kb that was bound by ZNF217 in Ntera2 cells (Fig. 1B). Because these experiments are the first to identify genomic binding sites of ZNF217 using ChIP-chip assays, we thought it was important to demonstrate the specificity of the ZNF217 antibody. Therefore, we treated Ntera2 cells with siRNAs to ZNF217 (see Fig. 7 for a Western blot indicating the degree to which ZNF217 protein can be reduced by the siRNA treatment) and then performed ChIP experiments using the ZNF217 antibody in the control versus the knockdown cells. Amplicons prepared from these ChIP samples were hybridized to ENCODE arrays. As shown in Fig. 1B, ZNF217 binding throughout the HOXA gene cluster on chromosome 7 was greatly reduced in the cells treated with siRNAs to ZNF217. Thus, because reduction of ZNF217 RNA reduced the signals obtained in the ChIP assay, we are confident that we are identifying bona fide ZNF217 target genes.FIGURE 7ZNF217 is down-regulated by retinoic acid in Ntera2 cells. Western blot of retinoic acid time course in Ntera2 shows down-regulation of ZNF217 by Day 4 of treatment to the same levels as siZNF217 treatment. OCT4 down-regulation indicates Ntera2 cells are differentiating. A section of the ponceau stain indicates levels of protein loaded in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) De Novo Identification of a Putative ZNF217 Binding Site Motif—The peaks that we identified above represent the first collection of in vivo ZNF217 binding sites. It is not yet known whether ZNF217 is directly bound to the DNA at each of these sites or whether it is recruited to the sites indirectly via interaction with partners such as CtBP. Because CtBP has been shown to bind to numerous DNA-binding proteins, an indirect recruitment mechanism might result in the identification of multiple motifs in the collection of binding sites. To search for common motifs, we used a de novo motifs discovery approach termed ChIPMotifs (28Jin V.X. O'Geen H. Iyengar S. Green R. Farnham P.J. Genome Res. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly the ChIPMotifs approach incorporates a statistical bootstrap resampling method to identify the top motifs detected from a set of ChIP-chip training data using ab initio motif-finding programs such as Weeder (29Pavesi G. Mereghetti P. Mauri G. Pesole G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W199-W203Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and MEME (multiple EM for motif elicitation) (30Bailey T.L. Gribskov M. J. Comput. Biol. 1997; 4: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To obtain a training data set, we first selected the common ZNF217 binding sites identified using the ENCODE arrays from all three cell lines. This provided a set of 53 very high confidence ZNF217 binding regions (each region was identified as a binding site in at least two of three biologically independent experiments in all three of the different cell types). A set of 506 sequences from the ENCODE regions of 500 bp in length that did not bind to ZNF217 was selected as a negative control data set. After applying the ChIPMotifs approach to these training sets, we identified the motif shown in Fig. 2. An 8-base consensus is defined as ATTCCNAC (reverse complement counterpart is GTNGGAAT, Fig. 2A) with a 5-base core consensus as ATTCC (reverse complement counterpart is GGAAT). The score cutoff for this motif positional weight matrix (ZNF217_PWM, Fig. 2B) built from the ChIPMotifs was determined as 1.00 for core score and 0.86 for PWM score with a significant Fisher p value of 0.001 determined by our ChIPMotifs approach. Using these cutoff scores, 47% (25 of 53) of the ZNF217 binding regions included this motif, whereas 81% of the regions in the negative control data set lacked the motif. After finding a motif common to the ZNF217 binding sites of all three cell lines, we wanted to know whether we would identify the same or different motifs if we analyzed the three cell lines individually. An AP1-like motif, ANGAGTCA, was identified in MCF7 cells with a significant p value of 0.009 for the cutoff of 1.0 for core score and 0.86 for PWM score, and a core binding motif, CATTCC, was identified in SW480 cells with a p value of 1.1 × 10–5 for the cutoff of 1.0 for core score and 0.85 for PWM score. The SW480 core sequence is much like the motif identified using the combined data sets. This may be due to the fact that the majority of the 61 binding sites identified in SW480 were included in the 53 common binding sites in the training data set from all three cell lines. Unfortunately we were unable to identify any significant motif using only the Ntera2 binding sites; an E2F core consensus was initially identified by the ab initio programs but failed to pass the significance test using a bootstrap resampling statistical approach. It is likely that the “common motif” was not identified using the Ntera2 set because the common 53 targets were a small portion of the total number of ZNF217 binding sites in Ntera2 cells. A recent study used in vitro casting experiments to identify a 15-base consensus sequence bound by zinc fingers 6 and 7 of ZNF217 (31Cowger J.J. Zhao Q. Isovic M. Torchia J. Oncogene. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Although we could not identify the full consensus site in any of the in vivo ZNF217 binding sites, the core sequence of CAGAAY (where Y is a pyrimidine) was found in 64% of the MCF7, 50% of the Ntera2, and 54% of the SW480 sites identified by ChIP-chip. Identification of ZNF217 Target Genes Using Promoter Arrays—Having shown that ∼40–50% of the ZNF217 binding sites identified using ENCODE arrays localized within 2 kb upstream or downstream of the transcription start site, we felt that the 5-kb NimbleGen promoter arrays would be appropriate for the identification of a large set of ZNF217 target genes. Using this two-array set, the region spanning 4.2 kb upstream to 0.8 kb downstream of the transcription start sites of 24,000 human promoters can be analyzed with each promoter being represented by 50 probes spaced ∼100 bp apart. We next performed ChIP-chip assays using the ZNF217 antibody and two independent cultures of Ntera2 cells (see supplemental Table S1). After array normalization, the ZNF217 hybridization signals were divided by the total input signals to provide a -fold enrichment value for each 50-bp oligomer on the array. To identify binding sites on these promoter arrays, we developed a analysis program (termed “Maxfour”) that ranks each of the promoters based on the highest average intensity value for four consecutive probes (which corresponds to ∼ 400 nt). This ranking system was used for the analysis of all promoter arrays in this study. The Maxfour values from the two independent ZNF217 ChIP-chip experiments for the 14,000 promoters on promoter 1 array (the promoters are present on two different arrays termed promoter 1 and promoter 2 arrays) were aligned to examine the reproducibility of the ChIP assays.

A. 2005; 102: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), the developmental regulation of Eed complex formation and activity remains largely unknown. This study detected dynamic changes in Eed isoform expression, complex composition, and histone modifying activity in the developing central nervous system (CNS) in mice. Specifically, Eed co-immunoprecipitated with EzH2 during CNS development but formed a complex with the trxG protein Mll in adult brain. Mll represents a 3,868-amino acid protein with multiple domains, including AT-hook domains, PhD zinc fingers, and a bromodomain (31Ma Q. Alder H. Nelson K.K. Chatterjee D. Gu Y. Nakamura T. Canaani E. Croce C.M. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6350-6354Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, a C-terminal SET domain methylates H3-K4 in the regulatory regions of transcribed genes (12Milne T.A. Briggs S.D. Brock H.W. Martin M.E. Gibbs D. Allis C.D. Hess J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1107-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Mll has been shown to interact directly with HDAC1 and -2 (32Xia Z.B. Anderson M. Diaz M.O. Zeleznik-Le N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8342-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), providing an additional mechanism for Mll function in chromatin remodeling. In this study, the developmental switch from Eed-EzH2 to Eed-Mll complex formation resulted in stage-specific changes in global histone modification in eed and Mll mutant brains. Furthermore, a distinct physiological role of the Eed-Mll complex in adult brain was evident from the interdependent function of Eed and Mll in the regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Thus, the combined biochemical, genetic, and physiological results demonstrate a novel molecular interface between PcG and trxG function in mouse brain. Mice—l7Rn53354SB represents N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced point mutation allele, which encodes an L290P substitution in the second WD motif of Eed (15Schumacher A. Faust C. Magnuson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although homozygosity for this eed null allele causes lethality at gastrulation, heterozygous animals are viable (20Faust C.

Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4495-4506PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant Mll allele was generated by gene targeting and harbors a lacZ insertion in the third exon, resulting in a truncated protein (33Yu B.D. Hess J.L. Horning S.E. Brown G.A.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Similar to other Mll alleles (34Yagi H. Deguchi K. Aono A. Tani Y. Kishimoto T. Komori T.

Single and double heterozygous brains were dissected at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) from timed mating, as well as at postnatal day 0 (P0) and P28. Adult brain and spleen were isolated from mice at 2–3 months of age. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Brain (E14.5, P0, P28, and adult) and spleen (adult) were sonicated in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 with Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). One to two mg of protein lysate were incubated overnight with αEed antibody coupled to beads (ProFound mammalian co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce)). As a control, brain and spleen lysates were incubated with free beads. Elutions were loaded onto 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for Western blot analysis. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) or ReliaBlot reagent (Bethyl Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with αEed, αEzh2, αMll-N, or αMll-C antibody. Following incubation with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories), (co-)immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL reagent, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Histone Preparation—Bulk histone preparation from P0 brain and adult hippocampus was performed as described (37Levenson J.M. O'Riordan K.J. Brown K.D. Trinh M.A. Molfese D.L. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40545-40559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of histone preparations and transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) was followed by blocking for 2 h at room temperature with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST. Primary incubation with αH4acK5,8,12,16, αH3m3K27, αH3m2K27, αH3m1K27, αH3m2K4, αH3acK14, αH3, or αH4 antibody was completed overnight at 4 °C followed by anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody incubation for 2 h at room temperature. Histone modifications were quantified as described previously (37Levenson J.M. O'Riordan K.J. Brown K.D. Trinh M.A. Molfese D.L. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40545-40559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Levels of histone acetylation and methylation were normalized to the amount of total H3 or H4. Statistical analysis consisted of a one-sample t test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Immunohistochemistry—Dissected P0 and adult brain was fixed in Bouin's fixative and embedded in paraffin for sectioning at 5–7 μm. Immunohistochemistry with αEed, αMll-N, or αMll-C antibodies was performed on mutant and wild-type sections mounted side by side on the same slide to allow for comparison of expression levels between genotypes. Standard streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase detection was performed as described (38Mok H. Mendoza M. Prchal J.T. Balogh P. Schumacher A. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 4871-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The following antibodies were employed: αEed (rabbit polyclonal raised against residues 123–140, custom-generated by Bethyl Laboratories, and rabbit polyclonal from Upstate), αMll-N (mouse monoclonal, Upstate), αMll-C (mouse monoclonal, Upstate), αEzh2 (rabbit polyclonal, Upstate), αH4acK5,8,12,16 (rabbit polyclonal, Upstate), αH3m3K27 (rabbit polyclonal, Upstate), αH3m2K27 (rabbit polyclonal, Upstate), αH3m1K27 (rabbit polyclonal, Upstate), αH3m2K4 (rabbit polyclonal, Upstate), αH3acK14 (rabbit polyclonal, Upstate), αH3 (mouse monoclonal, Upstate), or αH4 (rabbit polyclonal, Upstate). Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from newborn brain or hippocampus from 3-month-old animals with the MELT total nucleic acid isolation system (Ambion). eed and Mll mRNA expression was evaluated by TaqMan One-step RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems) using the 7500 Fast System (Applied Biosystems). The following TaqMan MGB probes were employed: eed (exon junction 2–3, Mm469651_m1; Applied Biosystems), Mll (exon junction 28–29, Mm1179231_m1; Applied Biosystems) and 18 S ribosomal RNA (4326313E; Applied Biosystems) as an endogenous control for each sample. The relative levels of eed and Mll mRNA expression were expressed as a ratio of the gene-specific probe to 18 S rRNA and normalized to a single wild-type ratio set to 1. Hippocampal Slice Electrophysiology—Input/output (I/O) relationships, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and 100-Hz long term potentiation (LTP) utilized 39 mice (n = 10 eed+/+; Mll+/+, 12 eed+/-;Mll+/+, 8 eed+/+;Mll+/-, and 9 eed+/-; Mll+/-). For NMDA input/output and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), three mice for each genotype were tested. Thetaburst LTP analysis employed n = 5 eed+/+;Mll+/+, 6 eed+/-; Mll+/+, 4 eed+/+;Mll+/-, and 5 eed+/-;Mll+/- mice. Dissected brains were immersed in oxygenated (95:5% O2/CO2) ice-cold cutting saline (CS: 110 mm sucrose, 60 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 28 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 7 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 0.6 mm ascorbate) prior to isolation of the caudal portion containing the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Transverse slices (400 μm) were prepared with a Vibratome (The Vibratome Co., St. Louis, MO). During isolation, slices were stored in ice-cold CS. After isolation, cortical tissue was removed, and hippocampal slices were equilibrated in an oxygenated mixture of 50% CS and 50% artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF: 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm glucose) at room temperature for 30 min prior to transfer to the recording chamber. Electrophysiology was performed in an interface chamber (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA). Oxygenated ACSF (30 °C) was perfused into the recording chamber at a rate of 1 ml/min. Electrophysiological traces were digitized and stored using a Digidata 1320A and Clampex software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Extracellular stimuli were administered on the border of area CA3 and CA1 along the Schaffer-collaterals using Teflon-coated bipolar platinum electrodes. fEPSPs were recorded in stratum radiatum with an ACSF-filled glass recording electrode (1–3 megohms). The relationship between fiber volley and fEPSP slopes over various stimulus intensities was used to assess base-line synaptic transmission. All subsequent experimental stimuli were set to an intensity that evoked an fEPSP with a slope of 50% of the maximum fEPSP slope. To assess NMDA receptor (NMDA-R)-dependent synaptic transmission, the ratio of fEPSP slope versus fiber volley slope over a range of intensities was measured in a modified ACSF (same as above except 4 mm CaCl2 and no MgCl2) in the presence of the AMPA-R antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (20 μm). High frequency stimulation LTP was induced by administering two 100-Hz tetani (1 s), with an intertetanus interval of 20 s. Synaptic efficacy was monitored 20 min prior to and 180 min following induction by recording fEPSPs every 20 s (traces were averaged for every 2 min interval). Slices that did not exhibit stable fEPSP slopes during the first 20 min of recording were excluded from the study. Input/output relationships were analyzed using a single exponential function (Y = slopemax × 1 - e-K × X) or linear regression where appropriate. Parameters used to fit I/O relationships were compared across genotypes using an F test. PPF, LTP, and PTP data were analyzed via 2-way ANOVA with repeated measures. For analysis of LTP and PTP, data acquired before and after induction were analyzed separately. Post hoc comparisons after 2-way ANOVA were made using the method of Bonferroni. Total depolarization induced by a 100-Hz tetanus was analyzed by comparing the area under the curve with a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, followed by a post hoc Dunn's multiple comparison test. Significance for all tests was set at p < 0.05. Developmental Regulation of Eed Isoform Expression in Brain—Immunoprecipitation of Eed at various stages of brain development revealed four Eed isoforms of varying abundance in the 50–70-kDa molecular mass range, reminiscent of recent findings in 293 cells (13Kuzmichev A. Jenuwein T. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, E14.5 brain and adult spleen demonstrated a similar pattern of Eed isoforms. At P0 and P28, the co-expression of developmental and adult brain isoforms at similar abundance suggested a gradual transition in Eed isoform expression. Interestingly, the isoforms identified by immunoprecipitation were undetectable in input lanes at both standard (Fig. 1) and maximum loading capacity (data not shown). However, it should be emphasized that two Eed antibodies with different epitopes detected the four Eed isoforms, confirming the specificity of the immunoprecipitation (data not shown). In addition, the Western blot results correlate with the low level of Eed expression demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Expression analysis in eed and Mll mutant mice. A, across all genotypes, immunohistochemistry detected similar levels of Eed expression in P0 brain and adult hippocampus. Nuclear expression of Eed in adult hippocampal pyramidal cells. B, although wild-type and eed+/-;Mll+/+ animals displayed low levels of Mll expression, both eed+/+;Mll+/- and eed+/-;Mll+/- animals exhibited significant Mll up-regulation throughout the P0 brain and adult hippocampus. The antibody employed in this reaction specifically recognized the Mll wild-type protein. Mll displayed nuclear expression in adult hippocampal pyramidal cells across all genotypes. A and B, eed+/-;Mll+/+ hippocampi showed normal hippocampal architecture. In contrast, eed+/+;Mll+/- and eed+/-;Mll+/- mice exhibited a subtle bilayer formation of pyramidal cells in area CA3 (arrowhead)in Mll heterozygotes as well as eed;Mll double heterozygotes. Genotypes are indicated above representative images. Stages and antibodies are denoted to the left and right of the panels, respectively.

EzH2 co-immunoprecipitated with Eed from E14.5 and P0 brain, as well as adult spleen (Fig. 1). In contrast, the two proteins did not co-immunoprecipitate from adult brain. Instead, Eed formed a complex with Mll, as evident from Eed immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis using both N- and C-terminal Mll antibodies (Fig. 1). Similar to the Eed isoform pattern, the transition from the Eed-EzH2 complex in the developing brain to the Eed-Mll complex in adult brain appeared gradual, and both complexes co-existed in P28 brain (Fig. 1). These results implicate Eed isoforms in stage- and tissue-specific recruitment of Eed complex constituents. Unlike in transiently transfected 293T cells (32Xia Z.B. Anderson M. Diaz M.O. Zeleznik-Le N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8342-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the Mll and Bmi1 did not co-immunoprecipitate from adult brain (data not shown). Furthermore, attempts to confirm a possible association of HDACs with Eed-EzH2 and Eed-Mll complexes were inconclusive because of the high affinity of HDAC1 and -2 to agarose beads (data not shown). A Developmental Switch in Global Histone Modification in Brain—The transition from Eed-EzH2 to Eed-Mll complex formation suggested a developmental switch in histone modifying activity from newborn to adult brain. This would be evident from stage-specific aberrations in global histone modification in eed and/or Mll mutant brains. Based on previous studies in other cellular contexts, defects in Eed-Ezh2 interaction would decrease levels of H3-K27 methylation (7Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

We have extended our previous studies to characterize the expression pattern of GRAIL in other murine CD4+ T cell types with a described anergic phenotype. These studies revealed that GRAIL expression is increased in naturally occurring (thymically derived) CD4+ CD25+ T regulatory cells (mRNA levels 10-fold higher than naive CD25– T cells). Further investigation demonstrated that CD25+ Foxp3+ antigen-specific T cells were induced after a “tolerizing-administration” of antigen and that GRAIL expression correlated with the CD25+ Foxp3+ antigen-specific subset. Lastly, using retroviral transduction, we demonstrated that forced expression of GRAIL in a T cell line was sufficient for conversion of these cells to a regulatory phenotype in the absence of detectable Foxp3. These data demonstrate that GRAIL is differentially expressed in naturally occurring and peripherally induced CD25+ T regulatory cells and that the expression of GRAIL is linked to their functional regulatory activity.

CD25+ Tregs have been shown to play a critical role in the prevention of organ-specific autoimmune disease (1Sakaguchi S. Sakaguchi N. Asano M. Itoh M. Toda M. J.

Mutations in the coding region of the transcription factor, Foxp3, result in aberrant development and function of CD25+ Treg cells in mice and humans, implicating Foxp3 as the master genetic regulator of CD25+ Treg cells (2Chatila T.A.

The absence of Foxp3 protein is associated with immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome in the majority of, but not all patients, suggesting that other genes may be important for CD25+ Treg function (5Gavin M.A. Torgerson T.R.

Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that antigen-specific CD25+ Tregs can be induced by antigen exposure in a non-inflammatory context and play an essential role in modulating adaptive immune responses, and clearly defining the similarities and differences between naturally occurring and induced CD25+ Treg cells is a high priority for making inroads into potential therapeutics for multiple disease states (6Thorstenson K.M. Khoruts A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 7Kretschmer K. Apostolou I. Hawiger D. Khazaie K. Nussenzweig M.C. von Boehmer H. Nat.

Characterization of cells with intrinsic anergic properties (termed recessive tolerance) was formally undertaken in the late 1980s after the Schwartz laboratory described a model system in vitro for induction of anergic T cell clones that, following engagement of their T cell receptor, required new protein and mRNA synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 9Schwartz R.H. Mueller D.L. Jenkins M.K. Quill H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 605-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model system has led to numerous studies to identify “anergy factors.” Our published work using this in vitro T cell anergy paradigm demonstrated the expression of a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase GRAIL, in T cell clones under anergy-inducing conditions (10Anandasabapathy N. Ford G. Bloom D. Holness C. Seroogy C. Skrenta H. Hollenhurst M. Fathman C.G. Soares L. Immunity. 2003; 18: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The development of immune unresponsiveness in vivo to neoantigens predates the development of the in vitro T cell clone model by over 20 years (11Dresser D.W. Nature. 1961; 191: 1169-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An intriguing observation in the early 1970s suggested that there is development de novo of a suppressor population when neoantigen is presented in a non-inflammatory context. Our recent published work demonstrated a correlation between CD4+ T cell anergy in vitro and in vivo and GRAIL expression (12Seroogy C.M. Soares L. Ranheim E.A. Su L. Holness C. Bloom D. Fathman C.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that is complemented by studies from Heissmeyer et al. (13Heissmeyer V. Macian F. Im S.H. Varma R. Feske S. Venuprasad K. Gu H. Liu Y.C. Dustin M.L. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These findings, coupled with several recent reports demonstrating an induction of CD25+ Treg cells in vivo after antigen presentation to naive CD4+ T cells in a tolerizing fashion, led us to pursue the role of GRAIL- and antigen-induced tolerance in vivo (6Thorstenson K.M. Khoruts A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 7Kretschmer K. Apostolou I. Hawiger D. Khazaie K. Nussenzweig M.C. von Boehmer H. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 8Apostolou I. Von Boehmer H. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1401-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated the mRNA and protein levels of GRAIL in naturally occurring and induced CD25+ Treg cells. We demonstrated that both naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells and antigen-specific CD25+ Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells induced in vivo after receiving antigen in a tolerizing fashion express GRAIL as a bulk population. Furthermore, retroviral-mediated forced expression of GRAIL in an antigen-specific CD4+ T cell line was sufficient for conversion of the transduced cells to a suppressor cell phenotype. These data suggest that GRAIL, along with and separable from Foxp3, might be involved in differentiation and biological function of CD4+ T cells into a regulatory phenotype. Animals and Adoptive Transfer—BALB/c mice were obtained from Harlan-Sprague (Madison, WI). DO11.10 and DO11.10 Rag2–/– mice (14Murphy K.M. Heimberger A.B. Loh D.Y. Science. 1990; 250: 1720-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar) were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of Wisconsin animal facility (Madison, WI). Foxp3-IRES-GFP knock-in mice were a generous gift from Dr. Talal Chatila (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). The Animal Care Committee at the University of Wisconsin approved all experimental protocols involving the use of mice. The adoptive transfer of DO11.10 (DO11) T cells into BALB/c mice and subsequent immunization followed a previously described protocol (12Seroogy C.M. Soares L. Ranheim E.A. Su L. Holness C. Bloom D. Fathman C.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Single cell suspensions were stained using the following antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol: KJ1.26 PE (Caltag, Burlingame, CA); CD4 Cy7APC (RM-5), Foxp3 PE (FJK-165) (both from eBioscience, San Diego, CA); CD25 APC (PC61), CTLA4 PE (UC10-4B9), CD103 PE (M290) (all from Pharmingen); GITR PE (FAB5241P, R+D, Minneapolis, MN). Acquisition was done on a LSR II (BD Biosciences), and sorting was done on a Vantage SE equipped with a FACS-DiVa digital upgrade. Analysis was done using FlowJo software (Treestar, San Carlos, CA). Cells—An OVA323–339-specific T cell line was derived from a DO11 T cell receptor transgenic mouse by serially stimulating the cells with 0.4 μg/ml OVA323–339 peptide and irradiated APCs from a BALB/c mouse every 8–14 days in supplemented RPMI 1640 as described previously (12Seroogy C.M. Soares L. Ranheim E.A. Su L. Holness C. Bloom D. Fathman C.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Retrovirus Production and T cell Transduction—Ecotropic retrovirus was produced using Phoenix-E cells and a modified CaPO4 precipitation transfection protocol as described previously (15Costa G.L. Benson J.M. Seroogy C.M. Achacoso P. Fathman C.G. Nolan G.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3581-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The DO11.10 T cell line was transduced 24 h after stimulation by spin-fection with virus supernatant containing 5 μg/ml Polybrene and 10 units/ml murine IL-2 as described previously (16Oh J.W. Seroogy C.M. Meyer E.H. Akbari O. Berry G. Fathman C.G. Dekruyff R.H. Umetsu D.T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 110: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Suppressor Assays—DO11 Rag2–/– donors were used for isolation of OVA323–339-specific naive CD4 T cells by flow cytometry. For the bead suppressor assay, 5 μm latex beads (Interfacial Dynamics) were coated with 2.5 μg/ml anti-CD3 (145–2C11, Pharmingen) and 1.25 μg/ml or 3.75 μg/ml anti-CD28 (37.51, Pharmingen) as described previously (17Ermann J. Szanya V. Ford G.S. Paragas V. Fathman C.G. Lejon K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4271-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells and beads were co-cultured at a ratio of 1:1 in U-bottom 96-well microtiter plates. Cells were pulsed at 72 h for 12–16 h with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine. For the peptide activation suppressor assays, cells were cultured in a 96-well flat bottom microtiter plate with 0.4 μg/ml OVA323–339 and irradiated BALB/c splenocytes at a concentration of 3 × 105/well. Cells were pulsed at 72 h for 12–16 h with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine. The percentage of suppression versus DO11 parent cell line was calculated by the following equation: 100–(mean cpm GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cells co-cultured with naive CD25– DO11 T cells/cpm DO11 parent T cells co-cultured with naive CD25– DO11 T cells × 100). For the transwell assay, 50,000 naive DO11 Rag2–/–cells were co-cultured with an equal number of DO11 T cells or GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cells either together or apart in a transwell plate (CoStar 3413) and stimulated with 0.4 μg/ml OVA323–339 and 5 × 105 irradiated BALB/c splenocytes. After 72 h, triplicate aliquots were removed and pulsed with [3H]thymidine for an additional 12–16 h. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Cell culture supernatants from transduced or control DO11 T cells were collected after activation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated beads and analyzed for the presence of TGF-β using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). To measure total TGF-β in the sample, 200-μl aliquots of sample were acid-treated with 2 μl of 1 n HCl for 15 min and then neutralized with an equal volume of 1 n NaOH. IFN-γ and IL-10 were assayed as reported previously (10Anandasabapathy N. Ford G. Bloom D. Holness C. Seroogy C. Skrenta H. Hollenhurst M. Fathman C.G. Soares L. Immunity. 2003; 18: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Immunoblot—CD4+ CD25+ T cells were selected using magnetic MicroBeads according to the manufacturer's instructions from DO11 mice (Miltenyi). Cells were stained with CD25-PE in a saturating concentration followed by several washes and then incubated with anti-PE magnetic MicroBeads. CD25-bearing cells were isolated using a QuadraMacs, and purity was confirmed by flow cytometry (>92% CD4+ CD25+). Protein was extracted, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride as described previously (18Soares L. Seroogy C. Skrenta H. Anandasabapathy N. Lovelace P. Chung C.D. Engleman E. Fathman C.G. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The membrane was probed with a rabbit anti-GRAIL-specific polyclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal portion of murine GRAIL (18Soares L. Seroogy C. Skrenta H. Anandasabapathy N. Lovelace P. Chung C.D. Engleman E. Fathman C.G. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-Foxp3 (eBioscience; FJK-16s) and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam; polyclonal) as a loading control. Antibody binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and the ECL+ Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were detected on Kodak BioMax Light film (GE Healthcare). Jurkat cells transduced with murine GRAIL were used as a positive control. Real-time Quantitative PCR (QPCR)—RNA from sorted cell populations was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion). cDNA was made using an iSCRIPT kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Real-time QPCR triplicate samples were run with SYBR green on an iCycler (Bio-Rad) using the following primer pairs: murine GRAIL primers, forward, 5′-GCGCAGTCAGCAAATGAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGTCAACATGGGGAACAACA-3′; and murine Foxp3 primers, forward, 5′-CACCTATGCCACCCTTATCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGAACATGCGAGTAAACCAA-3′. For normalization, the cyclophilin gene was used. Cyclophilin primers are as follows: forward, 5′-GCGTCTCCTTCGAGCTGT-3′, and reverse, 5′ GGAACCCTTATAGCCAAATCC-3′. Liver cDNA (GRAIL and cyclophilin) and T cells transduced with murine Foxp3 cDNA were used to generate standard curve for quantitation of transcript and gauge of reaction efficiency. Confocal Microscopy—Lymph nodes from FoxP3 GFP knock-in mice were isolated, and single cell suspensions were prepared. CD25+ cells were bead-purified using biotinylated anti-CD25 (PC61) and streptavidin MicroBeads (Milteyi Biotec). Following isolation, cells were allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were the fixed in 3% formalin, quenched with 0.15 m glycine, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated in blocking buffer (5% goat serum with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min at room temperature followed by rabbit anti-GRAIL primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature and then washed extensively. Finally, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature and washed extensively, nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen), and coverslips were mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen) on glass slides and imaged with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope and LaserSharp 5.2 software (W.M. Keck Laboratory for Biological Imaging, University of Wisconsin). GRAIL mRNA Is Increased in Naturally Occurring CD25+ T Regulatory Cells—We have previously reported that GRAIL is expressed in anergic CD4+ T cells using in vitro and in vivo model systems (10Anandasabapathy N. Ford G. Bloom D. Holness C. Seroogy C. Skrenta H. Hollenhurst M. Fathman C.G. Soares L. Immunity. 2003; 18: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 12Seroogy C.M. Soares L. Ranheim E.A. Su L. Holness C. Bloom D. Fathman C.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GRAIL function was found to be a necessary requirement for the induction of an anergic phenotype in CD4+ T cells in vivo (12Seroogy C.M. Soares L. Ranheim E.A. Su L. Holness C. Bloom D. Fathman C.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To expand on these observations, we began to study the expression profile of GRAIL in other anergic CD4+ T cells. During this survey, we found that both GRAIL mRNA and protein are expressed in naturally occurring CD25+ Tregs. At the RNA level, GRAIL expression was 10-fold higher in the CD25+ population than the CD25– naive CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1A). Using a GRAIL-specific polyclonal antibody, we were able to demonstrate at the protein level that GRAIL was preferentially expressed in the CD25+ Treg subset of lymphocytes, thus corroborating the mRNA data (Fig. 1B). To further solidify that GRAIL and Foxp3 are expressed in the same cell, confocal microscopy was utilized. We took advantage of transgenic mice that had GFP knocked-in to the 3′-untranslated region of the Foxp3 locus that allows GFP as a surrogate marker of Foxp3 protein expression. Staining of the CD25+ T cells from these mice with the GRAIL polyclonal antibody revealed dual expression of Foxp3 and GRAIL within the same cell (Fig. 1C). The cellular localization of GRAIL is as previously demonstrated or predicted; GRAIL, which is resident in endosomes, is present in the cytoplasm in a vesicular pattern. These data suggested that GRAIL, in addition to Foxp3, is differentially expressed in CD25+ Treg cells and may be involved in CD25+ Treg function or differentiation. GRAIL Expression Segregates with the CD25+, Foxp3-expressing Antigen-specific Tolerized Cells in Vivo—We have previously shown that GRAIL is expressed in antigen-specific anergic T cells induced following antigen administration in a tolerizing fashion in vivo (12Seroogy C.M. Soares L. Ranheim E.A. Su L. Holness C. Bloom D. Fathman C.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and in this study, we have demonstrated that GRAIL is expressed in naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells (Fig. 1). There is accumulating evidence demonstrating that CD25+ antigen-specific Treg cells can be induced from naive CD4+ CD25– T cells following oral or intravenous administration of antigen under non-inflammatory conditions similar to the methodology used in the adoptive transfer tolerance model of our previous studies that demonstrated that GRAIL was necessary for the development of the CD4+ T cell anergic phenotype in vivo (6Thorstenson K.M. Khoruts A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To determine whether GRAIL (and Foxp3) expression in antigen-specific anergic T cells segregated with CD25 expression, we used the in vivo adoptive transfer model described previously to explore CD25 and GRAIL expression (12Seroogy C.M. Soares L. Ranheim E.A. Su L. Holness C. Bloom D. Fathman C.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In our experiments, CD25+ antigen-specific CD4+ T cells were induced and detected by flow cytometry on day 12 after administering antigen in a tolerizing fashion (Fig. 2A). Transfer of DO11 naive T cells from either a Rag2–/– or a non-Rag background and antigen challenge demonstrated comparable up-regulation of CD25 expression (Fig. 2A). Since T cell receptor transgenic T cells from mice on a Rag2–/– background lack naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells, we concluded that this population of CD4+ CD25+ T cells was induced by antigen under non-inflammatory conditions. These data are consistent with the published work by Thorstenson et al. (6Thorstenson K.M. Khoruts A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), with CD25+ antigen-specific cells appearing between days 3 and 8 after administering antigen in a tolerizing immunization. We carried our studies out longer and found that the CD25+ antigen-specific CD4+ T cells persisted at least 70 days after administration of antigen in a tolerizing fashion (data not shown), which is consistent with data suggesting that CD25+ Treg cells do not require persistence of antigen for survival (8Apostolou I. Von Boehmer H. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1401-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). To characterize the association of GRAIL and CD25 expression, the KJ1.26+CD4+ cells were sorted 12 days after the tolerizing regimen into CD25+ or CD25– subsets. Quantification of GRAIL by real-time QPCR revealed that GRAIL was expressed only in the CD25+-expressing tolerized T cell subset (Fig. 2B). To date, the best genetic marker for CD25+Treg cells is Foxp3, and we assayed for this gene as a correlate for induced CD25+ Treg cells (19Khattri R. Cox T. Yasayko S.A. Ramsdell F. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (2394) Google Scholar, 20Fontenot J.D. Gavin M.A. Rudensky A.Y. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (6146) Google Scholar). Gene expression analysis, by real-time QPCR (Fig. 2C), and flow cytometry for protein expression (Fig. 2D) revealed that Foxp3 also was expressed only in the CD25+ subset, strongly suggesting that this population represents induced CD25+ Treg cells. Forced Expression of GRAIL in a T Cell Line Is Sufficient for Conversion to a Suppressor Phenotype in a Contact-dependent Manner—As a first step to studying the role of GRAIL in the suppressor cell phenotype, we enforced GRAIL overexpression in an OVA-specific CD4+ T cell line by retroviral transduction. Maintenance of this cell line in vitro required frequent supplementation of the culture media with IL-2 in addition to serial stimulation with antigen + APC (OVA323–339 peptide), similar to the requirements necessary for the maintenance of Foxp3-transduced T cells (20Fontenot J.D. Gavin M.A. Rudensky A.Y. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (6146) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cell line (DO11 GRAIL) demonstrated diminished proliferative capacity in response to antigen + APC when compared with the retrovirally transduced parent cell line expressing the marker protein alone, GFP (DO11 GFP) or non-transduced DO11 T cells (Fig. 3A: cells alone; the non-transduced parent cell line was phenotypically comparable with DO11 GFP; data not shown). Co-cultivation of the GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cell line and naive CD25– CD4+ T cells from a DO11.10 Rag 2–/– mice with the APC + OVA323–339 peptide demonstrated suppression of the naive responder cells (∼50% response when compared with responder naive cells alone and 90% reduction when compared with co-cultivation with DO11 GFP cells, Fig. 3A). The suppressor capacity of the GRAIL-expressing T cell line was compared with that of naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells from DO11 mice using a previously described anti-CD3/anti-CD28-conjugated bead suppression system (17Ermann J. Szanya V. Ford G.S. Paragas V. Fathman C.G. Lejon K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4271-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The GRAIL-expressing T cell line suppressed naive CD25– CD4+ T cell proliferation as well or better than the naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells when co-cultured at a 1:1 ratio in this system (Fig. 3B). Consistent with previous data, stronger co-stimulation (the addition of IL-2 or higher CD28 density on the beads) partially restored the proliferative response of naive CD4+ CD25– T cells (Fig. 3B, last two experimental groups). The addition of IL-2 resulted in a 19-fold increase in the proliferative response in cells co-cultured with naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells when compared with a 4-fold increase in the cultures containing the GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cell line. Increasing amounts of anti-CD28 resulted in a 13.6-fold increase in the proliferative response in the co-culture system when naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells were used as suppressor cells when compared with a 6-fold increase when using the GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cell line as suppressors. We attribute the disparity in restoration of the naive T cells proliferative capacity between naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells and GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cell line to superphysiologic expression of GRAIL based on real-time QPCR data (data not shown). The suppressive effect mediated by GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cells was titratable demonstrated by decreased suppression of naive CD25– CD4+ T cells at lower suppressor:naive cell ratios (Fig. 3C). We assessed the role of cell contact for suppression in the GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cells using a transwell system. This demonstrated that suppression was 4-fold greater if the cells were in contact when compared with separation by a permeable membrane (Fig. 3D). GRAIL-expressing DO11 T Cells Express Increased Levels of TGF-β, Surface CD25, GITR, and Total CTLA-4, and Biological Suppressor Function Is Separate from Foxp3 Expression in Vitro—To explore the potential mechanism for suppressor function of the GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cells, surface receptor expression and cytokine production was analyzed for various proteins that have been suggested to be important for suppressor function of naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells (21Takahashi T. Tagami T. Yamazaki S. Uede T. Shimizu J. Sakaguchi N. Mak T.W. Sakaguchi S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar, 22Nakamura K. Kitani A. Fuss I. Pedersen A. Harada N. Nawata H. Strober W. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Analysis of IL-10 production demonstrated detectable levels produced by the parent cell line, and interestingly, undetectable levels in the supernatant from activated GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cells (Fig. 4A). Published analysis of naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells and T cells ectopically expressing Foxp3 have increased levels of IL-10 (20Fontenot J.D. Gavin M.A. Rudensky A.Y. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (6146) Google Scholar); however, our data suggest that the suppressive mechanism in the GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cells did not involve IL-10. Although the parent T cell line produces considerable amounts of IFN-γ, we found that the levels of IFN-γ in the culture supernatant were consistently higher in the GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cell line (Fig. 4A). A recent report by Stock et al. (23Stock P. Akbari O. Berry G. Freeman G.J. Dekruyff R.H. Umetsu D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) has described the development of a suppressor T cell that expresses Foxp3 and IFN-γ, providing evidence that IFN-γ does not interfere with suppressor function. The cytokine that has most consistently been associated with suppressor T cells is TGF-β. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of the supernatant from GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cells demonstrated significantly increased levels of TGF-β when compared with the parent DO11 T cell line (Fig. 4A). Flow cytometric analysis of known markers of CD25+ Treg cells revealed an expression profile similar to naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells and Foxp3-expressing T cells, with the exception of CD103 (23Stock P. Akbari O. Berry G. Freeman G.J. Dekruyff R.H. Umetsu D.T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The GRAIL-expressing T cells had elevated levels of surface CD25, GITR, and total CTLA-4 (Fig. 4B). We assayed our GRAIL-expressing T cell line for Foxp3 protein by flow cytometry and found no detectable Foxp3 protein (Fig. 4C). Likewise, we assayed a Foxp3-expressing DO11 T cell line (retroviral expression vector kindly provided by Dr. A. Rudensky) for GRAIL mRNA by real-time QPCR and found no up-regulation of GRAIL mRNA in these cells despite demonstrable suppressor activity as previously published (data not shown). These data suggest that either GRAIL or Foxp3 expression by itself is sufficient but not necessary for regulatory T cell function in vitro. The functional outcome of naive CD4+ T cells following engagement with antigen in a non-inflammatory environment in vivo has been thought to follow one of several pathways in peripheral lymphoid tissues. In general, this engagement was thought to result in clonal ignorance, apoptosis, or anergy. The anergic phenotype has in general referred to a form of tolerance indicating a cell-intrinsic defect in lack of responsiveness, particularly for neoantigens. Accumulating evidence has suggested that these cells require persistence of antigen to maintain this form of induced tolerance, and in the absence of antigen, this phenotype is reversible (24Tanchot C. Barber D.L. Chiodetti L. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2030-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Pape K.A. Merica R. Mondino A. Khoruts A. Jenkins M.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4719-4729PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies have begun to suggest that exposure to antigen in a non-inflammatory milieu in vivo can lead to the induction of CD25+ Treg cells extrathymically from naive, conventional CD4+ T cells (6Thorstenson K.M. Khoruts A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 7Kretschmer K. Apostolou I. Hawiger D. Khazaie K. Nussenzweig M.C. von Boehmer H. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 8Apostolou I. Von Boehmer H. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1401-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The study from Thorstenson et al. (6Thorstenson K.M. Khoruts A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) reported the induction of CD4+ CD25+ antigen-specific T cells when low dose antigen was delivered in a non-inflammatory context. The functional characteristics of these cells in vitro implicated suppressor capabilities (6Thorstenson K.M. Khoruts A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Our findings support the hypothesis that the anergic phenotype seen in CD4+ T cells in vivo in response to a neoantigen challenge under non-inflammatory conditions is due to the acquisition of a suppressor phenotype by the antigen-activated anergic CD4+ T cells. This is based upon the induction of Foxp3 expression in the antigen-reactive T cells as well as their ability to be used in functional suppressor assays as regulatory T cells. Interestingly, the anergy-related E3 ubiquitin ligase, GRAIL, also segregates with these CD25+ antigen-specific regulatory T cells. Thus, in addition to Foxp3, GRAIL may be another gene product involved in CD25+ Treg cell function, and by itself (and separable from Foxp3), it seems to be sufficient to convey regulatory function to T cells that over express GRAIL. Our study complements and expands upon the observation by Thorstenson et al. (6Thorstenson K.M. Khoruts A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) by demonstrating that these induced CD25+ Treg cells are long-lived and express genotypic markers of naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells, namely Foxp3 and GRAIL. In our experiments, low dose (5 μg/animal) or high dose (300 μg/animal) antigen did not result in a large disparity in numbers of CD4+ CD25+ antigen-specific T cells between the groups. 3C. Seroogy, unpublished data. We cannot reconcile these data with the antigen dose-response Treg cell induction published by Thorstenson et al. (6Thorstenson K.M. Khoruts A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) with low dose favoring induction of CD4+ CD25+ antigen-specific cells, but among potential explanations could be that they might have been using a peptide that had some lipopolysaccharide contamination or perhaps was more aggregated, thus making it more immunogenic. Nonetheless, the observation that non-inflammatory exposure to antigen can result in long-lived suppressor T cells may have tremendous therapeutic potential. A better understanding of the conditions that favor this outcome could be exploited for treatment of multiple disease states that result from inappropriate and unregulated adaptive immune responses. Interestingly, we have consistently observed that the GRAIL mRNA levels were 100-fold higher in the induced CD25+-expressing population when compared with the naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cell population (Fig. 1A versus Fig. 2B). This suggests that GRAIL may be up-regulated in activated CD25+ Treg cells, or alternatively, that GRAIL is differentially expressed between naturally occurring and induced CD25+ Treg cells. This observation is in contrast to that of Foxp3 expression that does not appear to be differentially regulated with the activation status of CD25+ Treg cells (26Khattri R. Kasprowicz D. Cox T. Mortrud M. Appleby M.W. Brunkow M.E. Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6312-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is also possible that GRAIL is differentially regulated between naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells and induced CD25+ Treg cells, an intriguing possibility since very little is known about the genotypic and functional differences between these important T cell subsets. Studies are ongoing in our laboratory to further define the expression kinetics of GRAIL after CD25+ Treg cell activation and more formal characterization of the differences and similarities between naturally occurring and induced CD25+ Treg cells. The suppressor characteristics of GRAIL-expressing DO11 T cells share similarities with previously described features of naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells and T cells with enforced expression of Foxp3 in that the effect is titratable and suppression is maximal when cell contact is maintained. Moreover, cytokine and surface receptor expression appear to overlap, with all of these cells sharing the expression of CTLA-4, CD25, and GITR as well as increased production of TGF-β. Much emphasis has been placed on the role of TGF-β and CTLA-4 in the suppressor function of CD25+ Treg cells. Currently, controversy still exists, and neither of these proteins has been definitively demonstrated to be essential for suppressor function (27Tang Q. Boden E.K. Henriksen K.J. Bour-Jordan H. Bi M. Bluestone J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2996-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Work is in progress to identify the mechanism(s) of action through which GRAIL mediates its suppressor activity. Our attempts at blocking TGF-β have not relieved the suppressor activity and are consistent with published observations with naturally occurring CD25+ Treg cells (27Tang Q. Boden E.K. Henriksen K.J. Bour-Jordan H. Bi M. Bluestone J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2996-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 28Piccirillo C.A. Letterio J.J. Thornton A.M. McHugh R.S. Mamura M. Mizuhara H. Shevach E.M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that TGF-β is important for homeostasis of CD25+ Treg cells and maintenance of Foxp3 expression in vivo and that the source of TGF-β does not necessarily need to be cell-intrinsic (29Marie J.C. Letterio J.J. Gavin M. Rudensky A.Y. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). It is curious that exogenous exposure of naive CD25– T cells to TGF-β in vitro has been demonstrated to convert these cells to CD25+ Treg cells based on functional characteristics and up-regulation of Foxp3. One potential explanation for the lack of up-regulation of Foxp3 in our TGF-β-expressing GRAIL T cells may be a dose-response effect or perhaps a difference related to naive cells versus previously activated T cells, the latter being used as our GRAIL-transduced T cells. It remains to be seen whether the exposure of naive CD25– T cells to TGF-β at the time of initial activation results in up-regulation of GRAIL in addition to Foxp3. In conclusion, these observations will allow for future mechanistic studies further elucidating the role of GRAIL in CD25+ Treg cell function, its relationship to Foxp3, and strategies to specifically up-regulate or stabilize GRAIL protein as a therapeutic modality in human disease.

Previously, we have demonstrated that DCP stimulates cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines through Met-Janus kinase 1 signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway. In the present study, we demonstrated that DCP induces both cell proliferation and migration in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. DCP was found to bind with the kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), alternatively referred to as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. Furthermore, DCP induced autophosphorylation of KDR and its downstream effector phospholipase C-γ and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). To support these results, we showed that DCP-induced cell proliferation and cell migration were inhibited by KDR short interfering RNA, KDR kinase inhibitor, or MAPK inhibitor. In conclusion, these results indicate that DCP is a novel type of vascular endothelial growth factor that possesses potent mitogenic and migrative activities.

J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 225-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HCC is known as a highly malignant disease with a poor prognosis (2Mise K. Tashiro S. Yogita S. Wada D. Harada M. Fukuda Y. Miyake H. Isikawa M. Izumi K. Sano N. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1475-1482PubMed Google Scholar). Current treatments include surgical resection, liver transplantation, and local ablation therapy, which are effective only in localized tumors (3Mulcahy M.F. Curr. Treat. Options Oncol. 2005; 6: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). There is no effective therapy for patients with advanced HCC. Therefore, there is an urgency to identify a therapy to control tumor progression of HCC. As HCC is generally a highly vascular tumor, the progression of HCC is greatly related to active neovascularization (4Park Y.N. Kim Y.B. Yang K.M. Park C. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2000; 124: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Terada T. Nakanuma Y. Histopathology. 1995; 27: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Roncalli M. Roz E. Coggi G. Di Rocco M.G.

Evidence of the vital role of tumor angiogenesis in the progression and metastasis of HCC has been identified (8Sugimachi K. Tanaka S. Terashi T. Taguchi K. Rikimaru T. Surgery. 2002; 131: S135-S141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). New strategies have been pursued to inhibit neovascularization or to destroy existing tumor vessels, including direct targeting of endothelial cells and indirect targeting by inhibiting the release of proangiogenic growth factors by cancer or stromal cells in current treatments for miscellaneous cancers other than HCC (9Jain R.K. Duda D.G. Clark J.W. Loeffler J.S. Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 2006; 3: 24-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). However, there are limited data referring to the role of various angiogenic and angiostatic factors in HCC development (10Miura H. Miyazaki T. Kuroda M. Oka T. Machinami R. Kodama T. Shibuya M.

Angiogenesis is regulated by a complex process of multiple, sequential, and interdependent steps (13Fidler I.J. Ellis L.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 185-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) that are known to be regulated by some soluble angiogenic factors secreted from the tumor cells, vascular endothelial cells, and infiltrating cells. In the first step, vascular endothelial cells begin to migrate and accumulate in the region where the angiogenic factors are produced (14Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar). Among the angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a major role as it robustly stimulates proliferation, migration, and morphogenesis of vascular endothelial cells (15Millauer B.

Sakiyama-Elbert S.E. Hubbell J.A. J. Controlled Release. 2001; 72: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). It has been reported that VEGF expression is up-regulated in HCC (20Mise M. Arii S. Higashituji H. Furutani M. Niwano M. Harada T. Ishigami S. Toda Y. Nakayama H. Fukumoto M. Fujita J. Imamura M. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and that VEGF expression is correlated with tumor angiogenesis of HCC (4Park Y.N. Kim Y.B. Yang K.M. Park C. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2000; 124: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Others reported that serum VEGF can be a prognostic marker for HCC (21Poon R.T. Fan S.T. Wong J. J. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 19: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). However, Van Belle et al. (22Van Belle E. Witzenbichler B. Chen D. Silver M. Chang L. Schwall R. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) showed that when submaximal concentrations of VEGF and hepatocyte growth factor are used individually, there is no significant effect on endothelial cell proliferation and migration. This result implies that other growth factors may be involved in HCC-related angiogenesis. Autocrine signaling could be another mechanism that contributes to the tumor progression of HCC. We previously reported that des-γ-carboxyl prothrombin (DCP) is an autologous growth factor for HCC (23Suzuki M. Shiraha H. Fujikawa T. Takaoka N. Ueda N. Nakanishi Y. Koike K. Takaki A. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6409-6415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). DCP is a well recognized tumor marker that is a prothrombin (PT) precursor with no coagulation activity. The prothrombin precursor has 10 glutamic acid (Glu) residues in the N terminus that are converted into γ-carboxyl-glutamic acid (Gla) residues by vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase. All of these Glu residues need to be converted into Gla residues before PT can obtain coagulation activity. In DCP, not all of the 10 Gla residues are transformed; some remain as Glu residues (24Uehara S. Gotoh K. Handa H. Honjo K. Hirayama A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1999; 289: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Many studies consider DCP as a prognostic indicator of HCC (25Suehiro T. Matsumata T. Itasaka H. Taketomi A. Yamamoto K.

Cancer. 2001; 91: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Moreover, tumor arterial vascularity has indicated a strong correlation with the expression of both serum and tissue DCP (31Tamano M. Sugaya H. Oguma M. Iijima M. Yoneda M. Murohisa T. Kojima K. Kuniyoshi T. Majima Y. Hashimoto T. Terano A. Hepatol. Res. 2002; 22: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our previous study demonstrated that DCP stimulates cell proliferation of the HCC cell line and that Met-Janus kinase (JAK) 1 signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 signaling pathway is considered to be a major signaling pathway for its biological effect. As DCP is secreted from HCC cells, DCP might work as a paracrine interaction factor between HCC cells and vascular endothelial cells. Hence, we assessed the effect of DCP on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and migration as part of the process of angiogenesis. The transductional apparatus of DCP was identified to activate the phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) MAPK signaling pathway via activation of the kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), also known as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. These findings provide a description of a novel paracrine mechanism that is involved in HCC development. Cell Culture—HUVEC was obtained from Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and cultured in endothelial basal medium 2 (EGM™-2) (Sanko Junyaku) supplemented with EGM™-2 SingleQuo™ containing 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, hydrocortisone, human basic fibroblast growth factor, VEGF, R3-insulin-like growth factor 1, ascorbic acid, heparin, human epidermal growth factor, gentamicin, and amphotericin-B (Sanko Junyaku). DCP was purified from the DCP-producing HCC cell line PLC/PRF/5 as described previously (23Suzuki M. Shiraha H. Fujikawa T. Takaoka N. Ueda N. Nakanishi Y. Koike K. Takaki A. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6409-6415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were quiesced at subconfluence in serum-free conditions for 24 h before the experiment. Cell Proliferation Assay—DNA synthesis was estimated by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. Cells were grown in 12-well tissue culture plastic dishes. After 24 h of quiescence, cells were treated with DCP, PT (Sigma), VEGF165 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), if required, at the indicated concentrations for 18 h. [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) was added during the last 6 h of the 18-h treatment period. Cells were treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C and harvested, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Cell Migration Assay—Cells were grown until confluent in 6-well tissue culture plastic dishes. After 24 h of quiescence, experimental wounds were made by dragging a rubber Policeman™ (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) across the cell culture. The cultures were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and placed in fresh quiescent medium. Cells were treated with DCP, PT, and VEGF, if required, at the indicated concentrations at 37 °C. Three wounds were sampled for each specimen. Photographs were taken at 0 and 24 h, and the relative distance traveled by the cells at the acellular front was determined. Morphological Observation—Cells were plated in 2 ml in 6-well tissue culture plastic dishes with quiescent medium at the concentration of 105 cells/ml. After 24 h of quiescence, cells were treated with DCP (20 ng/ml), PT (20 ng/ml), or VEGF (10.6 ng/ml) for another 24 h. Morphological observations were performed under phase-contrast microscope. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were plated into 6-well tissue culture plastic dishes and grown to subconfluence. After 24 h of quiescence, cells were treated with DCP, PT, hepatocyte growth factor (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and VEGF, if required, at the indicated concentrations for 5 min, 15 min, and/or 6 h at 37°C. Cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 150 μl of sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, 1% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol). The samples were resolved using SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with anti-phospho-Met (Tyr-1234/1235) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-phospho-Met (Tyr-1349) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-JAK 1 (Tyr-1022/1023) (Sigma), anti-phospho-STAT 3 (Tyr-704) (Sigma), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/204) (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-phospho-PLC-γ-1 (Tyr-771) (Upstate Cell Signaling, Lake Placid, NY) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBS-T) buffer (Sigma), probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and developed with an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using enhanced chemiluminescence. Antibody Array Analysis—Cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm tissue culture plastic dishes, quiesced for 24 h, and stimulated with DCP (20 ng/ml), PT (20 ng/ml), or VEGF (10.6 ng/ml), if required, for 15 min. Human phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array kit (Proteome Profiler™ Array, Human Phospho-RTK Array kit) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was validated by profiling the tyrosine phosphorylation in HUVEC treated with DCP, PT, and VEGF. Conditioning of the membranes and hybridization were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The signal was detected and quantified using a LumiImager F1 (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were plated and grown to confluence in 10-cm tissue culture plastic dishes and treated with DCP, PT, and VEGF, if required, at the indicated concentrations for 15 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates containing the same amount of proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-KDR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunocomplexes were captured with protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) and washed four times with 20 nm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium vanadate. Precipitates were analyzed with 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-DCP antibody (Eisai Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody (R&D Systems). Inhibitors of KDR-PLC-γ-MAPK Signaling Pathway—Function-blocking KDR kinase inhibitor V ZM323881 (Calbiochem) and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) were utilized for the function-blocking assay against KDR-PLC-γ-MAPK signaling. The cells were treated with function-blocking ZM323881 (2 nm) or PD98059 (4 μm) with DCP stimulation. Gene Silencing with Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNA duplexes targeting KDR sequences were obtained from Dharmacon SMART pool technology™ (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO). Control (lamin A/C) siRNA duplex was obtained from Dharmacon. siRNAs were transfected into cells using RNAiFect™ transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were incubated for 12 h before the analysis. The interferences of KDR protein expression were confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-KDR antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) (data not shown). Cell proliferation and cell migration assays were also performed as described above. DCP Stimulates Cell Proliferation in HUVEC—To investigate the mitogenic effect of DCP, we utilized the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA as the index of proliferation. As shown in Fig. 1A, an increasing concentration of DCP led to increased incorporation of [3H]thymidine in HUVEC. DCP stimulated cell proliferation by 1.48 ± 0.12-fold at a concentration of 20 ng/ml in HUVEC compared with the 1.10 ± 0.09-fold in normal PT at the same concentration. This effect reached a plateau at concentrations higher than 20 ng/ml (data not shown). DCP Stimulates Cell Migration in HUVEC—DCP-induced cell migrative activities were assessed by in vitro wound healing assay. DCP-stimulated cell migration was 2.16 ± 0.29-fold at a concentration of 20 ng/ml in HUVEC compared with the 1.11 ± 0.25-fold in normal PT at the same concentration. As shown in Fig. 1B, an increasing concentration of DCP led to a significant promotion in the migrative activity in HUVEC. This effect also reached a plateau at the DCP stimulus of 20 ng/ml (data not shown). DCP Does Not Induce Morphological Change in HUVEC—Cultured HUVEC was relatively heterogeneous in terms of morphology. DCP, PT, and VEGF induced no significant morphological change at 12 (data not shown) and 24 h (Fig. 1C) in HUVEC. The Met-JAK-STAT Signaling Pathway Is Not Affected by DCP Stimulation—In previous studies of HCC cell lines, DCP was found to bind with the cell surface receptor Met and cause autophosphorylation (23Suzuki M. Shiraha H. Fujikawa T. Takaoka N. Ueda N. Nakanishi Y. Koike K. Takaki A. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6409-6415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activation of the Met-JAK-STAT signaling pathway was assessed in HUVEC, and DCP did not significantly induce phosphorylation of Met, JAK 1, or STAT 3 at 5 min (data not shown), 15 min, and 6 h (Fig. 2). Biological Effect of DCP on Binding to KDR and Activation of KDR-PLC-γ-MAPK Signaling Pathway—Because DCP did not stimulate the Met-JAK-STAT signaling pathway, the activation of other receptor tyrosine kinases was screened using a human phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array kit. The antibody array contains antibodies for phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases and related signaling molecules including Met, VEGF receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, Axl, RET, retinoid-related orphan receptor, tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains, nerve growth factor receptor, muscle-specific receptor, and ephrin receptor. Among these receptors, phosphorylation of KDR was induced by DCP stimulation in HUVEC, whereas PT did not induce phosphorylation of KDR (Fig. 3). Met stimulation was not detected in the antibody array analysis, which was consistent with the results of the immunoblot analysis. Consequently, the direct binding between DCP and KDR was examined by immunoprecipitation assay. DCP was detected in the immunoprecipitant with anti-KDR antibody (Fig. 4A). This confirmed the antibody array analysis result, as detected by anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody in HUVEC, demonstrating DCP treatment induced autophosphorylation of KDR (Fig. 4B). When KDR is activated by its ligand VEGF, the specific tyrosine residues are reported to be autophosphorylated (32Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 33Wu L.W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Ozes O.N. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the downstream pathway binding with VEGF-A and activation of KDR induce the binding of PLC-γ to KDR via its carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain, as well as produce strong phosphorylation at tyrosine (34Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Consequently the activated PLC-γ efficiently stimulates protein kinase C, resulting in the stimulation of the raf-MEK-MAPK pathway (34Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). To identify the signaling pathway following the autophosphorylation of KDR, activations of PLC-γ and MAPK were examined by immunoblot analysis of HUVEC treated with DCP. Phosphorylation of PLC-γ and MAPK was induced by DCP and KDR, but not PT (Fig. 4, C and D).FIGURE 4Co-immunoprecipitation analysis (A) and phosphorylation of KDR (B), PLC-γ (C), and MAPK (D). A, cells were stimulated with DCP (20 ng/ml) for 15 min. KDR protein was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblot using anti-DCP and anti-KDR antibodies. B–D, cells were stimulated with DCP (2 or 20 ng/ml), PT (20 ng/ml), and VEGF165 (10.6 ng/ml) for 15 min. KDR protein was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates. Precipitates were developed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-KDR antibodies (B).

Cell proliferative activities were analyzed by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. The inhibition of DCP-induced proliferative activity by KDR kinase inhibitor or MEK inhibitor reached 93 ± 14 and 79 ± 14%, respectively (Fig. 5A). VEGF-induced cell proliferation was partially inhibited by MEK inhibitor, suggesting that VEGF may work through other signaling pathway. Migrative activities were analyzed using an in vitro wound healing assay in HUVEC treated with KDR kinase inhibitor or MEK inhibitor. The inhibition of DCP-induced migrative activity by KDR kinase inhibitor or MEK inhibitor reached 104 ± 2 and 102 ± 12%, respectively (Fig. 5B). HUVEC was treated with KDR siRNA in [3H]thymidine incorporation assay or in vitro wound healing assay to determine whether the biological effect of DCP is due to the action of KDR. The inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation by KDR siRNA reached 115 ± 17% in HUVEC (Fig. 6A). The inhibition of cell migrative activity by KDR siRNA was 110 ± 24% in HUVEC (Fig. 6B).FIGURE 6The effect of gene silencing using KDR siRNA on cell proliferation (A) and cell migration (B).

Clinical studies show a significant correlation between serum DCP level and the clinical angiogenic potential or vascularity of HCC (31Tamano M. Sugaya H. Oguma M. Iijima M. Yoneda M. Murohisa T. Kojima K. Kuniyoshi T. Majima Y. Hashimoto T. Terano A. Hepatol. Res. 2002; 22: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the role of DCP in angiogenesis of HCC has not been confirmed. In this study, we demonstrated that DCP directly stimulated cell proliferation (Fig. 1A) and cell migration (Fig. 1B) of vascular endothelial cells. Previously, we reported that DCP acts as an autologous mitogen for HCC cell lines and that the biological effect of DCP is brought out through the Met-JAK-STAT signaling pathway (23Suzuki M. Shiraha H. Fujikawa T. Takaoka N. Ueda N. Nakanishi Y. Koike K. Takaki A. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6409-6415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). From that point of view, we assessed the DCP-induced activation of the Met-JAK-STAT signaling pathway in HUVEC. However, we found that DCP did not induce phosphorylation of Met, JAK, or STAT significantly (Fig. 2). It has been reported that Met is hardly detectable in quiescent confluent endothelial cells and differentiated endothelial cells on three-dimensional collagen gel (35Ding S. Merkulova-Rainon T. Han Z.C. Tobelem G. Blood. 2003; 101: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Besides, the process of angiogenesis is very complex and involves a number of orchestrated steps (13Fidler I.J. Ellis L.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 185-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). We did not address the synergic effect of two receptors in this report. It is reported that semaphorin, Sema4D, is angiogenic and that its biological effect is mediated by its high affinity receptor, plexin B1 (36Conrotto P. Valdembri D. Corso S. Serini G. Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Bussolino F. Giordano S. Blood. 2005; 105: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 37Giordano S. Corso S. Conrotto P. Artigiani S. Gilestro G. Barberis D. Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The biological effects elicited by plexin B1 require coupling and activation of the Met tyrosine kinase (37Giordano S. Corso S. Conrotto P. Artigiani S. Gilestro G. Barberis D. Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Moreover, semaphorin induces a lower level of Met stimulation without other Met ligands in HUVEC (36Conrotto P. Valdembri D. Corso S. Serini G. Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Bussolino F. Giordano S. Blood. 2005; 105: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These findings imply that an undetectable level of Met activation may be involved in the biological effect induced by DCP stimulation. Further studies are necessary to probe the synergic effect of two receptors to clearly exclude the involvement of Met signaling. Despite the fact that DCP stimulates HCC cells through the Met-JAK-STAT signaling pathway, it also stimulated an alternative cell surface receptor in HUVEC. Receptor antibody array analysis showed that DCP hit the cell surface receptor KDR in HUVEC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that clearly demonstrates a stimulus effect on endothelial proliferation and migration. HCC is characterized by high vascularity and arterial blood supply, rather than the portal blood supply, which increase as HCC develops (38Ueda K. Terada T. Nakanuma Y. Matsui O. Hum. Pathol. 1992; 23: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). VEGF, a strong endothelial cell-specific mitogen, is known to be involved in angiogenesis of malignancies including HCC (17Ferrara N. Semin.

Some studies indicated an overexpression of VEGF in HCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous liver tissue (20Mise M. Arii S. Higashituji H. Furutani M. Niwano M. Harada T. Ishigami S. Toda Y.

Nakashima Y. Ogasawara S. Higaki K. Akiba J. Hicklin D.J. Kojiro M. Oncol. Rep. 2000; 7: 725-729PubMed Google Scholar). However, others reported that VEGF expression is higher in the surrounding cirrhotic liver tissues than in the HCC. They also reported that basic fibroblast growth factor expression is correlated with VEGF expression (45Deli G. Jin C.H. Mu R. Yang S. Liang Y. Chen D. Makuuchi M. World J. Gastroenterol. 2005; 11: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that VEGF expression may initiate angiogenesis in HCC tissue, although this view is still regarded as controversial. It was hypothesized that VEGF secretion in HUVEC was stimulated by DCP because the KDR-PLC-γ-MAPK signaling pathway is activated by DCP as well as VEGF. VEGF consists of several subtypes, including VEGF-A, -B, -C, and -D. All members of the VEGF family have in common the ability to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation but may act through different receptors: Fms-related tyrosine kinase receptor 1 (FLT1/VEGFR1) binds VEGF-A and -B (46de Vries C.

The phosphorylations of FLT1 or FLT4 were not induced by DCP stimulation in antibody array analysis, whereas VEGF stimulation induced phosphorylation of FLT1 and KDR (Fig. 3). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis showed that endogenous secretions of VEGF-A, -C, and -D were not induced by DCP stimulation in HUVEC (data not shown). Moreover, DCP induced autophosphorylation of KDR in 15 min. Endogenous VEGF secretion is too fast to involve KDR activation, as autophosphorylation of KDR was detected within 5 min of DCP exposure (data not shown). These results imply that DCP binds directly to KDR and activates KDR signaling. As the best known ligand for the KDR is VEGF (51Quinn T.P. Peters K.G. De Vries C. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl.

VEGF administered to HUVEC in the dose of 10.4 ng/ml, equivalent to 277 pm, induced both cell proliferation and migration (Fig. 1, A and B). This concentration is physiologically relevant, because the known dissociation constant of the VEGF·KDR complex is 41–770 pm (55Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Fuh G. Li B. Crowley C. Cunningham B. Wells J.A. J. Biol.

Thus, DCP displayed an activity similar to VEGF in terms of molar concentration. These findings also support our hypothesis that stimulation of KDR is elicited by direct binding of DCP. The binding of KDR to DCP was detected by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 4A). It is reasonable to suppose that KDR-PLC-γ-MAPK signaling pathway is the major signaling pathway for DCP (Figs. 4, B–D, 5, and 6). LeCouter and others (58LeCouter J. Moritz D.R. Li B. Phillips G.L.

In the current study, we utilized HUVEC, raising a question that hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells might signal differently from HUVEC in response to VEGF. In the study of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, KDR signaling is well preserved (58LeCouter J. Moritz D.R. Li B. Phillips G.L. Liang X.H. Gerber H.P. Hillan K.J. Ferrara N. Science. 2003; 299: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). This finding strongly supports our hypothesis that DCP stimulates vascular endothelial cell migration and proliferation in HCC development. Further study is necessary to elucidate the physiological and patho-physiological function of DCP on angiogenesis. DCP produced the biological effect through the alternative cell surface receptor KDR in HUVEC. This might be a curious phenomenon as one ligand binds to a different cell surface receptor. There are some other cases where one ligand utilizes different receptors depending on the conditions. Bag-1 was reported to bind to cell surface receptor Met and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, enhancing the ability of these receptors to deliver signals for cell survival in the apparent absence of any effect on signal transduction pathways such as the ras-raf-MEK signaling cascade linked to mitogenesis (61Bardelli A. Longati P. Albero D. Goruppi S. Schneider C. Ponzetto C. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6205-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrated a novel paracrine mechanism of DCP in vitro, where the DCP-KDR-PLC-γ-MAPK signaling pathway becomes a capable therapeutic target to inhibit the development of HCC with respect to angiogenesis. Further in vivo studies are necessary to validate this mechanism. We thank Naoki Magario (Eisai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and Masato Uehara (Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) for DCP purification."

On the other hand, LY294002 and rapamycin abolished PAK1 phosphorylation and enhanced HCV abundance, suggesting that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is involved in PAK1 regulation of HCV. Small interfering RNA knockdown of the mTOR substrate p70 S6 kinase abrogated PAK1 phosphorylation and enhanced HCV RNA abundance, whereas overexpression of a constitutively active alternate substrate, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, increased cap-independent viral translation and viral RNA abundance without influencing PAK1 phosphorylation. Similar data indicated that mTOR is regulated by both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and ERK.

Hepatology. 1997; 26: 21S-28SCrossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Approximately 170 million people are estimated to be infected with the virus worldwide (2Lauer G.M. Walker B.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar). Classified within the family Flaviviridae, HCV has a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome about 9.6 kb in length (3Choo Q.L. Richman K.H. Han J.H. Berger K. Lee C. Dong C. Gallegos C. Coit D. Medina-Selby A. Barr P.J. Weiner A.J. Bradley D.W. Kuo G. Houghton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2451-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). The precursor polyprotein encoded by the large open reading frame that spans much of the genome is processed into at least 10 proteins (core, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) by cellular and viral proteases (4Major M.E. Feinstone S.M. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Up to 50–80% of patients infected with HCV fail to eliminate the virus (2Lauer G.M. Walker B.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar), leading to long term viral persistence and an increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality. The viral mechanisms that promote the establishment of persistent HCV infection remain poorly defined. In general, infected hosts mount a variety of innate and adaptive immune responses to ongoing replication of RNA viruses. Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade or defeat these cellular responses (reviewed in Ref. 5Conzelmann K.K. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5241-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and HCV is no different. Recent studies have shown that HCV infection blocks viral activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in orchestrating innate intracellular antiviral responses mediated through both the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) double-stranded RNA signaling pathways. HCV accomplishes this by targeting the RIG-I and TLR3 adaptor proteins, MAVS and TRIF, for specific proteolysis by the viral NS3/4A protease (6Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M.

Nature. 2005; 437: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). It is possible that the ability of HCV to delay or prevent early innate immune responses may contribute to the establishment of persistent infection. Subgenomic HCV RNA replicons capable of autonomous replication in stably selected cell lines were first reported by Lohmann et al. (9Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J.-O. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar) in 1999. These replicon RNAs are bicistronic constructs containing the native 5′- and 3′-nontranslated RNA sequences of HCV, with the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) within the HCV 5′-nontranslated RNA driving translation of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene, followed by a heterologous IRES from encephalomyocarditis virus driving translation of the nonstructural (NS) HCV proteins (NS2 or NS3 through NS5B). These RNAs replicate autonomously when transfected into Huh7 human hepatoma cells and allow the selection of stable replicon cell lines with G418 (9Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J.-O. Herian U.

The activities of a number of intracellular signaling molecules and pathways also have been shown to influence HCV replication and RNA abundance in replicon cell lines, including ERK (21Murata T.

Hepatology. 2002; 35: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Type I IFN-induced JAK-STAT activation results in strong suppression of viral replication by inducing a series of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although the JAK/STAT pathway has been relatively well characterized, as has the virus-activated RIG-I/IRF-3 pathway that leads to induction of type I IFN synthesis, many details of the mechanisms by which other pathways regulate HCV replication remain unclear. The state of the cell cycle and rate of cellular proliferation has also been shown to affect replication (23Scholle F. Li K. Bodola F. Ikeda M. Luxon B.A. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1513-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Pietschmann T. Lohmann V. Rutter G. Kurpanek K. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1252-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinases that play an important role in a variety of cellular functions in mammalian cells, including control of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and cell death (reviewed in Ref. 25Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). PAK1, a member of the PAK family, is activated by several growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor via activation of the Rho GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42 (26Parrini M.C. Lei M. Harrison S.C. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The binding of GTP-bound GTPases to PAK1 dissociates dimeric PAK1 molecules and leads to the active state conformation. PAK1 is also activated by numerous physiological signals (25Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that PAK1 mediates virus- or poly(I:C)-stimulated signaling and that it may contribute to the activation of IRF-3 through TANK-binding kinase-1 and IκB kinase-ϵ (27Ehrhardt C. Kardinal C. Wurzer W.J. Wolff T. von Eichel-Streiber C. Pleschka S. Planz O. Ludwig S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although further study is required, these observations suggest that PAK1 may play an important role in activating innate intracellular antiviral signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that PAK1 knockdown leads to an increase in HCV replicon RNA abundance in stable replicon cell lines and enhances replication of a cell culture-infectious virus, suggesting that PAK1 is involved in cellular process(es) that negatively regulate HCV replication. Contrary to previous studies (27Ehrhardt C. Kardinal C. Wurzer W.J. Wolff T. von Eichel-Streiber C. Pleschka S. Planz O. Ludwig S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), however, we do not find PAK1 to be required for IRF-3 activation by the virus-activated RIG-I pathway. We show that PAK1 activation in these replicon cells is inhibited by rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, and that mTOR is independently regulated by both PI3K/Akt and ERK. Further analysis revealed that p70 S6 kinase is responsible for the PAK1-mediated suppression of HCV replication, suggesting a novel pathway toward PAK1 activation. Cell Culture—The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, Huh7, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glucose (4.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. A7 and HP, two Huh7 clonal cell lines that harbor Con1 HCV (genotype 1b) subgenomic replicon RNAs (6Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), and a genome-length (HCV-N strain) replicon cell line, 2-3 (28Ikeda M. Yi M. Li K. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2997-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 250 μg/ml G418. Antibodies and Kinase Inhibitors—Antibodies to PAK1, phospho-PAK1 (Thr-423), p70 S6 kinase, phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr-389), Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser-473) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies to β-actin (A-5441) and FLAG (F-3165) were from Sigma. A mouse monoclonal antibody to the HCV core protein (C7-50) was obtained from Affinity BioReagents. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to HCV NS5A was kindly provided by Dr. Craig Cameron. The inhibitors, LY294002 (PI3K), wortmannin (PI3K), rapamycin (mTOR), and PD98059 (ERK) were obtained from Calbiochem. Plasmids and DNA Transfection—pIFN-β-Luc was provided by Dr. Rongtuan Lin. pPRDII-Luc (29Fredericksen B. Akkaraju G.R. Foy E. Wang C. Pflugheber J. Chen Z.J. Gale Jr., M. Viral Immunol. 2003; 15: 29-40Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and pISG56-Luc were provided by Dr. Michael Gale. pRC22F (30Wang T.H. Rijnbrand R.C. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11347-11358Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) has been previously described. An expression vector for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) was constructed by amplifying specific cDNA using conventional reverse transcription-PCR methods and cloning the amplified sequences into the HindIII-EcoRI site of pFLAG-CMV-6a (Sigma). Thr-46 was mutated to Ala by site-specific mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to construct the constitutive active mutant, pCMV-4EBP1-T46A. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. Cells were co-transfected with pCMV-β-gal (Clontech) to monitor transfection efficiencies. RNA Interference—Transfections of siRNA specific for PAK1 or p70 S6 kinase were carried out using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) with a final concentration of siRNA of 100 nm, according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. Briefly, for transfection of cells in 24-well cell culture plates, 60 pmol of siRNA was diluted in 50 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and 3 μl of Oligofectamine was diluted in 12 μl of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 5 min, the siRNA and Oligofectamine solutions were mixed, incubated for an additional 20 min, and added to cell culture medium. siRNAs specific for PAK1 were purchased from Dharmacon (M-003521-03); these were transfected singly or as a pool consisting of four oligoribonucleotide duplexes with the following sequences: 5′-ACCCAAACAUUGUGAAUUAUU-3′ and 5′-UAAUUCACAAUGUUUGGGUUU-3′ (P1), 5′-GGAGAAAUUACGAAGCAUAUU-3′ and 5′-UAUGCUUCGUAAUUUCUCCUU-3′ (P2), 5′-UCAAAUAACGGCCUAGACAUU-3′ and 5′-UGUCUAGGCCGUUAUUUGAUU-3′ (P3), and 5′-CAUCAAAUAUCACUAAGUCUU-3′ and 5′-GACUUAGUGAUAUUUGAUGUU-3′ (P4). Validated negative control siRNAs (C1 and C2) with limited sequence identity to known genes were obtained from Ambion (catalog number 4611 and 4613, respectively). p70 S6 kinase-specific siRNA (catalog number 1454) and a mutated p70 S6 kinase siRNA (MutS6K), containing two nucleotide substitutions, were purchased from Ambion as oligoribonucleotide duplexes with the sequences 5′-GGACAUGGCAGGAGUGUUUdTdT-3′ and 5′-AAACACUCCUGCCAUGUCCdTdC-3′ (p70 S6 kinase-specific, S6K) and 5′-GGACAUGGUCGGAGUGUUUdTdT-3′ and 5′-AAACACUCCGACCAUGUCCdTdC-3′ (MutS6K). Promoter Reporter Assays—A7 and HP cells (5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates) were transfected with siRNA specific for PAK1 as described above. Two days later, cells were cotransfected with 350 ng of reporter plasmids and 50 ng of pCMV-β-gal DNA. Cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity 24 h later. To assess the role of PAK1 in IRF-3 activation induced by Sendai virus, Huh7 cells (5 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates) were transfected with PAK1 siRNA, followed by the transfection of reporter plasmids (350 ng) and pCMV-β-gal (50 ng) 24 h later. The next day, cells were mock-treated or challenged with 100 hemagglutinin units/ml Sendai virus (Charles River Laboratory) as previously described (6Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) and then harvested and assayed for reporter protein activity 16 h later. The luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency based on the results of the β-galactosidase assay. Assays were performed in triplicate; S.D. values are denoted by bars in the figures. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was assessed by a WST-1 (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) assay according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol (Chemicon International Inc.). A7 cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well flat-bottom plates, transfected with negative control or PAK1 siRNA as above, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Ten microliters of WST-1 reagent was added to each well, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer. Assays were carried out in triplicate; S.D. values are denoted by bars in the figures. Northern Blot Analysis—For Northern blot analysis, total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Eight micrograms of total RNA was electrophoresed and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was probed with in vitro transcribed negative-strand HCV RNA labeled with digoxigenin, using reagents provided with the DIG Northern Starter Kit (Roche Applied Science) and following the manufacturer's recommended procedures. After extensive washing and blocking, the membrane was hybridized with anti-digoxigenin-AP, incubated with CSPD, and exposed to a BioMax MR x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunoblot Analysis—Total cellular proteins were extracted with lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin in phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P; Amersham Biosciences). After blocking, the membrane was probed with specific primary antibodies (see above), followed by further incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized using ECL Western blot detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to film. Dual Luciferase Assay—Huh7 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were seeded into 24-well plates and cotransfected with 200 ng of pRC22F and 200 ng of pCMV-4EBP1-T46A, as described above. Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed and assayed for HCV IRES-dependent firefly luciferase activity and cap-dependent Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). For experiments involving RNA interference, Huh7 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) in 24-well plates were sequentially transfected with 400 ng of pRC22F and with negative control or PAK1 siRNA. After incubation for 3 days, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activities. Assays were performed in triplicate; S.D. values are denoted by bars in the figures. Cell Culture-infectious HCV—H-NS2/NS3-J/YH/QL is a chimeric cell culture-infectious virus with a genome consisting of the core to NS2 sequence of genotype 1a (H77) virus placed within the background of the genotype 2a JFH1 virus and containing compensatory mutations in E1 (Y361H) and NS3 (Q1251L) (Fig. 5A) (31Yi M. Ma Y. Yates J. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These two mutations render the chimeric RNA highly infectious (31Yi M. Ma Y. Yates J. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Virus stock (107 focus-forming units/ml) was prepared at the fourth virus passage by clarifying supernatant media harvested from infected cells (collected after overnight incubation of the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum) by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min and then concentrating 50× in a Centricon Plus-80 Centrifugal Filter device with Ultracel PL Membranes (100-kDa exclusion) (Millipore Corp.). Infections were carried out at a multiplicity of infection of ∼2. Huh7 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well plates and 24 h later transfected with either PAK1-specific or control siRNA as above. Following 24 h of additional incubation, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of medium containing 4 × 105 focus-forming units of virus. After a 12-h incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with normal culture medium. At 24, 48, and 72 h after inoculation of virus, cells were lysed and assayed for HCV core protein expression as well as PAK1 and β-actin by immunoblot. Supernatant cell culture fluids collected at 48 and 72 h were also assayed for infectious virus. HCV Infectivity Assay—Huh7.5 cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were seeded onto 8-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) 24 h prior to inoculation of 100 μl of culture medium containing virus. After 3 days of incubation, cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) for 10 min, incubated for 2 h with anti-core antibody diluted 1:300, and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotech) for 1 h. Nuclei were visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride. The cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Clusters of infected cells staining for core antigen were counted, and virus titers were calculated in terms of focus-forming units/ml (11Yi M. Villanueva R.A. Thomas D.L. Wakita T. Lemon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2310-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 31Yi M. Ma Y. Yates J. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). PAK1 Knockdown Enhances HCV Replicon RNA Abundance—To determine whether PAK1 plays a role in controlling HCV RNA replication and the abundance of viral RNA in replicon cell lines, we transfected PAK1-specific siRNA into two cell lines, A7 and HP, which contain subgenomic HCV RNA replicons constructed from the Con1 HCV sequence. As described previously (6Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), these cell lines have contrasting characteristics with respect to replicon abundance and basal IRF-3 activity; HP demonstrated robust RNA replication leading to a complete block in Sendai virus-induced IRF-3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, whereas the abundance of replicon RNA was lower in A7 cells, which displayed basal activation of IRF-3 and partial IRF-3 responses to Sendai virus infection (6Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PAK1 enhanced the abundance of HCV replicon RNA as well as the level of viral NS5A protein expression. Although the starting abundances of HCV RNA and NS5A were greater in HP cells than in A7 cells, knockdown of PAK1 expression by transfection of a pool of PAK1-specific siRNAs reproducibly and significantly enhanced viral RNA and protein abundance in both replicon cell lines (Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm that the enhanced replication of HCV RNA was specifically related to PAK1 knockdown and not a result of an off target effect of one of the siRNAs included in the pool, we transfected A7 replicon cells with each of the four individual PAK1-specific siRNAs as well as two negative control siRNAs comprising sequences unrelated to any known genes. As shown in Fig. 1D, all four PAK1-specific siRNAs both decreased PAK1 expression levels and increased NS5A protein abundance in replicate experiments. Since these four PAK1-specific siRNAs have different sequences and target different regions of the PAK1 gene, these data argue strongly for the PAK1-specific nature of the enhancement in HCV RNA replication. We conclude from these results that PAK1 suppresses HCV RNA and protein abundance. PAK1 Control of HCV Replication Is Independent of RIG-I and IRF-3—IRF-3 plays a pivotal role in orchestrating innate intracellular antiviral defenses that may control or eliminate virus infections. Previous experimental results demonstrated that IRF-3 is basally activated in A7 cells and that antiviral genes regulated by IRF-3, such as ISG15 and ISG56, are expressed at low levels in these cells (6Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In addition, the ectopic expression of a dominant negative IRF-3 caused an up-regulation of HCV abundance in these cells (6Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Since PAK1 has been suggested to contribute to IRF-3 activation upstream of the TANK-binding kinase-1 and IκB kinase-ϵ kinases (27Ehrhardt C. Kardinal C. Wurzer W.J. Wolff T. von Eichel-Streiber C. Pleschka S. Planz O. Ludwig S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), it is possible that the enhancement of HCV replication in A7 cells could be due to inhibition of basal IRF-3 activity. On the other hand, the increase in HCV RNA following PAK1 knockdown in HP cells (Fig. 1) cannot be explained by such a mechanism, since IRF-3 activity is completely blocked in these cells under basal conditions (6Foy E.

https://openalex.org/W1996667568,"In the context of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, Sprouty2 (Spry2) is the most profound inhibitor of the Ras/ERK pathway as compared with other Spry isoforms. An exclusive, necessary, but cryptic PXXPXR motif in the C terminus of Spry2 is revealed upon stimulation. The activation of Spry2 appears to be linked to sequences in the N-terminal half of the protein and correlated with a bandshifting seen on SDS-PAGE. The band-shifting is likely caused by changes in the phosphorylation status of key Ser and Thr residues following receptor stimulation. Dephosphorylation of at least two conserved Ser residues (Ser-112 and Ser-115) within a conserved Ser/Thr sequence is accomplished upon stimulation by a phosphatase that binds to Spry2 around residues 50-60. We show that human Spry2 co-immunoprecipitates with both the catalytic and the regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A-C and PP2A-A, respectively) in cells upon FGF receptor (FGFR) activation. PP2A-A binds directly to Spry2, but not to Spry2Δ50-60 (Δ50-60), and the activity of PP2A increases with both FGF treatment and FGFR1 overexpression. c-Cbl and PP2A-A compete for binding centered around Tyr-55 on Spry2. We show that there are at least two distinct pools of Spry2, one that binds PP2A and another that binds c-Cbl. c-Cbl binding likely targets Spry2 for ubiquitin-linked destruction, whereas the phosphatase binding and activity are necessary to dephosphorylate specific Ser/Thr residues. The resulting change in tertiary structure enables the Pro-rich motif to be revealed with subsequent binding of Grb2, a necessary step for Spry2 to act as a Ras/ERK pathway inhibitor in FGF signaling.

Understanding the mechanism of action of proteins that are inhibitory to the central pathway is therefore important from both a biochemical and a pharmacological point of view. A Drosophila Sprouty (dSpry) protein was discovered in a screen designed to detect genes/proteins involved in trachea formation (3Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y.

Four mammalian Spry isoforms were subsequently discovered, and they share a conserved C-terminal Cys-rich domain as well as a conserved tyrosine-containing sequence in the N-terminal half. Of the mammalian isoforms, Spry2 has been the focus of the majority of the experiments (5Kim H.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 441-450Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar).

The best characterized Spry2-binding proteins are c-Cbl, an ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) and scaffold protein that binds via its TKB domain to the phosphorylated Tyr-55 of Spry2 (12Fong C.W.

The mode of binding of Grb2 to Spry2 is somewhat controversial with evidence being presented that the SH2 domain of Grb2 binds to Tyr-55, or conversely, that the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 binds to a PXXPXR motif on the C terminus of Spry2 (6Hanafusa H. Torii S. Yasunaga T. Nishida E. Nat Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 15Lao D.H. Chandramouli S. Yusoff P. Fong C.W. Saw T.W. Tai L.P. Yu C.Y. Leong H.F. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29993-30000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The PXXPXR motif is cryptic in unstimulated cells and is revealed upon activation of FGFRs (15Lao D.H. Chandramouli S. Yusoff P. Fong C.W. Saw T.W. Tai L.P. Yu C.Y. Leong H.F. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29993-30000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The question that then arises is as follows. What is the mechanism that causes the necessary change in conformation of Spry2? Changes in phosphorylation are the most likely means by which a protein can alter its tertiary structure. Evidence has been presented that Tyr residues other than Tyr-55 impact on the physiological function of Spry2 (16Rubin C. Zwang Y. Vaisman N. Ron D. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9735-9744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, in comparison with Tyr phosphorylation, there has been less work done on investigating the effect of Ser or Thr phosphorylation of the Spry isoforms. A previous study demonstrated that Spry1 and Spry2 were phosphorylated on Ser residues in unstimulated cells (7Impagnatiello M.A. Weitzer S. Gannon G. Compagni A. Cotten M. Christofori G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We had noted in a previous study that endogenous Spry2 partitions into two major bands when run on SDS-PAGE and that stimulation with FGF favored the faster migrating band (15Lao D.H. Chandramouli S. Yusoff P. Fong C.W. Saw T.W. Tai L.P. Yu C.Y. Leong H.F. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29993-30000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The partitioning of Spry isoforms had been reported earlier together with the demonstration that treatment of cell lysates with a phosphatase resulted in the “loss” of the slower migrating band when analyzed on SDS-PAGE with subsequent Western blotting (7Impagnatiello M.A. Weitzer S. Gannon G. Compagni A. Cotten M. Christofori G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Taking this evidence into account, we postulated that a Ser/Thr phosphatase could be involved in the activation of Spry2 via selective dephosphorylation of Ser residues. Four major classes of protein phosphatases have been described, including PP1, PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin), and PP2C. PP2A is widely expressed in mammalian cells and regulates signaling pathways by a mechanism of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation with a variety of substrates including core components of the Ras/ERK pathway such as RAF, KSR1, and ERK (18Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar, 19Janssens V. Goris J. Van Hoof C. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cell. 2005; 17: 215-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The predominant form of PP2A in cells is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme. The core enzyme consists of the 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2A-C) and a 65-kDa regulatory subunit (PP2A-A or PR65). In addition, there are a number of regulatory subunits (B subunits) that bind to the core enzyme and confer substrate specificity to its dephosphorylating activity (17Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). With the long term goal of determining the mechanism of action of Spry2 in inhibiting the Ras/ERK pathway, we sought to locate and characterize binding proteins and their sites of activity that contribute to the conformational changes necessary to activate the protein. We chose to do this with respect to FGFR activation primarily due to evidence that suggests that Spry function is predominantly associated with the FGF pathway (21Chambers D. Mason I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify a role for PP2A in the activation of Spry2. Wild type full-length constructs of the different isoforms of Spry, FGFR1, ERK2, HA-Cbl TKB have been described previously (8Yusoff P. Lao D.H. Ong S.H. Wong E.S. Lim J. Lo T.L. Leong H.F. Fong C.W.

For acute stimulation, bFGF (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at various concentrations and different time points as described in the text. 293T cells transfected with Spry2 constructs were treated with various doses of okadaic acid for 18 h.

For the neurite outgrowth assay, PC12 cells were transfected with the various Spry constructs. 48 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h followed by stimulation with bFGF (50 ng/ml) for 6 days or left in serum-free medium as control. Cell extracts from 293T cells activated with overexpressed FGFR1 or stimulated with bFGF (50 ng/ml) for 30 min and 2 h were prepared in Tris buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors, and 1 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.5. Free phosphate from samples was removed using a desalting column and tested for phosphate contamination using the malachite green assay (Upstate Biotechnologies) before proceeding with the assay. 100 μg of samples were subjected to the PP2A immunoprecipitation assay using the PP2A assay kit purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell lysates of 293T cells transfected with FLAG-Spry2 were harvested in lysis buffer without sodium orthovanadate and subjected to incubation with calf intestinal phosphatase from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) for 2 h at 37 °C using bovine serum albumin as a control. Proteolysis—Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were excised into small pieces (1 × 1 mm) and transferred to a polypropylene 96-well microtitre plate (Greiner). Gel pieces were soaked in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 50% acetonitrile (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) for 24 h followed by a brief rinse with the same solution and drying in a Savant SpeedVac centrifugal concentrator (Holbrook, NY). Enzymatic digestion performed by the addition of 10 μl of 0.02 μg/μl trypsin (Promega) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5 (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were incubated over-night at 37 °C with shaking. Peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce) using a Crest sonicating water bath for 10 min (Crest, Trenton, NJ), dried down in a SpeedVac and resolubilized in a solution of 2% methanol (Fisher) and 1% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Liquid Chromatography-MS/MS—Digested samples were separated using a nano-flow high-performance liquid chromatography system (LC Packings). Each sample of 7 μl was injected and concentrated onto a trap cartridge (μPrecolumn, 300 μm × 5 mm, C18 PepMap 100, LC Packings) in 0.1% formic acid in water at a flow rate of 25 μl/min. After 5 min of washing, the flow was switched in line to a resolving column (75-μm internal diameter Picotip emitter, New Objective, Boston, MA) packed in-house with 10 cm of C18 reversed-phase packing material (Column Engineering, Ontario, CA), and the flow rate decreased to 100 nl/min. A gradient was then developed from 0 to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 60 min at the same flow rate. Using a liquid junction at the distal end of the column, a voltage of 2300 V was introduced to form a spray at the tip of the column. The spray was directed at the inlet orifice of a quadrupole-time-of-flight hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (QSTAR-XL, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The mass spectrometer was run in information-dependent acquisition mode to capture and fragment doubly and triply charged mass ions automatically. Selected mass ions with a minimum signal of 8 counts/s were isolated and fragmented with nitrogen gas. The collision energy used was proportional to the mass of the peptide and was calculated during analysis using the Analyst-QS software (Applied Biosystems). Data Base Analysis—All data files obtained were searched against the mammalian subset of the UniProt non-redundant protein data base (European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK) using the MS/MS Ion Search mode of the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK). Variable modifications were set to include carboxyamidomethyl cysteine, oxidized methionine, and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. A peptide mass tolerance of 200 ppm was set, and an MS/MS tolerance of 0.5 Da was set. All doubly and triply charged spectra were considered. Up to one missed cleavage was allowed. For a protein to be positively identified, at least two peptides had to match the protein with a score equal to or above that shown to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). The in vitro binding was carried out using the PP2A-A-GST, Cbl-TKB-GST, or GST vector with the non-phospho (48-61 aa RKKRRQRRRIRNTNEYTEGPTV(KBtnX)) or phospho-hS2 biotinylated (RKKRRQRRRIRNTNEpYTEGPTV(KBtnX)) peptide. 55 μm GST protein was incubated with various concentrations of the peptides or buffer for control at 4 °C over-night with rotation. 15 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose beads were added to each tube the following day for 2 h. The complex was then washed three times with the PP2A lysis buffer, and after the final wash, the beads were boiled in 15 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. The boiled samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed using immunoblotting protocols. A Distal Motif on Spry2 Likely Controls the Presentation of the C-terminal PXXPXR Sequence—We have recently shown that a PXXPXR motif on the C terminus of Spry2 is necessary for the ERK inhibitory activity of the protein in the context of FGFR signaling (15Lao D.H. Chandramouli S. Yusoff P. Fong C.W. Saw T.W. Tai L.P. Yu C.Y. Leong H.F. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29993-30000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The proline-rich motif is cryptic in unstimulated cells and is revealed upon FGFR stimulation. The question we next wanted to answer was: what was the mechanism that exposed the binding sequence? From our recent work, we had shown that a mutation of Tyr-55 can affect the Grb2 binding to the distal C-terminal sequence. We thought it was possible that some or all of the amino acids that surround Tyr-55 could be involved in regulating the exposure of the C-terminal proline-rich motif. With this in mind, we constructed a mutant by deleting aa 50-60, termed Δ50-60 (Fig. 1A), as well as the indicated point mutants and combinations of these. We investigated the effects of these mutations on Grb2 binding, c-Cbl binding, and ERK inhibition. A representative result is depicted in Fig. 1B. The YR (Y55F,R309A double mutant), Δ50-60, and Δ50-60R (deletion of aa 50-60 and R309A point mutant) mutations show no ability to inhibit ERK phosphorylation, none of them bind c-Cbl as they all lack the phosphorylated Tyr-55 residue, and all show minimal or no binding to Grb2. As shown previously, the Y55F mutant has a reduced binding to Grb2 and a diminished ability to inhibit ERK phosphorylation. An interesting observation here is that the Δ50-60 mutant of Spry2 separates into two obvious protein bands (panels 3 and 7, lanes 9 and 10). We had noted in a number of previous experiments that Spry2 separates on SDS-PAGE as two distinct bands in unstimulated cells (15Lao D.H. Chandramouli S. Yusoff P. Fong C.W. Saw T.W. Tai L.P. Yu C.Y. Leong H.F. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29993-30000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate the disposition of the two major Spry2 bands on SDS-PAGE, we set up an experiment where 293T cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with overexpressed FGFR1 in the presence of WT Spry2 or Δ50-60. The result of a representative experiment is shown in Fig. 1C. Notably, in the absence of stimulation (lanes 1 and 3), the two Spry2 bands contain essentially equal amounts of protein. Upon FGFR1 stimulation, the cells that contained WT Spry2 showed a significant increase in the faster migrating Spry2 band (lane 2). Conversely, in the lysates from cells with Δ50-60 transfected, there is an increase in the slower migrating band (lane 4). These changes in band migration in SDS-PAGE provided us with a clue that certain covalent modifications are necessary for Spry2 to function as an ERK inhibitor. We therefore set up a series of experiments to investigate the cause of the “bandshifting.” Spry2 Is Dephosphorylated upon FGFR Activation by a Ser/Thr Phosphatase That Targets Conserved Residues—Spry1 and 2 had previously been shown to be phosphorylated predominantly on Ser residues (7Impagnatiello M.A. Weitzer S. Gannon G. Compagni A. Cotten M. Christofori G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the Spry2 bandshift was due to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, lysates from unstimulated cells, expressing either full-length Spry2 (plus and minus FGFR1) or the Spry2 Δ50-60 deletion mutant, were treated with either alkaline phosphatase or an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin as a control. It can be seen in Fig. 2A (lanes 2 and 8) that treatment with alkaline phosphatase causes the “disappearance” of the slower migrating band in these lanes, indicating that the retardation in SDS-PAGE was most likely due to phosphorylation of specific residues on Spry2. The predominance of the faster migrating band upon FGFR1 activation in Figs. 1C and 2A indicates that a Spry2-targeting phosphatase is activated upon cell stimulation. Since the deletion of aa 50-60 abrogated the accumulation of the faster migrating band, it can be assumed that the activated Ser/Thr phosphatase binds directly or indirectly to Spry2 via this sequence or possibly that the deletion may have caused a conformational change that affects the recruitment of a phosphatase at an adjacent, or less likely, a distal site on Spry2. The next question that arose was: where are the amino acids that are targeted by the phosphatase located? An alignment of the various mammalian Spry proteins indicated that there is an N-terminal, Ser/Thr-rich sequence that is conserved to a relatively high degree in the various mammalian Spry isoforms (Fig. 2B, upper panel). We had shown that Ser/Thr phosphorylation was potentially responsible for the multiple bands of Spry2 seen on SDS-PAGE, and one way of seeing which of these putative phospho-targets contributed to the bandshifting was to perform a series of “alanine scan” point mutations over this sequence and compare the outcome on SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting. From the data shown in Fig. 2B (middle panels), it can be observed that a loss of the slower migrating band can be seen on Spry2 with point mutations of Ser-110, Ser-112, Ser-115, Ser-118, Ser-121, Thr-124, Ser-125, Ser-127, Ser-128, Ser-130, Ser-131, and E132A. No difference was noted with point mutations of Ser-108, Thr-113, Ser-116, Ser-120, Thr-122, Thr-126, and Ser-129. These data are summarized in Fig. 2B (lower panel); the arrows indicate changes in the upper band, and underlined letters indicate no change. The working hypothesis at this point is that some or all of these conserved Ser/Thr residues would be phosphorylated in unstimulated cells and would be dephosphorylated upon stimulation and there would be a subsequent structural change that exposes the proline-rich C-terminal tail. CK2 is a likely “priming” kinase that phosphorylates residues in resting cells, and its recognition site starts with an acidic Glu or Asp residue that is C-terminal to multiple serines. In Fig. 2B, we included Glu-132 in the point mutational analysis, and this results in a downshifting of Spry2 similar to some of the serine point mutations, possibly implicating CK2 as the kinase that opposes a phosphatase in the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of these conserved residues. To identify the sites of phosphorylation on Spry2 before and after FGFR1 stimulation, we next employed immunoprecipitation followed by peptide analysis utilizing mass spectrometry. We separated the bands of Spry2 as designated in the Coomassie Blue-stained protein separation blot in Fig. 2C (upper panel). To simplify visualization of the data, in Fig. 2C (lower panel), the table shows the residues revealed to be phosphorylated in several determinations. There are two points to note. Two residues, Ser-112 and Ser-115, are shown to be phosphorylated in unstimulated cells and not to be phosphorylated in FGFR1-stimulated cells. We have shown in the previous experiment that Ser-112 and Ser-115 were two of the residues that, when mutated, caused the slower migrating band to “disappear.” However, we could not detect peptides covering the majority of the conserved Ser/Thr sequence we used for the point mutation analysis despite repeated attempts. This arose due to the technical disadvantage of mass spectrometry in that all of the protein sequence is not usually recovered. We believe, however, that Ser-112 and Ser-115 provide a proof of concept in that the mass spectrometry-derived data agree with the point mutational analysis in that the phosphorylation status of certain residues can alter the gel migratory characteristics of Spry2 and that this potential “switch”"

Here we show that despite ablation of ADAMTS-5 activity, aggrecanolysis can still occur at two preferred sites in the chondroitin sulfate-rich region. Retinoic acid was more effective than interleukin-1α (IL) in promoting cleavage at these sites in ADAMTS-5-deficient cartilage. These results suggest that cleavage at preferred sites in the chondroitin sulfate-rich region is mediated by ADAMTS-4 or an aggrecanase other than ADAMTS-5. Following retinoic acid or IL-1α stimulation of cartilage explants, aggrecan fragments in medium and extracts contained SELE1279 or FREEE1467 C-terminal sequences. Some SELE1279 and FREEE1467 fragments were retained in the cartilage, with intact G1 domains. Other SELE1279 fragments were released into the medium and co-migrated with the 374ALGS neoepitope, indicating they were aggrecanase-derived fragments. In contrast none of the FREEE1467 fragments released into the medium co-migrated with the 374ALGS neoepitope, suggesting that, despite their size, these fragments were not products of aggrecanase cleavage in the interglobular domain. ADAMTS-5, but not ADAMTS-1, -4, or -9, was up-regulated 8-fold by retinoic acid and 17-fold by IL-1α treatment. The data show that whereas ADAMTS-5 is entirely responsible for cleavage in the interglobular domain, cleavage in the chondroitin sulfate-rich region is driven either by ADAMTS-4, which compensates for loss of ADAMTS-5 in this experimental system, or possibly by another aggrecanase.

A feature of joint pathology in arthritis is destruction of articular cartilage. The major structural components of cartilage are type II collagen and the large aggregating proteoglycan, aggrecan. In healthy cartilage, type II collagen and aggrecan confer strength and compliance that enables this tissue to resist compressive forces. In arthritic diseases, the progressive degradation of aggrecan and type II collagen leads to cartilage erosion. Aggrecan has two globular domains, G1 and G2 at the N terminus, and a third globular domain, G3 at the C terminus. An extended sequence between the G2 and G3 domains is heavily substituted with keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains, organized into a distinct keratan sulfate-rich region and chondroitin sulfate-1 (CS-1) 2The abbreviations used are: CS-1, chondroitin sulfate-1 domain; CS-2, chondroitin sulfate-2 domain; IGD, interglobular domain; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif; GdnHCl, guanidine HCl; IL, interleukin. and chondroitin sulfate-2 (CS-2) domains. An interglobular domain (IGD) of ∼150 amino acids separates G1 from G2. The aggrecan IGD is highly sensitive to proteinases. Proteolysis in the IGD releases the entire chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate-rich regions essential for the biomechanical properties of aggrecan, and is therefore thought to be the most detrimental for cartilage function. In pathology, proteolysis is driven mainly by aggrecanases, but there may also be some involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in late stage disease (1van Meurs J.B. van Lent P.L. van de Loo A.A.

The aggrecanases are members of the ADAMTS (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family, designated ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase-1) (9Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

The ADAMTS proteins are a family of zinc-dependent enzymes within the metzincin family of metalloproteinases. In addition to the catalytic domain that is maintained in a latent form by an N-terminal prodomain, members of the ADAMTS family also contain a disintegrin domain, one or more thrombospondin motifs, a cysteine-rich domain, and a spacer domain of variable length (15Porter S. Clark I.M. Kevorkian L. Edwards D.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 16Jones G.C. Riley G.P. Arthritis Res.

Aggrecan cleavage at the E373↓374A bond in the IGD is the signature activity of the aggrecanases and is widely reported in humans and animals as a marker of aggrecanase activity. However, cleavage at E373↓374A is not the preferred action of these enzymes. In vitro, recombinant ADAMTS-4 and -5 preferentially cleave aggrecan in the CS-2 domain (19Tortorella M.D. Pratta M.

The two most preferred cleavage sites in bovine aggrecan are at KEEE1666↓1667GLGS, followed by GELE1480↓1481GRGT. Thereafter, further cleavages occur at TAQE1771↓1772AGEG and VSQE1871↓1872LGQR in the CS-2 region and at NITEGE373↓374ARGS in the IGD. A similar hierarchy of cleavage preferences is shown by native aggrecanases in other species (21Sandy J.D. Thompson V. Doege K. Verscharen C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sandy J.D. Verscharen C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We recently published that ablation of ADAMTS-5 protects against aggrecan loss and cartilage erosion in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis (18Stanton H. Rogerson F.M. East C.J. Golub S.B. Lawlor K.E. Meeker C.T. Little C.B. Last K. Farmer P.J. Campbell I.K. Fourie A.M. Fosang A.J. Nature. 2005; 434: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). This study was complementary to a study by Glasson et al. (17Glasson S.S. Askew R. Sheppard B. Carito B. Blanchet T. Ma H.L. Flannery C.R. Peluso D. Kanki K. Yang Z. Majumdar M.K. Morris E.A. Nature. 2005; 434: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) who showed that the ADAMTS-5-deficient mouse was also protected against aggrecan loss and cartilage erosion in a surgically induced model of arthritis, more like human osteoarthritis. Here, we present new data on aggrecanase cleavage at preferred sites in the mouse CS-2 domain that were not examined in our earlier study. We find that unlike cleavage in the IGD, cleavage in the CS-2 domain at FREEE1467 and SELE1279 is not blocked in the ADAMTS-5-Δcat mouse. Our results highlight the recent realization that an accurate readout of aggrecanolysis requires analysis of both IGD and CS-2 domain cleavage. Generation of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5-Δcat Mice—The generation of ADAMTS-4 and -5-Δcat mice by Cre-mediated excision of floxed exons encoding the catalytic sites has been described previously (18Stanton H. Rogerson F.M. East C.J. Golub S.B. Lawlor K.E. Meeker C.T. Little C.B. Last K. Farmer P.J. Campbell I.K. Fourie A.M. Fosang A.J. Nature. 2005; 434: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). In the present study, cartilage taken for in vitro experiments was harvested from mice in which the Cre transgene, previously present on one allele of chromosome X, was out-bred. Cre was removed to avoid the possibility of Cre-mediated recombination between cryptic pseudo-loxP sites and the effects reported in vitro (23Loonstra A. Vooijs M. Beverloo H.B. Allak B.A. van Drunen E. Kanaar R. Berns A. Jonkers J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9209-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and in vivo (24Schmidt E.E. Taylor D.S. Prigge J.R. Barnett S. Capecchi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13702-13707Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Age-matched mice from wild type breeders on a C57/129 mixed background were used as controls for mutant mice from Δcat breeders. Cartilage Explant Cultures—Femoral head (hip) cartilage was harvested from 3-week-old mice. These explants contain a small amount of growth plate cartilage as reported previously (25Little C.B. Mittaz L. Belluoccio D. Rogerson F.M. Campbell I.K. Meeker C.T. Bateman J.F. Pritchard M.A. Fosang A.J. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 1461-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) but no bone, periosteum, or synovium. Remnants of ligament (ligament teres femoralis) are rarely present. Hypertrophic chondrocytes and mineral are present in a central region of calcified cartilage that separates the growth plate from the articular surface. However, because the femoral head does not become vascularized, it does not form a true secondary center, marrow cavity, or bone. The explants were initially cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 20 mm HEPES. After 2 days, the explants were washed in serum-free medium and placed in a 48-well culture dish with fresh serum-free medium containing either 10–5 m retinoic acid (Sigma) or 10 ng/ml human recombinant IL-1α (Peprotech, NJ) and cultured for a further 3 days. Medium and explants were collected at days 0, 1, 2, and 3 after changing to serum-free medium. Aggrecan and aggrecan fragments were extracted from the explants for 48 h at 4 °C with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m caproic acid. Residual, non-extractable aggrecan remaining in the cartilage was recovered by digesting overnight at 60 °C with 3.5 units/ml papain in buffer containing 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 5 mm cysteine, 5 mm EDTA. Quantitation of Aggrecan—The 4 m GdnHCl cartilage extracts were dialyzed against ultrapure water containing 10 mm EDTA at 4 °C. The concentration of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (as a measure of aggrecan) in extracts, medium, and papain digests was determined using the 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue assay (26Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Total aggrecan was calculated as the sum of glycosaminoglycan in the conditioned media, GdnHCl extracts, and papain digests. The cumulative release of aggrecan into the conditioned media was expressed as a percentage of total aggrecan. Western Blotting—Prior to SDS-PAGE, aliquots of conditioned media and dialyzed extracts were digested for 6 h at 37 °C with 0.01 units of chondroitinase ABC (Seikugaku, Japan) per 10 μg of glycosaminoglycan in 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 6.5, containing proteinase inhibitors E-64 (10 μg/ml), 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), pepstatin (5 μg/ml), and EDTA (10 mm). The total amount of aggrecan (medium + extract + residue) was calculated for each sample. We found that total aggrecan was a more accurate denominator than tissue wet weight for normalizing samples for Western blot analysis because the weight of a single mouse hip is so small (between 0.5 and 1.0 mg). The volume of medium or extract loaded onto the gel was determined empirically for each neoepitope. Samples analyzed for 374ALGS and NVTEGE373 neoepitopes were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 2 m urea, under reducing conditions and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with antibodies that recognize neoepitopes created by aggrecanase activity and include anti-NITEGE373 (27Mercuri F.A. Maciewicz R.A. Tart J. Last K. Fosang A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33038-33045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), anti-FREEE1467, anti-SELE1279, and anti-374ALGS. The anti-NITEGE373 antibody recognized the mouse NVTEGE373 neoepitope after aggrecanase cleavage. After immunodetection with anti-NITEGE373 or anti-374ALGS, the blots were stripped with Re-blot Plus (Chemicon International) and reprobed with monoclonal antibody 2B6 that recognizes stubs of chondroitin 4-sulfate chains on aggrecan after digestion with chondroitinase ABC. Samples analyzed for SELE1279 and FREEE1467 neoepitopes were electrophoresed on 5% gels. Primary antibody binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). Western blot membranes for direct comparison with each other were developed together. In most cases, blots were developed with ECL reagent until the most strongly detected band in the series approached saturation. Generation of the Anti-374ALGS, Anti-FREEE1467, and Anti-SELE1279 Neoepitope Antibodies—Synthetic peptides with the sequences ALGSVILTAGGC, CGGPTTFREEE, and CGGATTSSELE (Auspep, Australia) were conjugated to ovalbumin using bromoacetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (28Hughes C. Caterson B. White R.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16011-16014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against the ovalbumin-conjugated peptides at the Institute for Medical and Veterinary Science (Adelaide, Australia) and screened against the same peptide immunogens conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the identical ovalbumin-conjugated 374ALGS immunogen was also raised by Chemicon International. The anti-374ALGS, anti-FREEE1467, and anti-SELE1279 IgGs were purified from rabbit sera by protein-A affinity chromatography. The titer and specificity of the purified anti-374ALGS IgG from the Institute for Medical and Veterinary Science and Chemicon were the same. RNA Isolation and Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from Δcat and wild type cartilage using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was done on 100 ng of total RNA using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) and random hexamer primers. The reaction was done for 1 h at 42 °C, after which the enzyme was inactivated by incubation for 5 min at 99 °C. TaqMan® real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to measure the mRNA levels of ADAMTS-1, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, and ADAMTS-9. Primer and probe sets for the detection of each ADAMTS mRNA (18Stanton H. Rogerson F.M. East C.J. Golub S.B. Lawlor K.E. Meeker C.T. Little C.B. Last K. Farmer P.J. Campbell I.K. Fourie A.M. Fosang A.J. Nature. 2005; 434: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) were designed and synthesized using the ABI “Primer-by-Design” service and reactions were done using the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Multiplex PCR was done with primer/probe sets to the target (ADAMTS) and reference (18 S rRNA) in the same reaction. mRNA as quantitated using the comparative CT method (29Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25582) Google Scholar), using 18 S rRNA as the reference. Preliminary experiments showed that the efficiencies of target and reference amplifications were similar in all cases, thus validating the use of this protocol. The relative amount of mRNA expression in samples taken at days 1, 2, or 3, compared with samples taken immediately ex vivo (day 0), was determined by the formula 2(–ΔΔCT), where ΔΔCT was calculated by subtracting the ΔCT value for day 0 from the ΔCT value for days 1, 2, or 3. The experiment was done once with pooled cartilage from 5 to 7 mice for each genotype, at each time point, and it required 70 mice. For the present study, we generated new lines of Δcat/Δcat and control mice that lacked the Cre transgene. Heterozygous, Cre-negative ADAMTS-4-Δcat breeders on a mixed C57/129 background produced litters of normal size and gender distribution (390 pups from 55 litters) with the expected Mendelian ratio of wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous Δcat pups (24, 49, and 27%, respectively). Heterozygous Cre-negative ADAMTS-5-Δcat breeders also produced litters of normal size and gender distribution (450 pups from 60 litters) with the expected ratio of wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous Δcat pups (28, 48, and 24%, respectively). Phenotypic Analysis—Homozygous ADAMTS-4- and ADAMTS-5-Δcat mice were phenotypically normal with no morphological differences between mutant mouse lines and wild type mice in heart, kidney, lung, liver, spleen, thymus, and small intestine (data not shown). Given the urogential phenotype of the ADAMTS-1 null mouse (30Mittaz L. Russell D.L. Wilson T. Brasted M. Tkalcevic J. Salamonsen L.A. Hertzog P.J. Pritchard M.A. Biol.

Investig. 2000; 105: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), we also examined the kidney, ovary, and testis of the ADAMTS-5-Δcat mice and found that these tissues were indistinguishable from wild types (data not shown). Glasson et al. (32Glasson S.S. Askew R. Sheppard B. Carito B.A. Blanchet T. Ma H.L. Flannery C.R. Kanki K. Wang E. Peluso D. Yang Z. Majumdar M.K. Morris E.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 2547-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) have published the normal histology of tissues in the ADAMTS-4-Δcat mouse (32Glasson S.S. Askew R. Sheppard B.

Aggrecanase activity and ADAMTS-4 protein are present in mouse growth plate (17Glasson S.S. Askew R. Sheppard B. Carito B. Blanchet T. Ma H.L. Flannery C.R. Peluso D. Kanki K. Yang Z. Majumdar M.K.

Symp. 2003; : 107-114PubMed Google Scholar), so ablation of the ADAMTS catalytic sites might have been expected to disturb or delay normal skeletal growth. We found that the average body weights for wild type, ADAMTS-4-, and ADAMTS-5-Δcat mice were indistinguishable at all ages, indicating that neither ADAMTS-4 nor ADAMTS-5 catalytic deficiency interferes with mouse growth and development (data not shown). There were no detectable differences in tibiofemoral growth plates at any age between 3 days and 6 months. The width of tibial growth plates did not vary with genotype, and there was no apparent accumulation of aggrecan, as assessed by toluidine blue staining (data not shown). In combination, the growth curves and the growth plate histology indicate that ADAMTS-4 and -5 have negligible roles in aggrecan resorption during endochondral ossification. Retinoic Acid and IL-1α Induce Aggrecanase-mediated Aggrecan Loss from Mouse Cartilage Explants—Previously we examined the effect of IL-1α on the release of aggrecan from mouse cartilage after 3 days in culture (18Stanton H. Rogerson F.M. East C.J. Golub S.B. Lawlor K.E. Meeker C.T. Little C.B. Last K. Farmer P.J. Campbell I.K. Fourie A.M. Fosang A.J. Nature. 2005; 434: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the kinetics of aggrecan loss by analyzing samples on each of days 1, 2, and 3 of culture following treatment with retinoic acid, and compared them with IL-1α-treated samples. The results show that for both retinoic acid and IL-1α, the rate of aggrecan loss from wild type cartilage is non-linear. The rate of loss is greatest on day 1, and progressively less on days 2 and 3 (Fig. 1, a and b). Aggrecan loss from ADAMTS-4- and ADAMTS-5-Δcat cartilage is also non-linear, and is reduced after the first day in culture. Aggrecan loss from ADAMTS-4-Δcat cartilage was ∼15% less than from wild type cartilage following treatment with either agent. In contrast, aggrecan loss from ADAMTS-5-Δcat cartilage was substantially less than from wild type cartilage, and was ∼49% less than wild type in retinoic acid-treated cultures and ∼56% less than wild type in IL-1α-treated cultures. Il-1α promoted a greater release of aggrecan than retinoic acid for all genotypes. The Role of ADAMTS-4 and -5 in Retinoic Acid and IL-1α-induced Aggrecanolysis—To further examine the role of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 in driving in vitro aggrecanolysis, we next examined aggrecanase cleavage at preferred sites in the CS-2 domain and compared it with IGD cleavage. Cleavage sites in the mouse IGD and CS-2 domains are highly conserved but not identical to other species (Fig. 2, b and c). Three new neoepitope antibodies, specific for the mouse sequences 374ALGS, SELE1279, and FREEE1467 (Fig. 2a), were generated in rabbits. To confirm the neoepitope specificity of the antibodies, aggrecan present in 4 m GdnHCl extracts of wild type mouse cartilage was incubated at 37 °C, with or without recombinant human ADAMTS-4 (p40; Chemicon International), and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2, d–f). In each case, the antibodies failed to detect epitope in undigested cartilage extracts, but detected fragments of the predicted size in samples digested with ADAMTS-4. The results in Fig. 2 and subsequent figures confirm the neoepitope specificity of the antibodies used in this study. Retinoic Acid and IL-1α Induce ADAMTS-5 Cleavage in the Aggrecan IGD—Cleavage at the E373↓374A bond in the IGD was examined by Western blotting medium samples containing the 374ALGS neoepitope (Fig. 3, b and d), and cartilage extracts containing the NVTEGE373 neoepitope present on the G1 domain (Fig. 3, a and c). In retinoic acid-treated cultures, neither NVTEGE373 nor 374ALGS epitopes were detected on days 1 or 2 of culture, but were present by day 3 in both wild type and ADAMTS-4-Δcat cartilage. No IGD neoepitopes were detected in ADAMTS-5-Δcat cartilage treated with retinoic acid, in this system (Fig. 3, a and b). IL-1α treatment of wild type and ADAMTS-4-Δcat cartilage stimulated IGD cleavage commencing on day 1 of culture and increasing up to day 3, however, IGD fragments were not detected in cultures of ADAMTS-5-Δcat cartilage (Fig. 3, c and d). Overexposing the Western blots did not reveal NVTEGE373 or 374ALGS neoepitopes in either retinoic acid or IL-1α-treated ADAMTS-5-Δcat cartilage. Stripping the blots and reprobing with antibody 2B6 confirmed that samples were loaded in each lane (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that ADAMTS-5 is the major aggrecanase responsible for cleavage in the IGD of mouse aggrecan in response to treatment with both retinoic acid and IL-1α. ADAMTS-5 Deficiency Does Not Block Aggrecanase Cleavage in the CS-2 Domain of Aggrecan—Next we examined cleavage at E1279↓1280G and E1467↓1468G in the CS-2 domain using anti-SELE1279 and anti-FREEE1467 antibodies, respectively. We analyzed media and cartilage extracts and found that retinoic acid and IL-1α treatment generated SELE1279 and FREEE1467 epitopes in cartilage from all genotypes including ADAMTS-5-Δcat cartilage (Fig. 4). The epitopes were present on days 2 and 3 of culture and were detected in both the media and extracts. These results are consistent with our previous study (18Stanton H. Rogerson F.M. East C.J.

Here we report that LAR is sequentially cleaved by α- and presenilin (PS)/γ-secretases, which also affect signaling and/or degradation of type-I membrane proteins including the Alzheimer disease-related β-amyloid precursor protein. Similar to the previously characterized PS/γ-secretase substrates, inhibition of γ-secretase activity resulted in elevated LAR C-terminal fragment (LAR-CTF) levels in stably LAR-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human neuroglioma cells, and mouse cortical neurons endogenously expressing LAR. Furthermore, LAR-CTF levels increased in cells lacking functional PS, indicating that γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of LAR was PS-dependent. Inhibition of α-secretase activity by TAPI-1 treatment blocked LAR-CTF accumulation, demonstrating that prior ectodomain shedding was prerequisite for PS/γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of LAR. Moreover, we identified the product of PS/γ-secretase cleavage, LAR intracellular domain (LICD), both in vitro and in cells overexpressing full-length (FL) LAR or LAR-CTFs. LAR localizes to cadherin-β-catenin-based cellular junctions. Assembly and disassembly of these junctions are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. We found that endogenous tyrosine-phosphorylated β-catenin coimmunoprecipitated with LAR in CHO cells. However, when PS/γ-secretase activity was inhibited, the association between LAR and β-catenin significantly diminished. In addition to cell adhesion, β-catenin is involved in transcriptional regulation. We observed that LICD significantly decreased transcription of cyclin D1, one of the β-catenin target genes. Thus, our results show that PS/γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of LAR controls LAR-β-catenin interaction, suggesting an essential role for PS/γ-secretase in the regulation of LAR signaling.

LAR localizes to neurites and growth cones in neuronal cells and to adherens junctions in epithelial cells.

Recently, LAR knockdown or expression of phosphatase-inactive LAR in cultured hippocampal neurons was shown to result in the loss of functional excitatory synapses (53Dunah A.W. Hueske E.

Together, these data demonstrate that LAR is essential for development and maintenance of functional synapses and neural networks. Here we show that LAR is a novel substrate for consequent proteolytic cleavages by α- and PS/γ-secretases, and that PS/γ-secretase activity regulates association of LAR with β-catenin. Furthermore, we show that LICD is involved in the regulation of β-catenin-mediated transcription of the cyclin D1 gene, suggesting that LAR proteolytic processing by PS/γ-secretase affects LAR signaling. Plasmids, Transfection, and Cell Lines—Expression construct encoding full-length (FL) human LAR was kindly provided by Drs. A. Dunah and M. Sheng (MIND, Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). The FL-LAR cDNA and the nucleotides encoding the LAR-CTF were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1/GS to produce C-terminally V5-His-tagged FL-LAR and LAR-CTF constructs. This tag adds ∼5 kDa to the molecular mass of the expressed LAR proteins. Parental Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), H4 human neuroglioma, or N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (DMEM-C). Stable CHO cell lines overexpressing FL-LAR-V5-His (G418) and LAR-CTF-V5-His (Hygromycin B) were produced by transfection with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and individual antibiotic-resistant colonies were isolated. Cell clones overexpressing FL-LAR and LAR-CTF with relatively high levels, as determined by Western blot analysis, were maintained in selection medium (DMEM-C with 200 μg/ml G418 or 150 μg/ml Hygromycin B, respectively). CHO cells overexpressing either wild-type (WT) PS1 or PS1/D385A dominant negative mutant were produced as described earlier (20Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49976-49981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and cultured in DMEM-C containing 240 μg/ml zeocin. Mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) lines from WT mice (WT ES) or PS1 and PS2 double knock-out mice (PS1/2 dKO ES) were a generous gift from Dr. S. Sisodia (University of Chicago, IL), and cultured in Knock-out MEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for ES cells, l-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin as above, 1000 units of ESGRO (Calbiochem), 110 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μm nonessential amino acids (all Invitrogen). All cell lines were cultured in a humidified cell culture incubator in 5% CO2 atmosphere and at +37 °C. Western Blot Analysis, Antibodies, and Inhibitors—The cells were treated with TPA (Sigma), γ-secretase inhibitors DAPT, L-685,458 (both from Calbiochem), or WPE-31C (a gift from Dr. M. Wolfe, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA), α-secretase inhibitor TAPI-1 (TNF-α processing inhibitor-1, IC2; BIOMOL), and proteasome inhibitor clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (Calbiochem) alone or in combinations at indicated concentrations for indicated times. Control cells were treated with the vehicle Me2SO. Total protein lysates were prepared by lysing the cells in a lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice and centrifuging at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 10–50 μg of total proteins were separated on 3–8% Tris acetate or 4–12% bis-Tris gels (Novex) under reducing conditions and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were stained with V5 antibody (1:5000, Invitrogen) to detect LAR overexpression, and the bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using the ECL Plus substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal anti-LAR antibody (D5013) was a gift from Drs. A. Dunah and M. Sheng and used at 1:500 dilution for detecting the endogenously expressed LAR. Anti-β-catenin antibody (1:1000) and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20; 1:1000) were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories, and anti-transferrin receptor (1:1000) antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. APP and APP-CTFs were visualized using a polyclonal antibody recognizing the APP C terminus (Chemicon; 1:1000), and PS1 by an antibody recognizing the PS1 loop region (MAB5232, Chemicon, 1:1000). Coimmunoprecipitation—Total proteins were extracted as described above. Sodium orthovanadate (1 mm) was added to the lysis buffer to prevent protein dephosphorylation. 500 μgof total proteins were precleared with protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) in a total volume of 500 μl by overnight rotation at +4 °C. The V5 antibody (1 μl/reaction) was prebound to protein G beads in a similar way. Next day, the precleared samples were added to the antibody-bound beads and rotated at +4°C for 4 h. The beads were washed three times in washing buffer I (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40), twice in washing buffer II (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and once in washing buffer III (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitated proteins were detached from the beads by heating at +70 °C in 1× LDS gel-loading buffer (Novex) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation reactions of LAR-overexpressing cells without antibodies (beads only) or parental CHO cells with antibody-bound beads were used as negative controls. Total protein lysates were used as positive controls for staining. In Vitro γ-Secretase Assay—P2 + P3 membrane fractions from LAR-CHO cells were prepared as described earlier (20Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49976-49981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The membranes were then incubated at +37 °C in the absence or presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 at indicated concentrations for 2 h. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were cultured on glass coverslips or chamber slides (Nunc) coated with poly-d-lysine (0.5 mg/ml) and laminin (10 μg/ml) on 12-well plates. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and blocked and permeabilized in PBS containing 1.5% goat IgG (PBS-IgG) and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The cells were incubated with V5 antibody (1:500) in PBS-IgG for 1.5 h and with anti-mouse-Alexa-488 (1:500; Molecular Probes) for 1 h. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst-33342 stain (1:5000; Molecular Probes) for 5 min. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Fluoromount (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc.), and localization of LICD was observed under a confocal microscope system (Olympus DSU with IX70 microscope and Hamamatsu EM CCD camera). Extraction of Cytoplasmic, Nuclear, Membrane, and Cytoskeletal Fractions—The subcellular fractions were extracted using Compartmental Protein Extraction kit (Chemicon) according to the kit instructions. Cells were cultured in the absence of serum for 24 h (54Frade J.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1407-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and treated with lactacystin and/or TPA and DAPT for 3 h. For Western blots, GAPDH (Abcam, 1:5000) was used as a cytosolic marker, Lamin A/C (BD Biosciences; 1:1000) as a nuclear marker, transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:1000) as a membrane marker protein, and α-tubulin (Sigma, 1:8000) as a cytoskeletal marker. Different forms of LAR were detected with the V5 antibody (1:5000). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Cyclin D1—Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells, which were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding LICD-V5-His. Nontransfected cells served as a control. Effectene transfection reagent was used according to the kit instructions. N2a cells were used in this experiment instead of CHO cells, because of the availability of mouse, but not hamster, cyclin D1 mRNA sequence (accession number NM_007631) in GenBank™. PCR primers, producing a single PCR product of 248 bp, were as follows: Forward primer (20-mer), 5′-TGGTGAACAAGCTCAAGTGG-3′; and reverse primer (20-mer), 5′-GCAGGAGAGGAAGTTGTTGG-3′. 1 μg of total RNA was used as a template in cDNA synthesis in SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). qPCR reactions were performed using SybrGreen PCR mix (Applied Biosystems), 15 pmol of each primer, and 1 μl of cDNA as a template and run with ABI Prism 7500 (Applied Biosystems). The same cDNA samples were used in qPCR reactions with TaqMan Rodent GAPDH Control Reagents (Applied Biosystems) for normalization of cyclin D1 mRNA levels. Results were analyzed using the standard curve method. Results shown are expressed as % of control (nontransfected cells) of GAPDH-normalized cyclin D1 mRNA levels. Inhibition of γ-Secretase Activity Results in the Accumulation of LAR-CTFs—The currently known PS/γ-secretase substrate proteins share lysine- and/or arginine-rich sequence homology characteristic of the γ-secretase cleavage site at the membrane-cytosol boundary. Using a BLAST search based on the homology at the APP ϵ-cleavage site and the S3 cleavage site of Notch, we have identified a number of type-I membrane proteins with homologous amino acid sequences at their membrane-cytosol interface, including nectin-1α (20Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49976-49981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and β2-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) (21Kim D.Y.

Our homology search suggested that the RPTP LAR, a type-I transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion and synapse formation, could also be a novel PS/γ-secretase substrate. LAR is expressed as a full-length protein of ∼235 kDa, consisting of two noncovalently associated subunits, the ∼150-kDa extracellular E-subunit and ∼85-kDa membrane-bound P-subunit (26Pot D.A.

LAR has previously been shown to undergo ectodomain cleavage, which results in the release of the E-subunit and proteolytic cleavage of the P-subunit (41Aicher B. Lerch M.M. Muller T. Schilling J. Ullrich A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 681-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 55Ruhe J.E. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 1515-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the P-subunit is enzymatically cleaved to form a membrane-bound LAR-CTF that can function as a substrate for PS/γ-secretase-mediated cleavage. We first treated CHO cells stably expressing FL-LAR with three well characterized pharmacological γ-secretase inhibitors, DAPT, L-6"
https://openalex.org/W2071179037,"Bcl2 has been reported to suppress DNA mismatch repair (MMR) with promotion of mutagenesis, but the mechanism(s) is not fully understood. MutSα is the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer that primarily functions to correct mutations that escape the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase. Here we have discovered that Bcl2 potently suppresses MMR in association with decreased MutSα activity and increased mutagenesis. Exposure of cells to nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone results in accumulation of Bcl2 in the nucleus, which interacts with hMSH6 but not hMSH2 via its BH4 domain. Deletion of the BH4 domain from Bcl2 abrogates the ability of Bcl2 to interact with hMSH6 and is associated with enhanced MMR efficiency and decreased mutation frequency. Overexpression of Bcl2 reduces formation of the hMSH2-hMSH6 complex in cells, and purified Bcl2 protein directly disrupts the hMSH2-hMSH6 complex and suppresses MMR in vitro. Importantly, depletion of endogenous Bcl2 by RNA interference enhances formation of the hMSH2-hMSH6 complex in association with increased MMR and decreased mutagenesis. Thus, Bcl2 suppression of MMR may occur in a novel mechanism by directly regulating the heterodimeric hMSH2-hMSH6 complex, which potentially contributes to genetic instability and carcinogenesis.

Thus, Bcl2 suppression of MMR may occur in a novel mechanism by directly regulating the heterodimeric hMSH2-hMSH6 complex, which potentially contributes to genetic instability and carcinogenesis. Bcl2 is a proto-oncogene that was first identified at the chromosomal breakpoint of t(14;18) found in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is involved in dysregulated apoptotic cell death during the carcinogenic process (1Tsujimoto Y. Croce C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5214-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Bcl2 is widely expressed in various malignancies, including hematopoietic lung, breast, prostate, and nasopharyngeal cancers (2Kaklamanis L. Savage A. Mortensen N. Tsiotos P. Doussis-Anagnostopoulou I. Biddolph S. Whitehouse R. Harris A. Gatter K. J. Pathol. 1996; 179: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) by which Bcl2 facilitates oncogenesis is not fully understood. Because overexpression of Bcl2 results in lymphomagenesis in transgenic mice, this suggests that Bcl2, in addition to its survival activity, may also potentially have an oncogenic property (3Linette G.P. Hess J.L. Sentman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that Bcl2 can enhance the benzene metabolite-induced DNA damage and mutagenesis in human promyelocytic HL60 cells (4Kuo M. Shiah S. Wang C. Chuang S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 894-901PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl2 not only attenuates the nucleotide excision repair capacity and DNA replication in UV-irradiated HL60 cells (5Liu Y. Naumovski L. Hanawalt P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1650-1653PubMed Google Scholar) but also inhibits gamma ray-induced homologous recombination repair pathways, which result in elevated frequencies of mutagenesis (6Saintigny Y. Dumay A. Lambert S. Lopez B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2596-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A recent report has proposed that Bcl2 can suppress DNA mismatch repair (MMR) 3The abbreviations used are: MMR, mismatch repair; MutSα, MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer; GTBP, G/T binding protein; SAEC, small airway epithelial cell; NNK, nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone; BH, Bcl2 homology; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WT, wild type; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.3The abbreviations used are: MMR, mismatch repair; MutSα, MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer; GTBP, G/T binding protein; SAEC, small airway epithelial cell; NNK, nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone; BH, Bcl2 homology; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WT, wild type; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. by inhibiting E2F transcriptional activity (7Youn C.K. Cho H. Kim S. Kim H. Kim M. Chang I. Lee J. Chung M. Hahm K. You H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the oncogenic activity of Bcl2 may occur through multiple regulatory pathways. MMR is a critical mechanism for maintaining genetic integrity by correcting base substitution and insertion/deletion loop mismatches that occur because of errors in DNA replication and recombination as well as DNA lesions resulting from a variety of internal and external stresses (8Kunkel T. Erie D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The MMR system in human cells is composed of at least eight genes, including hMSH2, hMSH3, hMSH4, hMSH5, hMSH6 (GTBP), hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2 (9Modrich P. Lahuer R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 10Snowden T. Acharya S. Butz C. Berardini M. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 437-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The mismatch is detected by two major mismatch recognition complexes consisting of the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer, which acts on single base mispairs and loops of one or two bases, and the hMSH2-hMSH3 heterodimer, which preferentially binds loops of three and four bases (11Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M. Guerrette S. Marsischky G. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13629-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have suggested that the MSH2-MSH6 complex is required for repair of single base substitution mispairs (12Marsischky G. Filosi N. Kane M. Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 13Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), and the MSH6-defective mice have been found to develop cancer (14de Wind N. Dekker M. Claij N. Jansen L. van Klink Y. Radman M. Riggins G. van der Valk M. van't Wout K. te riele H. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that MSH2 and MSH6 are critical components in the MMR system. Nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is the most potent carcinogen contained in cigarette smoke that can induce cellular DNA damage (15Jorquera R. Castonguay A. Schuller H. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Mijal R. Thomson N. Fleischer N. Pauly G. Moschel R. Kanugula S. Fang Q. Pegg A. Peterson L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The NNK-induced DNA damage may have the potential to undergo mutagenesis during DNA replication and recombination. We previously discovered that Bcl2 potently suppresses the repair of NNK-induced abasic sites of DNA lesions by regulating c-Myc and APE1 (16Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is currently unclear whether Bcl2, in addition to its negative role in repairing NNK-induced DNA damage, may also affect NNK-induced mutagenesis by regulating the MMR machinery. Here we have discovered that Bcl2 enhances both spontaneous and NNK-induced mutagenic frequencies in a novel mechanism by down-regulating MMR efficiency via disrupting the hMSH2-hMSH6 complex, which may potentially contribute to genetic instability and carcinogenesis. Materials—Bcl2, hMSH2, hMSH3, hMSH6, and prohibitin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). NNK was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). The GTBP DNA repair kit was obtained from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). Purified recombinant wild type (WT), ΔBH1, ΔBH2, ΔBH3, and ΔBH4 Bcl2 mutant proteins were obtained from ProteinX Lab (San Diego, CA). Synthetic Bcl2 short interfering RNA (siRNA) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The M13mp2 heteroduplex DNA-containing mismatch was obtained from Dr. Thomas A. Kunkel (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences). All of the reagents used were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. Generation of Various Bcl2 Deletion Mutants—To create ΔBH1, ΔBH2, ΔBH3, and ΔBH4 Bcl2 deletion mutants, the 5′-phosphorylated mutagenic primers for various precise deletion mutants were synthesized as follows: ΔBH1, 5′-GGA CGC TTT GCC ACG GTG GTG GAG GTG GAG AGC GTC AAC AGG GAG ATG-3′; ΔBH2, 5′-GAG TAC CTG AAC CGG CAT CTG CAC CGA CCT CTG TTT GAT TTC TCC TGG-3′; ΔBH3, 5′-GCG CTC AGC CCT GTG CCA CCT GTG GAC TTC GCA GAG ATG TCC AGT CAG-3′; and ΔBH4, 5′-GGA AGG ATG GCG CAA GCC GGG AGA GCT GGA GAT GCG GAC GCG GCG CCC CTG-3′. The WT-Bcl2/pUC19 construct was used as the target plasmid that contains a unique NdeI restriction site for selection against the unmutated plasmid. The NdeI selection primer is 5′-GAG TGC ACC ATG GGC GGT GTG AAA-3′. Various Bcl2 BH deletion mutants were created by using a mutagenesis kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions and confirmed by sequencing of the cDNA. The WT and various Bcl2 deletion mutants were then cloned into the pCIneo (Promega) mammalian expression vector. Cell Lines, Plasmids, and Transfections—Various human lung cancer cells were maintained as previously described (16Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). DLD1 (MSH6-/-) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% serum. Human normal small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) were obtained from Cambrex Bio Science, Inc. and were maintained following the manufacturer's protocol. The pCIneo plasmid containing each Bcl2 mutant cDNA was transfected into H1299 cells, DLD1 cells, or SAECs using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen). Clones stably expressing WT and Bcl2 deletion mutants were selected in a medium containing G418 cells (0.6 mg/ml). The expression levels of exogenous Bcl2 were compared by Western blot analysis. Three separate clones for each mutant expressing similar amounts of exogenous Bcl2 were selected for further analysis. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in ice-cold 1% CHAPS lysis buffer (1% CHAPS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected as the total cell lysate and used for protein analysis or co-immunoprecipitation as described (18Deng X. Gao F. Flagg T. Anderson J. May W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4421-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (16Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 107) were washed once with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing the protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem). The resuspended cells were homogenized with a polytron homogenizer operating for four bursts of 10 s each at a setting of 5 and then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to pellet mitochondria. The mitochondria was washed with mitochondrial buffer, resuspended with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, rocked for 60 min, and then centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing mitochondrial proteins was collected. For nuclear fractionation, the cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 2 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.03% Nonidet P-40 with fresh protease inhibitor mixture set I). The samples were incubated on ice until >95% of the cells could be stained by trypan blue. The samples were then centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting nuclear pellet was washed with Buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine) and then resuspended in 150 μl of Buffer C (350 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine) and rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation (14,000 × g) at 4 °C, the supernatant (nuclear fraction) was collected. Protein (100 μg) from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a Bcl2 antibody. Measurement of MutSα Activity—MutSα DNA binding activity in nuclear extract isolated from various human lung cancer cells was analyzed using GTBP DNA repair kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif). GTBP DNA repair kits contain 96-well plates on which has been immobilized linear oligonucleotides containing G/T mismatches. The MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer contained in nuclear extract can specifically bind the G/T mismatch base pairs in the oligonucleotide. The primary antibody used in the GTBP DNA repair kit recognizes an epitope on the GTBP protein that is accessible upon DNA binding. After binding of a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, developing solution was added to each well and incubated for 15 min. After the addition of stop solution, samples were read on a spectrophotometer within 5 min at 450 nm. Raji nuclear extract provided in the kit or the boiled recombinant Bcl2 protein were used as a positive or negative control, respectively. Each experiment was repeated three times, and data represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate determinations. Purification of hMutSα—Human MutSα was purified from the nuclear extracts of H1299 cells as described previously (19Chang I. Kim S. Cho H. Lee D. Kim M. Chung M. You H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5073-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In brief, the samples used for hMutSα purification were precipitated from H1299 nuclear extracts between an ammonium sulfate saturation of 30 and 65%. The extract was diluted three times before being loaded onto a single strand DNA cellulose column (1 × 1.5 cm; United States Biochemical). The proteins were eluted by a 10-ml (of 0.2-1 m NaCl) gradient in buffer A. The fractions containing the MSH2-MSH6 complex were diluted to bring the conductivity of the pool to an equivalent to 100 mm NaCl before being loaded onto Mono S (HR5/5). The bound proteins were eluted with a 20-ml (of 0.1 to 1 m NaCl) gradient in Buffer A. The purified hMutSα was immediately supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10% sucrose, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Purified hMutSα were confirmed by Western blot using hMSH2 and hMSH6 antibodies. MMR Assay—MMR activity was analyzed using an M13mp2 lacZ α-complementation method as described previously (20Thomas D.C. Umar A. Kunkel T. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 1995; 7: 187-197Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The double-stranded M13mp2 heteroduplex DNA contains a nick in the (-) strand and a A:C, G:G or G:T mismatch in the lacZ α-complementation gene. The (+) strand encodes a colorless plaque phenotype, whereas the (-) strand encodes a blue plaque phenotype. The repair was directed to the (-) strand of M13mp2 by the presence of a nick. Introduction of this heteroduplex DNA into an Escherichia coli strain defective in mismatch repair yields M13 plaques on host indicator plates that are blue, colorless, or a mixture of the two. The repair reactions (25 μl) contained 30 mm Hepes (at pH 7.8), 7 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 200 μm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP, 100 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 100 mg ml-1 creatine phosphokinase, 15 mm sodium phosphate, 5 ng of purified heteroduplex DNA, and 50 μg of the nuclear extract protein isolated from human lung cancer cells or SAECs. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the DNA was introduced into a mutS strain by electroporation. The cells were plated to score the plaque colors. As the nick directs repair to the (-) strand, the (+) phenotype increases and the (-) phenotype decreases, that is, producing more colorless plaques in this instance. The repair efficiency was expressed in percentage, as 100× (ratio of mixed colonies in the control group - the ratio of mixed colonies in repaired group)/(ratio of mixed colonies in the control group). Each experiment was repeated three times, and data represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate determinations. Mutagenic Frequency Assay—The shuttle vector pS189 and host E. coli strain MBM7070 were obtained from Dr. No-Hee Park (University of California Los Angeles School of Dentistry, Los Angeles, CA). The mutagenic frequency assay was performed as described previously (21Shin K. Kang M. Dicterow E. Kameta A. Baluda M. Park N. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transiently transfected with pS189 plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000™ reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were exposed to NNK (1 μm) for 2 h and cultured in fresh medium without NNK for an additional 24 h. At the end of the incubation, the plasmids were recovered from the cells by the alkaline lysis method as described previously (22Stary A. Menck C.F. Sarasin A. Mutat. Res. 1992; 272: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was digested with the enzyme DpnI (Invitrogen) to cleave DNA from plasmids that had not replicated in cells. Recovered plasmid DNA that had replicated in cells was transfected into E. coli MBM7070 by the heat shock method. Transformed bacteria were plated on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial colonies containing plasmids with the mutant or wild-type suppressor tRNA gene (supF) were identified by color (cells containing wild-type plasmids were blue, whereas cells with mutant plasmids were light blue or white). The mutagenic frequency was determined as the percentage of white and light blue colonies in the total colonies (mutagenesis frequency (%) = number of white and light blue colonies/number of total colonies). Each experiment was repeated three times, and data represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate determinations. Bcl2 Silence—This is a technique for down-regulating the expression of a specific gene in living cells by introducing a short homologous double-stranded RNA. H460 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bcl2 were transfected with Bcl2 siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000™ according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). A control siRNA (non-homologous to any known gene sequence) was used as a negative control. The levels of Bcl2 expression were analyzed by Western blotting. Specific silencing of the targeted Bcl2 gene was confirmed by at least three independent experiments. Expression of Endogenous Bcl2 Is Associated with Increased Mutagenic Frequency, Decreased MMR Efficiency, and Lower Levels of MutSα Activity in Human Lung Cancer Cells—MMR is responsible for correcting base substitution and insertion or deletion loop mismatches generated during DNA replication (8Kunkel T.

Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). hMSH2 and hMSH6 are the major mismatch repair proteins that are required for MMR and are widely expressed in both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer cells (Fig. 1A). Intriguingly, Bcl2, a major anti-apoptotic and/or oncogenic protein, is co-expressed with hMSH2 and hMSH6 in H69 and H460 but not in other lung cancer cells tested (Fig. 1A). To test whether endogenous expression of Bcl2 may potentially regulate mutagenesis, various lung cancer cells were transfected with pS189 plasmids. After 24 h, the cells were exposed to NNK (1 μm) for 2 h and cultured in fresh medium without NNK for an additional 24 h. The mutagenic frequency was analyzed using the host E. coli strain MBM7070 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results indicate that H69 and H460 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bcl2 represent a higher rate of either spontaneous or NNK-induced mutagenesis compared with other cell lines that express low or undetectable levels of Bcl2 (Fig. 1B). Because MMR is a key mechanism in maintaining genetic stability (23Harfe B.D. Jinks-Robertson S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 359-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), an increased mutagenic frequency may result from decreased MMR. To test this possibility, nuclear extracts were prepared from various human lung cancer cells, and MMR efficiency was analyzed using three heteroduplexes containing A:C, G:G, or G:T mismatches. The percentage of MMR (i.e. A:C, G:G, and G:T) is significantly lower in the Bcl2-expressing H69 and H460 cells than that of other lung cancer cell lines that express undetectable levels of Bcl2 (Fig. 1C). MutSα is involved in recognizing and repairing mismatched bases and insertion or deletion loop mismatches in double-stranded DNA (24Marti M. Kunz C. Fleck O. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To assess whether expression of Bcl2 affects MutSα activity, the mismatch binding capacity of MutSα was assessed using nuclear extracts isolated from various lung cancer cells and a DNA repair kit that contains a G:T mismatched double-stranded linear DNA following the manufacturer's instructions. Because lower levels of MutSα activity were observed in H69 and H460 cells, this indicates that expression of endogenous Bcl2 is associated with the decreased mismatch binding capacity of MutSα (Fig. 1D), which may contribute to decreased MMR and increased mutagenesis. Overexpression of Exogenous Bcl2 Suppresses MMR in Association with Decreased MutSα Activity and Increased Mutagenesis—To directly test the effect of Bcl2 on MMR, MutSα activity, and mutagenesis, Bcl2 was overexpressed in H1299 cells that do not express detectable levels of endogenous Bcl2, primary normal lung small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) that express low levels of endogenous Bcl2. Results indicate that overexpression of exogenous Bcl2 significantly inhibits both MMR efficiency and MutSα activity in association with enhanced mutagenic frequency in both H1299 and SAECs (Fig. 2). An MMR-deficient DLD1 (MSH6-/-) cell line was used as a negative control (25Roth E.P. Reynolds M. Quievryn G. Zhitkovich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As expected, a low level of MutSα activity, low MMR efficiency, and high mutation frequency were observed in DLD1 cells. Overexpression of Bcl2 does not affect MutSα activity, MMR, and mutation frequency in DLD1 (MSH6-/-) cells (Fig. 2), and this suggests that MSH6 is necessary for the effect of Bcl2 on either MMR or mutation frequency. Purified MutSα was added back to the extracts from MMR-deficient DLD1 cells as an MMR-positive control. Results indicate that MutSα can restore MMR from DLD1 vector control cells (Fig. 2B). However, overexpression of Bcl2 in DLD1 cells inhibits MutSα-mediated MMR (Fig. 2B). Each study was performed on at least three separate occasions with at least three independently derived clones expressing similar levels of exogenous Bcl2, and results for one representative clone are shown throughout. These findings strongly suggest that the oncogenic property of Bcl2 may result from the inhibition of MMR. Treatment of Cells with the DNA-damaging Agent NNK Promotes Bcl2 Accumulation, Co-localization, and Association with hMSH6 in the Nucleus—Bcl2 is primarily localized in the outer mitochondrial membranes with minor expression in nuclear and endoplasmic reticulum membrane systems (26Hockenbery D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that Bcl2 also resides in the nucleoplasm and functions within the nucleus (16Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F.

Cytochem. 1999; 47: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the nuclear localized Bcl2 has no anti-apoptotic activity but is able to suppress DNA repair (16Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By contrast, hMSH2 and hMSH6, the major components in the MMR machinery, primarily localize and function in the nucleus (30Castrilli G. Piantelli M. Artese L. Perfetti G. Rubini C. Fioroni M. Ranelletti F. Piattelli A. J. Oral Pathol. Med. 2001; 30: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To test how Bcl2 regulates hMSH6 following DNA damage, H460 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bcl2 and hMSH6 were exposed to NNK (5 μm) for 60 min. Subcellular distribution of Bcl2 and hMSH6 was then examined by co-immunofluorescent staining. Consistent with our previous findings (16Jin Z. May W.S. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14446-14456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the majority of Bcl2 is localized in cytoplasm, and only a small proportion is located in the nucleus in untreated cells. Intriguingly, Bcl2 is accumulated and co-localized with hMSH6 in nucleus after exposure of cells to NNK for 60 min, because the merged images become more yellow in the NNK-treated cells than untreated cells (Fig. 3A). However, our previous report indicates that treatment of H82 cells with NNK for 24 h did not affect Bcl2 nuclear localization (31Jin Z. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40209-40219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These different results may be due to the time difference of cell treatment (60 min versus 24 h). To test this possibility, a time course experiment was performed. H460 cells were treated with NNK (5 μm) for various times up to 24 h. Subcellular fractionation was carried out to isolate mitochondrial and nuclear fractions. Results reveal that nuclear Bcl2 expression is enhanced within 60 min (Fig. 3B). After 3 h, the increased levels of nuclear Bcl2 are gradually reduced to the same level as the no treatment control (i.e. at a 12 or 24 h time point; Fig. 3B), indicating that NNK-enhanced nuclear Bcl2 expression occurs in a time-dependent manner. These findings can explain why treatment of cells with NNK for 24 h did not affect nuclear Bcl2 expression in our earlier report (31Jin Z. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40209-40219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). By contrast, the levels of mitochondrial Bcl2 showed no significant change in the time course experiment (Fig. 3B, lower panel). Thus, increased nuclear Bcl2 may not result from a movement from mitochondria into nucleus. This effect on Bcl2 following exposure of cells to NNK may occur through a transcriptional or other unknown mechanism(s). Further study is required to demonstrate this possibility. To test for a direct interaction between Bcl2 and hMSH2 or hMSH6 in the nucleus, a co-immunoprecipitation was performed using isolated nuclear extracts and an agarose-conjugated Bcl2 or hMSH6 antibody. Results reveal that NNK-induced DNA damage promotes Bcl2 to associate with hMSH6 (but not hMSH2) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C, upper panel). NNK enhanced Bcl2-hMSH6 binding results in a decreased hMSH2-hMSH6 association (Fig. 3C, middle and lower panels), suggesting that Bcl2 may replace hMSH2 from the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer and form a new Bcl2-hMSH6 complex upon DNA damage. Thus, Bcl2 suppression of MMR may occur in a novel mechanism by disrupting the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimerization. Intriguingly, NNK-induced Bcl2-hMSH6 binding promotes hMSH2-hMSH3 interaction (Fig. 3C, lower panel). It is possible tha"
https://openalex.org/W1982077820,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that can occur spontaneously or can be caused by infection or mutations within the prion protein gene PRNP. Nonsynonymous DNA polymorphisms within the PRNP gene have been shown to influence susceptibility/resistance to infection in sheep and humans. Analysis of DNA polymorphisms within the core promoter region of the PRNP gene in four major German bovine breeds resulted in the identification of both SNPs and insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms. Comparative genotyping of both controls and animals that tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) revealed a significantly different distribution of two indel polymorphisms and two SNPs within Braunvieh animals, suggesting an association of these polymorphisms with BSE susceptibility. The functional relevance of these polymorphisms was analyzed using reporter gene constructs in neuronal cells. A specific haplotype near exon 1 was identified that exhibited a significantly lower expression level. Genotyping of nine polymorphisms within the promoter region and haplotype calculation revealed that the haplotype associated with the lowest expression level was underrepresented in the BSE group of all breeds compared to control animals, indicating a correlation of reduced PRNP expression and increased resistance to BSE."
https://openalex.org/W2082608849,"Group B <i>Streptococcus</i> (GBS) frequently colonizes the human gastrointestinal and gynecological tracts and less frequently causes deep tissue infections. The transition between colonization and infection depends upon the ability of the organism to cross epithelial barriers. The alpha C protein (ACP) on the surface of GBS contributes to this process. A virulence factor in mouse models of infection, and prototype for a family of Gram-positive bacterial surface proteins, ACP facilitates GBS entry into human cervical epithelial cells and movement across cell layers. ACP binds to host cell surface glycosaminoglycan (GAG). From crystallography, we have identified a cluster of basic residues (BR2) that is a putative GAG binding area in Domain 2, near the junction of the N-terminal domain of ACP and the first of a series of tandem amino acid repeats. D2-R, a protein construct including this region, binds to cells similarly to full-length ACP. We now demonstrate that the predicted charged BR2 residues confer GAG binding; site-directed mutagenesis of these residues (Arg<sup>172</sup>, Arg<sup>185</sup>, or Lys<sup>196</sup>) eliminates cell-binding activity of construct D2-R. In addition, we have constructed a GBS strain expressing a variant ACP with a charge-neutralizing substitution at residue 185. This strain enters host cells less effectively than does the wild-type strain and similarly to an ACP null mutant strain. The point mutant strain transcytoses similarly to the wild-type strain. These data indicate that GAG-binding activity underlies ACP-mediated cellular entry of GBS. GBS entry into host cells and transcytosis of host cells may occur by distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2093671497,"Recent studies confirm that intracellular cAMP concentrations are nonuniform and that localized subcellular cAMP hydrolysis by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is important in maintaining these cAMP compartments. Human phosphodiesterase 3B (HSPDE3B), a member of the PDE3 family of PDEs, represents the dominant particulate cAMP-PDE activity in many cell types, including adipocytes and cells of hematopoietic lineage. Although several previous reports have shown that phosphorylation of HSPDE3B by either protein kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase B (PKB) activates this enzyme, the mechanisms that allow cells to distinguish these two activated forms of HSPDE3B are unknown. Here we report that PKA phosphorylates HSPDE3B at several distinct sites (Ser-73, Ser-296, and Ser-318), and we show that phosphorylation of HSPDE3B at Ser-318 activates this PDE and stimulates its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. In contrast, although PKB-catalyzed phosphorylation of HSPDE3B activates this enzyme, it does not promote 14-3-3 protein binding. Interestingly, we report that the PKA-phosphorylated, 14-3-3 protein-bound, form of HSPDE3B is protected from phosphatase-dependent dephosphorylation and inactivation. In contrast, PKA-phosphorylated HSPDE3B that is not bound to 14-3-3 proteins is readily dephosphorylated and inactivated. Our data are presented in the context that a selective interaction between PKA-activated HSPDE3B and 14-3-3 proteins represents a mechanism by which cells can protect this enzyme from deactivation.

A consensus has emerged that protein-protein interactions play a central role in regulating cAMP-mediated signaling. Indeed, it is generally accepted that selective subcellular anchorage of PKA, through interaction with A-kinase anchoring proteins, allows selective coordination of PKA-dependent cellular events (17Dodge-Kafka K.L.

Yingling J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 68: 281-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A PKC-dependent phosphorylation of HSPDE3A also stimulates association of HSPDE3A with 14-3-3 proteins (26Pozuelo Rubio M. Campbell D.G. Morrice N.A. Mackintosh C. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of HSPDE3B at Ser-318 activates this enzyme and promotes its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Although PKA is also shown to phosphorylate HSPDE3B at two other sites, Ser-73 and Ser-296, these events neither activated nor promoted HSPDE3B interactions with 14-3-3 proteins. Although PKB activated HSPDE3B, this kinase did not promote 14-3-3 protein binding of HSPDE3B or influence the effects of PKA. Taken together, our data are consistent with the novel hypothesis that PKA-activated, but not PKB-activated, HSPDE3B interacts with 14-3-3 proteins and that this selective protein-protein interaction protects the PKA-activated HSPDE3B from phosphatase-mediated deactivation in cells. Two-hybrid Screen—Mass screening for protein-protein interactions were carried out using a modification of the “interaction trap” methodology described by Fields and Song (27Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar) using the Y860 strain of yeast (Matα ura3-1:URA3 lexAop-ADE2 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 trp1-1 ade2-1 can1-100) (Dr. C. Boone, University of Toronto, Canada). Briefly, a murine brain expression library in pACT (Clontech) that allowed expression of mouse brain proteins as GAL4 fusions (Clontech) served as “prey.” “Bait” constructs were selected fragments of HSPDE3B (GenBank™ accession number NM-000922) in pEG202, which allowed expression of HSPDE3B-LexA fusion proteins. Primers for HSPDE3B fragment amplification were as follows: aa 2–90 (sense, 5′-ggggatccTGAGGAGGGACGAGCGAGAC-3′; antisense, 5′-ctctcgagTTCCTCTTCATCTGCCTCTTC-3′); aa 257–711 (sense, 5′-gcggatcCTGCTGGCCCTGGGGTTGG-3′; antisense, 5′-gcctcgagTTCCAATAAACCAGTGTC-3′); aa 712–1000 (sense, 5′-gcggatcCCCACTCAACAATTTATG-3′; antisense, 5′-gcctcgagACACAGGGGACCCACTATG-3′); and aa 978–1113 (sense, 5′-gcggatcCGTTCTTCTCCTCAACTAGC-3′; antisense, 5′-cgctcgagTTCCTCTTCATCTGCCTCTTC-3′). Following transformation, yeast was grown in synthetic dropout (SD) media supplemented with tryptophan (72 mg/liter), adenine (110 mg/liter), leucine (327 mg/liter), and histidine (72 mg/liter) as appropriate for selection purposes. Positive clones were initially selected for growth in the absence of adenine and then for the presence of LacZ activity. Plasmids were purified from yeast colonies that met both phenotypic requirements, transformed into Escherichia coli (DH5α), again tested in yeast, and identified by DNA sequencing (CORTEC DNA Service Laboratories, Kingston, Canada). Expression and Characterization of Glutathione S-Transferase Fusion Proteins—An amino-terminal FLAG-tagged HSPDE3B expression construct (HSPDE3B(AT)) was generated by ligating an EcoRI-HSPDE3B-digested cDNA (base pairs 1–1548 inclusively) into EcoRI-digested pCMV tag 2B vector. A carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged HSPDE3B expression construct (HSPDE3B(CT)) was generated by ligation of a PstI-digested fragment of HSPDE3B containing base pairs 1795–3269, inclusively into the PstI-digested pCMV tag 2C. For use in 14-3-3 pulldown experiments, recombinant 14-3-3 (β or η) or HSPDE3B fragments were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in E. coli. A pGEX-2T plasmid containing human 14-3-3β was a gift from Dr. Q. Medley (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard University), and the 14-3-3η- and HSPDE3B-GST fragments were expressed using pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences). E. coli (BL21(DE)) expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. Bacterial cell pellets were collected by centrifugation (6000 × g, 15 min) and lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Triton -X-100, 0.02% sodium azide, 100 μm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 μg/ml lysozyme, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml bestatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μm E-64, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Filtered protein lysates were loaded on reduced glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), washed, and eluted with 5 mm free GSH in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and GSH was removed using of Amicon® Centricon® centrifugation filters (Millipore). GST fusion protein yields and purities were assessed by SDS-PAGE. Mammalian Cell Culture—HEK293T (herein 293T) or NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 g/liter d-glucose. Heterologous Expression of HSPDE3B Constructs—A cDNA encoding HSPDE3B (Dr. V. C. Manganiello, National Institutes of Health) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV-Tag2C (Stratagene) using BamHI. This construct was used to express HSPDE3B. In experiments in which HSPDE3B was expressed heterologously, transfections were carried out with amounts of plasmid to limit overexpression of HSPDE3B to levels not exceeding 4-fold those of endogenous HSPDE3B. With full-length HSPDE3B, levels of expression were determined by PDE activity assays. Point mutations that allowed substitution of alanine (Ala) for serine (Ser) at positions 73, 295, 296, or 318 within HSPDE3B were generated using the Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmids encoding wild type (WT), membrane-associated (MA), or dominant negative (DN) PKB were provided by Dr. D. Alessi (University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, UK). HSPDE3B constructs were transiently expressed in 293T or NIH 3T3 cells following transfection using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). In Vitro Phosphorylation of HSPDE3B—GST- or FLAG-tagged proteins were purified by conventional approaches using GSH-Sepharose or M2-agarose. HSPDE3B proteins were incubated with recombinant PKA catalytic subunit or activated recombinant PKBβ (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) in a buffer without or with 200 μm ATP or 200 μm ATP supplemented with [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi per reaction; 3000 Ci/mmol stock) for 1 h at 30 °C. For reference, reactions were carried out with neither kinase nor ATP, with kinase or ATP alone, or with both ATP and kinase. At the completion of these reactions, proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10–12% gels). Treatment of Cells with Pharmacological Agents and Cell Processing—Confluent cultures of 293T or NIH 3T3 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in serum-free media containing forskolin (1–100 μm; Calbiochem), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; 10–100 μm; Sigma), or vehicle (Me2SO, 0.2% v/v; Fisher). When used, protein kinase inhibitors, H89, Bis-1, LY22945 (1–10 μm) (Sigma), were added 30 min prior to the test agent. At the end of the incubation period, cells were either flash-frozen until use or immediately processed. Treated cell cultures were homogenized with a Tenbroeck tissue grinder in a lysis buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm benzamidine, 100 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml bestatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μm E-64, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (1,000 × g; 5 min), and cleared supernatants were used in the experiments. Protein concentrations were measured by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Precipitation of Cellular Proteins with Immobilized GST Fusions or M2-Agarose—Interactions between HSPDE3B, or its fragments or mutants, with GST-14-3-3 proteins were studied using precipitation by pulldown or immunoprecipitation assays with GST-14-3-3β, GST-14-3-3η, or anti-FLAG(M2)-coupled agarose. For immobilized GST pulldown experiments, 50 μl (bed volume) of GSH-Sepharose-4B beads were saturated with GST, GST-14-3-3β, or GST-14-3-3η at 4 °C for 1 h, washed, and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with cell extracts, prepared as described above. For M2-agarose pulldowns, cell lysates were similarly incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Following the incubations, Sepharose or agarose beads were centrifuged (6,000 × g; 2 min) and washed repeatedly with 1% Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer. cAMP PDE activities in pulldowns was measured following resuspension of beads in lysis buffer (1:1 volume ratio) using an assay described previously (28Rose R.J. Liu H. Palmer D. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cilostamide (1 μm) or Ro20-1724 (10 μm) was used to inhibit PDE3 and PDE4 activities, respectively (28Rose R.J. Liu H. Palmer D. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, pellets were suspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. HSPDE3B, as well as other proteins of interest in these pellets, were detected using several antisera, including a monoclonal antibody specific for HSPDE3B (281K; 1:3000 dilution), a monoclonal antisera specific for PDE4D (1:4000) (all gifts from Drs. S. Wolda and V. Florio, ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA), or nonspecies selective anti-PDE3B polyclonal antibodies (sc-11835 and sc-11838; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as we described previously (29Liu H. Maurice D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10557-10565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Levels of PKA-phosphorylated HSPDE3B in cells were detected using an antiserum directed at phosphorylated PKA substrates (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Detection of 14-3-3 proteins was carried out by immunoblot analysis using antisera directed against 14-3-3 isoforms (sc-629; pan-reactive; rabbit and goat polyclonals; 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Statistical Analysis—Some of the data describing protein-protein interactions are shown as representative immunoblots. In all cases, data consistent with that shown in the representative immunoblot were obtained in at least three additional separate experiments. Numerical data are presented as means ± S.E. and are from at least four independent experiments. Statistical differences were assessed using unpaired analysis of variance, with a Tukey post hoc test, or unpaired Student's t test, as appropriate, with a value of p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Materials—Yeast and bacteria culture reagents were obtained from Difco (yeast nitrogenous base without amino acids), Fisher (peptone, tryptone, and dextrose), Qbiogene (complete supplement mixture –His –Leu –Ade –Trp), and Sigma (adenine, hisitidine, leucine, tryptophan, and o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside). Restriction enzymes, TaqDNA polymerase, Superscript Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, RPMI 1640, antibiotic/antimycotic solution, trypsin-EDTA, bovine serum albumin, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Plasmid purification was achieved using QIAprep spin columns, and MIDI columns were from Qiagen. [3H]cAMP (25 Ci/mmol), 5′-[14C]AMP (590.4 mCi/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Western Lightning) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DTT, Triton X-100, EDTA, EGTA, PIPES, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, TEMED, and ammonium persulfate were purchased from ICN Biomedicals. Sodium azide, Tris, trisodium citrate dihydrate, citric acid monohydrate, HEPES, NaCl, and Tween 20 were from Fisher. Benzamidine-HCl, leupeptin hemisulfate, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and G418 antibiotic were purchased from Calbiochem. All other reagents, salts, and enzymes were obtained from Sigma. Identification of HSPDE3B-interacting Proteins—To identify potential HSPDE3B-interacting proteins, we screened a yeast two-hybrid mouse brain cDNA library with HSPDE3B fragments as bait. “Bait-1” encoded amino acids 2–90, and “bait-2” encoded amino acids 257–711 of HSPDE3B, respectively. No interacting proteins were isolated when bait-2 was used. In contrast, multiple clones of a brain 14-3-3 protein, 14-3-3η (GenBank™ accession number NM-0011738), were isolated using bait-1 (Fig. 1, A–D). Expressed alone in yeast, HSPDE3B “baits” or the 14-3-3η isolates did not promote adenine synthesis nor LacZ activity (Fig. 1, A–D). When other fragments of HSPDE3B were tested for their ability to interact with 14-3-3η, fragments encoding amino acids 257–711, 712–1000, or 978–1113 did not possess such potential (not shown). Binding of 14-3-3 proteins usually requires that the binding partner be phosphorylated (25Darling D.L. Yingling J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 68: 281-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that phosphorylation could have promoted the interaction of bait-1 with 14-3-3η in yeast, bait-1 encodes several basophilic Ser/Thr kinase sites (30Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar), and this fragment was phosphorylated by the PKA catalytic (C) subunit in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1E). In Vitro and in Vivo Association of Purified HSPDE3B and GST-14-3-3 Proteins Is Stimulated following PKA Phosphorylation of HSPDE3B—Using a GSH-based adsorption assay (herein the “GST-14-3-3 pulldown”), purified HSPDE3B interacted with either immobilized GST-14-3-3η or GST-14-3-3β but not with immobilized native GST. Consistent with an important regulatory role for HSPDE3B phosphorylation in regulating this interaction, prior in vitro incubation of HSPDE3B with the C-subunit of PKA and ATP, but not the C-subunit alone, increased markedly these interactions (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, although in vitro incubation of HSPDE3B with purified recombinant-activated PKB and ATP increased HSPDE3B activity by ∼90 ± 15% (n = 3), it did not promote HSPDE3B binding to GST-14-3-3β proteins (Fig. 2B). Overall these data are consistent with the idea that HSPDE3B and 14-3-3 proteins interact directly in vitro and that phosphorylation of HSPDE3B by PKA, but not PKB, promoted this direct interaction. The modest HSPDE3B binding caused by ATP alone (Fig. 2A) was likely because of the presence of trace amounts of kinase activity in the purified HSPDE3B. To investigate if PKA-mediated phosphorylation of HSPDE3B also promoted 14-3-3 binding in cells, we used a cell line that expressed HSPDE3B endogenously, namely HEK293T, “293T.” Incubation of 293T cells with a combination of forskolin and IBMX (F/I) markedly increased HSPDE3B binding to GST-14-3-3β and, when tested by immunoprecipitation of HSPDE3B, the amount of 14-3-3β that associated with HSPDE3B (Fig. 2, C and D). Consistent with a role for PKA in coordinating the effects of F/I, prior incubation of cells with a PKA inhibitor (H89, 10 μm) ablated this effect (Fig. 2D). Addition of a PKC inhibitor (5 μm Bis-1; Fig. 2D) or a PI3K inhibitor (10 μm LY294002; data not shown) did not alter F/I-induced HSPDE3B binding to GST-14-3-3β. Addition of either the exchange proteins activated by cAMP-selective activator (10 μm; 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyl-cAMP), insulin (100 nm; data not show"

In prokaryotes, this process is completed by DNA polymerase I by means of strand displacement DNA synthesis and 5 ′-nuclease activity. Here, we demonstrate that the strand displacement DNA synthesis is facilitated by the collective participation of Ser769, Phe771, and Arg841 present in the fingers subdomain of DNA polymerase I. The steady and presteady state kinetic analysis of the properties of appropriate mutant enzymes suggest that: (a) Ser769 and Phe771 together are involved in the strand separation via the formation of a flap structure, and (b) Arg841 interacts with the template strand to achieve the optimal strand separation and DNA synthesis. The amino acid residues Ser769 and Phe771 are constituents of the O1-helix, which together with O and O2 helices form a 3-helix bundle structure. We note that this 3-helix bundle motif also exists in prokaryotic RNA polymerase. Thus in both DNA and RNA polymerases, this motif may have been adopted to achieve the strand separation function.

Strand displacement synthesis is an essential process in the removal and replacement of RNA primer moieties of Okazaki fragments. In prokaryotes, DNA polymerase I (pol I) 3The abbreviations used are: pol I, E. coli DNA polymerase I; KF, Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I; TP, template primer; KlenTaq, Klenow fragment equivalent of T. aquaticus DNA polymerase I; Bst, Klenow fragment equivalent of B. stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I; WT, wild-type; nt, nucleotide.3The abbreviations used are: pol I, E. coli DNA polymerase I; KF, Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I; TP, template primer; KlenTaq, Klenow fragment equivalent of T. aquaticus DNA polymerase I; Bst, Klenow fragment equivalent of B. stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I; WT, wild-type; nt, nucleotide. carries out this function by its 5′-nuclease and 5′-3′ polymerase activities. Whereas early studies indicate a coordination of 5′-nuclease with the polymerase activity (1Setlow P. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 232-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the precise mechanism underlying this process is not clear. It appears that the participation of 5′-nuclease activity is not necessary for the strand displacement synthesis because the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I has been known to catalyze strand displacement DNA synthesis (2Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 113-159Google Scholar). Thus, the strand separation activity resides in the polymerase domain of pol I. Despite the availability of numerous DNA-bound structures of polymerases (3Eom S.H. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 4Doublie S. Tabor S.

One exception to this is the DNA-bound crystal structure of mammalian DNA polymerase β, where the enzyme-DNA complex contains gapped DNA (9Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). However, this enzyme has no strand displacement activity. In the DNA-bound crystal structures of pol I family DNA polymerases, the immediate unpaired template nucleotide assumes a flipped conformation (6Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) such that it cannot pair with the incoming dNTP substrate. The base moiety of the template (n + 1) 4The numbering scheme for the template nucleotide is indicated in Scheme 1.4The numbering scheme for the template nucleotide is indicated in Scheme 1. nucleotide is positioned out of the DNA helical axis by more than 90° (4Doublie S.

In the crystal structures of polymerases, because of the short length of the single-stranded template overhang, only few interactions of downstream DNA with the enzyme protein could be discerned (3Eom S.H.

The ternary complex crystal structure of KlenTaq shows that the 5′-phosphate group of the template nucleotide, which pairs with the incoming dNTP (referred to as n + 1 hereafter), interacts with Ser674 (equivalent to Ser769 of E. coli pol I) (6Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In T7 DNA polymerase, the position equivalent to Ser769 is Gly527. The phosphate backbone of the n + 1 template nucleotide in KlenTaq interacts with Arg746, which is topologically equivalent to Arg841 of KF. Arg746 has an additional interaction with next template nucleotide (n + 2) in the single stranded region. Similar interactions are also noted in T7 DNA polymerase ternary complex, where His607 occupies the position of Arg746 of KlenTaq (4Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 8Li Y. Mitaxov V. Waksman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9491-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the catalytically active DNA-bound binary complex of Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) (5Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Braman J.C. Beese L.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), Tyr719 (equivalent to Phe771 of KF) packs against the n + 2 nucleotide of the template. It has also been shown experimentally that Phe771 of KF binds the 2nd nucleotide, confirming the structural observation (14Srivastava A. Singh K. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 15Turner Jr., R.M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2373-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be inferred that Ser769, Phe771, and Arg841 interact with the single-stranded template overhang. Biochemical results have confirmed some of these structural observations. Photoaffinity labeling has demonstrated that the single-stranded template overhang makes a close contact with Phe771 of E. coli pol I (14Srivastava A. Singh K. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 15Turner Jr., R.M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2373-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the mutant F771A polymerase did not exhibit significant alteration in its polymerase activity (14Srivastava A. Singh K. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Phe771 in a process other than the template strand stabilization required for the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. The interactions between pol I and the downstream double-stranded DNA have not been characterized. T7 RNA polymerase is homologous to the pol I family of DNA polymerases, and its structure with a double-stranded downstream DNA has been solved (16Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The superposition of the 3-helix bundle from pol I and T7 RNA polymerase shows that Phe771 of pol I is structurally homologous to Phe644 of T7 RNA polymerase. Phe644 of T7 RNA polymerase is located at the DNA fork, implying its role in DNA strand separation although there are no reported studies of Phe644 mutation. We propose tentative interactions of Ser769, Phe771, and Arg841 of pol I with a nicked DNA generated after the gap-filling reaction, prior to strand displacement (Fig. 1). This proposal suggests that some rearrangements in the interactions of Ser769, Phe771, and Arg841 would be required as the enzyme encounters the nicked DNA situation. Based on this proposal, we carried out the biochemical characterization of the alanine mutant enzymes of these residues with respect to their strand displacement activity. The mutant enzymes were also examined for their ability to synthesize DNA on gapped DNA substrates. Our observations clearly show that Ser769, Phe771, and Arg841 of pol I are required for strand displacement synthesis. Arg841 is required for stabilizing the template strand, while Ser769 and Phe771 play a role in initializing the process of strand separation. Materials—The PCR grade dNTPs were from Roche Applied Science. Radiolabeled nucleotides were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The DNA extraction kit was from Qiagen, whereas DNA oligodeoxynucleotides were either from MWG-Biotechnologies or from the Molecular Resources Facility at the New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ. All 32P5′-end-labeled oligomers were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. In Vitro Site-directed Mutagenesis and Purification of WT and Mutant Enzymes—The PCR-based protocol using PFU-Turbo polymerase, as described in Stratagene's QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was used to generate the desired mutations of KF. The plasmid pCJ141 (17Polesky A.H. Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8417-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. Catherine Joyce of Yale University) was used for the generation of KF protein and to construct the desired mutant derivatives. This plasmid contains the E. coli KF gene carrying a mutation, D424A. This mutation abolishes 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of pol I. The wild-type KF used for this study and its Ser769, Phe771, and Arg841 mutants are therefore exonuclease-deficient. Plasmid DNA from mutant clones, after confirming desired mutation by DNA sequencing, was used to transfect an expression strain, E. coli CJ376 (19Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1830-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Isolation and purification of S769A, F771A, R841A, and S769A/F771A (double mutant) enzymes were carried out as described before (20Singh K. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11289-11302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The WT pol I and the double mutant S769A/F771A were expressed and purified using the procedure described by Joyce and Derbyshire (21Joyce C.M. Derbyshire V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using the plasmid pCJ194 (kindly provided by Dr. Joyce). Observed Catalytic Rates (kobs) of Single Nucleotide Incorporation of WT and Mutant Enzymes with Gapped DNA—All kinetic measurements were carried out using a rapid quench-flow instrument (KinTek, Corp., Model RQF-3). To evaluate whether the amino acid residues Ser769, Phe771, and Arg841 were part of catalytic machinery in the gap-filling reaction, the rates of single nucleotide incorporation were determined under single turnover conditions by rapid mixing of enzyme 32P-radiolabeled template primer blocker (32/14/14-mer; see Scheme 1) complex with Mg·dNTP, followed by quenching of the reaction by EDTA. All assays were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol at 25 °C. Preincubated KF (wild-type or mutant enzymes) (60 nm) and template primer blocker (20 nm) were loaded into one sample loop, and dATP (50 μm) and MgCl2 (5 mm) were loaded into the other sample loop. Reactions were quenched at desired times (5 ms to 5 s) with 0.3 m EDTA, and the products were electrophoresed on 16% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The intensities of the product and substrate bands here and in all other assays were quantitated with a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant version 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics). To ensure reproducibility, the assays were repeated at least two times. The amplitudes and rate constants for the duplicate experiments were in very close agreement. Observed Catalytic Rates (kobs) of Single Nucleotide Incorporation of WT and Mutant Enzymes with Nicked DNA—The assays to determine the catalytic rates of single nucleotide incorporation were performed under the identical conditions mentioned above except for the DNA substrate, which was a nicked DNA consisting of a 28-mer template annealed with two 14-mer oligonucleotide (Scheme 1). To determine the DNA binding affinity of the wild-type and mutant enzymes for nicked DNA, the enzymes (60 nm) were preincubated with nicked DNA (final concentration of 10-160 nm), were loaded into one sample loop, and dATP (50 μm) and MgCl2 (5 mm) were loaded into the other sample loop. After rapid mixing, the reactions were quenched with 0.3 m EDTA at various reaction time intervals. The products were resolved by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The quantitation of products was carried out as above. Data Analysis—The amount of product formed (P) was graphed as a function of time (t), and the data were fit by non-linear regression to the burst Equation 1,P=A(1-e-k1t)+ksstEq. 1 where A is the amplitude of the burst phase, k1 is the rate constant of the burst phase, and kss provides the rate of the linear (steady-state) phase. The amplitudes of the burst phases (A) were graphed as a function of total DNA concentration ([DNA]), and the data were fit to the quadratic Equation 2,A=0.5(KD+[pol]+[DNA])-0.25(KD+[pol]+[DNA])2-([pol][DNA])Eq. 2 where KD is the dissociation constant for the pol-DNA complex, and [pol] is the concentration of active polymerase molecules. Strand Displacement DNA Synthesis by WT and Mutant Enzymes—The strand displacement DNA synthesis by the WT and mutant enzymes was assayed by incubating 100 nm gapped and/or flap structured DNA with 50 nm of enzyme in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol, at 25 °C. The DNA synthesis was initiated by the addition of four dNTPs (50 μm each, final concentration) and MgCl2 (5 mm, final concentration). The reactions were terminated at various time intervals by the addition of Sanger's stop solution (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar), and the products were quantified as described above. The rates of product accumulation and its disappearance after the gap-filling reaction was determined by plotting the amount of 19-mer (or 18-mer, depending upon the gap-length) with time and fitting the data to a double exponential Equation 3,P=A{(I-e-k1t)+e-k2t}+CEq. 3 where k1 is the rate constant of 19-mer formation and k2 is the rate constant of 19-mer utilization and C is a constant. The rate constant k2 can be considered as the overall rate of strand displacement DNA synthesis. The fitting of all data were carried out using SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific). Mutant proteins, F771A, S769A, R841A, and S769A/F771A were prepared to investigate the role of each amino acid in DNA synthesis and strand displacement DNA synthesis. All the enzymes used here including the WT and the mutants were exonuclease-deficient enzymes, because of the D424A mutation, which was introduced to eliminate the 3′-5′ proofreading exonuclease activity and to accurately measure DNA synthesis activity. DNA Synthesis on a Template Primer Substrate—The DNA synthesis activity of the mutants was determined initially on a heteropolymeric (47/17-mer) template primer substrate in the presence of all dNTPs and Mg2+ as the metal cofactor. None of the mutants showed any significant decrease in DNA synthesis activity (Table 1), suggesting that the individual residues Ser769, Phe771, and Arg841 do not play a critical role in the polymerase function.TABLE 1Polymerase activity parameters of WT and mutant Klenow fragment enzymesEnzymeDNA polymerase activityaThe polymerase activity was determined by standard trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay.

Open table in a new tab Rate Constant of Single Nucleotide Addition—Further characterization of DNA synthesis was carried out by measuring the rate constant of single nucleotide addition on a defined DNA substrate. WT and mutant polymerases were preincubated with a radiolabeled gapped DNA substrate (Fig. 2) under conditions of excess enzyme over DNA. Reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing the polymerase-DNA complex with the next correct nucleotide dATP at 50 μm concentration with Mg2+ (5 mm) in a rapid quenched-flow instrument. The reactions were quenched after 5 ms to 1 s, and the quenched reactions were run on a sequencing gel to separate the radiolabeled 15-mer product from the starting 14-mer primer. The amount of 15-mer was quantified and graphed as a function of time, and the resulting kinetic profiles (Fig. 2) were fit to obtain the rate constant of dAMP addition by each polymerase. The observed single nucleotide addition rate constants determined from these data for the WT, S769A, F771A, S769A/F771A, and R841A mutant enzymes were 150, 130, 150, 140, and 90 s-1, respectively. Except for the R841A mutant, the rate constants of single nucleotide addition by all the polymerases are very similar, indicating that these amino acid residues do not contribute in any major way to the nucleotide transfer catalytic apparatus of the polymerase. Strand Displacement Synthesis by the WT KF, DNA pol I, and Their Mutant Derivatives—Strand displacement DNA synthesis was measured using the gapped DNA substrate (Fig. 3A) that contained a 5-nt single-stranded region immediately following the 3′-end of the primer, followed by a downstream double-stranded DNA region. To copy the entire template strand, the polymerase needs to separate the downstream double-stranded DNA (strand displacement DNA synthesis). The 5′-end of the downstream non-template DNA strand was phosphorylated to mimic in vivo conditions. To assess the extent of strand displacement DNA synthesis by the WT and the mutant enzymes S769A, F771A, and R841A, DNA synthesis was measured in the presence of all dNTPs. The kinetics of DNA synthesis (Fig. 3A) showed that all the polymerases were able to fill the gap within 1 min of reaction time to make the marked 19-mer product. WT and S769A polymerases were able to displace the blocking strand and synthesize a full-length 61-mer DNA product after longer incubation or reaction times. In contrast, F771A, S769A/F771A, and R841A mutant polymerases were unable to copy the template DNA past the gap, even after 5 min of reaction. These results indicate that F771A, R841A, and double mutant S769A/F771A proteins have a defect in strand displacement DNA synthesis activity. We examined if the same mutations in complete pol I would have similar properties. A double mutant (S769A/F771A) of pol I was generated and studied alongside the KF mutant enzymes. No difference was noted between WT KF and WT pol I in their ability to catalyze strand displacement DNA synthesis (Fig. 3A). Similarly, double mutation of Ser769 and Phe771 in KF as well as pol I rendered the polymerase inactive in catalyzing strand displacement DNA synthesis. All the polymerases were capable of catalyzing the gap-filling reaction with comparable efficiencies. Because, the biological activity of pol I is to perform gapfilling DNA synthesis and to further displace and cleave the RNA primer that initiate lagging strand DNA synthesis, we investigated DNA synthesis on a substrate containing an RNA blocker. WT KF and WT pol I were able to complete strand displacement DNA synthesis on the substrate with the RNA blocker (Fig. 3B). The single and double mutant enzymes, however, failed to perform strand displacement DNA synthesis on the substrate with the RNA blocker, which is similar to the results observed with the DNA blocker except S769A mutant enzyme, which displayed the strand displacement activity similar to WT KF on DNA blocker. These results, indicate that substrates with DNA and RNA blockers behave in general, in a similar manner, and therefore all further studies were carried out with the DNA blocker substrate, and using KF as the model enzyme. Strand Displacement DNA Synthesis under Presteady State Conditions—To measure the relative efficiencies of gap-filling and strand displacement DNA synthesis, we measured the kinetics of DNA synthesis under single turnover reaction conditions. The time course of DNA synthesis by WT and F771A (as a representative of mutant enzymes) at 50 μm dNTPs and 5 mm MgCl2 is shown from 5 ms to 5 s (Fig. 4A). Both WT and F771A complete the gap-filling synthesis reaction to make the 19-mer product within 25 ms, but both pause upon encountering the DNA blocker. The WT polymerase makes the full-length DNA by strand displacement synthesis by 1 s, but the F771A fails to do so even after 5 s. Similar behavior was observed with the mutant polymerases, S769A, R841A, and S769A/F771A (data not shown), indicating that the mutant polymerases are defective in strand displacement DNA synthesis. In the WT reaction, the product of the gap-filling reaction 19-mer is extended to longer DNAs by strand displacement synthesis. To extract the rate constants of formation of 19-mer and its elongation by strand displacement DNA synthesis, the amount of 19-mer was quantified at various reaction times (Fig. 4B). WT and F771A mutant polymerases show a rapid initial increase in 19-mer, but its subsequent decrease with time is more prominent in the WT reaction compared with the F771A reaction. The data were fitted to a double exponential equation (Equation 3; see “Experimental Procedures”). We also noted from the data shown in Fig. 4A, the initial fraying of the blocker strand from a nicked DNA is a slow step. Once a few bp of the blocker DNA was unwound, the WT polymerase catalyzed strand displacement DNA synthesis very efficiently. The F771A mutant also extended one or two bp inside the double-stranded region, but DNA synthesis beyond that was blocked. These results indicate that F771A is deficient in continued unwinding of the downstream double-stranded DNA. Single Nucleotide Addition Rate on Nicked Substrates—To determine the efficiency of DNA synthesis on a nicked substrate, the single turnover kinetics of nucleotide addition was measured for the WT and each of the mutant proteins. The kinetics showed that a single nucleotide is added in the nicked substrate at a rate constant that is ∼1000-fold less compared with that of the single nucleotide incorporation in the gap-filling reaction (Table 1). This suggests a significant difference in the kinetics of strand displacement DNA synthesis compared with the gap-filling synthesis. The rate constant of nucleotide incorporation by the mutant enzymes was lower compared with that of the WT enzyme. The rate difference varied between 2-7-fold depending upon the mutant polymerase used (Table 1), indicating the requirement of Ser769, Phe771, and Arg841 in the strand separation by pol I. This difference in the catalytic activity was not due to the defect in DNA binding of mutant polymerases. The KD, DNA determined by plotting the amplitude of the burst phase against DNA concentration of WT and mutant enzymes was 7.1, 10.5, 9.8, 11.9, and 13.0 nm for WT, S769A, F771A, S769A/F771A, and R841A mutant enzymes, respectively (Fig. 5, B-E). It may be pointed out here that the amplitude of the burst-phase in the R841A mutant reaction is significantly low. One possible reason may be that the amount of productive R841A-DNA complex is significantly less compared with other enzymes. Requirement of the 5′-Flap in the Blocker for Strand Displacement Synthesis—The pausing of DNA synthesis prior to the separation of the downstream double-stranded DNA and the slow rate constant of nucleotide addition in nicked substrates indicate that initiation of strand separation is a very slow process. To understand this process better, we made gapped DNA substrates with flaps of 0, 1, 2, and 4 nt at the 5′-end in the blocker DNA and measured DNA synthesis in the presence of all dNTPs. Interestingly, as the length of the flap increases, the pausing by the WT polymerase after 19-mer synthesis decreases (Fig. 6). WT polymerase therefore shows efficient strand displacement DNA synthesis on a substrate with a 4-nt flap in the blocker. Using the gapped DNA substrate with or without a 4-nt flap, we measured the strand displacement DNA synthesis activity of the mutant polymerases. The presence of a flap sequence at the 5′-end of the blocker clearly enhances the strand displacement DNA synthesis activity of S769A and F771A polymerases, but not that of the double mutant (S769A/F771A) and R841A polymerases (Fig. 7). The time course of strand displacement DNA synthesis activity of WT and F771A mutant enzymes on the flap-structured DNA substrate was measured under presteady state conditions. The time course of strand displacement DNA synthesis between 5 ms and 5 s (Fig. 8A) shows little or no stall after gap-filling synthesis. The average rate of DNA synthesis by the WT and F771A mutant polymerase was very similar (13.20 and 12.42 s-1, respectively) (Fig. 8B). The strand displacement DNA synthesis rates (k2 in Equation 3) for the DNA substrate containing a 4-nt long flap, for WT and F771A mutant enzymes were 1.23 and 0.89 s-1, respectively (Fig. 8C), providing a defect of ∼1.38-fold in the strand displacement activity of F771A mutant enzyme. This difference is significantly lower compared with the one observed for the substrate containing no flap (∼17-fold) (Fig. 4). In summary, these results indicate that the initiation of strand displacement synthesis is a very slow process. Both WT and the single mutants are able to catalyze efficient strand displacement synthesis when provided with a pre-made flapped substrate. The double mutant and R841A, however, cannot catalyze strand displacement synthesis on the flapped DNA substrate, which indicates that the combined action of residues Ser769 and Phe771 and that of Arg841 is required for DNA strand displacement. Properties of Ser769 and Phe771—As outlined under the Introduction, Ser769 of KF interacts with the phosphate moiety of the n + 1 template nucleotide (5Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Braman J.C. Beese L.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). This nucleotide governs the selection of incoming substrate in KF. The interaction of Ser769 with the phosphate backbone is nonsequence-specific. Therefore, Ser769 can be attributed to participate in positioning the template nucleotide at the active site. The mutations S769A and F771A individually or together (double mutant) do not significantly affect the DNA synthesis activity as long as the template is single-stranded. As shown in Table 1, the mutant enzymes retained polymerase activity under steady state conditions as shown by standard trichloroacetic acid precipitation assays. Similar results were obtained in single nucleotide incorporation assays under presteady state conditions. These results indicate that the side chains of Ser769 and Phe771 are not essential for the nucleotide addition activity of KF or pol I (14Srivastava A. Singh K. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 15Turner Jr., R.M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2373-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The double mutant S769A/F771A showed a significant decrease (∼7-fold) in single nucleotide incorporation activity on nicked DNA compared with WT polymerase. Because no significant difference was noted in the affinity for nicked DNA by WT and mutant enzyme, the only reason for the lower polymerase activity is the inability of mutant enzymes to displace the non-template strand, which is a prerequisite for the nucleotide incorporation. These observations led us to extensively characterize the mutant enzymes for their strand displacement DNA synthetic activity. WT and S769A mutant had a similar strand displacement DNA synthesis activity on a substrate with a DNA or an RNA blocker. Both polymerases pause after filling the gap before continuing to copy the template by displacement of the blocker. On the other hand, F771A and S769A/F771A mutant polymerases nearly stop after filling the gap, which clearly indicated a role for Phe771 in strand displacement (or flap-structure generation). Very similar results were obtained with pol I, which indicates that the 5′-nuclease activity associated with pol I has little or no effect on strand displacement DNA synthesis. The double mutant (S769A/F771A) was defective in displacement activity compared with either of the single mutation carrying enzymes (S769A or F771A), implying the participation of both residues (Ser769 and Phe771) in the process of strand displacement possibly through the formation of the flap-structured DNA. The role of Phe771 becomes obvious when strand displacement activity of the F771A mutant enzyme is compared with the WT KF under presteady state conditions. WT KF removed the block generated after the gap-filling reaction, whereas the F771A mutant enzyme failed in this activity. In fact, the rate of block removal by F771A mutant enzyme was nearly 17-fold lower than the WT enzyme. Because no significant difference was noted in the binding affinity for the nicked DNA by the WT and mutant enzyme, the only defect that can be attributed to mutant enzyme (F771A) is its deficiency in performing the strand displacement activity. Properties of Arg841—As described before, this residue has two contacts with the template strand (6Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Thus, the likely role of Arg841 is to stabilize the template strand during the nucleotide incorporation reaction as well as during the strand displacement reaction. However, the participation of Arg841 in the nucleotide incorporation does not appear to be essential as R841A mutant enzyme showed significant polymerase activity (Table 1). Interestingly, the strand displacement properties of R841A mutant enzyme were as severe as those of the double mutant S769A/F771A enzyme including the DNA displacement synthesis with a DNA substrate. These results suggest that Arg841 is an essential component of KF for optimal strand displacement DNA synthesis. Comparison with Other Polymerases and Structural Evolution of the 3-Helix Bundle—A primary amino acid sequence comparison of pol I family enzymes has shown a high degree of conservation of these two residues (Ser769 and Phe771). However, in the enzymes that are devoid of strand displacement activity, the equivalent positions are occupied by non-homologous residues. For example, in T7 DNA polymerase, which is deficient in strand displacement activity (23Stano N.M. Jeong Y.J. Donmez I. Tummalapalli P. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. Nature. 2005; 435: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the positions of Ser769, Phe771, and Arg841 are occupied by glycine, glutamic acid, and histidine, respectively. Thus the presence of serine, phenylalanine, and arginine at defined positions in the pol I family of enzymes may be prerequisite for the expression of strand displacement synthesis. Ser769 and Phe771 are located on the O1-helix of DNA pol I. It has previously been reported that the structure formed by O, O1, and O2 helices of pol I shares structural homology with a novel DNA binding motif (24Yuan Y.C. Whitson R.H. Liu Q. Itakura K. Chen Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) found in transcription factor Mrf-2 and in some DNA repair proteins such as E. coli endonuclease III (25Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and T4 RNase H (24Yuan Y.C. Whitson R.H. Liu Q. Itakura K. Chen Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This structural homology suggested the involvement of this motif in the recognition of double-stranded nucleic acid. However, for the DNA polymerase I family of enzymes, it was suggested that this region may be important in the binding of the ssDNA template overhang (24Yuan Y.C. Whitson R.H. Liu Q. Itakura K. Chen Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this context, the occurrence of the 3-helical structural motif in pol I and T7 RNA polymerase suggests that this motif is clearly utilized in the binding and separation of two strands of DNA. In both enzymes, the strand with 3′-5′ polarity serves as template for the synthesis of appropriate nucleic acid. The superposition of the 3-helix bundle from pol I onto the structurally homologous region of T7 RNA polymerase is shown in Fig. 9. In addition to the excellent superposition of all 3 helices, the nucleotide substrate binding residues of T7 RNA polymerase and pol I (Arg754 and Lys758 equivalent residues) also superpose extremely well. Additionally, Phe771 of pol I appears to be structurally conserved with Phe644 of T7 RNA polymerase (16Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), which is located at the DNA fork in the transcription complex (Fig. 9), implying that this residue participates in separation of the two DNA strands. Collectively, these observations suggest that the 3-helix bundle is a functional unit that recognizes or induces altered DNA structure. The placement of an aromatic residue at the apex of the 3-helix bundle as seen in pol I (or T7 RNA polymerase) may facilitate the strand separation. In summary, the biochemical experiments described above clearly demonstrate that Ser769, Phe771, and Arg841 are required for strand displacement synthesis. The first two amino acids provide a means to separate the doublestranded DNA structure, which is essential for the rapid strand displacement DNA synthesis. The structural analyses further indicate that Ser769 and Phe771 are the components of a novel 3-helix bundle structure that functions in strand separation reactions.

In the adult mouse brain, PK2 is expressed abundantly in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the GCL and PGL in the OB (18Cheng M.Y. Bullock C.M. Li C. Lee A.G. Bermak J.C. Belluzzi J. Weaver D.R.

PK2 expression in the SCN is abolished in Clock–/– and Bmal1–/– mice (18Cheng M.Y. Bullock C.M. Li C. Lee A.G. Bermak J.C. Belluzzi J. Weaver D.R. Leslie F.M. Zhou Q.Y.

In this study, we examine the regulation of the PK2 gene by the proneural bHLH factors Ngn1 and MASH1 in the embryonic and postnatal mouse OB. We found that the expressions of these genes overlap in several populations of OB neurons, and the expression of the PK2 gene is reduced in Ngn1 and MASH1 mutant mice. Both Ngn1 and MASH1 positively regulate the PK2 gene transcription by binding to E-box motifs on the PK2 promoter. Moreover, both PK2 and Ngn1 mutant mice have similar defects in OB development. Our results indicate that PK2 is a target gene of proneural factors for neurogenesis in the OB. Animals and Histological Examination—Postnatal and adult mice were perfused with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) under anesthesia. For the embryos, the day on which the vaginal plug was found was counted as embryonic (E) day 0.5. E13.5–E18.5 embryos were collected from pregnant mice by cesarean section. Embryos older than E15.5 were perfused transcardially. Cresyl violet staining on cryosections was carried out for histological examination. All procedures regarding the care and use of animals were in accordance with institutional guidelines. In Situ Hybridization—Riboprobes for PK2, Ngn1, and Mash1 were labeled with 35S-UTP or digoxigenin (DIG)-UTP. In situ hybridization was performed on cryosections as described (18Cheng M.Y. Bullock C.M. Li C. Lee A.G. Bermak J.C. Belluzzi J. Weaver D.R. Leslie F.M. Zhou Q.Y. Nature. 2002; 417: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 24Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Relative density of hybridization signals using 35S-labeled probes were analyzed with ImageJ from NIH. Immunohistochemistry—Cryosections were blocked with 10% horse serum and incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Fluorescent secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 1:200) were added subsequently. Sections were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and viewed with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Antibody used are: mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (Novus Biologicals, 1:1000), rabbit anti-MASH1 (Chemicon, 1:100), mouse anti-Tuj1 (Covance, 1:200), rabbit anti-Ngn1 (gift from Michael Greenberg, 1:500). The specificity of Ngn1 antibody was tested by immunostaining on Ngn1–/– tissues. Combo Immunostaining with in Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed with a DIG-labeled probe. Sections were then incubated in hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, blocked in 10% horse serum, and incubated with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1:500) at 4 °C overnight. PK2-expressing cells were revealed with the TSA Plus fluorescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sections were then immunostained and viewed under a confocal microscope. Luciferase Reporter Assay—HEK293 cells were plated in 12-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well and transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). In all transfection assays, 100 ng of promoter constructs were used with 300 ng of expression constructs of Ngn1, MASH1, p300, or CBP. Cells were harvested after 36 h and analyzed for luciferase activity. Relative promoter activity was calculated as described (25Zhang C. Shin D.J. Osborne T.F. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assay was performed using an EZ-ChIP kit (Upstate Biotechnology) following the provided instructions. Tissues from wild-type (WT) or mutant mice were minced with scalpels, fixed in 1% PFA at room temperature for 15 min, and homogenized. Chromatin was released by SDS lysis buffer and sonicated to fragments ranging from 200 to 1000 bp. Antibodies against MASH1, Ngn1, and RNA polymerase II were used for immunoprecipitation. Negative controls were performed with nonspecific IgG antibody, no DNA input, and tissues from Ngn1–/– and Mash1–/– mice. Primers used for PCR are as follows: E-box 1, 5′-TCTCAGCCTCGGATACTTCAC-3′ and 5′-GTTTCACCTTCCCACTCCTG-3′; E-box 2, 5′-CTTGCCCTTTGCTTGTTTGTCTG-3′ and 5′-CTCCTCCTTCGCCGTCCTGT-3′; E-box 3, 5′-GATCAGAACCCCCACCACCA-3′ and 5′-CCTGACCCTTTCTGCCCTGA-3′; E-box 4, 5′-TGCTGGCTAATGCCACATGC-3′ and 5′-ACTTCCTGGTCCAGCCACCA-3′. In Vitro Differentiation of Neural Stem Cell—Neural stem cells were isolated from the anterior subventricular zone of adult mice as described (26Richardson A. Fedoroff S. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture.Third Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 173-197Google Scholar) and maintained as neurosphere in serum-free Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and 20 ng/ml EGF. Neurospheres were dissociated into single cells with trypsin and plated on poly-d-lysine-coated chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) at 20,000 cell/cm2. Differentiation were induced by replacing the EGF medium with medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum with PK2 or retinoid acid. Culture media were replaced every other day. The cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min and immunostained after culture. Neurosphere Assay—Neural stem cells were plated in uncoated 96-well plates at 200 cell/well in Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with different combinations of B27, PK2, and EGF. Neurospheres were allowed to grow and counted after 7 days. To test the hypothesis that proneural bHLH factors regulate PK2 gene expression in the OB, we first examined the expressions of these genes in the OB of embryonic and postnatal mice. In situ hybridization with DIG-labeled antisense probe revealed that PK2 was expressed in the ependymal and subependymal layers of the olfactory ventricle at E13. In postnatal day 0 (P0) and adult mice, PK2 was expressed in the GCL, the PGL, as well as the mitral cell layer (MCL) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, similar expression patterns of Ngn1 and Mash1 were observed in the OB of E13, P0, and adult mice (Fig. 1 and supplemental Figs. 1 and 2; sense probes showed no hybridization signals, data not shown). The expression of PK2, Ngn1, and Mash1 thus overlapped in several populations of OB neurons. Immunostaining against Ngn1 and in situ hybridization with DIG-labeled PK2 probe showed that they were co-expressed in some neurons in the OB of adult and P0 mice. Similar co-localization was also observed for MASH1 and PK2 (Fig. 1, J and K, and data not shown). We then examined whether Ngn1 and MASH1 could activate the PK2 promoter. As shown with luciferase reporter assays in HEK293 cells, heterologous expression of Ngn1 activated the PK2 promoter moderately. A stronger activation was produced upon the addition of CBP or p300, two transcriptional coactivators of Ngn1 (11Sun Y. Nadal-Vicens M. Misono S. Lin M.Z. Zubiaga A. Hua X. Fan G. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 2001; 104: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). A construct containing the proximal E-box of the PK2 promoter could also be transactivated by Ngn1, with or without CBP and p300, whereas mutation of the E-box abolished the activation (Fig. 2B). Comparable with Ngn1, heterologous expression of MASH1 also transactivated the PK2 promoter, with moderate enhancement by CBP and p300 (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, a ChIP assay confirmed the association of Ngn1 and MASH1 with the E-box motifs on the PK2 promoter in vivo in the OB (Fig. 2, C–E). These data suggested that Ngn1 and MASH1 could regulate the expression of the PK2 gene by binding the E-boxes on its promoter. We further studied the regulation of Ngn1 and MASH1 on the PK2 gene by examining the expression of the PK2 gene in the OB of Ngn1–/– and Mash1–/– mice. In situ hybridization with 35S-labeled probe showed that the expression of the PK2 gene in the OB of P0 Ngn1–/– mice was reduced to about 30% of the level in WT controls (Fig. 3A, p < 0.001, n = 4). In the OB of E16.5 Mash1–/– mice, the expression of the PK2 gene was decreased to about 50% of WT controls (Fig. 3B, p < 0.01, n = 3). These results indicated that both Ngn1 and MASH1 are critical for the expression of the PK2 gene in the OB and that the residue expression of the PK2 gene in Ngn1–/– or Mash1–/– mice might result from redundant activation of PK2 promoter by the other transcription factor. We have previously shown that PK2 functions as a chemoattractant for the migration of the progenitors for OB interneurons in adult mice (19Ng K.L. Li J.D. Cheng M.Y. Leslie F.M. Lee A.G. Zhou Q.Y. Science. 2005; 308: 1923-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). As PK2 has also been shown to promote the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (17LeCouter J. Zlot C. Tejada M. Peale F. Ferrara N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16813-16818Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27LeCouter J. Kowalski J. Foster J. Hass P. Zhang Z. Dillard-Telm L. Frantz G. Rangell L. DeGuzman L. Keller G.A. Peale F. Gurney A. Hillan K.J. Ferrara N. Nature. 2001; 412: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), we examined whether exogenous PK2 could affect the differentiation of neural stem cell. When cultured at low density (200 cells/well in a 96-well plate) in serum-free medium supplemented with 50 nm PK2, neural progenitors from the SVZ of adult mouse did not form neurosphere, indicating that PK2 cannot promote the self-renewal and proliferation of neurosphere-forming cells (Fig. 4, A and D). In addition to that, there was a great reduction in the number of neurospheres formed when PK2 was added to the medium with EGF (20 ng/ml) (Fig. 4D, 96 ± 13 neurospheres/well in medium with EGF versus 35 ± 3 neurospheres/well in medium with EGF and PK2). Moreover, most of the neurospheres formed when PK2 was presented were much smaller than the control group (Fig. 4, B, C, and E). These data suggested that PK2 could antagonize the effect of the mitogen and induce neural progenitors to exit the proliferation state. Interestingly, we saw that many progenitors stopped dividing after the first round division and thus resulted in pairs of sister cells when only PK2 was added to the medium (Fig. 4A). We then examined the fate of the newly generated cells by in vitro differentiation assay. After 7 days of culture, the percentage of β-tubulin III (Tuj1)-positive cells, a marker for immature neurons, nearly doubled from 3.6 to 6.5% and 6.8% when 10 or 50 nm PK2 was added to the medium, comparable with the neurogenic effect of 1 μm retinoid acid (Fig. 4F). After 14 days of culture, the percentage of mature neurons (using MAP2ab as marker) increased substantially when PK2 was added to the medium (Fig. 4G). Taken together, our studies indicated that PK2 could enhance the differentiation of neural progenitors into neurons. Deficiency of the PK2 gene leads to an abnormal OB architecture in adult mice, particularly the GCL and PGL (19Ng K.L. Li J.D. Cheng M.Y. Leslie F.M. Lee A.G. Zhou Q.Y. Science. 2005; 308: 1923-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Examination of the development of OB in prenatal PK2–/– mice showed evidently smaller OBs at E16 and E18 when compared with that of WT embryos (supplemental Fig. 3). Cresyl violet staining of the OB of P0 PK2–/– mice revealed a reduction of the GCL and an abnormal MCL. The reduction of the OB size in PK2–/– mice was slightly more severe than that of Ngn1–/– mice (supplemental Fig. 3) and Mash1–/– mice (28Murray R.C. Navi D. Fesenko J. Lander A.D. Calof A.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1769-1780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). We further analyzed one population of PGL interneurons in PK2–/– and Ngn1–/– mice. Alterations in the development of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive interneurons were observed in the OB of both PK2–/– and Ngn1–/– mice at P0. In the OB of Ngn1–/– mice, many TH-positive cells did not reach their destination in the PGL, but instead, were stalled in the GCL, demonstrating a defect in the migration of these interneurons. However, in the OB of PK2–/– mice, almost all TH-positive cells were stalled in the GCL, demonstrating a more severe defect in their migration (Fig. 5). The relatively moderate migration defect of TH-positive interneurons in Ngn1–/– mice might result from the residue expression of PK2 in the OB, which could still attract some of the interneurons into the PGL. The diminished expression of the PK2 gene in Ngn1–/– and Mash1–/– mice and similar defects in OB interneurons in the mutant mice implied that PK2 is a downstream target gene of Ngn1 and MASH1 in the development of the OB. Proneural bHLH factors are pivotal regulators of the development of nervous system. The known target genes of bHLH factors, most of which are transcription factors, act in cascades to regulate the proliferation, cell type determination, and differentiation of neural progenitors, as well as the migration of neurons to their destination (8Ross S.E. Greenberg M.E. Stiles C.D. Neuron. 2003; 39: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 9Bertrand N. Castro D.S. Guillemot F. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). A recent study finds that proneural bHLH factors enhance the radial migration of cortical neurons by regulating the expressions of RhoA, Dcx, and p35, genes critical for the intrinsic cell migration machinery (14Ge W. He F. Kim K.J. Blanchi B. Coskun V. Nguyen L. Wu X. Zhao J. Heng J.I. Martinowich K. Tao J. Wu H. Castro D. Sobeih M.M. Corfas G. Gleeson J.G. Greenberg M.E. Guillemot F. Sun Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In this study, we provided evidence that PK2, a ligand for G-protein-coupled receptors, is a functional target gene of Ngn1 and MASH1. Our finding implied that Ngn1 and MASH1 can also regulate the migration of olfactory interneurons by controlling the production of PK2, a chemoattractant secreted by OB neurons. This is a novel mechanism that has not been reported previously, suggesting that proneural bHLH factors can regulate cell migration by controlling extracellular signaling in addition to intrinsic migration machinery. In addition to functioning as a chemoattractant for the migration of OB interneuron progenitors, we found that PK2 can induce neural progenitors to exit proliferation and promote their differentiation into neurons. The expression of PK2 in the olfactory ventricle at E13, when the generation of mitral cells peaks, suggests that PK2 might also be involved in the development of mitral cells. Indeed, we observed an abnormal MCL in the OB of PK2–/– mice (supplemental Fig. 3). A further study of the defect of mitral cells in the OB of PK2–/– mice would shed light on the effect of PK2 on mitral cell development. Taken together, our data suggest that PK2, as a functional target gene, appears to mediate some roles of Ngn1 and MASH1 in the OB neurogenesis. Previously, we have demonstrated that PK2 gene is a functional target of another pair of bHLH factors, CLOCK and BMAL1, in the regulation of mammalian circadian clock (18Cheng M.Y. Bullock C.M. Li C. Lee A.G. Bermak J.C. Belluzzi J. Weaver D.R. Leslie F.M. Zhou Q.Y. Nature. 2002; 417: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the same set of E-boxes on the PK2 promoter appears to be utilized by both groups of bHLH factors. It has also been suggested that PK2 expression might be controlled by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, another bHLH factor and key mediator for angiogenesis under hypoxia conditions (16LeCouter J. Lin R. Tejada M. Frantz G. Peale F. Hillan K.J. Ferrara N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2685-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Our results thus establish PK2 as a common functional target gene for different bHLH factors in regulating their respective functions (supplemental Fig. 4). Our studies also provide an example that the complexity of mammalian genome is probably not due to a sheer increase in the quantity of genes but most likely to complicated gene regulation networks (29Levine M. Tjian R. Nature. 2003; 424: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Michael Greenberg for providing anti-Ngn1 antibodies. Download .pdf (.39 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2169290811,"The dopamine transporter (DAT) protein plays an important role in the termination of dopamine signaling. We addressed the hypothesis that loss of DAT function would result in a distinctive cardiorespiratory phenotype due to the significant role of dopamine in the control of breathing, especially with respect to chemical control, metabolism, and thermoregulation. The DAT knockout mouse (DAT-/-) displays a state of functional hyperdopaminergia characterized by marked novelty driven hyperactivity. Certain behavioral and drug responses in these mice are reminiscent of endophenotypes of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). We performed experiments on conscious, unrestrained DAT-/- mice (KO) and littermate DAT+/+ wild-type (WT) controls. Ventilation was measured by the barometric technique during normoxia, hypoxia, or hypercapnia. We measured core body temperature and CO2 production as an index of metabolism. DAT-/- mice displayed a significantly lower respiratory frequency than WT mice, reflecting a prolonged inspiratory time. DAT-/- mice exhibited a reduced ventilatory response to hypoxia characterized by an attenuation of both the respiratory frequency and tidal volume responses. Both groups showed similar metabolic responses to hypoxia. Circadian measurements of body temperature were significantly lower in DAT-/- mice than WT mice during inactive periods. We conclude that loss of the DAT protein in this murine model of altered dopaminergic neurotransmission results in a significant respiratory and thermal phenotype that has possible implications for understanding of conditions associated with altered dopamine regulation."

Highly purified fractions of bone morphogenetic activity isolated from bone extracts contain peptides corresponding to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; TGF, transforming growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; AP, alkaline phosphatase; WT, wild type; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; Tsg, BMP4-binding protein twisted gastrulation; hpf, hours post-fertilization. 1–7 (1Celeste A.J.

BMPs 2–7 are all TGF-β superfamily members and are involved not only in formation of bone, but in the formation of various tissues, including the nervous system, heart, and kidneys (3Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). BMPs 2 and 4 in particular have also been shown to play central roles in determining the dorsal-ventral axis in early embryogenesis (3Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 4Kishimoto Y. Lee K.H. Zon L. Hammerschmidt M. Schulte-Merker S. Development (Cambr.). 1997; 124: 4457-4466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the TGF-β-like BMPs, BMP1 is the prototype of a subgroup of structurally similar secreted metalloproteinases with astacin-like protease domains (5Ge G. Greenspan D.S. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2006; 78: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mammalian BMP1-like proteinases play key roles in formation of the extracellular matrix via biosynthetic processing of precursors into mature, functional proteins that include collagen types I–III, V, VII, and XI; laminin 5; proteoglycans biglycan and osteoglycin; and the enzyme lysyl oxidase (5Ge G. Greenspan D.S. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2006; 78: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, BMP1-like proteinases are involved in activating some TGF-β family members; including growth differentiation factors (GDFs) 8 and 11, TGF-β1, and BMPs 2 and 4, via cleavage of extracellular antagonists (5Ge G. Greenspan D.S. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2006; 78: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Ge G. Greenspan D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). BMPs 2 and 4 are activated via cleavage of the extracellular antagonist Chordin by BMP1-like proteinases (5Ge G. Greenspan D.S. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2006; 78: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). TGF-β-like factors and BMP1-like proteinases are both synthesized as precursors with NH2-terminal prodomains that are excised by subtilisin-like proprotein convertases to, in each case, yield the COOH-terminal biologically active portion of the molecule (3Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 5Ge G. Greenspan D.S. Birth Defects Res.

Thus, it is not surprising that all BMP 2–7 tryptic peptides obtained from bone morphogenetic fractions correspond to sequences within the COOH-terminal biologically active portion of these proteins, downstream of the proprotein convertase cleavage site (1Celeste A.J. Iannazzi J.A. Taylor R.C. Hewick R.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Wozney J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9843-9847Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 2Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J.

In contrast, all BMP1 tryptic peptides obtained from bone morphogenetic fractions of bone extracts have corresponded to sequences within the NH2-terminal prodomain region of this protein (2Wozney J.M.

Thus, the BMP1 prodomain, which is thought to be cleaved upon secretion of BMP1 by fibrogenic cells (9Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), perhaps within the trans-Golgi network (10Leighton M. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18478-18484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), persists in bone and co-purifies through a large number of varied biochemical purification steps (8Wang E.A. Rosen V. Cordes P. Hewick R.M. Kriz M.J. Luxenberg D.P. Sibley B.S. Wozney J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9484-9488Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) with TGF-β-like BMPs 2–7. Persistence of the BMP1 prodomain in bone suggests a role in bone biology, whereas co-purification through multiple protein separation steps with TGF-β-like BMPs in morphogenetic fractions of bone extracts suggests that the BMP1 prodomain might interact with the TGF-β-like proteins. In the present study, it is demonstrated that the BMP1 prodomain binds active BMP2 and BMP4 with high specificity and high avidity (KD = 10.9 nm); that it is capable of modulating signaling by these BMPs in vitro and in vivo; and that BMP1 prodomain-BMP4 complexes are found in cell culture media and within human tissues. Expression Constructs—A construct for expression of mutagenized proBMP1, in which the prodomain is impervious to SPC activity, was generated via PCR using reverse primer 5′-TCGGGACGTCGCCGCCTGCTGGCTACTGGATCTACCTCTCCA-3′, which encodes proBMP1 sequences in which sequences encoding the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase recognition site RSRR were converted to sequences encoding residues SSQQ. ProBMP1 sequences within vector pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) were used as template, and T3 primer was used as the forward primer. The resulting amplimer was digested with AflII and AatII and used to replace the corresponding wild-type fragment in the original proBMP1/pBluescript clone. Subsequently, an AflII-ApaI fragment containing the mutation was excised from the pBluescript construct and exchanged for the corresponding wild-type fragment in full-length proBMP1 sequences previously placed within vector pcDNA4/TO-His (Invitrogen), such that mutant proBMP1 produced by the resultant construct would have a COOH-terminal His tag. To create recombinant baculovirus for expression of the BMP1 prodomain, PCR amplification was performed, using primers 5′-GAGTAGATCTAGACCTAGCCGACTACACCTATGACCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGTGCTAGCCGCCGGCTACGGGATCTACCTCTCC-3′ (reverse), and using wild-type proBMP1 sequences in pcDNA4/TO as the template. The resulting amplimer was restricted with BglII and NheI, and then inserted between the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pAcGP67.coco baculovirus transfer vector (11Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (kind gift of Deane F. Mosher, University of Wisconsin-Madison). The pAcGP67.coco vector is a modification of vector pAcGP67A (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), with sequences encoding the thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS) and a six-histidine tag (His6 tag) added immediately 3′ to the multiple cloning site. Recombinant baculovirus was generated by co-transfection with Baculogold-linearized AcNPV viral DNA (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) into SF9 cells (InVitrogen). Recombinant baculovirus was propagated, and protein was expressed and purified as described by Mosher et al. (11Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To create a construct for expression of a BMP1 prodomain-Fc fusion protein, a KpnI-NgoMI cDNA fragment encoding BMP1 prodomain sequences fused to BM40 signal peptide sequences (12Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) was inserted between a KpnI site and a BamHI site that had been blunt-ended with Klenow fragment in a construct that contained enterokinase cleavage site sequences, followed by sequences encoding the human IgG1 Fc domain, in a pcDNA3 backbone (13Lum L. Reid M.S. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26236-26247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The enterokinase site/Fc domain construct was the kind gift of Carl P. Blobel (Hospital for Special Surgery, Cornell University). To generate mRNA for injection into zebrafish embryos, BMP1 prodomain sequences were PCR-amplified with primers 5′-CTGAGAATTCCCAGCACCATGAGGGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGTTCTAGACTACCGCCGGCTACGGGATCTACCT-3′ (reverse) and inserted between the EcoRI and XbaI sites of vector pCS2+. To generate mRNA for expression of a BMP1 prodomain/CD-2 fusion protein, prodomain sequences were PCR-amplified with primers 5′-CTGAGGATCCAGCACCATGAGGGCCTGGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACTGAATTCCCTAGGCGGCTACGGGATCTACC-3′(reverse). The resulting amplimer, which contained AvrII and EcoRI, sites in reverse primer sequences, was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and was inserted between corresponding sites of pCS2+. The resulting construct was restricted with AvrII and EcoRI, for placement of an AvrII-EcoRI cDNA fragment encoding rat CD-2 transdomain and partial exodomain sequences (kind gift from Gary Struhl, Columbia University). Protein Biochemistry—For expression of recombinant proteins, constructs were transfected into T-REx 293 cells using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen). Recombinant proteins with His tags or Fc domains were purified from conditioned serum-free medium using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) or protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. FLAG-tagged murine Chordin and wild-type human BMP1 were produced, purified, and analyzed for purity on zinc-stained SDS-PAGE gels as previously described (12Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Concentrations of purified proteins were calculated by comparing intensities of Coomassie Blue-stained bands from serial dilutions of each sample to those of serially diluted bovine serum albumin of known concentrations. Procollagen and Chordin cleavage assays were performed as previously described (12Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations of recombinant proteins were performed as previously described (14Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Maas S.A. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), using equimolar amounts of purified proteins. For the competition experiment, 5 nm proBMP1SSQQ was incubated 30 min at 37 °C with 5 nm BMP4 in the presence of excess BMP2, BMP5, EGF, or TGF-β1 (with the extent of excess noted in the text) and immunoprecipitated. Similarly, mBMPR-1A/Fc was incubated with BMP4 under conditions similar to those described above, was competed with equimolar amounts of Chordin or BMP1 Prodomain, and complexes were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose. For immunoprecipitations from MG-63 cultures, 80% confluent MG-63 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated 15 min with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C, followed by two PBS washes. Cells were then incubated 48 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D systems). Conditioned medium was harvested and cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, followed by lysing in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% CHAPS, 10% glycerol; with clearing of lysates by centrifugation. Cell lysate or conditioned medium, with Triton X-100 and CHAPS added to 0.1% final concentrations, was precleared with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C. Anti-BMP1 prodomain antibodies or preimmune serum was then added, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to six 10-min washes with PBS/0.5% Triton X-100, followed by elution of samples with SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, and separation of samples on 4–20% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (Bio-Rad). Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-BMP1 prodomain antibodies or monoclonal anti-BMP4 antibody (R&D systems). Separate dermal and epidermal extracts were obtained from neonatal foreskin, essentially as described by Bruckner-Tuderman et al. (15Bruckner-Tuderman L. Schnyder U.W. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), except that dermal extraction was performed in the absence of reducing agents. Briefly, artificial epidermolysis was performed in 1 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid (buffer 1) for 72 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, epidermis was peeled off, and the dermis was extracted twice for 30 s at 95 °C with 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 2% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid (buffer 2). Epidermis in buffer 1 and dermis in buffer 2 were separately homogenized and supernatants were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 10 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid; and used for immunoprecipitation with anti-prodomain antibody. Western blots were performed as described in Scott et al. (12Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Recombinant BMP2, BMP4, BMP5, EGF, BMPR-1A/Fc, and TGF-β1 were all purchased from R&D systems. Antibodies—Antibody was raised against recombinant BMP1 prodomain produced by the recombinant baculovirus described above. The His-tagged protein was purified with Ni-NTA resin; followed by removal of the His tag by thrombin cleavage, SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis on a preparatory gel, and excision of a single band, visualized with Coomassie Blue. The band was equilibrated with PBS, emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant, and injected subcutaneously into a New Zealand White rabbit. The rabbit was boosted twice at 4-week intervals with 250 μg of His-tagged BMP1 prodomain in Freund's incomplete adjuvant per boost. Antibodies were purified on a prodomain affinity column of purified prodomain-His, coupled in 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.5 to CNBr-activated agarose (Sigma). After washing the column with 10 bed volumes of 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, bound antibody was eluted with 10 bed volumes of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. Antibody-containing pools were dialyzed against PBS, 0.2% sodium azide and then stored at -70 °C. Specificity of the affinity-purified antibody was ascertained by immunoblotting of conditioned medium of TGF-β-treated MG-63 cells. Although the latter produce both 104-kDa proBMP1 and 79-kDa mature BMP1 (9Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), only the former was detected by the antibody (Fig. 4D). For immunoblots, prodomain antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution; anti-BMP4, anti-TGF-β, and anti-BMPR1A antibodies (R&D) at 1:5000; and anti-BMP2, anti-EGF, and anti-BMP-5 (R&D) at 1:1000. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—SPR measurements were performed in a BIAcore 2000 system. Recombinant BMP2, the generous gift of Elisabeth Schwarz (16Hillger F. Herr G. Rudolph R. Schwarz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14974-14980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), was dissolved at 2.5 μg/ml in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.7) and immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip, using the amine coupling method, to a level of ∼887 response units. BMP1 Prodomain-Fc fusion protein was purified, and the Fc portion was cleaved off with Enterokinase (Novagen). Enterokinase and Fc domains were removed using Ekapture agarose (Novagen) and protein G-Sepharose, respectively. The BMP2 used for SPR was produced, purified, and analyzed for purity on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels, as previously described (16Hillger F. Herr G. Rudolph R. Schwarz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14974-14980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Control flow cells were prepared by executing the coupling reaction in the presence of coupling buffer alone. Control cells were then used to obtain control sensorgrams showing nonspecific binding to the surface as well as refractive index changes resulting from changes in bulk properties of the solution. Control sensorgrams were subtracted from sensorgrams obtained with immobilized ligand to yield accurate binding responses. Binding and washes were performed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween-20. Each experimental cycle consisted of an initial 4-min flow of various concentrations of BMP1 prodomain or Chordin into the respective flow cells at a flow rate of 20 μl/min, followed by a 4-min flow of buffer. After each cycle, chip surfaces were regenerated by a 5-s flow of 0.1 m HAc, 1 m NaCl, 5 m guanidine-HCl. Data were analyzed with BIAevaluation 4.1 software and curve-fitting was done with the assumption of one-to-one binding. SPR experiments were conducted by G. G. at the Biophysics Instrumentation Facility (Department of Biochemistry), established by funding from NSF (BIR-9512577), NIH (S10 RR13790), and the University of Wisconsin. RNA Preparation, Embryo Microinjections, and in Situ Hybridization—ProCS2+ vector constructs were linearized with BssHII, and RNA was prepared using the mMessage mMachine SP6 kit (Ambion). Zebrafish embryos were micro-injected at the 1–2 cell stage and imaged using a Leica, FL III dissecting microscope and a digital color camera (Diagnostic Instruments Spot Insight). For in situ hybridizations, embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, washed with PBS-Tween 20, and permeabilized with 100% methanol, prior to removal of the chorion. Dechorionated embryos were incubated 1 h in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% Tween-20) at 68 °C and were then incubated with in vitro digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe in hybridization buffer plus 5 mg/ml yeast RNA and 50 μg/ml heparin overnight at 68 °C. Following incubation with probe, embryos were washed in 2× SSCT (SSC, 0.1% Tween-20) at 68 °C, rinsed with 1× maleate buffer (150 mm maleic acid, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), and blocked in 1× blocking reagent (Boehringer) in maleate buffer for 1–4 h at room temperature. Anti-digoxigenin Fab-AP (Boehringer) was added diluted 1:5000, followed by detection with insoluble alkaline phosphatase substrate NBT/BCIP. Goosecoid, chordin, and gata2 in situ hybridization probes, corresponding to full-length cDNA sequences, have been previously described (17Detrich 3rd, H.W. Kieran M.W. Chan F.Y. Barone L.M. Yee K.

Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) BMP Signaling Assay—AP assays were performed as previously described (21Jasuja R. Allen B.L. Pappano W.N. Rapraeger A.C. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51289-51297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, M2–10B4 cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates at 10,000 cells per well. After 16 h, cells were washed once with PBS and then placed in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum containing either 6 nm BMP4 (dissolved in 4 mm HCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) or 6 nm BMP4 that had been preincubated with proBMP1 or BMP1 prodomain at 37 °C. AP activity was determined 48-h later. Cells were washed once with PBS and lysed by freeze-thawing twice in 50 μl of 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2. 150 μl of AP buffer (5 mg of p-nitrophenyl phosphate dissolved in 2.5 ml of Sigma 221 alkaline buffer solution diluted 1:2 with water) was added to each well, and plates were incubated 1 h at 37 °C. AP activity was then measured by absorbance readings at 405 nm using a Universal Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski VT). ProBMP1, but Not Mature BMP1, Specifically Binds BMPs 2 and 4—To begin characterizing possible functional roles of the BMP1 prodomain, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to alter the proBMP1 furin recognition site RSRR to SSQQ (Fig. 1A), to enable comparison of the properties of pro and mature BMP1. When expressed in transfected T-Rex-293 cells, only full-length proBMP1SSQQ was detected in conditioned medium, with no evidence of processing to mature BMP1 (Fig. 1B). The proBMP1SSQQ displayed no detectable activity for processing BMP1 substrates type I procollagen (Fig. 1C) and Chordin (Fig. 1D). Moreover, proBMP1SSQQ was found to interfere with cleavage of procollagen and Chordin by mature/active wild-type BMP1 (Fig. 1, C and D). There is evidence that BMP1-like proteinases do not form oligomers (22Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the apparent dominant negative effect of proBMP1SSQQ likely results from binding to, and sequestering of substrate. The ability of proBMP1SSQQ to bind substrate, suggests that it is correctly folded. In an initial attempt to ascertain the ability of BMP1 prodomain sequences to interact with TGF-β-like BMPs, mature BMP1, and proBMP1SSQQ were separately incubated with BMP4, and then immunoprecipitated with anti-BMP1 antibody. Immunoprecipitation of proBMP1SSQQ, but not of mature BMP1, was found to co-precipitate BMP4 (Fig. 2A); consistent with the probability that BMP1 prodomain sequences bind BMP4. Moreover, this binding is highly specific, as closely related BMP2 (93% sequence identity) readily displaced BMP4 from binding to proBMP1SSQQ, and was itself pulled down by proBMP1SSQQ from which BMP4 had been displaced (Fig. 2B). Competition of BMPs 2 and 4 for binding to the BMP1 prodomain is not surprising, given their close sequence homology and evidence of similar binding of the two proteins to previously described BMP-binding proteins (23Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 24Zimmerman L.B. De Jesús-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). In contrast, 10-fold molar excesses of the unrelated growth factor EGF, or even other TGF-β-like growth factors such as TGF-β1 (36% sequence identity to BMP4) or BMP5 (54% sequence identity to BMP4) did not compete with BMP4 for binding to proBMP1SSQQ (data not shown). BMP1 Prodomain Sequences Specifically Bind BMP2/4 with High Affinity—To more closely explore the ability of BMP1 prodomain sequences to interact with TGF-β-like BMPs, BMP1 prodomain, free of other sequences other than a COOH-terminal His tag, was produced in a baculovirus system (Fig. 2C). In addition, for such studies antibodies were raised against the recombinant prodomain, capable of detecting 6 ng of prodomain at a 1:20,000 antibody dilution (Fig. 2D). Upon incubation of the His-tagged BMP1 prodomain with BMP4, pull down of the His-tagged prodomain with nickel-charged resin was found to co-precipitate BMP4 (Fig. 3A). Similarly, pull down of the prodomain with the anti-BMP1 prodomain antibodies also co-precipitated BMP2 (Fig. 3B). Thus, BMPs-2 and 4 are bound by the BMP1 prodomain. The specificity of this interaction is demonstrated in Fig. 3C, in which a 10-fold molar excess of BMP2, but not of TGF-β1, EGF, or BMP5, effectively competed with BMP4 for binding to the BMP1 prodomain. To compare the affinity of the BMP1 prodomain for BMP4 to that of Chordin, a known in vivo BMP4-binding partner (23Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), an equilibrium binding experiment was performed. This experiment entailed incubating BMP4 with an equimolar amount of soluble BMP receptor IA (ALK-3), fused to an Fc domain, in the presence of 1:1, 2:1, or 5:1 molar ratios of either BMP1 prodomain or Chordin. As can be seen (Fig. 3D), BMP1 prodomain, like Chordin, was able to effectively compete with the BMPR-IA-Fc fusion protein for BMP4 binding, and both proteins were able to essentially block BMP4 binding to the BMPR-1A-Fc fusion protein at a molar ratio of 5:1. Thus, affinity of the BMP1 prodomain for BMP4 is shown to be of the same order of magnitude as the affinity of Chordin for this ligand. BMP1 Prodomain Sequences Bind BMP2 with an Apparent KD of 11 nm—To quantitate the strength of the interaction between the BMP1 prodomain and BMP2, binding affinity was determined via surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) analysis. Toward this end, BMP2 was immobilized on the surface of a sensor chip, and the strength of binding was separately determined for different concentrations of BMP1 prodomain. Toward this end, a BMP1 prodomain-Fc fusion protein was produced and purified (Fig. 4A), the Fc domain was removed, and the prodomain region was repurified (Fig. 4B). For comparison, the strength of binding to immobilized BMP2 was also determined for different concentrations of Chordin. From the kinetic association and dissociation rates, the equilibrium dissociation constants (apparent KD) for binding of BMP1 prodomain (Fig. 4C) and Chordin (Fig. 4D) to BMP2 were calculated to be ∼11 and 7 nm, respectively. The apparent KD for murine Chordin calculated here, is comparable to the KD of ∼12 nm previously calculated for murine Chordin via surface plasmon resonance (25Rentzsch F. Zhang J. Kramer C. Sebald W. Hammerschmidt M. Development. 2006; 133: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the KD calculated here for BMP1 prodomain binding of BMP2 is clearly in the same range as the KD values of proteins like Chordin and Crossveinless 2 (25Rentzsch F. Zhang J. Kramer C. Sebald W. Hammerschmidt M. Development. 2006; 133: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which are thought to bind BMPs 2 and 4 in vivo and modulate their signaling under physiological conditions.

Mutant forms of Aβ, including Dutch- and Iowa-type Aβ, which are responsible for familial CAA, deposit primarily as fibrillar amyloid along the cerebral vasculature and are either absent or present only as diffuse non-fibrillar plaques in the brain parenchyma. Despite the lack of parenchymal fibril formation in vivo, these CAA mutant Aβ peptides exhibit a markedly increased rate and extent of fibril formation in vitro compared with wild-type Aβ. Based on these conflicting observations, we sought to determine whether brain parenchymal factors that selectively interact with and modulate CAA mutant Aβ fibril assembly exist. Using a combination of immunoaffinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified myelin basic protein (MBP) as a prominent brain parenchymal factor that preferentially binds to CAA mutant Aβ compared with wild-type Aβ. Surface plasmon resonance measurements confirmed that MBP bound more tightly to Dutch/Iowa CAA double mutant Aβ than to wild-type Aβ. Using a combination of biochemical and ultrastructural techniques, we found that MBP inhibited the fibril assembly of CAA mutant Aβ. Together, these findings suggest a possible role for MBP in regulating parenchymal fibrillar Aβ deposition in familial CAA.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 8: 741-766Crossref Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). Aβ is a 39–43-amino acid peptide that exhibits a high propensity to self-assemble into β-sheet-containing oligomeric forms and fibrils (2Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides are proteolytically produced from the amyloid β-protein precursor (AβPP), a large type I integral membrane protein, through sequential proteolysis by β- and γ-secretase activities (3Vassar R.

Cerebral deposition of Aβ in the parenchyma can occur as diffuse plaques, with little surrounding pathology, or as fibrillar plaques associated with dystrophic neurons, neurofibrillary tangles, and inflammation (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 8: 741-766Crossref Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). Fibrillar Aβ deposition also occurs within and along primarily small and medium arteries and arterioles of the cerebral cortex and leptomeninges and in the cerebral microvasculature, a condition known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (7Vinters H.V. Stroke. 1987; 18: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 8Jellinger K.A. J. Neural Transm. 2002; 109: 813-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 9Vinters H.V. Farag E.S. Adv.

This condition accounts for up to 20% of all spontaneous primary intracerebral hemorrhages and is a key pathological lesion in nearly all patients with Alzheimer disease and certain related disorders. Accumulation of fibrillar cerebral vascular Aβ has been shown to cause degeneration and cell death of smooth muscle cells and pericytes in affected larger cerebral vessels and cerebral microvessels, respectively (9Vinters H.V.

Recent findings have implicated cerebral microvascular Aβ deposition in promoting neuroinflammation and dementia in Alzheimer disease (12Bailey T.L. Rivara C.B. Rocher A.B. Hof P.R. Neurol.

In contrast to the Dutch-type disease, Iowa-type CAA appears to be more localized to the cerebral microvasculature, and although cerebral hemorrhage is not common, ischemic damage is observed (21Grabowski T.J.

It is noteworthy that the Dutch-type (E22Q) and Iowa-type (D23N) mutations are adjacent within the Aβ peptide and that both result in loss of a negative charge at their respective sites. We found that including each of these mutations together in the same Aβ peptide (Dutch/Iowa CAA double mutant Aβ40 peptide (Aβ40DI)) further enhances the fibrillogenic and pathogenic properties in vitro (34Van Nostrand W.E.

Furthermore, in transgenic mice, Aβ40DI retains the characteristic pattern of in vivo deposition of the Dutch and Iowa mutant peptides, including extensive fibrillar amyloid deposition along the cerebral vasculature accompanied by predominantly diffuse Aβ accumulation in the brain parenchyma (35Davis J. Xu F. Deane R. Romanov G. Previti M.L. Zeigler K. Zlokovic B.V. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20296-20306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, the reason as to why the Dutch- and Iowa-type mutations lead to preferential accumulation of fibrillar amyloid exclusively in the cerebral vasculature and not in the brain parenchyma is unclear. A number of naturally occurring “Aβ chaperone”-binding molecules that have been reported to modulate fibrillar assembly of the peptide have been identified. For example, apoE has been described to either promote or inhibit Aβ fibril formation in vitro (36Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.-M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D.

Subsequent studies have suggested that the dual effects of apoE are dependent on the isoform (apoE3 versus apoE4) and/or the extent of lipidation (41Aleshkov S. Abraham C.R. Zannis V.I.

The involvement of these Aβ chaperones in promoting or inhibiting CAA mutant Aβ fibril formation remains largely unknown. With this in mind, one approach we have taken is to identify molecules that preferentially bind to CAA mutant forms of Aβ and that may modulate their fibrillar assembly. In this study, we identified myelin basic protein (MBP) as an endogenous brain protein that preferentially binds to familial CAA mutant forms of Aβ. This was demonstrated by a combination of affinity chromatography of normal human brain homogenate and mass spectrometry analysis and confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) kinetic binding experiments. Furthermore, we show that MBP effectively inhibits the fibrillar assembly of CAA mutant Aβ by biochemical methods as well as by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Therefore, we postulate that MBP may be involved, at least in part, in regulating the compartment-specific fibrillar deposition of CAA mutant Aβ within the brain. Reagents and Chemicals—Aβ peptides were synthesized by solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acid chemistry, purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and structurally characterized as described previously (55Burdick D.

N-terminally biotinylated Aβ peptides were purchased from American Peptide Company Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). Aβ peptides were initially prepared in hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol, dried, and resuspended in Me2SO as described previously (56Stine Jr., W.B. Dahlgren K.N. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol.

Control samples containing 0.5% Me2SO and 1.56 μm MBP or lactalbumin in PBS were also included. At each time point, 100-μl samples of each reaction were placed in a 96-well microplate in triplicate, and 5 μl of 100 μm thioflavin T was added. The plate was mixed and incubated at 22 °C in the dark for 10 min. Fluorescence was measured at 490 nm with an excitation wave-length of 446 nm in a SpectraMax spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using SoftMax Pro control software. Immunohistochemistry—Tg2576 and Tg-SwDI transgenic mice were killed at 24 months, and the brains were removed and bisected through the mid-sagittal plane. Cerebral hemispheres were immersion-fixed with 70% ethanol overnight and subjected to increasing sequential dehydration in ethanol, followed by xylene treatment and embedding in paraffin. Sagittal sections were cut at 10-μm thickness using a microtome, placed in a flotation water bath at 45 °C, and then mounted on ColorFrost Plus slides (Fisher). Paraffin was removed from the sections by washing with xylene, and the tissue sections were rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by treatment with proteinase K (0.001 mg/ml) for 5 min at 22 °C. Immunostaining was performed using anti-Aβ mAb 66.1 (1:300 dilution). Primary antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and visualized with a stable diaminobenzidine solution (Invitrogen). Detection of fibrillar amyloid was performed by incubating the sections with 1% thioflavin S in PBS in the dark for 5 min at 22 °C, followed by washing three times (3 min each) with 50% ethanol. Images were captured using an Olympus BX60 optical microscope and an Olympus DP10 charge-coupled device camera. Affinity Chromatography of Human Brain Homogenate—To prepare affinity resins, biotinylated wild-type Aβ40 peptide (Aβ40WT) and Aβ40DI were each redissolved in 20 mm NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.5) and applied to ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Immobilized ligands were cross-linked with 2 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) for 30 min with rocking at room temperature in 20 mm NaHCO3 (pH 8.5). Cross-linking reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 20 mm. Homogenates of normal human brain frontal cortex were prepared in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl and 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)) containing Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were loaded onto Tris-buffered saline-equilibrated affinity columns (0.8 × 4 cm) under gravity flow. After extensive washing, the columns were eluted with 0.2 m glycine and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 2.7) and collected into tubes containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, 50 μm iodoacetate, 50 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% Tris/glycine gradient gels. All runs were carried out at 4 °C. Three separate affinity chromatography runs were carried out for each column ligand. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Protein bands separated by SDS-PAGE were excised from the polyacrylamide gels and digested overnight with sequencing-grade trypsin in situ at 37 °C. Samples were run on a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) operating in the reflector mode. Samples were dissolved in a 50% solution of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (5 mg/ml) and dried on the sample plate. A nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm was employed to ionize the sample. The accelerating voltage was set to 20 kV employing a 275-ns delay before introduction of ions into the flight tube of the mass spectrometer. The mass scale (m/z 500–5000) was calibrated with a mixture of peptides (400 fmol/μl), and ∼100 laser shots were used to produce each spectrum. Peak lists were submitted to the Mascot search engine with no taxonomy limitation and a peptide tolerance set to 100 ppm. Immunoblot Analysis—Briefly, samples were heated at 90 °C for 5 min in reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer, loaded onto gels, and electrophoresed. Gels were transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) at 50 V overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% milk or bovine serum albumin (BSA; used with biotinylated primary antibodies) at room temperature for 1 h and washed 3 × 10 min with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h and washed as described above. Next, the membranes were incubated with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (both from Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and washed. Detection was accomplished using ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce), and images were captured either on film or using a VersaDoc 3000 imaging system (Bio-Rad) and quantitated with the manufacturer's Quantity One software. Co-immunoprecipitation—Aβ peptides were resuspended in Me2SO to 2.5 mm and used at 10.8 μm. MBP was used at 1.56 μm. Proteins were combined in 250 μl of incubation buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% BSA). Anti-MBP mAb 382 was added to each sample mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. After incubation, 20 μl of washed GammaBind protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each mixture, followed by incubation for an additional 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. Beads were separated by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 2 min. Supernatants were removed, and beads were washed with 1 ml of incubation buffer. Separation and washing were repeated three times. A final wash was performed in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 to remove excess BSA. Centrifuged beads were combined with 25 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated as described above. 10 μl of each sample/loading buffer mixture was loaded onto 10–20% Tricine gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed at 125 V for 35 min. Immunoblotting was carried out as described above using either biotinylated anti-MBP mAb 384 or biotinylated anti-Aβ mAb 3D6 as primary antibody. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Dot Blot Analysis—Aβ peptides and the AβPP-(744–763) and AβPP-(100–119) peptides (Multiple Peptide Systems, San Diego, CA) were diluted to 2 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline from 10 mg/ml Me2SO stock solutions. Insulin (Sigma) was resuspended to 2 mg/ml in water at pH 2.0 and diluted to 2 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline. 1 μg of each was immobilized onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes using a Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each membrane was removed from the apparatus following immobilization and blocked overnight in 5% BSA and PBS at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated in 1 μg/ml MBP in 5% BSA, PBS, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed 3 × 10 min with 5% BSA, PBS, and 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with mAb 384 (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was next washed 3 × 10 min with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Detection and quantitation were performed as described above. Surface Plasmon Resonance—All runs were performed on a Biacore 2000 instrument using 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20 as running buffer and diluent. Streptavidin was conjugated to the surface of three flow cells of a CM5 chip at 10 μl/min using amine coupling chemistry to a final average response level of 1890.2 response units. N-terminally biotinylated Aβ peptides were resuspended in Me2SO to 2.5 mm and serially diluted to 13 nm immediately before application. Biotinylated Aβ40WT and Aβ40DI were bound to individual flow cells at 10 μl/min to achieve an average relative response level of 157.1 response units, leaving flow cell 1 as reference. This chip preparation procedure was found to result in a surface that minimized mass transfer effects for kinetic interaction experiments. The resultant Rmax of these surfaces was ∼700 response units with MBP as analyte. Purified MBP was passed over all four flow cells at 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 nm at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for kinetic measureme"
https://openalex.org/W2039500802,"Human blood group A and B antigens are produced by two closely related glycosyltransferase enzymes. An N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GTA) utilizes UDP-GalNAc to extend H antigen acceptors (Fucα(1–2)Galβ-OR) producing A antigens, whereas a galactosyltransferase (GTB) utilizes UDP-Gal as a donor to extend H structures producing B antigens. GTA and GTB have a characteristic 211DVD213 motif that coordinates to a Mn2+ ion shown to be critical in donor binding and catalysis. Three GTB mutants, M214V, M214T, and M214R, with alterations adjacent to the 211DVD213 motif have been identified in blood banking laboratories. From serological phenotyping, individuals with the M214R mutation show the Bel variant expressing very low levels of B antigens, whereas those with M214T and M214V mutations give rise to AweakB phenotypes. Kinetic analysis of recombinant mutant GTB enzymes revealed that M214R has a 1200-fold decrease in kcat compared with wild type GTB. The crystal structure of M214R showed that DVD motif coordination to Mn2+ was disrupted by Arg-214 causing displacement of the metal by a water molecule. Kinetic characterizations of the M214T and M214V mutants revealed they both had GTA and GTB activity consistent with the serology. The crystal structure of the M214T mutant showed no change in DVD coordination to Mn2+. Instead a critical residue, Met-266, which is responsible for determining donor specificity, had adopted alternate conformations. The conformation with the highest occupancy opens up the active site to accommodate the larger A-specific donor, UDP-GalNAc, accounting for the dual specificity.

The conformation with the highest occupancy opens up the active site to accommodate the larger A-specific donor, UDP-GalNAc, accounting for the dual specificity. The ABH histo-blood group antigens are inherited carbohydrate structures on erythrocytes and other cells. Individuals with blood group A carry at least one allele encoding a 3-α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GTA), 4The abbreviations used are: GTA, 3-α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; GTB, 3-α-galactosyltransferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. whereas those with blood group B have at least one allele giving rise to an 3-α-galactosyltransferase (GTB). GTA utilizes UDP-GalNAc as its donor substrate and the Fucα(1–2)Galβ-OR structure as an acceptor, where R is a glycoprotein or glycolipid (Fig. 1). Thus GTA synthesizes the blood group A antigen, GalNAcα(1–3)[Fucα(1–2)]Galβ-OR. GTB uses UDP-Gal as a donor for the same H acceptor, yielding the B antigen, Galα(1–3)[Fucα (1–2)]Galβ-OR (Fig. 1). GTA and GTB are highly homologous enzymes differing in only 4 of 354 amino acids, Arg/Gly-176, Gly/Ser-235, Leu/Met-266, and Gly/Ala-268 (1Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S.

Kinetic studies demonstrated that residue Leu/Met-266 is critical for differentiating between the UDP-GalNAc donor for GTA and the UDP-Gal donor of GTB (3Seto N.O.L. Compston C.A. Evans S.V. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Palcic M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This observation was understood upon the determination of their crystal structures (4Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), where the larger side chain of Met-266 in GTB blocks the N-acetyl group of the donor sugar from binding in the active site. In GTA the smaller side chain of Leu-266 allows the N-acetyl group of the UDP-GalNAc donor into the active site. Glycosyltransferases have been categorized into 87 different families based on amino acid sequence similarity (5Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol.

The blood group-synthesizing GTA and GTB are classified as retaining, metal-dependent, family 6 enzymes. However, despite the enormous sequence diversity of glycosyltransferase enzymes, only two major structural folds have been observed, the GT-A fold and the GT-B fold (6Davies G.J. Gloster T.M.

The blood group GTA and GTB enzymes both exhibit the GT-A structural fold (4Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct.

Enzymes with a GT-A fold frequently require metals (Mn2+,Mg2+) for activity (7Breton C. Snajdrova L. Jeanneau C. Koca J. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 29R-37RCrossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and have a characteristic DXDor equivalent motif that coordinates to the phosphate in the donor via the metal (4Patenaude S.I.

The Asp residues coordinate a Mn2+ ion, which in turn coordinates to the phosphates of the UDP-sugar donor. Both aspartate residues bind to the Mn2+ including a bidentate coordinate bond by Asp-213 (4Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct.

The only exception reported to date is leukocyte type 2 6-β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, which displays the GT-A fold type but lacks a DXD metal ion binding site.

The subgroups of the ABO blood group system were originally characterized based on their serological behavior in red blood cells and plasma typing. Subsequently, individuals with anomalous blood grouping results were further categorized following DNA sequencing of their ABO genes (16Olsson M.L. Irshaid N.M. Hosseini-Maaf B. Hellberg Å.

These subgroups include variants of blood group B, in which individuals with mutations adjacent to the 211DVD213 motif, M214V or M214T, have been classified as AweakB subgroups (19Deng Z.H. Yu Q. Wu G.G. Lian Y.L. Su Y.Q. Li D.C. Wang D.M. Zhang S.Y. Vox Sang. 2005; 89: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The erythrocytes in these cases react weakly with some anti-A reagents as well as with all anti-B sera, suggesting that the blood group glycosyltransferase exhibits GalNAc as well as Gal transferase activity. A third mutation, M214R, has been classified as aBel subgroup (20Ogasawara K. Yabe R. Uchikawa M. Saitou N. Bannai M. Nakata K. Takenaka M. Fujisawa K. Ishikawa Y. Juji T. Tokunaga T. Blood. 1996; 88: 2732-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of B determinant on these erythrocytes is very low, so that they do not agglutinate when incubated with monoclonal or polyclonal anti-B reagents. However, upon incubation with polyclonal blood grouping reagents, these cells will adsorb and subsequently elute measurable quantities of anti-B. Also, these individuals typically lack anti-B in their sera. Here we report the expression, kinetic analysis, structure determination by single crystal x-ray diffraction, and structurefunction correlations of variant GTB enzymes corresponding to the naturally occurring mutants, M214T, M214R, and M214V, which all have mutations adjacent to the DXD motif. Each of these constructs is based on the same synthetic gene that has been previously used for high level expression of soluble GTB in Escherichia coli (3Seto N.O.L. Compston C.A. Evans S.V.

Materials—Oligodeoxynucleotides, UDP, UDP-Gal, and UDP-GalNAc were obtained from Sigma. The acceptor substrate (Fucα(1–2)Galβ(CH2)7CH3) was a kind gift from Prof. Ole Hindsgaul. Sep-Pak C18 reverse-phase cartridges (Waters), UDP-[6-3H]GalNAc (50μCi/mmol) and UDP-[6-3H]Gal(250μCi/mmol) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals), Ecolite(+) liquid scintillation mixture (ICN), Vivaspin protein concentrators (Vivascience AG, Hannover, Germany), and restriction enzymes (Promega) were obtained from the suppliers indicated. All other chemicals used were of at least reagent grade. Site-directed Mutagenesis—A QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate mutants. The PCR step was performed in a thermocycler Peltier Thermal PTC-200 (Bio-Rad). The plasmid pCWΔlac vector harboring the –10GTB (amino acids 63–354) gene was used as a template. The PCRs were carried out according to the supplier's instructions. The primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: M214Tsense, GCGTTGACGTTGACACCGAGTTCCGTGACCAC; M214Tantisense, GTGGTCACGGAACTCGGTGTCAACGTCAACG; M214Vsense, GCGTTGACGTTGACGTGGAGTTCCGTGAC; M214Vantisense, GTCACGGAACTCCACGTCAACGTCAACGC; M214Rsense, CGTTGACGTTGACAGGGAGTTCCGTGACC; and M214Rantisense, GGTCACGGAACTCCCTGTCAACGTCAACG. The nucleotides that were altered are underlined. The PCR reaction mixture was treated with 1 μl of DpnI (10 units/μl) for 60 min at 37 °C to digest template-methylated nonmutated plasmid DNA. The DpnI-treated plasmids were transformed into E. coli XL10-Gold cells, and sequencing was performed by Agowa (Berlin, Germany). Positive mutants were transformed into E. coli BL21 Gold cells for expression. Expression in E. coli—The enzyme variants were expressed in E. coli BL21 Gold cells and purified with a two-step protocol using an ion-exchanger step followed by a UDP-hexanolamine affinity column as described previously (3Seto N.O.L.

Kinetics—Kinetics were carried out with a radiochemical assay (22Palcic M.M. Heerze L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In this assay a Sep-Pak reverse-phase cartridge was used to isolate radiolabeled reaction products that were produced when label was transferred from a radioactive donor to a hydrophobic acceptor, Fucα(1–2)Galβ(CH2)7CH3 (22Palcic M.M. Heerze L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 37 °C in a total volume of 12 μl containing substrate and enzyme in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 20 mm MnCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Seven different concentrations of donor and acceptor were employed, and the initial rate conditions were linear with no more than 10% of the substrate consumed in the reaction. For the UDP-Gal donor, the Km values for all three mutants were determined at 1.0 mm acceptor, and the Km for the acceptor was determined at 1.0 mm UDP-Gal. For UDP-GalNAc, the Km value was determined at 1.0 mm acceptor for the M214T mutant and at 2.0 mm acceptor for the M214R and M214V mutants. Km for the acceptor was determined at 1.6 mm UDP-GalNAc for M214V and M214R and at 1.0 mm acceptor for M214T. The kinetic parameters kcat and Km were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis of the Michaelis-Menten equation with the GraphPad Prism 3.0 program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The specific activities for the wild type GTB, M214T, and M214V were determined as in the kinetic assay, except the assay volume was 10 μl and the substrate concentrations were either 13 and 130 μm for donor and 495 μm for acceptor or 2 mm for both substrates. A unit of enzyme is the amount that converts 1 μmol of substrate to product in 1 min. Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford method with bovine γ-globulin as a protein standard. Crystallography—The GTB mutant structures were crystallized using conditions similar to the native GTA and GTB enzymes (4Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M.

Data were collected on a Rigaku RAXIS IV++ area detector at distances of 72 mm and exposure times between 4.0 and 5.0 min for 0.5o oscillations and processed with d*trek (23Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). X-rays were produced by a MM-002 generator (Rigaku) coupled to Osmic “Blue” confocal x-ray mirrors with power levels of 30 watts (Osmic). The crystals were frozen and maintained under cryogenic conditions at a temperature of –160 °C using a CryoStream 700 crystal cooler (Oxford Cryosystems). All structures were solved by using molecular replacement techniques with wild type GTB (Protein Data Bank accession code 1LZ7) as a starting model (24Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) and were refined using Refmac5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Occupancies of conformers were adjusted to achieve similar B factors. Preparation of Mutant Enzymes—Three natural variants of GTB discovered in blood banking laboratories with mutations located at Met-214 in the immediate vicinity of the 211DVD213 motif were prepared. These enzymes were all cloned as soluble truncated forms of the catalytic domain (amino acids 63–354) and expressed in E. coli. The purification of the three constructs by ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on a UDP-hexanolamine resin was straightforward in all cases. The yields of final purified protein were 25 mg/liter for the M214T mutant, 53 mg/liter for the M214V mutant, and 25 mg/liter for the M214R enzyme. Kinetics and Serology—Kinetic constants were determined for each enzyme at a high concentration of the alternate substrate (Table 1). For the M214R mutants, the kcat for both UDP-Gal (0.0042 s–1) and UDP-GalNAc (0.00016 s–1) was decreased substantially as compared with the wild type GTB, which exhibits a kcat of 5.1 s–1 for UDP-Gal and 0.42 s–1 for UDP-GalNAc (Table 1). The binding of UDP-Gal and acceptor was also affected for this mutant with an increase in Km for UDP-Gal from 27 μm for the wild type enzyme to 298 μm for the mutant. The acceptor Km had also been increased from 88 to 167 μm. Individuals with this mutation would generate low quantities of B antigen on their red blood cells, consistent with the results obtained in blood banking laboratories where the T641G mutation was found in the B allele of an individual who was phenotyped and categorized as Bel (20Ogasawara K.

This allele was originally designated *B105 by the authors and later Bel01 according to the Blood Group Antigen Gene Mutation Database (27Blumenfeld O.O. Patnaik S.K. Hum.

Kinetic analysis of the mutant using the B-donor UDP-Gal revealed that the kcat for UDP-Gal (5.4 s–1) was unchanged, whereas the kcat for the A-donor UDP-GalNAc increased 3.8-fold compared with wild type GTB (Table 1). The mutation introduces a minor effect on the binding of the acceptor substrate reflected in an elevation in Km for Fucα(1–2)Galβ(CH2)7CH3 acceptor (Table 1). This should result in the expression of normal levels of B antigen on cell surfaces and low levels of A antigen, which is in agreement with the phenotyping. A T641C mutation resulting in M214T was found in the B allele (B(A)05 according to the data base (27Blumenfeld O.O. Patnaik S.K. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)) of an individual phenotyped as AweakB (19Deng Z.H. Yu Q. Wu G.G. Lian Y.L. Su Y.Q. Li D.C. Wang D.M. Zhang S.Y. Vox Sang. 2005; 89: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), despite the absence of an A allele in trans, showing agglutination with antibodies for the A (weakly) and the B (strongly) antigen. For the M214V mutant there was almost no effect on the kcat for the A-donor UDP-GalNAc, whereas the kcat for UDP-Gal was reduced 3.6-fold. The Km values were affected in a similar way as the M214T enzyme (Table 1). The reduced activity is not because of instability of the M214V mutant. The mutant maintained 90% of its activity after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, which is comparable with that of wild type GTB. The kinetic study predicted expression of B structures, but the low kcat for UDP-GalNAc is not consistent with the AweakB phenotype found in individuals whose B alleles were mutated A640G resulting in M214V in otherwise normal GTB (19Deng Z.H.

Therefore specific activities were measured at both low (13 or 130 μm) and high (2 mm) concentrations of UDP-GalNAc. At low donor concentrations, the specific activity of M214V was 1.7–2.4 times higher than wild type GTB, whereas at high donor concentrations wild type GTB was 1.4 times higher than M214V (Table 2). Although cellular substrate concentrations are not known, the AweakB phenotype is consistent with enzyme operating under low substrate kcat/Km conditions.TABLE 2Specific activity for wild type and mutant blood type B glycosyltransferasesEnzymeUDP-GalNAc 2 mm Acceptor 2 mmUDP-GalNAc 0.13 mm Acceptor 0.5 mmUDP-GalNAc 0.013 mm Acceptor 0.5 mmunits/mgunits/mgunits/mgWild type1.20.190.022M214V0.840.330.052M214T2.90.510.067M214R0.00110.00032NDaNot determined; the specific activity was too low to measure accurately.a Not determined; the specific activity was too low to measure accurately. Open table in a new tab Crystallography—The M214R and M214T mutants were successfully crystallized, but crystals could not be obtained for the M214V mutant. The M214T mutant was crystallized in complex with UDP, but this was not possible for M214R. Several attempts were made at higher concentrations of UDP and manganese without success. Details of the data collection and refinement results for the GTB mutants and complexes are shown in Table 3. Diffraction data were collected to a maximum resolution ranging from 1.67 to 1.99 Å, with final Rwork ranging from 0.178 to 0.184 and an Rfree of 0.218 and 0.235. All structures showed excellent electron density along the entire length of the polypeptide chain with the exception of the disordered loop (amino acids ∼174–195) and the 10 C-terminal amino acid residues, both of which were also disordered in the native GTA/GTB structures (4Patenaude S.I.

Open table in a new tab The 211DVD213 motif in the human blood group A and B glycosyltransferases coordinates a Mn2+ ion, which in turn facilitates UDP-donor binding (4Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that the natural mutations observed in this important region of the enzyme can strongly affect catalysis, but it is significant that they also affect enzyme substrate specificity. The very low substrate turnover for the M214R mutant can be understood upon examination of its crystal structure. In the wild type enzyme, the two aspartate residues coordinate a Mn2+ ion; however, in the mutant enzyme Arg-214 joins with Asp-211 and Asp-213 to trap a water molecule in the Mn2+ binding site, which would significantly hinder (if not preclude) donor binding (Fig. 2). The presence of a water molecule rather than a low occupancy Mn2+ ion is indicated not only by the hydrogen bond to the functional group of the arginine residue but also by the longer distances observed between Asp-211 and Asp-213 and the water molecule (2.63 and 2.99 Å, respectively) than observed between these residues and the Mn2+ ion in the wild type enzyme (2.33 and 2.38 Å, respectively). Also a strong peak in the anomalous Fourier map would be expected for a Mn2+ ion; however, no peak was observed adjacent to the DVD motif. Interestingly, the observed length of the hydrogen bond from Arg-214 to the water molecule is somewhat shorter than usual at 2.18 Å. Short hydrogen bonds between charged groups are stabilized by polarization effects (28Rajagopal S. Vishveshwara S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1819-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and there is a clear charge gradient across the water molecule as it bridges between Arg-214 and the two aspartate residues of the 211DVD213 motif. Arg-214 did not approach either of the active site critical residues known to be involved in donor recognition (Met-266 and Ala-268); consequently there was no issue of the mutation affecting enzyme turnover by simply blocking the active site, as in the blood group O2 (O03) mutant enzyme (29Lee H.L. Barry C.H. Borisova S.N. Seto N.O.L. Zheng R.B. Blancher A. Evans S.V. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 525-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several attempts to obtain a structure of M214R in complex with UDP were made under higher concentrations of Mn2+ (10 mm) and UDP (50 mm) than used for the wild type enzyme, but density for manganese or UDP was never observed (data not shown). M214T showed both GTA and GTB activity (Table 1). The mutation of the bulky Met-214 to the smaller threonine in GTB resulted in the generation of a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the active site. The side chain of Leu-324 moved, by nearly 1.7 Å, into this pocket. This, in turn, created a significant void in the active site surrounding the critical residue Met-266, with the result that the side chain of this residue can be seen to adopt at least three different conformations (Fig. 3), all of which conform to the Boltzmann-type distribution of side chain conformations in proteins (30Butterfoss G.L. Hermans J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2719-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The major conformation maintains van der Waals contact with Leu-324 (Fig. 3, green); one of the minor conformations is similar to that observed for Met-266 in the wild type enzyme (yellow), and the other moves into the donor binding site (magenta). The anomalous Fourier map shows a small peak at 3.0 σ corresponding to the sulfur atom in the high occupancy conformation. The occupancies of these three conformations were adjusted to 0.50, 0.25, and 0.25, respectively, which yielded comparable temperature factors for each conformer. The alternate conformation of Met-266 with highest occupancy shows the side chain maintaining van der Waals contact with Leu-324 and opening a large pocket in the active site (Fig. 4). Using the atomic coordinates of UDP from the M214T structure solved in complex with UDP, the likely position of UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc can be modeled into the binding site (Fig. 5). The modeled folded-back conformation for UDP-Gal is in accordance with the solution structure of bound donor determined by transferred NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) experiments (31Angulo J. Langpap B. Blume A. Biet T. Meyer B. Krishna N.R. Peters H. Palcic M.M. Peters T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 13529-13538Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This shows that the favored conformation of Met-266 provides space within the active site to accommodate the N-acetyl group of GalNAc in the donor binding site (Fig. 5), resulting in blood group A activity.FIGURE 5a, wild type GTB showing the position of Met-214 and Met-266 relative to bound UDP-Gal. b, M214T showing the position of Thr-214 and Met-266 relative to bound UDP-Gal. The predominant conformation of Met-266 (green) opens up the active site. c, M214T modeled with UDP-GalNAc. The larger A-donor, UDP-GalNAc, can be accommodated by the high occupancy conformation of Met-266 (green) and not the low occupancy, wild type conformation (yellow).

The modeled Gal and GalNAc of the donors are shown with magenta bonds.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Crystals of the M214V mutant did not grow. However, it is possible to draw some structure-function correlations, because the change in side chain from the wild type methionine to valine is similar in size and shape to the M214T mutation described above. The smaller 214 side chain would again remove the stabilizing influence of Leu-324 away from Met-266 and create a more forgiving active site recognition pocket that would admit and subsequently transfer the larger A donor. Alterations of donor substrate specificity upon mutagenesis have been reported for other glycosyltransferases (32Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 53-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 33Hancock S.M. Vaughan M.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006; 10: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These include mutants of bovine 4-β-galactosyltransferase with increased glucosyltransferase activity with a single amino acid change, R228K (34Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Qasba P.K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3202-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and increased UDP-GalNAc transferase activity with a Y289L mutation (35Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20833-20839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The donor specificity of Clostridium difficile toxin B glucosyltransferase has been changed to UDP-GlcNAc by a double mutation based on comparison with a related toxin UDP-GlcNAc transferase and vice versa (36Jank T. Reinert D.J. Giesemann T. Schulz G.E. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37833-37838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A 3-β-glucuronosyltransferase was converted to an enzyme with increased UDP-Glc, -GlcNAc, and -Man transferase activity by a H308R mutation (37Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Levoin N. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25439-25445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A plant anthocyanin galactosyltransferase was converted to a glucosyltransferase with a Q382H mutation (38Kubo A. Arai Y. Nagashima S. Yoshikawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 429: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether such sensitivity of donor specificity to a few mutations is generalized among glycosyltransferases and whether GTA and GTB are more sensitive than other glycosyltransferases to mutations. In summary, mutations of residue 214 in the human blood group B enzyme were expected to affect catalysis, as they are adjacent to the 211DVD213 motif (4Patenaude S.I. Seto N.O.L. Borisova S.N. Szpacenko A. Marcus S.L. Palcic M.M. Evans S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 32Qasba P.K. Ramakrishnan B. Boeggeman E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 53-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), which is essential for donor binding. However, they have also been shown to be able to affect the size and shape of the active site donor recognition pocket. M214R shows very slow substrate turnover, as the arginine residue significantly impacts on the ability of the 211DVD213 motif to bind Mn2+ while providing no steric barrier to donor sugar recognition. M214T and M214V enzymes exhibit both glycosyltransferase A and B activity, which can be rationalized by the fact the M214T and probably the M214V mutation lead to a rearrangement of the active site residues to permit the binding and subsequent transfer of the bulky A donor. In the case of M214T and M214R, the serological results are in high agreement with the kinetics obtained. More than a century after its discovery, the ABO blood group system is still one of the most dynamic and relevant model systems for studies of glycobiological phenotype-genotype correlations as well as understanding the structure-function relationships of glycosyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2073845281,"We have identified and characterized two different sodium-coupled monocarboxylate cotransporters (SMCT) from zebrafish (Danio rerio), electrogenic (zSMCTe) and electroneutral (zSMCTn). zSMCTn is the 12th member of the zebrafish Slc5 gene family (zSlc5a12). Both zSMCT sequences have ∼50% homology to human SLC5A8 (hSMCT). Transport function and kinetics were measured in Xenopus oocytes injected with zSMCT cRNAs by measurement of intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) and membrane potential. Both zSMCTs oocytes increased [Na+]i with addition of monocarboxylates (MC) such as lactate, pyruvate, nicotinate, and butyrate. By using two electrode voltage clamp experiments, we measured currents elicited from zSMCTe after MC addition. MC-elicited currents from zSMCTe were similar to hSMCT currents. In contrast, we found no significant MC-elicited current in either zSMCTn or control oocytes. Kinetic data show that zSMCTe has a higher affinity for lactate, nicotinate, and pyruvate (KmL-lactate = 0.17 ± 0.02 mm, Kmnicotinate = 0.54 ± 0.12 mm at -150 mV) than zSMCTn (KmL-lactate = 1.81 ± 0.19 mm, Kmnicotinate = 23.68 ± 4.88 mm). In situ hybridization showed that 1-, 3-, and 5-day-old zebrafish embryos abundantly express both zSMCTs in the brain, eyes, intestine, and kidney. Within the kidney, zSMCTn mRNA is expressed in pronephric tubules, whereas zSMCTe mRNA is more distal in pronephric ducts. zSMCTn is expressed in exocrine pancreas, but zSMCTe is not. Roles for Na+-coupled monocarboxylate cotransporters have not been described for the brain or eye. In summary, zSMCTe is the zebrafish SLC5A8 ortholog, and zSMCTn is a novel, electroneutral SMCT (zSlc5a12).

Slc5a12 in higher vertebrates is likely responsible for the electroneutral Na+/lactate cotransport reported in mammalian and amphibian kidneys. The liver and the kidneys are the major sites of lactate uptake and metabolism. Normally the blood lactate concentration is ∼1.2 mm; however, lactate levels can increase to 10 mm during maximal exercise. Lactate is reabsorbed in kidney such that only trace amounts of lactate are normally excreted in the urine. Lactate in the glomerular ultrafiltrate is almost completely reabsorbed by the proximal nephron (1Geibisch G. Windhager E. Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. Medical Physiology. 1st Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2003: 790-813Google Scholar). The movement of lactate and other monocarboxylates across plasma membranes is thought to occur by proton-linked monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 4The abbreviations used are: MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; SMCT, sodium monocarboxylate cotransporter; MCs, monocarboxylates; [Na+]i, intracellular Na+ concentration; AcAc, acetoacetate; SMCTe, electrogenic; SMCTn, electroneutral; EST, expressed sequence tag; AP, alkaline phosphatase; βOH-buty, β-hydroxybutyrate; hpf, hours post-fertilization; dpf, days post-fertilization.4The abbreviations used are: MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; SMCT, sodium monocarboxylate cotransporter; MCs, monocarboxylates; [Na+]i, intracellular Na+ concentration; AcAc, acetoacetate; SMCTe, electrogenic; SMCTn, electroneutral; EST, expressed sequence tag; AP, alkaline phosphatase; βOH-buty, β-hydroxybutyrate; hpf, hours post-fertilization; dpf, days post-fertilization.

However, a significant body of data indicates an important role for luminal Na+/monocarboxylate cotransport in the reabsorption of filtered lactate by the proximal tubule. Some studies have concluded that luminal Na+/lactate transport is electroneutral (4Barbarat B. Podevin R.A. J. Biol.

Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In humans, 11 SLC5 genes have been identified (15Wright E.M. Turk E. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SLC5 members function as Na+ and solute (e.g. glucose, myoinositol, iodide and multivitamins) cotransporters (15Wright E.M. Turk E. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the functions of some of the family members are well understood, e.g. Slc5a1 (SGLT1; the Na+/glucose cotransporter) and Slc5a5 (NIS; the Na+/I- cotransporter), others family members (SLC5A9-A12) have not been well characterized (15Wright E.M. Turk E. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Wright E.M. Loo D.D. Hirayama B.A. Turk E. Physiology (Bethesda). 2004; 19: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). SLC5A8 was originally cloned by Rodriguez et al. (17Rodriguez A.M. Perron B. Lacroix L. Caillou B. Leblanc G. Schlumberger M. Bidart J.M. Pourcher T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 3500-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in an attempt to identify iodide transporters that might play a functional role in the physiology of the thyroid gland. This gene codes for a protein with 46% identity in amino acid sequence with NIS (Slc5a5) (18Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). The SLC5A8 protein is expressed in the apical membrane of thyroid follicular cells and was hypothesized to mediate passive transport of iodide independent of Na+; consequently, Slc5a8 was originally named the “apical iodide transporter” (17Rodriguez A.M. Perron B. Lacroix L. Caillou B. Leblanc G. Schlumberger M. Bidart J.M. Pourcher T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 3500-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recently, the SLC5A8 gene was shown to play an important role in controlling the development of colon cancers (19Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Casey G. Issa J.-P. Willis J. Willson J.K.V. Plass C. Markowitz S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and classical papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC-cf) (20Porra V. Ferraro-Peyret C. Durand C. Selmi-Ruby S. Giroud H. Berger-Dutrieux N. Decaussin M. Peix J.L. Bournaud C. Orgiazzi J. Borson-Chazot F. Dante R. Rousset B. J. Clin. Endocrinol Metab. 2005; 90: 3028-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Silencing of SLC5A8 is a common and early event in both tumors. Promoter methylation that inactivates SLC5A8 is found in ∼60% of colon cancer cell lines and primary colon cancers and >80% adenomas (19Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Casey G. Issa J.-P. Willis J. Willson J.K.V. Plass C. Markowitz S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In the case of PTC-cf, SLC5A8 silencing by methylation was found in 90% of thyroid carcinomas (follicular, the most common type) and occurred in about 20% of other papillary thyroid carcinomas (20Porra V. Ferraro-Peyret C. Durand C. Selmi-Ruby S. Giroud H. Berger-Dutrieux N. Decaussin M. Peix J.L. Bournaud C. Orgiazzi J. Borson-Chazot F. Dante R. Rousset B. J. Clin. Endocrinol Metab. 2005; 90: 3028-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). SLC5A8 is thus also hypothesized to be a tumor suppressor gene. We reasoned that such important functions of SLC5A8 should be evolutionarily preserved and could be crucial in development and differentiation, particularly of epithelial tissues. In fact, Costa and co-workers (21Costa R.M. Mason J. Lee M. Amaya E. Zorn A.M. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2003; 3: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have found that Slc5a8 (Vito) is first expressed at the blastopore lip (the beginning of neurulation and gastrulation) in Xenopus tadpoles. Human SLC5A8 and mouse Slc5a8 protein functions have been studied previously in Xenopus laevis oocytes. As a transporter, SLC5A8 is an electrogenic Na+/monocarboxylate cotransporter (SMCT) moving substrates such as short chain fatty acids (propionate, butyrate, and valerate) as well as monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate, nicotinate, and pyrazinoate (13Coady M.J. Chang M.-H. Charron F.M. Plata C. Wallendorff B. Sah J.F. Markowitz S.D. Romero M.F. Lapointe J.-Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 557: 719-731Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Miyauchi S. Gopal E.

Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Yet, these substrates are apparently moved with varied affinity and coupling to Na+ (13Coady M.J. Chang M.-H. Charron F.M. Plata C. Wallendorff B. Sah J.F. Markowitz S.D. Romero M.F. Lapointe J.-Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 557: 719-731Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Miyauchi S. Gopal E. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. J.

J. 2005; 388: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Slc5a8 was also cloned from mouse kidney (23Gopal E. Fei Y.J. Sugawara M. Miyauchi S. Zhuang L. Martin P. Smith S.B. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44522-44532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, mouse Slc5a8 expressed in Xenopus oocytes is electrogenic, transporting the same substrates as human SMCT (13Coady M.J. Chang M.-H. Charron F.M. Plata C. Wallendorff B. Sah J.F. Markowitz S.D. Romero M.F. Lapointe J.-Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 557: 719-731Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Miyauchi S. Gopal E. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, Slc5a8 is the first transporter known to be expressed in mammalian colon and kidney that has the ability to mediate the electrogenic absorption of lactate and other monocarboxylates with Na+ (13Coady M.J. Chang M.-H. Charron F.M. Plata C. Wallendorff B. Sah J.F. Markowitz S.D. Romero M.F. Lapointe J.-Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 557: 719-731Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Gopal E. Fei Y.J.

Trans. 2005; 33: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The Km and Vmax values for MC substrates of SLC5A8 indicate that it is a high affinity and low capacity transporter that could easily be saturated by MCs in the renal ultrafiltrate or in the colonic lumen. Thus, an electroneutral Na+/MC cotransporter, particularly with high transport capacity, would allow MC absorption without excess loss in the urine or stool. Yet the molecular identity of such electroneutral Na+/lactate transport proteins in kidney remains unknown. In this study we identified, localized, and functionally characterized two zebrafish SMCTs. One is the electrogenic SMCT (Slc5a8), and the other is a novel electroneutral form of the Na+/monocarboxylate cotransporter (SMCTn) with high transport capacity. SMCTn is the zebrafish ortholog of Slc5a12 recently reported as a second electrogenic Na+/monocarboxylate cotransporter (32Srinivas S.R. Gopal E. Zhuang L. Itagaki S. Martin P.M. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that both SMCTn and the electrogenic SMCT (SMCTe/Slc5A8) are present in kidney and brain of the teleost Danio rerio (zebrafish) and have different kinetic properties. Both proteins increase intracellular Na+ in response to a variety of MCs as follows: short chain fatty acids, lactate, pyruvate, nicotinate, acetoacetate, and 3-β-hydroxybutyrate. Slc5a8 mRNA is also found in the gut consistent with its original description in human. cDNA Cloning of Zebrafish SMCT, zSlc5a8 and zSlc5a12—A BLAST search of the EST data base revealed two D. reiro cDNAs that were homologous to human SLC5A8, yet clearly distinct from one another. The cDNAs corresponding these ESTs (IMAGE clones zSMCTe (zSlc5a8, 7212813) and zSMCTn (Slc5a12, 6793401)) were obtained from the IMAGE consortium (Research Genetics, Genome Systems) and sequenced (GenBank™ accession numbers AY727859 for zSMCTe and AY727860 for zSMCTn). The complete EST inserts were sequenced (W. M. Keck Facility, New Haven, CT) and then subcloned in pGEMHE Xenopus oocyte expression vector between EcoRI (5′) and XbaI (3′). Oocyte Isolation and Injection—Oocytes were removed from female X. laevis (Xenopus Express, Beverly Hills, FL) as described previously (25Sciortino C.M. Romero M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F611-F623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Excised lobes of oocytes were placed into a Ca2+-free buffered saline solution (200 mosm) and defolliculated by collagenase digestion as described previously (26Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F425-F432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Capped zSlc5a8 and zSlc5a12 cRNAs were synthesized using a linearized cDNA template and the T7 mMessage mMachine (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of 0.5 ng/nl (25 ng/oocyte) cRNA of zSMCTe, zSMCTn, hSMCT, or water. The oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in filtered ND96 medium (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.5)) (13Coady M.J. Chang M.-H. Charron F.M. Plata C. Wallendorff B. Sah J.F. Markowitz S.D. Romero M.F. Lapointe J.-Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 557: 719-731Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Oocytes were studied 3–10 days after injection. All experiments were performed in accordance with the regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Case Western Reserve University. Electrophysiology—All monocarboxylate solutions (1 mm lactate, pyruvate, propionate, and butyrate) were prepared in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)) as described previously (13Coady M.J. Chang M.-H. Charron F.M. Plata C. Wallendorff B. Sah J.F. Markowitz S.D. Romero M.F. Lapointe J.-Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 557: 719-731Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, MCs were all used at 1 mm. To examine the kinetics of lactate and nicotinate transport of zSMCTn, a low chloride ND96 was used to maintain the same tonicity for all solutions (∼200 mosmol). For lactate curves, we used (in mm) 66 NaCl base solution with 30 to 0 sodium gluconate and 0 to 30 sodium lactate. For nicotinate curves, we used 56 NaCl base with 50 to 0 sodium gluconate and 0–50 sodium nicotinate. All solutions also contained 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES and were pH 7.5. Ion-selective Microelectrode—Ion-selective microelectrodes were used to monitor intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) of zSMCTs and water-injected oocytes as described previously (25Sciortino C.M. Romero M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F611-F623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24552-24559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Intracellular [Na+] was measured as the difference between the Na+ electrode and a KCl voltage electrode impaled into the oocyte; and membrane potential (Vm) was the potential difference between the KCl microelectrode and an extracellular calomel (26Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F425-F432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Na+ microelectrodes were calibrated using 10 mm NaCl and 100 mm NaCl solutions followed by point calibration in ND96 (96 mm Na+) as performed previously (26Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F425-F432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Intracellular Na+ microelectrodes had slopes of at least -50 mV/p(Na+). Two Electrode Voltage Clamp—Oocyte membrane currents were recorded using an OC-720C voltage clamp (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), filtered at 2–5 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and recorded with the Pulse software, and data were analyzed using the PulseFit program (HEKA, Germany) as described previously (25Sciortino C.M. Romero M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F611-F623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dinour D. Chang M.-H. Satoh J.-I. Smith B.L. Angle N. Knecht A. Serban I. Holtzman E.J. Romero M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52238-52246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For periods when I-V protocols were not being run, oocytes were clamped at a holding potential (Vh) of -50 mV; and the current was constantly monitored and recorded at 1 Hz. I-V protocols consisted of 400-ms steps from Vh to -150 mV and +50 mV in 20-mV steps as described previously (13Coady M.J. Chang M.-H. Charron F.M. Plata C. Wallendorff B. Sah J.F. Markowitz S.D. Romero M.F. Lapointe J.-Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 557: 719-731Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar).The I-V protocols were run in the absence and in the presence of a particular substrate. The substrate-specific current is determined by subtraction of the pre-substrate current from the substrate current. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature. Test substrates bathed oocytes for 1–3 min. For kinetic analysis, oocytes were exposed to only one monocarboxylate at one concentration and then discarded. Calculations—Oocytes were perfused with ND96 for 5 min at which time “initial [Na+]i” is measured. The solution was switched to different monocarboxylates for 8–10 min (i.e. [Na+]i and Vm or I plateau), and the “final [Na+]i” is measured. Oocytes came from at least four separate donor animals. 22Na+ Uptakes—Functions of zSMCTe and zSMCTn were assessed by measuring 22Na+ uptake in groups of 15–20 oocytes 4 days after water or cRNA injection. 22Na+ uptake was performed as described previously (30Plata C. Meade P. Vazquez N. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11004-11012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, 22Na+ uptake was measured with the following protocol: a 30-min incubation period ND96 with 1 mm ouabain, 100 μm amiloride, 100 μm bumetanide, followed by a 60-min uptake period in ND96. To analyze the pyruvate transport kinetics, we varied pyruvate concentration from 0 to 5 mm in ND96 for zSMCTe and from 0 to 20 mm for zSMCTn. These uptake solutions also contained 1 μCi/ml of 22Na+ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the same inhibitors used during the incubation period. Uptakes were performed at 30 °C. At the end of the uptake period, oocytes were washed five times in ice-cold ND96 solution without isotope to remove extracellular tracer. Next, individual oocytes were dissolved in 10% SDS, and tracer activity was determined by β scintillation counting. RNA-injected oocytes were compared with water controls subjected to identical conditions, using oocytes from the same donor. Kinetic analysis was performed by estimating the Km values for pyruvate of each SMCT. The Km values were calculated from log [ion] versus V/Vmax plots using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego). RNA in Situ Hybridization—Single label in situ hybridization was carried out as described (31Thisse C. Thisse B. Schilling T.F. Postlethwait J.H. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 1203-1215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reagents were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Briefly, zebrafish embryo groups were incubated at 70 °C with digoxigenin-UTP-labeled antisense RNA probe for zSMCTe or zSMCTn in hybridization solution containing 50% formamide, detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (AP), and visualized with a combination of 4-nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (blue precipitate). We alkali-hydrolyzed cRNA probes with 0.2 m Na2CO3 (pH 10.2) for 14 min at 60 °C to obtain 200–300-bp fragments (size verified by RNA gel and [cRNA] determined by UV spectrometry). AP buffer is 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20. The developing solution was 225 μg/ml 4-nitro blue tetrazolium and 175 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in AP buffer. Endogenous AP activity was inhibited by adding 2 mm levamisole (Sigma) to all solutions after antibody incubation. Following in situ hybridization, embryos were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, destained with undiluted methyl salicylate (M6752, Sigma), digitally photographed (27Romero M.F. Henry D. Nelson S. Harte P.J. Dillon A.K. Sciortino C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24552-24559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and stored in mineral oil. Fish Embryo Sections—After in situ hybridization, 5 dpf embryos were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Fixed embryos were incubated overnight in 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline and then embedded in OCT. 15-μm cryosections were cut with a Leica cryostat and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. Embryo sections were observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 microscope and acquired with an AxioCam digital camera and AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss, Germany) as described previously (27Romero M.F. Henry D. Nelson S. Harte P.J. Dillon A.K. Sciortino C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24552-24559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The results are presented as means ± S.E. The significance of the differences between groups was tested by one-way analysis of variance with multiple comparison using Bonferroni correction or by the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks with the Dunn method for multiple comparison procedure, as needed. Molecular Cloning of the zSMCTs—We found two cDNAs for the zebrafish (D. rerio) homologs of the human electrogenic sodium/monocarboxylate cotransporter (hSMCTe/SLC5A8). One cDNA (zSMCTe) encodes a 610-amino acid protein (GenBank™ accession number AY727859), whereas the other cDNA (zSMCTn) encodes a 623 amino acid protein (GenBank™ accession number AY727860). zSMCTe and zSMCTn are 46% identical. Both zSMCT sequences are roughly equally divergent from mammalian Slc5a8. zSMCTe has 55 and 56% amino acid identity, and zSMCTn has 51 and 53% amino acid identity to human and mouse Slc5a8, respectively. zSMCTn shows 64% identity to mouse Slc5a12, and zSMCTe is 48% identical to mammalian Slc5a12 (Fig. 1). Secondary structure of zSMCT proteins was predicted using TMHMM. This analysis predicts that zSMCTe has 13 transmembrane spans, as indicated for hSMCT (19Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Casey G. Issa J.-P. Willis J. Willson J.K.V. Plass C. Markowitz S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The zSMCTe protein contains three potential N-linked glycosylation sites in extracellular loops (Asn-112, Asn-439, and Asn-485), 19 Ser, 8 Thr, and 4 Tyr-like potential phosphorylation sites but only 7 Ser (Ser-477, Ser-523, Ser-541, Ser-556, Ser-568, Ser-570, and Ser-588), 2 Thr (Thr-75 and Thr-84), and one Tyr (Tyr-80) are outside of the membrane, increasing the probability these are actual phosphorylation sites. A similar sequence analysis of zSMCTn also predicted 13 transmembrane spans. There are two potential N-linked glycosylation sites in extracellular loops (Asn-478 and Asn-614). Several potential phosphorylation sites are predicted, but only a few are not in the membrane making them accessible to kinases: 9 Ser (Ser-111, Ser-216, Ser-232, Ser-266, Ser-303, Ser-314, Ser-379, Ser-547, and Ser-597), 3 Thr (Thr-217, Thr-495, and Thr-587), and two Tyr (Tyr-12 and Tyr-82). BLAST analysis of the zSMCTn sequence against the human genome data base resulted in a hypothetical protein MGC52019 (SLC5A12; NT_086780.1 and NT_009237.17) with ∼65% identity to zSMCTn. Recently, Srinivas et al. (32Srinivas S.R. Gopal E. Zhuang L. Itagaki S. Martin P.M. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) identified and cloned mouse Slc5a12 indicating that mammalian homologs are not just putative. Thus, zSMCTn is the zebrafish ortholog of mouse Slc5a12, and zSMCTe is the ortholog of human SLC5A8 (Fig. 1). Functional Expression of zSMCT Proteins in Xenopus Oocytes— We analyzed the function of both zSMCT clones by simultaneous measurement of membrane potential (Vm) and intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) with ion-selective microelectrodes in Xenopus oocytes injected with zSMCTn or zSMCTe cRNA. Using two electrode voltage clamp experiments, we also examined currents elicited by monocarboxylates for both SMCT cotransporters. All MCs tested induced a significant increase of intracellular [Na+] in both zSMCT oocytes (Δ[Na+] zSMCTei = 2.76 ± 0.29 mm, n = 8; Δ[Na+] zSMCTni = 2.28 ± 0.33 mm, n = 9). In contrast, control oocytes displayed only minor increments of intracellular Na+ (Δ[Na+] con"
https://openalex.org/W2028470542,"The nuclear import of H1 linker histones is mediated by a heterodimer of transport receptors, known as importinβ and importin7. Interestingly, both importins separately interact with H1, but only as a dimer they facilitate the translocation through the nuclear pore. We identified the H1 binding site of importin7, comprising two extended acidic loops near the C terminus of importin7. The analysis of the H1 import complex assembly by means of isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the formation of a receptor heterodimer in vitro is an enthalpy-driven process, whereas subsequent binding of H1 to the heterodimer is entropy-driven. Furthermore, we show that the importinβ binding domain of importin7 plays a key role in the activation of importin7 by importinβ. This process is allosterically regulated by importinβ and accounts for a specific tuning of the activity of the importinβ·importin7 heterodimer. The results presented here provide new insights into cellular strategies to even energy balances in nuclear import and point toward a general regulation of importinβ-related nuclear import processes.

NPCs have a dual function; whereas solutes, ions and small macromolecules (20-40 kDa) are allowed to diffuse passively through the nuclear pore, larger macromolecules or such, whose transfer has to be tightly controlled, are transported by specific, soluble transport receptors in a signal-dependent manner (for review, see Refs. 1Madrid A.S. Weis K. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2006; 115: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 3Fried H.

The majority of known transport signals are specifically recognized by members of the importinβ/karyopherinβ protein superfamily shuttling between nucleus and cytosol, also known as importins and exportins. They are composed of a number of helix-turn-helix motifs termed HEAT tandem repeats, which pack side by side in an almost parallel fashion, forming elongated molecules with a superhelical twist (5Lee S.J. Matsuura Y. Liu S.M. Stewart M. Nature. 2005; 435: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Matsuura Y. Stewart M. Nature. 2004; 432: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 7Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 8Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Müller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Besides one or more substrate binding sites, these proteins additionally comprise a binding site for the small GTPase Ran (9Görlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Ran represents the central mediator of directionality of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Its low intrinsic GTPase activity allows for a rigid control of GTP hydrolysis. The cytosolic GTPase-activating protein RanGAP1 acts as activator of Ran; the additional factors RanBP1 and RanBP2 act as GTPase enhancers and further stimulate Ran's GTP hydrolysis rate. Due to the nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization of the regulatory factors, with RanGAP in the cytosol and RanGEF in the nucleus, a steep gradient of RanGTP is established across the nuclear envelope with high concentrations in the nucleus and low ones in the cytosol. The RanGTP gradient across the nuclear envelope is thought to provoke a unidirectional translocation of cargoes through the NPC; in terms of nuclear import, binding of nuclear RanGTP to import receptors with associated cargo usually irreversibly terminates import processes by release of the cargo and initiates re-export of the import receptors. The nuclear import pathways known so far are subdivided in three classes. First, the receptor adaptor pathways with the well characterized example of the import of classical nuclear localization signal bearing substrates by importinβ (Impβ) and importinα (Impα). Second, the single receptor pathways, with a single importin directly binding its cargo as found in the import of small ribosomal proteins by the nuclear import receptors Impβ, transportin1 (Trn1), importin5 (Imp5), and importin7 (Imp7) (10Jäkel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) or the nuclear import of the parathyroid hormone-related protein PTHrP by Impβ (11Lam M.H.C. Briggs L.J. Hu W. Martin J. Gillespie M.T. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7391-7396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The third class applies a receptor pair, with each importin participating equally in substrate recognition and translocation through the pore, the so-called co-import pathways. A prominent example for such co-import pathways is the nuclear import of H1 linker histones. The functional import receptor for H1 is the Impβ·Imp7 heterodimer (12Jäkel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32480-32489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Only upon dimerization of Impβ and Imp7, a cooperative binding to H1 occurs (13Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32480-32489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ternary Impβ·Imp7·H1 complex then translocates through the nuclear pore and after translocation sticks to the nuclear basket. Upon binding of nuclear RanGTP to Impβ, the ternary complex is thought to dissociate into Impβ, which recycles into the cytosol in the RanGTP-bound state, and an Imp7·H1 dimer, which travels on inside the nucleus to the DNA gyres. There, binding of RanGTP to Imp7 possibly represents the signal for transfer of H1 onto the chromatin. RanGTP·Imp7 is finally exported back to the cytosol completing the import cycle (10Jäkel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 12Jäkel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Strikingly, substrates of co-import pathways tend to exhibit an extended, basic surface, that may be involved in unspecific interactions or aggregation in the cytosol as well as in the nucleus. As the need for coverage and protection of such basic regions during transport arises, only a pair of import receptors is thought to provide a joint substrate binding site large enough to also display a chaperoning activity (12Jäkel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, importins involved in co-import often are functional in other types of import, like Impβ and Imp7 as described above. Because the mechanisms of complex formation of Impβ and Imp7 and its specific role in H1 import remain elusive, the question arises of how such versatile molecules like Impβ and Imp7 accommodate to their different roles in the co-import pathway of H1 in comparison with common single receptor import. Hence, it is of high interest to thermodynamically characterize H1 import to see whether the import receptors Impβ and Imp7 modulate each other upon dimerization and how their cooperativity in binding H1 might be explained and, finally, to investigate if there are general thermodynamic indications on importin versatility. Recombinant Protein Expression and Protein Purification—Human Impβ was expressed in Escherichia coli M15 (pREP4) with 300 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C overnight and purified as described previously (14Kutay U. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Xenopus laevis N-His10-Imp7 inserted into pQE-80 (a generous gift from D. Görlich, ZMBH Heidelberg, Germany) was expressed in E. coli SG13009 (pREP4) in 2YT medium with 150 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 30 mm K2HPO4, and 4% ethanol at 16 °C overnight. The purification was performed according to Bäuerle et al. (13Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32480-32489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Impβ_N-396, Impβ_304-C were expressed and purified as described previously (15Bednenko J. Cingolani G. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Ran/TC4 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) RP in 2YT medium with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C over night and purified as described (16Melchior F. Sweet D.J. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The nucleotide exchange of GDP against GMPPNP, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, was performed with the alkaline phosphatase method (17John J. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11792-11799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exchange efficiency was determined by HPLC. The Impβ fragments Impβ_32-C, Impβ_127-C, Impβ_210-C, Impβ_N-641, Impβ_N-726, and Impβ_127-641 were subcloned from pQE-60-Impβ into the BamHI/SmaI sites of pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare). Expression and purification were carried out in accordance with the protocol for glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (GE Healthcare) with the addition of a final gel filtration with a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (XK 26/60, GE Healthcare) in analogy to full-length Impβ. The X. laevis Imp7 fragments Imp7_N-916, Imp7_N-1001, Imp7_357-C, and Imp7_598-C were subcloned from pQE-9 into the MCS of pQE-80-Ndecahis (a generous gift from D. Görlich, ZMBH Heidelberg, Germany). These constructs were expressed and purified in analogy to the full-length protein. The Imp7 fragments Imp7_598-C, Imp7_665-C, Imp7_824-C, Imp7_917-C, Imp7_1002-C, Imp7_876-1001, Imp7_917-1001, and Imp7_876-916 were subcloned from pQE-9-Imp7 into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare). Expression and purification was analogous to that of the Impβ fragments. H10 was expressed and purified as described previously (13Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32480-32489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recombinant H1.2 from B. taurus was purchased from Axxora, Germany. H1.11L from Gallus gallus inserted into pET-13a (a generous gift from V. Ramakrishnan, Cambridge, UK) was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) in 2YT medium with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors. After cell lysis in a microfluidizer 110S (Microfluidics, Newton, MA) and clarification by centrifugation at 30,000 × g, 4 °C for 45 min, the lysate was titrated to pH 8.8 and subsequently loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, and 100 mm NaCl. The flow-through containing H1.11L was collected. After adjusting the NaCl concentration to 500 mm, the flow-through was loaded onto a SPSepharose cation exchange column (XK 26/20, GE Healthcare) in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris/HCl pH 8.8 and 500 mm NaCl. H1.11L was eluted from the column in a gradient from buffer A to buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl pH 8.8, 1 m NaCl) and finally purified with a Superdex S75 gel filtration column (XK 26/60, GE Healthcare) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, and 100 mm NaCl. Binding Assays—Pulldown assays on Ni-NTA-Sepharose. 2 nmol of His-tagged proteins were immobilized in binding buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) on 50 μl of HisTrap-Ni-NTA-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), and after copious washing in binding buffer with 40 mm imidazole, 4 nmol of the corresponding purified binding partners were applied to the Ni-NTA-Sepharose. Complexes were eluted with binding buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and analyzed via SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Pulldown assays on GSH-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) were performed equally with the following exceptions. Washing was done with binding buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.3, 300 mm NaCl), and elution was performed in binding buffer containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. The binding assays for gel filtration analysis of Impβ/Imp7 interactions were prepared in gel filtration buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.6 and 100 mm NaCl. For interaction analysis of import receptors with H1 the salt concentration in the gel filtration buffer was increased to 300 mm NaCl. To achieve a good separation of formed complexes from the monomers, the protein quantities were 2-4 nmol of the larger binding partners; the smaller ones were each added in a 1.5-fold molar excess. Complex formation was tested on an analytical Superdex 200 column (S200 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Coomassie staining. In Vitro Nuclear Import Assays and Immunofluorescence Detection—Preparation of the fluorescent import substrates 4z-rpL23a and 6z-H10 was done as described (10Jäkel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 13Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32480-32489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The permeabilization of HeLa cells, the preparation of the energy regenerating system, and the Ran mix were done according to the protocol of Adam et al. (18Adam S.A. Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) and modifications described by Jäkel and Görlich (10Jäkel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Recombinant nuclear import receptors were applied in concentrations as indicated in the figures. As a positive control, 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate were added to the import assay; the negative control lacked any of the recombinant import factors and the reticulocyte lysate. Import was allowed to progress for 15 min at 37 °C (import of rpL23a) and 30 min at 30 °C (import of H1) before the cells were washed and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. For immunofluorescence detection of His-tagged proteins the nuclei were subsequently permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and washed. Upon blocking with 0.2% fish gelatin the cells were incubated with a α-His antibody from Mus musculus and after copious washing incubated with the secondary antibody, a α-mouse antibody (Capra hircus) labeled with Alexa 594. Finally nuclear import was monitored by fluorescence microscopy with a Zeiss Axioskop20 microscope. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was done with a Leica DM IRE2 microscope, a Leica TCS SP2 spectral detector, and Leica confocal software. The immunofluorescence signals of 40 randomly chosen nuclei per experiment were quantified with ImageJ. For the comparison of different import assays, the immunofluorescence signal of the negative control was subtracted from all other values before the final evaluation. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—For determination of binding isotherms of Impβ, Imp7, and RanGDPNP, all proteins were in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. The isotherms were recorded at 25 °C. For isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments with H1.11L and for determination of the specific heat capacity of the Impβ·Imp7-interaction (additional binding isotherms were recorded at 15 °C and 10 °C) all proteins were in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 200 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm potassium phosphate, and 1 mm MgCl2. For H1.11L interactions all isotherms were recorded at 10 °C. ITC experiments were carried out with a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (Microcal). The protein concentrations were 5 μm in the sample cell and 50-100 μm in the injection syringe. Data were analyzed with Origin 7.0, and the fitting curves were calculated according to one set of binding site models. Previous studies revealed the Impβ·Imp7 heterodimer to be the only functional import receptor for H1 linker histones (12Jäkel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32480-32489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The binding sites on Impβ for Imp7 and H10 have already been identified (12Jäkel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and include HEAT repeats 4-9 (Imp7) and HEAT repeats 6-19 (H10). They overlap and comprise the central part of Impβ. The interaction site of Imp7 for Impβ has also been identified previously (13Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32480-32489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The H1 binding site of Imp7 was unknown as was the binding site of Impβ for H1 subtypes other than H10. Because evidence was given that during H1 import Impβ/Imp7 might not only act as import receptors but as chaperones as well (13Bäuerle M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32480-32489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Jäkel S. Mingot J.M. Schwarzmaier P. Hartmann E. Görlich D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the question arose as to whether the properties of the binding sites of Impβ·Imp7 for the linker histone H1 support the hypothesized chaperoning activity of the Impβ·Imp7 heterodimer during nuclear import. An energy characterization of the formation of a trimeric Impβ·Imp7·H1 complex was of high interest as well to investigate if there are energy requirements for a receptor dimer in H1 nuclear import. In this study numerous deletion mutants of both Impβ and Imp7 were constructed to locate their binding sites for H1.2 and H1.11L, respectively, and to investigate the effects of dimerization of Impβ and Imp7 on subsequent H1 binding. Additionally, the energy requirements of trimeric Impβ·Imp7·H1 complex formation were characterized by ITC. The newly designed Impβ deletion constructs used in this study comprise fragments with incomplete binding sites either for Ran or Imp7 and H10 (see Fig. 1A). In contrast to most previous studies, they were designed in accordance with a crystal structure of Impβ (Ref. 8Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Müller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar and supplemental Fig. 1), with special attention to the HEAT repeat organization of the molecule. Only complete HEAT repeats were deleted, to maintain correct folding of the resulting fragments. The Impβ deletions should allow for the identification of the H1.2 and H1.11L binding site of Impβ. The construction of fragments of Imp7 focused on N-terminal deletions (see Fig. 3A), as sequence analysis revealed two extended and rather disordered acidic regions (aa 882-912 and 927-957) at the C terminus of Imp7, which may be involved in substrate recognition. For a complete list of all tested constructs, see supplemental Fig. 2.FIGURE 3The H1 binding site of Imp7 is located between aa 665 and 1001 including the C-terminal acidic loops of Imp7 and does not overlap with IBB7. A, schematic representation of the soluble Imp7 fragments and their qualitative binding capacities to Impβ and H1. Four constructs, namely Imp7_598-C (aa 598-1038), Imp7_665-C (aa 665-1038), Imp7_824-C (aa 824-1038), and Imp7_1002-C (aa 1002-1038) contain the Impβ binding site (aa 1008-1038, in the following referred to as IBB7), thus, putatively allowing dimerization with Impβ, whereas five other deletion constructs do not: Imp7_N-1001 (aa 1-1001), Imp7_876-1001 (aa 876-1001), Imp7_N-916 (aa 1-916), Imp7_917-1001 (aa 917-1001), and Imp7_876-916 (aa 876-917). The latter three additionally lack one or both of the acidic loops of full-length Imp7. The ability of the fragments to interact with Impβ and H1 is indicated by + and - in comparison with wild-type level of binding of full-length Imp7 (+++). Wild-type levels of H1 binding requires amino acids 665-1001. The acidic loops of Imp7 are both indispensable for binding H1 and are solely involved in the interaction with H1 but not in binding either RanGTP or Impβ. B, SDS-PAGE of binding assays of Imp7 fragments and H1.2. The interaction of glutathione S-transferase-fused fragments of Imp7 with H1.2 was tested in pulldown experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The lanes show the elution fractions. The interaction of the other Imp7 fragments with H1.2 was analyzed by gel filtration. Here the peak fractions of the Imp7 fragments are shown. Where co-eluted, H1.2 is marked by an asterisk; the masses of the molecular weight standard (MW) are as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding Sites of Impβ for RanGTP and Imp7 Overlap but Allow for Simultaneous Binding—Although the binding sites of Impβ for RanGTP and Imp7 have been elucidated previously, showing an overlap of both sites within Impβ (5Lee S.J. Matsuura Y. Liu S.M. Stewart M. Nature. 2005; 435: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 12Jäkel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), the question of whether binding of Impβ to Imp7 and RanGTP are mutually exclusive in vitro has not been addressed so far. To elucidate the organization of binding sites on Impβ, the binding capabilities of Impβ fragments for RanGTP and Imp7 or Imp7_1002-C, containing solely the importinβ binding domain of Imp7 (IBB7, aa 1008-1038), were tested in pulldown assays via the recovery of Imp7 and Ran by the immobilized Impβ constructs. Gel filtration chromatography was applied to confirm the stability of complexes observed in pulldown experiments (see Figs. 1 and 3). The analysis of truncated Impβ fragments confirms the previously published minimal binding site for Imp7, represented by an N-terminal-located part of Impβ comprising HEAT repeats 6-9 (aa 210-396, Fig. 1). Further N-terminal deletions abolish binding to Imp7_1002-C completely, as is demonstrated for Impβ_304-C (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, a prominent overlap of the binding sites of Impβ for Imp7 and RanGTP, comprising aa 210-396, could be confirmed. Because RanGTP was previously shown to dissociate the Impβ·Imp7 heterodimer, the question was whether RanGTP achieves this by a competitive displacement mechanism, pointing to interactions of Imp7 and RanGTP with identical amino acid side chains of Impβ. Surprisingly, in our hands RanGDPNP did not necessarily dissociate the Impβ·Imp7 heterodimer (Fig. 2). In fact, simultaneous binding of Imp7 and RanGTP to Impβ was observed in gel filtration experiments, where a significant binding of a purified Impβ·RanGDPNP heterodimer to Imp7 could be verified. In this experiment an Imp7 construct with N-terminal His tag was used which abolishes binding of Imp7 to RanGDPNP (not shown). This suggests that simultaneous binding of RanGTP and Imp7 to Impβ is possible in vitro, yet probably with reduced affinity. Any H1 Subtype Interacts with the Same Binding Site on Impβ—With respect to the three-dimensional structures of Impβ (5Lee S.J. Matsuura Y. Liu S.M. Stewart M. Nature. 2005; 435: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Müller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), several Impβ fragments with intact HEAT repeats were tested in binding to H1. Because the question remained unanswered of whether the contribution of RanGTP to any H1 import complex disassembly is identical, various H1 subtypes were applied in the binding experiments. Despite previous findings, where a stable complex formation with H10 was only demonstrated for an Impβ·Imp7 heterodimer and the single import receptors were shown to bind H10 with strongly reduced affinity (12Jäkel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), a significant and stable complex formation of full-length Impβ with H1.2 could be observed in the absence of Imp7 (Fig. 1C). Binding of Impβ to H1.2 is mediated by a large portion of Impβ involving HEAT repeats 4-14 (aa 127-641, Fig. 1, A and C), as is shown for Impβ_127-641. Further deletions of either the N terminus or the C terminus, represented by Impβ_N-396 and Impβ_210-C, respectively, abolish H1.2 binding completely. Thus, the binding sites for both Imp7 and H1.2 on Impβ do overlap (see Fig. 4, upper), implying a cooperative binding mode of the Impβ·Imp7 heterodimer and H1.2. In addition, the H1.2 binding site is very similar to the one for H10 (12Jäkel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), pointing to a common mechanism of binding of Impβ to several H1 subtypes. Supporting this hypothesis, a difference in binding of several subtypes of H1 to Impβ could not be observed when repeating the experiments with H10 and H1.11L from G. gallus (data not shown). All tested histones display significant similarities to each other with sequence identities between 43% (H1.2) and 41% (H1.11L) in comparison to H10 (see supplemental Fig. 3). Consecutively, a similarity in the primary structure corresponds to similar if not the same requirements for binding sites on Impβ·Imp7. Moreover, the RanGTP binding site of Impβ (HEAT repeats 1-8 and 14-15, aa 20-378 and 639-682) (5Lee S.J. Matsuura Y. Liu S.M. Stewart M. Nature. 2005; 435: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) overlaps with both Imp7 and H1 binding sites (see Fig. 4), as published previously (12Jäkel S. Albig W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R.

In contrast to the interaction between Impβ and RanGTP, which allowed for simultaneous binding of Imp7, a simultaneous binding of H1.2 and RanGTP to Impβ could not be observed (data not shown), implying a mutual exclusivity of binding to Impβ and, therefore, at least in part identical requirements for interaction sites on Impβ. This probably includes the acidic loop within HEAT 8 of Impβ (aa 333-343), for this loop has been reported to be involved in a competitive displacement of substrates bound to Impβ by RanGTP (8Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Müller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Because Imp7 lacks an acidic loop in a comparable position but instead displays two large, acidic loops near its C terminus, we next determined their role in H1 nuclear import. H1 Binding by Imp7 Is Conferred by Its Acidic C Terminus—Because the H1 interaction site of Imp7 has not been identified previously, deletion mutants of Imp7 were designed, allowing for the identification of the binding site on Imp7 for the linker histone H1.2. Their ability of binding to H1.2 was analyzed via pulldown assays and gel filtration experiments. As a control for correct folding of the C-terminal fragments, their binding capability to Impβ was also tested (data not shown), as"
