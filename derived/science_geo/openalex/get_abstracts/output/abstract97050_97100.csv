https://openalex.org/W1556721384,"3T3-L1 preadipocytes, cloned from 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts, differentiate in monolayer culture into cells with morphological and biochemical characteristics of adipocytes. Deposition of cytoplasmic triglyceride is associated with an increased lipogenic rate and a coordinate rise in the activities of many lipogenic enzymes (Mackall, J.C., Student, A.K., Polakis, S.E., and Lane, M.D. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 6462-6464). During differentiation induced by a 48-h treatment of postconfluent cells with methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin, fatty acid synthetase activity increased to a level 19.5-fold higher than that of undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells or nondifferentiating 3T3-C2 cells. The rate of [3H]leucine incorporation into immunoadsorbable fatty acid synthetase rose to a maximum and then declined to a new level 12.5-fold higher in than in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells. The kinetics of the changing [3H]leucine incorporation rate was reflected in the kinetics of the rise in fatty acid synthetase activity. The rate of degradation of fatty acid synthetase, determined by pulse-chase experiments, was unaffected by differentiation, the t1/2 remaining constant at 1.4 days. It is concluded that the higher level of fatty acid synthetase activity in 3T3-L1 cells can be attributed entirely to an increased rate of enzyme synthesis. The rate of total cellular protein synthesis also increases early early in differentiation, lending support to a model in which the synthesis of a large number of differentiated proteins is coordinately induced."
https://openalex.org/W160088592,"The uptake and metabolism of lymphatic large chylomicrons from fat-fed rats, lymphatic small chylomicrons from glucose-fed rats, and hepatic very low density lipoproteins from perfusates of isolated livers, and of remnants produced from these lipoproteins in functionally eviscerated rats were studied in the isolated perfused rat liver. All lipoproteins were labeled isotopically in their cholesteryl ester and triglyceride moieties. Uptake of the labeled lipids or large chylomicrons was slow and limited, but these lipids in small chylomicrons and hepatic very low density lipoproteins were taken up and metabolized progressively and at equal rates. Incubation with very low density lipoprotein-free plasma increased the content of C apolipoproteins in small chylomicrons and hepatic very low density lipoproteins and greatly retarded the hepatic uptake of their labeled lipids. In remnants from all sources, which are depleted of C apolipoproteins but not of apolipoprotein E, the labeled lipids were rapidly taken up and metabolized. Neither extensive hydrolysis of core triglycerides nor the production of monoglycerides was required for this rapid hepatic uptake. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that one or more of the C apolipoproteins opposes and apolipoprotein E promotes recognition of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by a hepatic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1517007955,"A new method is described for the estimation of the percentages of free steroids in undiluted serum or plasma. Samples were incubated with 3H-steroid and [14C]glucose, and duplicate aliquots of the mixture were subjected to centrifugal ultrafiltration through a dialysis membrane at 37 degrees C. The percentages of free estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone in serum were estimated by comparing the ratio of 3H-steroid to [14C]glucose in the ultrafiltrate with the corresponding ratio in the serum retained by the dialysis membrane. In addition to being highly reproducible, the present method affords several advantages over existing methods. The use of [14C]glucose to monitor the movement of unbound serum components obviates measurement of the ultrafiltrate volume, and because the ultrafiltrate remains in contact with the dialysis membrane, small molecular weight components are able to pass through the dialysis membrane in either direction during centrifugal ultrafiltration. This latter feature, which could be described as isodialysis, allows the estimation of the percentage of free steroid under conditions which closely approximate the in vivo situation."

https://openalex.org/W1807286889,"The thermal and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denaturation of lysozyme has been investigated at various concentrations of tri-N-acetylglucosamine ((GlcNAc)3), a trisaccharide which binds specifically at the active site of native lysozyme. The presence of (GlcNAc)3 leads to a readily observable stabilization of the protein to thermal and GdnHCl denaturation. An analysis of guanidine hydrochloride denaturation curves shows that the stability of lysozyme is increased by 495 cal/mol by the presence of 3 x 10(-4) M (GlcNAc)3. The midpoint of the thermal denaturation curve, T 1/2, is increased 1.6 and 5.3 degrees C by 2.02 x 10(-4) M and 1.38 x 10(-3) M (GlcNAc)3, respectively. This corresponds to an increase in the stability of lysozyme of 385 and 1275 cal/mol. These results are in excellent agreement with predictions based on an equation derived by Schellman ((1975) Biopolymers 14, 999-1018) to take into account the effect of ligand binding on the melting temperature of a protein. delta T 1/2 = TT0R divided by delta HD ln (1 + KB[S]) where T and T0 are T1/2 values in the presence and absence of (GlcNAc)3, delta HD is the enthalpy of denaturation in the presence of (GlcNAc)3, KB in the equilibrium constant for the binding of (GlcNAc)3 to lysozyme, and [S] is the free concentration of (GlcNAc)3. Thus, the increased stability of an enzyme in the presence of its substrate, coenzyme, or any small molecule that it binds specifically results because binding to the native state shifts the unfolding equilibrium and decreases the concentration of unfolded states of the enzyme. It is suggested that this may be a more important factor than substrate-induced conformational changes in acccounting for the decreased rates of protein catabolism frequently observed in vivo at elevated substrate concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1543024703,"The fibroblast is a differentiated mesenchymal cell which produces and exports collagen, a macromolecule that plays a critical structural role in the function of most organs. To evaluate the control soft tissue fibroblasts have over collagen production, HFL-1, a diploid human lung cell strain, was studied during periods of rapid cell growth and relatively slow growth over 25 population doublings. To minimize environmental influences, the extracellular milieu of the cells was kept constant throughout the study period. Rates of collagen production per cell per unit time were quantitated by labeling HFL-1 with [14C]proline and measuring the production of [14C]hydroxyproline after taking into consideration the specific activity of [14C]proline within the free intracelllular proline pool and the per cent hydroxylation of proline residues in newly synthesized collagen. Although the specific activity of intracellular free proline and the per cent hydroxylation of proline in collagen varied considerably depending on the growth rates of the cells, collagen production by HFL-1 was constant, even during periods of rapid cell growth. Thus, under conditions of a stable environment, populations of soft tissue fibroblasts rigidly control their collagen production. In cultures that maintained a constant doubling time, this stability was maintained over at least 25 population doublings, suggesting that on the average, collagen production appears to be tightly controlled and dissociated from the events and sequelae of cell division."
https://openalex.org/W1554538771,"Metallothionein was purified under anaerobic conditions from livers of human fetuses ranging from 19 weeks gestational age to term. Homogeneous metallothionein obtained in the absence of reducing agents from the soluble fraction of the tissue which contained 24% and 85% of the total liver copper and zinc, respectively, had less than 1 g atom of copper and about 3.1 g atoms of zinc/mol. Extraction with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol of the insoluble fraction of the tissue (containing 76% and 15% of the liver copper and zinc, respectively) yielded a metallothionein with approximately 2.5 g atoms of copper and 1.3 g atoms of zinc. When the whole tissue was extracted similarly by the procedure of Ryden and Deutsch ((1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 519), nearly equal proportions of the two metals were obtained in the soluble fraction from which metallothionein, with about 3.0 g atoms of zinc and 1.5 g atoms of copper, was purified. Thus, zinc- and copper-rich forms of metallothionein are differently distributed between the soluble and insoluble fractions of fetal liver. Nevertheless, the predominant metal in metallothionein of human fetal liver is zinc as is the case in the adult; significant amounts of copper are also present, consistent with the elevated quantity of this metal in the fetal tissue relative to the adult. Cadmium was not detected. Zinc is much more easily removed from the protein than is copper."

https://openalex.org/W1510264962,"Saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol are important components of pulmonary surface active material. We studied the synthesis of these two phospholipid classes by alveolar type II cells in primary culture. During a 20-h incubation, type II cells incorporated a high percentage of glycerol, acetate, and palmitate into phosphatidylcholine (61.2, 76.4, and 76.8% of lipid radioactivity, respectively) and into phosphatidylglycerol (16.7, 5.8, and 6.6%). Acetate was incorporated principally by de novo synthesis of fatty acids rather than by chain elongation. We studied the pathways for synthesis of saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol with type II cells that had been in culture for 1 day. Palmitate was incorporated nearly equally into positions 1 and 2 of saturated phosphatidylglycerol, but predominantly (72%) into position 2 of saturated phosphatidylcholine. These data imply that saturated phosphatidylcholine is synthesized at least in part by acylation of 1-acyl-2-lysophosphatidylcholine. Alveolar type II cells also incorporated a mixture of saturated 1-[9,10-3H]palmitoyl-2-lysophosphatidylcholine and 1-acyl-2-lysophosphatidyl-[1,2-14C]choline from the medium by direct acylation rather than by transacylation. As the duration of culture increased beyond 1 day, type II cells incorporated a lower percentage of palmitate into phosphatidylglycerol and saturated phosphatidylcholine."
https://openalex.org/W1608901332,"Human antithrombin III has been shown to contain four identical N-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chain per molecule. These carbohydrate chains have been investigated by sugar and methylation analysis before and after removal of N-acetylneuraminic acid residues. The chains have been further investigated by Smith degradation, trifluoroacetolytic degradation, and degradation after chromium trioxide oxidation. As a result of these studies, the following structures is proposed for the carbohydrate chains in human antithrombin III: (formula: see text). NeuNAc, N-acetylneuraminic acid; Galp, galactopyranose; GlcNAcp, 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucopyranose; Manp, mannopyranose are the abbreviations used in the structure."
https://openalex.org/W1607363102,"We describe the interactions at 25 degrees C of the 3-carbanions (I-) and 3-carbon conjugate acids (I) of 3-nitropropionate, 3-nitro-2-hydroxypropionate, and 3-nitro-2-aminopropionate with fumarase and aspartase. (Formula: see text) 1. Ia- and Ib- inhibit fumarase competitively and are bound more than 4000- and 18,000-fold more tightly, respectively, than Ia and Ib, and 5000- and 11,000-fold more tightly, respectively, than succinate. Ic inhibits aspartase competitively and is bound (depending on the ionization state of the 2-amino group) more than 220- to 1630-fold more tightly than Ic and 290- to 2200-fold more tightly than succinate. 2. Fumarase and asparatse bind I- much more tightly than their respective substrates. Thus, Km/KIa- and Km/KIb- for fumarase are 375 and 900, respectively (with KIa- = 64 nm and KIb- = 27 nM at pH 7.0). For asparatse, Km/KIa- = 519, while Km/KIc- = 1630 (2-amino group unprotonated) or 220 (2-amino group protonated). 3. The values of kI and k-I (FORMULA: SEE TEXT) for fumarase are respectively, 0.55 X 10(8) M-1 s-1 and 3.5 s-1 for Ia- and 2.6 X 10(8) M-1 s-1 and 6.9 s-1 for Ib- at pH 7.0. These results, together with those of control experiments with Malic Enzyme, suggest that Ia-, Ib-, and Ic- are transition state, or transient intermediate, analogues and that the mechanisms of the fumarase and aspartase reactions involve enzyme-bound 3-carbanions."

https://openalex.org/W1514728968,"The benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase system of Pseudomonas arvilla consists of two proteins, an NADH-cytochrome c reductase and an oxygenase. The oxygenase component was purified to apparent homogeneity by the criteria of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from benzoate-induced cells of P. arvilla. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be 273,000 by sedimentation equilibrium analysis, 280,000 by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels of different concentrations, and 270,000 by Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration, respectively. The sedimentation coefficient, the Stokes radius, and the partial specific volume of the enzyme were calculated to be 10.0 S, 56 A, and 0.72 ml/g, respectively. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was estimated to be pH 4.5. The enzyme contained about 10 mol of iron and about 8 mol of labile sulfide/mol of enzyme. The iron-sulfur clusters of the enzyme were suggested to be (2Fe-2S*) from cluster-extrusion experiments (S*, sulfide, acid-labile sulfur). No significant amounts of heme or flavin were detected in the enzyme. The enzyme exhibited absorption spectrum with maxima at 279, 325, and 464 nm. The turnover number of the enzyme in the presence of saturating amounts of NADH-cytochrome c reductase, the other component of the benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase system, was calculated to be 22,000 at 24 degrees C. The apparent Km values for the reductase, benzoate, and molecular oxygen were 26 (0.97 mg of protein/ml), 3.9, and 4.3 microM, respectively."

We describe the use of high voltage paper electrophoresis in borate for the resolution of seven glycopeptides from ovalbumin and seven glycopeptides from human immunoglobulin G. This technique has been used in the preparation of glycopeptide substrates required for the study of certain glycosyltransferases and glycosidases.

https://openalex.org/W1512115523,"Rat liver ferritins consist of families of isoferritins fashioned from different proportions of two subunit types, H and L. Iron administration alters both the absolute and the relative amounts of these isoferritins through an increase in L-rich forms. This phenotype change represents preferential synthesis of L-rich isoferritins together with a faster degradation of H-rich isoferritins. The turnover rates of isoferritins in the same liver are markedly different and vary progressively with subunit composition. The H and L subunits in individual isoferritins appear to turn over at similar rates, suggesting that the various isoferritins are degraded as intact shells rather than through exchange and degradation of subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1519378496,"Porcine pancreatic lipase was inhibited by alkane and arene boronic acids. The inhibition by octadecane boronic acid was competitive when measured against the hydrolysis of dissolved tripropionin in the presence of siliconized glass beads. The value of Ki in this system was 1.34 x 10(3) molecules micron-2. The ratio of substrate to inhibitor concentrations giving 50% inhibition was in the range of 700 to 2200, indicating that lipase has a greater affinity for boronic acids than for tripropionin. Boronic acids did not interfere with the interaction of lipase with the siliconized glass/water interface, demonstrating that the binding of lipase to substrate interfaces, the first step in lipase action, was not the step at which inhibition occurred. The boronic acid binding site on lipase is at or near the active center serine since modification of this residue by diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate was prevented by boronic acids. Modification of the active center serine residue by diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate also prevented boronic acid binding. Binding of a chromophoric boronic acid, 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazolyl m-aminobenzene boronic acid, to lipase was demonstrated by equilibrium gel filtration on polyacrylamide beads (Bio-Gel P-60) in the presence of 4 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate. The complex contained 1 molecule of boronic acid per molecule of lipase and had a dissociation constant Kd of 5 x 10(-6) M. The boronic acid was not bound in the absence of taurodeoxycholate. Boronic acids are believed to be analogs of the tetrahedral intermediate in the action of lipase."

https://openalex.org/W1510285220,"Abstract The acceptor substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the purified porcine submaxillary beta-galactoside alpha 1 leads to 2 fucosyltransferase have been examined. The transferase forms the Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal linkage with oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids which contain nonreducing terminal galactose residues and shows no absolute specificity for a particular penultimate residue or for the linkage between the galactose and the penultimate residue. The fucosyltransferase is active in the absence of divalent metal ions, but it is stimulated upon addition of Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, or Co2+. Kinetic analysis indicates an increase in the Km for both donor and acceptor substrates and in the Vmax in the presence of Mn2+. Initial rate studies and inhibition patterns suggest that the transferase has either a rapid equilibrium random kinetic mechanism or a steady state ordered mechanism with GDP-fucose binding first. Human Bombay erythrocytes which lack cell surface Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal structures are fucosylated by the transferase, but expression of H blood group activity is dependent on treatment of the cells with neuraminidase. After neuraminidase digestion, the fucosylated cells are serologically identical to native O-type cells. Analysis of the fucosylated material in the erythrocyte membrane on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggests that fucose is incorporated primarily into glycoprotein acceptors."

https://openalex.org/W1604864481,"Stopped flow kinetic studies have been used to demonstrate three features of the enzymatic mechanism of the microsomal FAD-containing monooxygenase from hog liver. First, in contrast to the bacterial flavin-containing monooxygenases, reduction of the FAD is independent of substrate. Second, the rate of the reaction of reduced enzyme with oxygen to form the C(4a)-peroxyflavin intermediate is independent of substrate. Third, the rate of transformation of the C(4a)-peroxyflavin to oxidized FAD is substrate-dependent. These results are in agreement with the mechanism, determined by steady state kinetic studies (Poulsen, L.L., and Ziegler, D.M. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 6449-6455), which predicts that the reduced flavin reacts with oxygen before combination with substrate."

This result suggests that the enzymatic conversion of propionate groups of coproporphyrinogen III to vinyl groups of protoporphyrinogen IX occurs stepwise starting from position 2 to 4 through beta-hydroxypropionate porphyrinogen as an intermediate. When coproporphyrinogen oxidase was treated with tetranitromethane, an initial modification of 1 tyrosine residue per molecule did not affect the enzyme activity, whereas modification of a second tyrosine residue resulted in a substantial inactivation of the enzyme. Conversion of 2,4-bis-(beta-hydroxypropionic acid) deuteroporphyrinogen XI into protoporphyrinogen IX was not affected by the tyrosine residue modification. Both modification and kinetic studies led to a conclusion that at least one tyrosine residue is involved in the active site of the enzyme, presumably participating in the initial reaction of the oxidation step of a propionate group to beta-hydroxypropionate."
https://openalex.org/W1606147438,"Removal of the terminal sialic acid residues from most mammalian glycoproteins results in their rapid transfer from the circulation into the liver. In vitro, these desialylated glycoproteins bind to a specific membrane-associated hepatic lectin which has a ubiquitous distribution within the liver cell. In the present study, infusion of a specific antibody to the purified lectin into the portal vein of an isolated perfused rat liver prior to injection of radiolabeled asialoorosomucoid or bilirubin reduced the rate of influx of asialoorosomucoid into the liver by over 80%, while the influx of bilirubin was unchanged. Although uptake of asialoorosomucoid remained blocked for at least 90 min after excess antibody was removed from the perfusion system, the total hepatic content of functional binding protein was nearly normal. These results indicate that interaction with specific cell surface lectin is essential for removal of asialoorosomucoid from the circulation. During the 90 min following infusion of antibody, no functional lectin is restored to the surface of hepatocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1598067475,"The reaction mechanism of melilotate hydroxylase in the presence of 2-OH-cinnamate has been investigated by equilibrium titration, steady state kinetic and rapid reaction kinetic techniques. Analysis of the rapid reaction results for the reoxidation of reduced enzyme . 2-OH-cinnamate complex by molecular oxygen revealed the presence of an intermediate with visible absorption spectrum very similar to that of a C4a-flavin adduct. Repetition of this reoxidation experiment in the presence of 32 mM potassium iodide indicated the sequential appearance of two C4a-flavin adducts. Further analysis of these spectra indicated that hydroxylation of the substrate occurred during the conversion of the first intermediate into the second. Reaction of the oxidized enzyme . 2-OH-cinnamate complex with NADH was saturable in NADH. Oxidized enzyme was converted, in an apparent first order fashion, to a reduced enzyme . NAD charge-transfer-type species which subsequently decayed to reduced enzyme. The turnover number calculated from rapid reaction data was in good agreement with that determined from steady state analyses. Titration and rapid reaction results indicated that at no point in the reaction was there an observable intermediate which contained 2-OH-cinnamate in its phenolate form."

https://openalex.org/W1508165723,"The bile acid-conjugating enzyme cholyl-coenzyme A:glycine/taurine N-acyltransferase previously purified from bovine liver was subjected to a bisubstrate kinetic analysis. Double reciprocal plots of reaction rates as a function of variable concentrations of aminoa acid and cholyl-CoA yielded the nonintersecting type of plots typical of ping-pong reaction mechanisms. A Tetra Uni ping-pong mechanism was supported by further kinetic analysis including demonstration that the enzyme will catalyze the release of CoA from cholyl-CoA without glycine being present. This half-reaction is shown not to be the result of an acyl-CoA thiolase contaminating the N-acyltransferase preparation. The specificity of the enzyme for amino acid was found to be quite narrow; no detectable rate was found for D-Ala, L-Ala, L-Ser, L-Glu-NH2, L-ornithine, or beta-alanine. Activity toward various acyl-CoA derivatives was also tested. Phenylacetyl-CoA, benzoyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA were not substrates. CoA derivatives of the other common bile acids were very good substrates. Conjugated bile acids were efficient competitive inhibitors of cholyl-CoA binding. Cholic acid also inhibited; however, its inhibition pattern was complex. The enzyme could be reversibly inhibited by p-mercuribenzoate and both cholyl-CoA and glycine protected. N-Ethylmaleimide and iodoacetate were not inhibitory."
https://openalex.org/W1563381512,"Methotrexate and 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide react to form a relatively unstable product (activated methotrexate) that irreversibly inhibits methotrexate transport in L1210 mouse leukemia cells. The rate of methotrexate transport was reduced 50% by pretreatment of cells with activated methotrexate at a concentration of 1 microM and by 98% upon exposure to an excess (40 microM) of this agent. Specificity was demonstrated by the fact that activated methotrexate had no effect on other transport systems (i.e. leucine and phosphate) and that complete protection against inactivation was afforded by either the unlabeled substrate (methotrexate) or a competitive inhibitor (phosphate). The carbodiimide-generated derivatives of aminopterin, folate, and p-aminobenzoylglutamate were also irreversible inhibitors of methotrexate transport, and their relative effectiveness paralleled the ability of the parent compounds (aminopterin greater than methotrexate greater than folate greater than p-aminobenzoylglutamate) to act as reversible transport inhibitors. Measurements at 4 degrees C showed that activated methotrexate (Ki = 0.8 microM) was a competitive inhibitor for binding of methotrexate (KD = 0.4 microM) to the transport protein. Treatment of the cells with sufficient activated methotrexate to inhibit transport increased the KD for methotrexate to 0.9 microM but had no effect on total methotrexate-binding activity. Methotrexate efflux was also reduced but was not blocked by an excess of this reagent."

https://openalex.org/W1526138335,"Rabbits were made anemic to different extents by phenylhydrazine injections so as to vary the developmental stages of the erythroid cells in their peripheral blood and bone marrow. It was found that the more severe the anemia, the lower the concentration of glycerate-2,3-P2 in the bone marrow cells and in the circulating erythroid cells. The glycerate-2,3-P2 level was shown to rise during erythroid differentiation in a linear relationship to the hemoglobin level, corresponding to the equation Y = 0.03x + 0.29, where y is the concentration of glycerate-2,3-P2 (micromoles per ml packed cells) and x is the concentration of hemoglobin (milligrams per packed cells). The bone marrow cells were fractionated on a size (i.e. maturity) basis and enzyme activities in the fractionated cells were measured. The accumulation of glycerate-2,3-P2 was found to be primarily attributable to the increase in glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase activity. Glycerate-2,3-P2 phosphatase and phosphofructokinase increased as the cells matured from the polychromatic stages to become reticulocytes while pyruvate kinase and phosphoglyceromutase decreased. The changes in phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase appear to be advantageous for glycerate-2,3-P2 accumulation. The two enzyme activities directly responsible for the synthesis and the breakdown of glycerate-2,3-P2 are probably manifested by a single protein, glycerate-2,3-P2 synthase-phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1546709430,"The cholinergic mouse neuroblastoma cell line NS20Y was adapted to undifferentiated growth in suspension culture. When suspension cells were transferred to surface culture and treated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP, the cells underwent differentiation as assessed by biochemical, morphological, and physiological criteria. Differentiated NS20Y cells in co-culture with mouse muscle cells had the capacity to form functional neuromuscular junctions with the muscle cells. The sequence complexities of the poly(A)-containing messenger RNA (poly(A)+ mRNA) of the differentiated, process-forming cells (P-cells) and undifferentiated cells in suspension culture (S-cells) were measured by analysis of the kinetics of hybridization of the mRNAs with their complementary DNAs (cDNAs). There were less than 100 high abundance and approximately 8000 low abundance poly(A)+ mRNAs in both differentiation states. Heterologous hybridization reactions and recycling of the cDNA probes revealed that 9.7% and 6.8% of the messages in P- and S-cells, respectively, were specific to those differentiation states. The P-cell-specific sequences included approximately 3 high abundance and 320 low abundance poly(A)+ mRNAs. The S-cell-specific sequences included approximately 3 high abundance and 250 low abundance poly(A)+ mRNAs. We conclude that the increment in NS20Y differentiation results in both the disappearance of old, and the appearance of new mRNAs in polyribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1516286825,"13N- and 15N-labeling experiments were carried out with Paracoccus denitrificans, grown anaerobically on nitrate, to determine whether hyponitrite might be an obligatory intermediate in denitrification and a precursor of nitrous oxide. From experiments designed to trap [13N]- or [15N,15N]hyponitrite by dilution into authentic hyponitrite it was calculated that the intracellular concentration of a presumptive hyponitrite pool must be less than 0.4 mM. In order for a pool of this size to turn over rapidly enough to handle the flux of nitrogen during dentrifucation, the spontaneous rate of hyponitrite dehydration must be enhanced by a factor of several thousand through enzyme catalysis. Cell extracts failed to catalyze this reaction under a variety of conditions. It is concluded that hyponitrite cannot be an intermediate in dentrification. In addition, the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen was studied in P. denitrificans using 13N as tracer. At low concentrations (less than 10(-8) M) of labeled nitrate and nitrite 5 to 10% of the label was assimilated into non-volatile metabolites and 90 to 95% was reduced to N2. Similarly, with 15 mM [13N]nitrate, 5% of the label went into metabolites and 95% to N2. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the labeled metabolites indicated that the major pathway for assimilation of inorganic nitrogen in P. denitrificans under these conditions is through ammonia incorporation via the aspartase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1588121589,"The carbon monoxide binding kinetics of the isolated trout Hb I has been investigated by flash photolysis at various temperatures, from approximately 20 degrees to 72 degrees C. The time course of recombination has been quantitatively analyzed with a simple two-state allosteric model, making use of the thermodynamic data previously obtained. These new experiments and their analysis show that a simple two-state kinetic model is adequate, in the case of trout Hb I, to describe quantitatively the time course of CO binding at all temperatures. Moreover, we show that temperature can be used to perturb the quaternary conformational equilibrium, the high affinity state of the molecule (R) being progressively more populated at higher temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2104058384,"A fully kinetoplastic strain of an antigenic variant of Trypanosoma equiperdum has been made dyskinetoplastic by successive treatments of infected rats with ethidium bromide or acriflavine. After seven passages in the absence of the dye, the loss of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) is stable and complete as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation, CsCl-dye gradients, and the reassociation kinetics of in vitro-labeled kDNA. Moreover, these trypanosomes exhibit the same infectivity as the wild type. These results suggest that neither the minicircles nor the maxicircles of the kDNA network are essential to the viability and the pathogenicity of blood-stream trypanosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1560748788,"Creatine kinase does not catalyze the scrambling of 18O in adenosine 5'-[alpha beta-18O, beta-18O2]triphosphate in the absence of creatine, in the presence of L-arginine or taurocyamine (competitive inhibitors of creatine), or in the presence of poor substrates where single turnover experiments were performed. In order to support this prima facie evidence for an associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer, an investigation was undertaken of 1-carboxymethyl-2-aminoimidazole, a new substrate analogue of creatine. This analogue has a binding constant for rabbit muscle creatine kinase similar to creatine and 1-carboxymethyl-2-iminoimidazolidine, but the initial rate of phoshorylation by MgATP in the presence of creatine kinase is almost 5 orders of magnitude slower. The phosphorylation product, assigned the structure 1-carboxymethyl-2-imino-3-phospho-4-imidazoline is also a poor substrate for the phosphorylation of MgADP by creatine kinase. These observations can be accounted for by an associative SN2(P) mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and by a microenvironment of the enzyme-bound creatine (or creatine analogue) which lowers the pKa of the guanidino group by several pH units compared with that in aqueous solution."
https://openalex.org/W1520635903,"5-Dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl)-Co-eIF-2A was prepared using homogeneous Co-eIF-2A. Dansyl-Co-eIF-2A was as active as untreated Co-eIF-2A when assayed for stimulation of ternary complex formation and also for protection of the ternary complex from dissociation by aurintricarboxylic acid. The mechanism of interaction of dansyl-Co-eIF-2A with eIF-2 was studied by measuring changes in fluorescence polarization. These studies indicate that dansyl-Co-eIF-2A interacts specifically with the ternary complex and does not interact with free eIF-2 or with two other high molecular weight protein complexes, Co-eIF-2B and Co-eIF-2C. Mg2+ inhibits ternary complex formation by eIF-2 and Co-eIF-2C relieves this Mg2+ inhibition of ternary complex formation. In both cases, the changes in fluorescence polarization of dansyl-Co-eIF-2A correlate well with the extent of ternary complex formed."

https://openalex.org/W1505330938,"Treatment of intact pigeon erythrocytes with trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin does not alter the isoproterenol-dependent adenylate cyclase activity in plasma membranes prepared after proteolysis. However, both proteases affect adenylate cyclase activity when isolated membranes are digested. Thus, the proteases probably act at the cytoplasmic side of the membranes. This conclusion is supported by the finding that proteases are able to inhibit NADH cytochrome c oxidoreductase, an enzyme located on the inner face of the plasma membrane. In isolated membranes, trypsin inhibits adenylate cyclase. Chymotrypsin (2.5 microgram/ml, 10 min, 37 degrees C) activates adenylate cyclase about 3-fold when the enzyme activity is measured with NaF, guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)-triphosphate, or guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)-triphosphate and isoproterenol. Chymotrypsin also activates adenylate cyclase in membranes pretreated with cholera toxin. Activation by chymotrypsin is not expressed when adenylate cyclase is assayed with 5 mM Mn2+ without guanine nucleotides or fluoride. However, the chymotryptic activation is expressed when guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)-triphosphate is present together with Mn2+. We conclude that interaction of the guanine nucleotide regulatory subunit with the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase is required for expression of chymotryptic activation."
https://openalex.org/W2097687635,"Submitochondrial particles obtained from skeletal muscle are open membrane fragments which show energy coupling yet cannot sustain transmembrane ion gradients. An energy-linked decrease in fluorescence emission of the fluorescent probe quinacrine is observed with skeletal muscle particles which is enhanced by the anion SCN-. This is essentially the same reaction observed with beef heart submitochondrial particles, in which the reaction is known to be a monitor of intramembrane H+ transfer. The results with skeletal muscle particles show that this intramembrane H+ transfer occurs in the absence of any electrochemical potential across the membrane. Further, it occurs independently of the direction of H+ exchange with the suspendingly medium, since energization of skeletal muscle submitochondrial particles is known to give H+ efflux into the medium, while energization of beef heart particles gives H+ uptake from the medium. We conclude that a primary reaction of energy coupling is intramembrane H+ transfer linked to electron transport but shielded from the suspending medium. Movements of H+ between membrane and medium are secondary reactions derived from the primary one, possibly linked by a series of intramembrane conformational changes comprising a sequential membrane Bohr effect."
https://openalex.org/W1663681308,"In the fungus Podospora anserina, a double mutant strain which combines two ribosomal mutations exhibits a marked sensitivity to NH4+ acetate. Mutations which suppress this phenotype were isolated. Two mutants were found to have an electrophoretically altered ribosomal protein. In one mutant, protein S15 from the small subunit has a reduced charge; in the other, the 60 S protein L16 is shorter than the homologous wild type protein. Both mutant and wild type proteins are present in heterokaryotic strains combining mutant and wild type nuclei. We therefore propose that the alteration of S15 and L16 results from mutations in the structural genes for these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1543414589,"Wheat and rabbit 18 rRNAs radiolabeled at the 3' end with [5'-32P]pCp were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after chemical cleavage or partial enzymatic digestion under nondenaturing conditions. rRNA was similarly analyzed after photoreaction with 4'-aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen and photoreversal of the resulting pyrimidine cross-links. The digestion patterns indicated the presence of a base-paired structure within a conserved 3'-terminal sequence. This structure corresponds to the 3'-proximal hairpin configuration suggested previously for the small subunit rRNAs of Escherichia coli, yeast, rat, and silkworm on the basis of their nucleotide sequences."
https://openalex.org/W138982757,"In previous studies, it was shown that a 4600-dalton pyruvate-containing peptide is released from proline reductase by mild alkali treatment. The alkali-sensitive bond proved to be between Ser-Glu, and it was suggested that an ester, rather than a peptide linkage, might be involved. In the present study, the effects of additional esterolytic reagents, (I) LiBH4 and (II) NH2OH, on proline reductase have been investigated and compared with 0.1 N NaOH-induced cleavage. Treatment with reagents I and II released a peptide identical with the peptide released by alkali as judged by electrophoretic mobility on thin layer sheets, COOH-terminal analyses, and amino acid compositional studies. The glutamic acid residue is converted to alpha-amino-delta-hydroxyvaleric acid after reductive cleavage with LiBH4. The liberation of the peptide fragment by the relatively specific esterolytic reagent, LiBH4, provides additional support of the presence of an ester linkage in native proline reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1600213545,"Mouse IgA 47A is an immunoglobulin variant whose heavy (alpha) chain has a molecular weight of 40,000 and lacks the entire CH3 domain. In order to understand better the mechanism by which the CH3 domain is lost, the 47A heavy chain mRNA has been partially purified. The mRNA migrated as a 17 S species on sucrose gradients and coded for the cell-free synthesis of only one serologically reactive protein with an apparent molecular weight of 42,000. Competitive inhibition of immunoprecipitation and tryptic peptide analysis of a cyanogen bromide fragment of the in vitro product revealed significant homology between the authentically secreted heavy chain and the respective cell-free synthesized, immunoprecipitated product. The heavy chain mRNA of 47A possessed a chain length of about 2200 nucleotides which is the same size as a normal alpha heavy chain mRNA, thus demonstrating that the protein deletion is not due to a large deletion at the mRNA level. The deletion in the 47A heavy chain may be due to a frameshift of a single nucleotide followed by premature chain termination."
