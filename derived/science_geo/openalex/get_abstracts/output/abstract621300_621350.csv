https://openalex.org/W2898656436,"Power demands are set to increase by two-fold within the current century and a high fraction of that demand should be met by carbon free sources. Among the renewable energies, solar energy is among the fastest growing; therefore, a comprehensive and accurate design methodology for solar systems and how they interact with the local environment is vital. This paper addresses the environmental effects of solar panels on an unirrigated pasture that often experiences water stress. Changes to the microclimatology, soil moisture, water usage, and biomass productivity due to the presence of solar panels were quantified. The goal of this study was to show that the impacts of these factors should be considered in designing the solar farms to take advantage of potential net gains in agricultural and power production. Microclimatological stations were placed in the Rabbit Hills agrivoltaic solar arrays, located in Oregon State campus, two years after the solar array was installed. Soil moisture was quantified using neutron probe readings. Significant differences in mean air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and soil moisture were observed. Areas under PV solar panels maintained higher soil moisture throughout the period of observation. A significant increase in late season biomass was also observed for areas under the PV panels (90% more biomass), and areas under PV panels were significantly more water efficient (328% more efficient)."

Salinity stress enhanced biochemical contents and antioxidant activity in A. tricolor leaves. Protein, ash, energy, dietary fiber, minerals (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Na), β-carotene, ascorbic acid, total polyphenol content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (DPPH and ABTS+) in leaves were increased by 18%, 6%, 5%, 16%, 9%, 16%, 11%, 17%, 38%, 20%, 64%, 31%, 22%, 16%, 16%, 25% and 17%, respectively at 50 mM NaCl concentration and 31%, 12%, 6%, 30%, 57%, 35%, 95%, 96%, 82%, 87%, 27%, 63%, 82%, 39%, 30%, 58% and 47%, respectively at 100 mM NaCl concentration compared to control condition. Contents of vitamins, polyphenols and flavonoids showed a good antioxidant activity due to positive and significant interrelationships with total antioxidant capacity. It revealed that A. tricolor can tolerate a certain level of salinity stress without compromising the nutritional quality of the final product. This report for the first time demonstrated that salinity stress at certain level remarkably enhances nutritional quality of the leafy vegetable A. tricolor. Taken together, our results suggest that A. tricolor could be a promising alternative crop for farmers in salinity prone areas- in the tropical and sub-tropical regions with enriched nutritional contents and antioxidant activity."
https://openalex.org/W2898918507,"Immunodeficient mice engrafted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) support preclinical studies of human pathogens, allograft rejection, and human T-cell function. However, a major limitation of PBMC engraftment is development of acute xenogeneic graft- versus-host disease (GVHD) due to human T-cell recognition of murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC). To address this, we created 2 NOD- scid IL-2 receptor subunit γ ( IL2rg) null (NSG) strains that lack murine MHC class I and II [NSG-β-2-microglobulin ( B2M) null ( IA IE)null and NSG -( Kb Db) null ( IAnull)]. We observed rapid human IgG clearance in NSG- B2Mnull ( IA IE) null mice whereas clearance in NSG -( Kb Db) null ( IAnull) mice and NSG mice was comparable. Injection of human PBMCs into both strains enabled long-term engraftment of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells without acute GVHD. Engrafted human T-cell function was documented by rejection of human islet allografts. Administration of human IL-2 to NSG -( Kb Db) null ( IAnull) mice via adeno-associated virus vector increased human CD45+ cell engraftment, including an increase in human regulatory T cells. However, high IL-2 levels also induced the development of GVHD. These data document that NSG mice deficient in murine MHC support studies of human immunity in the absence of acute GVHD and enable evaluation of human antibody therapeutics targeting human T cells.-Brehm, M. A., Kenney, L. L., Wiles, M. V., Low, B. E., Tisch, R. M., Burzenski, L., Mueller, C., Greiner, D. L., Shultz, L. D.

https://openalex.org/W2899132865,"Efforts to recycle organic wastes using black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens into high-nutrient biomass that constitutes a sustainable fat (biodiesel) and high-quality protein ingredient in animal feeds have recently gained momentum worldwide. However, there is little information on the most suitable rearing conditions for growth, development and survivorship of these flies, which is a prerequisite for mass production technologies. We evaluated the physiological requirements for growth and reproduction of H. illucens on two diets [spent grains supplemented with brewers’ yeast (D1) and un-supplemented (D2)]. Development rates at nine constant temperatures (10–42°C) were fitted to temperature-dependent linear and non-linear day-degree models. Thereafter, life history table parameters were determined within a range of favourable temperatures. The thermal maximum (TM) estimates for larval, pre-pupal and pupal development using non-linear model ranged between 37.2 ± 0.3 and 44.0 ± 2.3°C. The non-linear and linear day-degree model estimations of lower developmental temperature threshold for larvae were 11.7 ± 0.9 and 12.3 ± 1.4°C for D1, and 10.4 ± 1.7 and 11.7 ± 3.0°C for D2, respectively. The estimated thermal constant of immature life stages development of BSF was higher for the larval stage (250±25 DD for D1 and 333±51 for D2) than the other stages evaluated. Final larval wet weight was higher on D1 compared to D2. The population growth rate was most favourable at 30-degree celsius (°C) with higher intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm = 0.127 for D1 and 0.122 for D2) and shorter doubling time (5.5 days for D1 and 5.7 days for D2) compared to the other temperatures. These results are valuable for the optimization of commercial mass rearing procedures of BSF under various environmental conditions and prediction of population dynamics patterns using computer simulation models."
https://openalex.org/W2899136154,"Limited real-world data are available regarding the comparative safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The objective of this retrospective claims observational cohort study was to compare the risk of bleeding among non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients prescribed apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban. NVAF patients aged ≥18 years with a 1-year baseline period were included if they were new initiators of NOACs or switched from warfarin to a NOAC. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios of any bleeding, clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding, and major inpatient bleeding within 6 months of treatment initiation for rivaroxaban and dabigatran compared to apixaban. Among 60,227 eligible patients, 8,785 were prescribed apixaban, 20,963 dabigatran, and 30,529 rivaroxaban. Compared to dabigatran or rivaroxaban patients, apixaban patients were more likely to have greater proportions of baseline comorbidities and higher CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores. After adjusting for baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, patients prescribed rivaroxaban were more likely to experience any bleeding (HR: 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26–1.45), CRNM bleeding (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.27–1.49), and major inpatient bleeding (HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17–1.74), compared to patients prescribed apixaban. Dabigatran patients had similar bleeding risks as apixaban patients. In conclusion, NVAF patients treated with rivaroxaban appeared to have an increased risk of any bleeding, CRNM bleeding, and major inpatient bleeding, compared to apixaban patients. There was no significant difference in any bleeding, CRNM bleeding, or inpatient major bleeding risks between patients treated with dabigatran and apixaban."
https://openalex.org/W2897475166,"Background Use of selective COX-2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (coxibs) has been associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the risk of AMI has only been studied for very few NSAIDs that are frequently used. Objectives To estimate the risk of AMI for individual NSAIDs. Methods A nested case-control study was performed from a cohort of new NSAID users ≥18 years (1999–2011) matching cases to a maximum of 100 controls on database, sex, age, and calendar time. Data were retrieved from six healthcare databases. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of current use of individual NSAIDs compared to past use were estimated per database. Pooling was done by two-stage pooling using a random effects model (ORmeta) and by one-stage pooling (ORpool). Results Among 8.5 million new NSAID users, 79,553 AMI cases were identified. The risk was elevated for current use of ketorolac (ORmeta 2.06;95%CI 1.83–2.32, ORpool 1.80; 1.49–2.18) followed, in descending order of point estimate, by indometacin, etoricoxib, rofecoxib, diclofenac, fixed combination of diclofenac with misoprostol, piroxicam, ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib, meloxicam, nimesulide and ketoprofen (ORmeta 1.12; 1.03–1.22, ORpool 1.00;0.86–1.16). Higher doses showed higher risk estimates than lower doses. Conclusions The relative risk estimates of AMI differed slightly between 28 individual NSAIDs. The relative risk was highest for ketorolac and was correlated with COX-2 potency, but not restricted to coxibs."
https://openalex.org/W2898778999,"Mucosal vaccine delivery systems have paramount importance for the induction of mucosal antibody responses. Two studies were conducted to evaluate immunogenicity of inactivated AIV antigens encapsulated in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs). In the first study, seven groups of specific pathogen free (SPF) layer-type chickens were immunized subcutaneously at 7-days of age with different vaccine formulations followed by booster vaccinations two weeks later. Immune responses were profiled by measuring antibody (Ab) responses in sera and lachrymal secretions of vaccinated chickens. The results indicated that inactivated AIV and CpG ODN co-encapsulated in PLGA NPs (2x NanoAI+CpG) produced higher amounts of hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies compared to a group vaccinated with non-adjuvanted AIV encapsulated in PLGA NPs (NanoAI). The tested adjuvanted NPs-based vaccine (2x NanoAI+CpG) resulted in higher IgG responses in the sera and lachrymal secretions at weeks 3, 4 and 5 post-vaccination when immunized subcutaneously. The incorporation of CpG ODN led to an increase in Ab-mediated responses and was found useful to be included both in the prime and booster vaccinations. In the second study, the ability of chitosan and mannan coated PLGA NPs that encapsulated AIV and CpG ODN was evaluated for inducing antibody responses when delivered via nasal and ocular routes in one-week-old SPF layer-type chickens. These PLGA NPs-based and surface modified formulations induced robust AIV-specific antibody responses in sera and lachrymal secretions. Chitosan coated PLGA NPs resulted in the production of large quantities of lachrymal IgA and IgG compared to mannan coated NPs, which also induced detectable amounts of IgA in addition to the induction of IgG in lachrymal secretions. In both mucosal and subcutaneous vaccination approaches, although NPs delivery enhanced Ab-mediated immunity, one booster vaccination was required to generate significant amount of Abs. These results highlight the potential of NPs-based AIV antigens for promoting the induction of both systemic and mucosal immune responses against respiratory pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2899030747,"HIV disproportionately impacts transgender communities and the majority of new infections occur in the Southern United States. Yet, limited data exists on contextual realities of HIV vulnerability and healthcare needs among transgender individuals in the Deep South. Addressing this gap in the literature, we assess the health needs, including barriers and facilitators to accessing healthcare, including and beyond HIV, from the perspective of transgender men and women in Mississippi. Between June-August 2014, in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 14) were conducted with adult transgender persons at an LGBT healthcare setting in Jackson, Mississippi. In-depth interviews lasted between 60-90 minutes and followed semi-structured format (themes probed: HIV vulnerability, healthcare needs, and availability of gender-affirming medical care). Audio files were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Dedoose (v.6.1.18). Among participants (mean age = 23.3 years, standard deviation = 4.98), 43% identified as a transgender man or on a transmasculine spectrum, 43% as Black, and 21% self-reported living with HIV. HIV-related services were frequently described as the primary gateway to accessing healthcare needs. Nonetheless, participants' primary health concerns were: gender affirmation processes (hormones, silicone, binding/packing); mental health; and drug/alcohol use. Stigma and discrimination were commonly reported in healthcare settings and health-related information was primarily attained through social networks and online resources. Results highlight gender identity alongside race and pervasive marginalization as key social determinants of transgender health in Mississippi. As Mississippi is one of several states actively debating transgender access to public accommodations, findings underscore the need to treat transgender health as a holistic and multidimensional construct, including, but moving beyond, HIV prevention and care."
https://openalex.org/W2898622999,"The major pathogenesis of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) because of disordered growth factors, such as TGF-β, in the vitreous humor. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are pluripotent growth factors. In this study, we identified the antifibrotic activity of BMP7 in a PVR model both in vivo and in vitro. BMP7 expression was confirmed on the PVR proliferative membranes. BMP7 was down-regulated in the PVR vitreous humor and TGF-β–induced RPE cell EMT. In the in vivo studies, BMP7 injection attenuated PVR progression in the eyes of the rabbit model. Additionally, BMP7 treatment maintained RPE cell phenotypes and relieved TGF-β2–induced EMT, migration, and gel contraction in vitro. BMP7 inhibited the TGF-β2–induced up-regulation of fibronectin and α–smooth muscle actin and the down-regulation of E-cadherin and zona occludens-1 by balancing the TGF-β2/Smad2/3 and BMP7/Smad1/5/9 pathways. These findings provide direct evidence of the ability of BMP7 in PVR inhibition and the potential of BMP7 for use in PVR therapeutic intervention.—Yao, H., Ge, T., Zhang, Y., Li, M., Yang, S., Li, H., Wang, F.

https://openalex.org/W2898962197,"Sweat is a biofluid with several attractive attributes. However, investigation into sweat for biomarker discovery applications is still in its infancy. To add support for the use of sweat as a non-invasive media for human performance monitoring, volunteer participants were subjected to a physical exertion model using a treadmill. Following exercise, sweat was collected, aliquotted, and analyzed for metabolite and protein content via high-resolution mass spectrometry. Overall, the proteomic analysis illustrates significant enrichment steps will be required for proteomic biomarker discovery from single sweat samples as protein abundance is low in this medium. Furthermore, the results indicate a potential for protein degradation, or a large number of low molecular weight protein/peptides, in these samples. Metabolomic analysis shows a strong correlation in the overall abundance among sweat metabolites. Finally, hierarchical clustering of participant metabolite abundances show trends emerging, although no significant trends were observed (alpha = 0.8, lambda = 1 standard error via cross validation). However, these data suggest with a greater number of biological replicates, stronger, statistically significant results, can be obtained. Collectively, this study represents the first to simultaneously use both proteomic and metabolomic analysis to investigate sweat. These data highlight several pitfalls of sweat analysis for biomarker discovery applications."
https://openalex.org/W2898714921,"The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) is a self-report questionnaire designed to evaluate the severity and functional impairment associated with anxiety. Given its transdiagnostic nature, it can be used indistinctly across anxiety and depressive disorders. In this study, the psychometric properties of the online version of the OASIS were evaluated in a Spanish clinical sample with emotional disorders. Patients (n = 583) with anxiety (n = 250) and depression (n = 333) with a mean age of 37.21 (SD = 12.22), underwent a diagnostic interview and questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, positive and negative affect, and quality of life. Factorial structure, internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, cutoff scores, and sensitivity to change were analyzed. Confirmatory Factor Analysis yielded a unidimensional factor structure, consistent with previous validations of the instrument. The analyses showed good internal consistency and adequate convergent and discriminant validity, as well as sensitivity to change. A cutoff score of 7.5 was found to meet the criteria used in this study to select the optimal cutoff point. Overall, in this study, the psychometric properties of the online version of the OASIS were found to be appropriate. The brevity and ease of use of the OASIS support its adequacy as a valid measure of anxiety severity and impairment in Spanish clinical samples with anxiety and depression."
https://openalex.org/W2898722889,"Peer education with micro-planning has been integral to scaling up key population (KP) HIV/STI programmes in Kenya since 2013. Micro-planning reinforces community cohesion within peer networks and standardizes programme inputs, processes and targets for outreach, including peer educator (PE) workloads. We assessed programme performance for outreach–in relation to the mean number of KPs for which one PE is responsible (KP:PE ratio)–and effects on HIV/STI service utilisation. Quarterly programmatic monitoring data were analysed from October 2013 to September 2016 from implementing partners working with female sex workers (FSWs) and men who have sex with men (MSM) across the country. All implementing partners are expected to follow national guidelines and receive micro-planning training for PEs with support from a Technical Support Unit for KP programmes. We examined correlations between KP:PE ratios and regular outreach contacts, condom distribution, risk reduction counselling, STI screening, HIV testing and violence reporting by KPs. Kenya conducted population size estimates (PSEs) of KPs in 2012. From 2013 to 2016, KP programmes were scaled up to reach 85% of FSWs (PSE 133,675) and 90% of MSM (PSE 18,460). Overall, mean KP:PE ratios decreased from 147 to 91 for FSWs, and from 79 to 58 for MSM. Lower KP:PE ratios, up to 90:1 for FSW and 60:1 for MSM, were significantly associated with more regular outreach contacts (p<0.001), as well as more frequent risk reduction counselling (p<0.001), STI screening (p<0.001) and HIV testing (p<0.001). Condom distribution and reporting of violence by KPs did not differ significantly between the two groups over all time periods. Micro-planning with adequate KP:PE ratios is an effective approach to scaling up HIV prevention programmes among KPs, resulting in high levels of programme uptake and service utilisation."
https://openalex.org/W2899172575,"Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is one of the most common ocular surface diseases in the world. In AC, T helper type 2 (Th2) immune responses play central roles in orchestrating inflammatory responses. However, the roles of lipid mediators in the onset and progression of AC remain to be fully explored. Although previous reports have shown the beneficial effects of supplementation of ω-3 fatty acids in asthma or atopic dermatitis, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, a diet rich in ω-3 fatty acids alleviated AC symptoms in both early and late phases without affecting Th2 immune responses, but rather by altering the lipid mediator profiles. The ω-3 fatty acids completely suppressed scratching behavior toward the eyes, an allergic reaction provoked by itch. Although total serum IgE levels and the expression levels of Th2 cytokines and chemokines in the conjunctiva were not altered by ω-3 fatty acids, eosinophil infiltration into the conjunctiva was dramatically suppressed. The levels of ω-6-derived proinflammatory lipid mediators, including those with chemoattractant properties for eosinophils, were markedly reduced in the conjunctivae of ω-3 diet-fed mice. Dietary ω-3 fatty acids can alleviate a variety of symptoms of AC by altering the lipid mediator profile.-Hirakata, T., Lee, H.-C., Ohba, M., Saeki, K., Okuno, T., Murakami, A., Matsuda, A., Yokomizo, T. Dietary ω-3 fatty acids alter the lipid mediator profile and alleviate allergic conjunctivitis without modulating Th2 immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2952493777,"Monocytes are amongst the first cells recruited into the brain after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We have shown monocyte depletion 24 hours prior to TBI reduces brain edema, decreases neutrophil infiltration and improves behavioral outcomes. Additionally, both lesion and ventricle size correlate with poor neurologic outcome after TBI. Therefore, we aimed to determine the association between monocyte infiltration, lesion size, and ventricle volume. We hypothesized that monocyte depletion would attenuate lesion size, decrease ventricle enlargement, and preserve white matter in mice after TBI. C57BL/6 mice underwent pan monocyte depletion via intravenous injection of liposome-encapsulated clodronate. Control mice were injected with liposome-encapsulated PBS. TBI was induced via an open-head, controlled cortical impact. Mice were imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1, 7, and 14 days post-injury to evaluate progression of lesion and to detect morphological changes associated with injury (3D T1-weighted MRI) including regional alterations in white matter patterns (multi-direction diffusion MRI). Lesion size and ventricle volume were measured using semi-automatic segmentation and active contour methods with the software program ITK-SNAP. Data was analyzed with the statistical software program PRISM. No significant effect of monocyte depletion on lesion size was detected using MRI following TBI (p = 0.4). However, progressive ventricle enlargement following TBI was observed to be attenuated in the monocyte-depleted cohort (5.3 ± 0.9mm3) as compared to the sham-depleted cohort (13.2 ± 3.1mm3; p = 0.02). Global white matter integrity and regional patterns were evaluated and quantified for each mouse after extracting fractional anisotropy maps from the multi-direction diffusion-MRI data using Siemens Syngo DTI analysis package. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were preserved in the monocyte-depleted cohort (123.0 ± 4.4mm3) as compared to sham-depleted mice (94.9 ± 4.6mm3; p = 0.025) by 14 days post-TBI. All TBI mice exhibited FA values lower than those from a representative naïve control group with intact white matter tracts and FA~200 mm3). The MRI derived assessment of injury progression suggests that monocyte depletion at the time of injury may be a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of TBI. Furthermore, non-invasive longitudinal imaging allows for the evaluation of both TBI progression as well as therapeutic response over the course of injury."
https://openalex.org/W2899462585,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling has emerged as a powerful tool to detect and quantify species abundance in aquatic environments. However, relatively few studies have compared the performance of eDNA-based abundance estimates to traditional catch or survey approaches in the field. Here, we have developed and field-tested a qPCR assay to detect eDNA from alewife and blueback herring (collectively known as ‘river herring’), comparing eDNA-based presence and abundance data to traditional methods of quantification (ichthyoplankton sampling and adult observations). Overall, the qPCR assay showed very high target specificity in lab trials, and was successful in detecting river herring for 11/12 Chesapeake Bay tributaries in spring 2015 and 2016, with 106 out of 445 samples exhibiting positive eDNA hits. We found a strong correlation between eDNA abundance and ichthyoplankton count data (Spearman’s Rho = 0.52), and Phi-tests (correlation of presence/absence data) showed higher correlation between eDNA and ichthyoplankton data (Phi = 0.45) than adult data (Phi = 0.35). Detection probability was significantly lower on western vs. eastern shore tributaries of Chesapeake Bay, and blueback herring and alewife were more likely detected on the western and eastern shores, respectively. Temporal patterns of eDNA abundance over the spring spawning season revealed that alewife were present in high abundances weeks ahead of blueback herring, which aligns with known differences in spawning behavior of the species. In summary, the eDNA abundance data corresponded well to other field methods and has great potential to assist future monitoring efforts of river herring abundance and habitat use."
https://openalex.org/W2899403941,"In low and middle-income countries, approximately 85% of children have a surgically treatable condition before the age of 15. Within these countries, the burden of pediatric surgical conditions falls heaviest on those in rural areas. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the relationship between rurality, surgical condition and treatment status among a cohort of Ugandan children.We identified 2176 children from 2315 households throughout Uganda using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) survey. Children were randomly selected and were included in the study if they were 18 years of age or younger and had a surgical condition. Location of residence, surgical condition, and treatment status was compared among children.Of the 305 children identified with surgical conditions, 81.9% lived in rural areas. The most prevalent causes of surgical conditions reported among rural and urban children were masses (24.0% and 25.5%, respectively), followed by wounds due to injury (19.6% and 16.4%, respectively). Among children with untreated surgical conditions, 79.1% reside in rural areas while 20.9% reside in urban areas. Among children with untreated surgical conditions, the leading reason for not seeking surgical care among children living in both rural and urban areas was a lack of money (40.6% and 31.4%, respectively), and the leading reason for not receiving care in both rural and urban settings was a lack of money (48.0% and 42.8%, respectively).Our data suggest that over half of the children with a surgical condition surveyed are not receiving surgical care and a large majority of children with surgical needs were living in rural areas. Future interventions aimed at increasing surgical access in rural areas in low-income countries are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2899495642,"To evaluate body water volumes and cardiac output in each trimester of pregnancies complicated with hypertension and/or poor fetal growth, relative to uncomplicated pregnancy.In this semi-longitudinal cohort study, a standardised non-invasive maternal hemodynamics assessment in first, second or third trimester was performed in 1068 women with uncomplicated pregnancy (UP), 75 with early onset (EPE) and 117 with late onset preeclampsia (LPE), 139 with gestational hypertension (GH), 129 with small for gestational age (SGA) neonates and 43 with essential hypertension (EH). Women with hypertension or SGA were included prior to onset of symptoms or at diagnosis of disease; 46% of women (758/1631) were assessed in ≥ 2 trimesters. Impedance cardiography and spectrum analysis were used to measure cardiac output, total body water (TBW), extracellular (ECW) and intracellular water (ICW). A linear mixed model was used for inter-trimestrial comparison of parity-, age- and BMI-corrected values within and between groups.For all pregnancies, TBW is higher in each consecutive trimester, mainly due to increasing fraction of ECW (ECW%). Compared to first trimester UP, ECW and ECW% are higher in EPE whereas TBW, ECW and ICW are lower in SGA. Compared to inter-trimestrial differences in UP, abnormal changes for body water volumes are observed in GH, EPE and LPE and for CO in EPE and LPE. Changes in EH are not different from UP.This study is the first to show that concomitant gestational changes of ECW and CO are different from UP already in preclinical stages of pregnancies complicated with hypertension and/or poor fetal growth, except EH. This finding highlights the relevance of early gestational assessment of maternal body fluid status in pregnancies at risk for hypertension or poor fetal growth."
https://openalex.org/W2898679753,"A large body of literature links risk of cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) or pre-diabetes. Accumulating evidence implicates a close relationship between the brain insulin receptor signaling pathway (IRSP) and the accumulation of amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated and conformationally abnormal tau. We showed previously that the neuropathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD were reduced in patients with diabetes who were treated with insulin and oral antidiabetic medications. To understand better the neurobiological substrates of T2D and T2D medications in AD, we examined IRSP and endothelial cell markers in the parahippocampal gyrus of controls (N = 30), of persons with AD (N = 19), and of persons with AD and T2D, who, in turn, had been treated with anti-diabetic drugs (insulin and or oral agents; N = 34). We studied the gene expression of selected members of the IRSP and selective endothelial cell markers in bulk postmortem tissue from the parahippocampal gyrus and in endothelial cell enriched isolates from the same brain region. The results indicated that there are considerable abnormalities and reductions in gene expression (bulk tissue homogenates and endothelial cell isolates) in the parahippocampal gyri of persons with AD that map directly to genes associated with the microvasculature and the IRSP. Our results also showed that the numbers of abnormally expressed microvasculature and IRSP associated genes in diabetic AD donors who had been treated with anti-diabetic agents were reduced significantly. These findings suggest that anti-diabetic treatments may reduce or normalize compromised microvascular and IRSP functions in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2899092184,"While numerous studies have shown that floodplain habitat complexity can be important to fish ecology, few quantify how watershed-scale complexity influences productivity. This scale mismatch complicates population conservation and recovery strategies that evaluate recovery at regional or multi-basin scales. We used outputs from a habitat status and trends monitoring program for ten of Puget Sound's large river systems to examine whether juvenile Chinook salmon productivity relates to watershed-scale habitat complexity. We derived habitat complexity metrics that quantified wood jam densities, side and braid to main channel ratios, and node densities from a remote sensing census of Puget Sound's large river systems. Principal component analysis revealed that 91% of variance in these metrics could be explained by two principal components. These metrics revealed gradients in habitat complexity across Puget Sound which were sensitive to changes in complexity as a result of restoration actions in one watershed. Mixed effects models revealed that the second principle component term (PC2) describing habitat complexity was positively related to log transformed subyearling Chinook per spawner productivity rates from 6-18 cohorts per watershed. Total subyearling productivity (subyearlings per spawner) and fry productivity (subyearling fry per spawner) rates were best described by models that included a positive effect of habitat complexity (PC2) and negative relationships with log transformed peak flow recurrence interval, suggestive of reduced survival due to egg destruction during floods. Total subyearling productivity (subyearlings per spawner) and parr productivity (subyearling parr per spawner) rates were best described by models that included a positive effect of habitat complexity (PC2) and negative relationships with log transformed spawner density, suggestive of density dependent limits on juvenile rearing habitat. We also found that coefficient of variation for log transformed subyearling productivity and subyearling fry productivity rates declined with increasing habitat complexity, supporting the idea that habitat complexity buffers populations from annual variation in environmental conditions. Therefore, we conclude that our watershed-scale census-based approach provided habitat complexity metrics that explained some of the variability in productivity of subyearling juveniles among Chinook salmon populations. Furthermore, this approach may provide a useful means to track and evaluate aggregate effects of habitat changes on the productivity of Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed Chinook salmon populations over time."

This study investigated the effects of treprostinil on PDGF-BB induced remodelling parameters in isolated human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC) of four PAH patients. The production of TGF-β1, CTGF, collagen type-I and -IV, and of fibronectin were determined by ELISA and PCR. The role of cAMP was determined by ELISA and di-deoxyadenosine treatment. Proliferation was determined by direct cell count. Treprostinil increased cAMP levels dose and time dependently, which was not affected by PDGF-BB. Treprostinil significantly reduced PDGF-BB induced secretion of TGF-β1 and CTGF, both was counteracted when cAMP generation was blocked. Similarly, the PDGF-BB induced proliferation of PASMC was dose dependently reduced by treprostinil through signalling via cAMP-C/EBP-α p42 -p21(WAf1/Cip1). In regards to extracellular matrix remodelling, treprostinil significantly reduced PDGF-BB-TGF-β1-CTGF induced synthesis and deposition of collagen type I and fibronectin, in a cAMP sensitive manner. In contrast, the deposition of collagen IV was not affected. The data suggest that this action of treprostinil in vessel wall remodelling may benefit patients with PAH and may reduce arterial wall remodelling."
https://openalex.org/W2899256217,"National clinical audits play key roles in improving care and driving system-wide change. However, effects of audit and feedback depend upon both reach (e.g. relevant staff receiving the feedback) and response (e.g. staff regulating their behaviour accordingly). This study aimed to investigate which hospital staff initially receive feedback and formulate a response, how feedback is disseminated within hospitals, and how responses are enacted (including barriers and enablers to enactment). Using a multiple case study approach, we purposively sampled four UK hospitals for variation in infrastructure and resources. We conducted semi-structured interviews with staff from transfusion-related roles and observed Hospital Transfusion Committee meetings. Interviews and analysis were based on the Theoretical Domains Framework of behaviour change. We coded interview transcripts into theoretical domains, then inductively identified themes within each domain to identify barriers and enablers. We also analysed data to identify which staff currently receive feedback and how dissemination is managed within the hospital. Members of the hospital’s transfusion team initially received feedback in all cases, and were primarily responsible for disseminating and responding, facilitated through the Hospital Transfusion Committee. At each hospital, key individuals involved in prescribing transfusions reported never having received feedback from a national audit. Whether audits were discussed and actions explicitly agreed in Committee meetings varied between hospitals. Key enablers of action across all cases included clear lines of responsibility and strategies to remind staff about recommendations. Barriers included difficulties disseminating to relevant staff and needing to amend feedback to make it appropriate for local use. Appropriate responses by hospital staff to feedback about blood transfusion practice depend upon supportive infrastructures and role clarity. Hospitals could benefit from support to disseminate feedback systematically, particularly to frontline staff involved in the behaviours being audited, and practical tools to support strategic decision-making (e.g. action-planning around local response to feedback)."
https://openalex.org/W2898633253,"Interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3), an RNA-binding protein, is best known for its role in innate immunity by participation in cellular antiviral responses. A role for ILF3 in angiogenesis is unreported. ILF3 expression in CD31+ capillaries of hypoxic cardiac tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. Proangiogenic stimuli induce ILF3 mRNA and protein expression in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells (hCAECs). Angiogenic indices, including proliferation, migration, and tube formation, are all significantly reduced in hCAECs when ILF3 is knocked down using small interfering RNA (siRNA), but are significantly increased when ILF3 is overexpressed using adenovirus. Protein and mRNA abundance of several angiogenic factors including CXCL1, VEGF, and IL-8 are decreased when ILF3 is knocked down by siRNA. These factors are increased when ILF3 is overexpressed by adenovirus. ILF3 is phosphorylated and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to angiogenic stimuli. Proangiogenic transcripts containing adenine and uridine-rich elements were bound to ILF3 through RNA immunoprecipitation. ILF3 stabilizes proangiogenic transcripts including VEGF, CXCL1, and IL-8 in hCAECs. Together these data suggest that in endothelial cells, the RNA stability protein, ILF3, plays a novel and central role in angiogenesis. Our working hypothesis is that ILF3 promotes angiogenesis through cytokine-inducible mRNA stabilization of proangiogenic transcripts.—Vrakas, C. N., Herman, A. B., Ray, M., Kelemen, S.

https://openalex.org/W2898889719,"Aging is often associated with a decreased autophagic activity that contributes to the high sensitivity of aged livers to ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). Blood from young animals can positively affect aged animals. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of young plasma in a model of liver IRI in aged rats. Aged rats were treated with pooled plasma collected from young rats before ischemia. Administration of young plasma restored aging-induced suppression in hepatic autophagic activity and reduced liver IRI. Inhibition of the young-plasma–restored autophagic activity abrogated the beneficial effect of young plasma against liver IRI. Similarly, young serum restored autophagic activity and reduced cellular injury after hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in primary old rat hepatocytes. Mechanistic studies showed thatadministration of young plasma increased AMPK phosphorylation and led to unc-51–like autophagy activating kinase (ULK)1 activation. Furthermore, AMPK-inhibition abrogated the young serum-induced ULK1 activation and autophagic activity and diminished the protective action of young serum against H/R injury in primary old rat hepatocytes, whereas AMPK-activation potentiated the effects of young serum. Young plasma could restore age-impaired autophagy, at least in part, via AMPK/ULK1 signaling. Restoration of age-impaired autophagic activity may be a critical contributing mechanism to young-plasma–afforded protection against liver IRI in aged rats.—Liu, A., Yang, J., Hu, Q., Dirsch, O., Dahmen, U., Zhang, C., Gewirtz, D.

https://openalex.org/W2952166297,"Aims In this study, we determined whether different subtypes of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon19 mutation are associated with the therapeutic effect of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on advanced non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma. Methods A total of 122 patients with stage III or IV non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical characteristics of these patients, including progression-free survival (PFS) outcome for EGFR-TKI treatment, were analyzed. Results According to the mutation pattern, we classified the in-frame deletions detected on EGFR Exon19 into three different types: codon deletion (CD), with a deletion of one or more original codons; codon substitution and skipping (CSS), with a deletion of one or two nucleotides but the residues could be translated into a new amino acid without changing following amino acid sequence; CD or CSS plus single nucleotide variant (SNV) (CD/CSS+SNV), exclude CD or CSS, there’s another SNV nearby the deletion region. The clinical characteristics of three groups were analyzed and as a result, no significant difference was found. By comparing the average number of missing bases and amino acids of the three mutation subtypes, it could be discovered that the number of missing bases and amino acids of the three mutation subtypes is diverse, and group CSS> group CD> group CD/CSS+SNV. Finally, survival analysis was performed between three groups of patients. The median PFS of group CD, group CSS and group CD/CSS+SNV was 11 months, 9 months and 14 months respectively. There was a distinct difference in the PFS between group CSS and group CD/CSS+SNV (P = 0.035<0.05), and the PFS of group CD/CSS+SNV was longer. Conclusions Different mutation subtypes of EGFR exon19 can predict the therapeutic effect of EGFR-TKIs on advanced non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2953135002,"Cellular function depends on heterogeneous dynamic intra-, inter-, and supramolecular structure-function relationships. However, the specific mechanisms by which cellular function is transduced from molecular systems, and by which cellular dysfunction arises from molecular dysfunction are poorly understood. We proposed previously that cellular function manifests as a molecular form of analog computing, in which specific time-dependent state transition fluxes within sets of molecular species (""molecular differential equations"" (MDEs)) are sped and slowed in response to specific perturbations (inputs). In this work, we offer a theoretical treatment of the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular analog computing (which we refer to as ""biodynamics""), focusing primarily on non-equilibrium (dynamic) intermolecular state transitions that serve as the principal means by which MDE systems are solved (the molecular equivalent of mathematical ""integration""). Under these conditions, bound state occupancy is governed by kon and koff, together with the rates of binding partner buildup and decay. Achieving constant fractional occupancy over time depends on: 1) equivalence between kon and the rate of binding site buildup); 2) equivalence between koff and the rate of binding site decay; and 3) free ligand concentration relative to koff/kon (n · Kd, where n is the fold increase in binding partner concentration needed to achieve a given fractional occupancy). Failure to satisfy these conditions results in fractional occupancy well below that corresponding to n · Kd. The implications of biodynamics for cellular function/dysfunction and drug discovery are discussed."

Recently, some pre- and clinical studies have reported that RAS components play a relevant role in the development and behavior of gliomas. The angiotensinogen (AGT) rs5050 genetic variant has been identified as a crucial regulator of the transcription of AGT mRNA, which makes it a logical and promising target of research. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the AGT rs5050 genetic variant in blood with prognosis in astrocytoma.A prospective pilot study was performed on forty-eight astrocytoma patients, who received the standard-of-care treatment. Blood samples were taken prior to surgery and DNA was sequenced using Ion Torrent next-generation sequencing and analyzed by Ion Reporter software. Descriptive, bivariate, multivariate, and survival analyses were performed using SPSS v21, STATA 12 and GraphPad Prism 7.Median follow-up was 41 months (range 1-48). Survival analysis showed a significant difference between the rs5050 genotypes (p = .05). We found lower survival rates in individuals with the GG-genotype of rs5050 AGT compared to patients with the TT- and TG-genotype (2 months vs. 11.5 months, respectively [p = .01]). In bivariate and multivariate analyses, GG-genotype was negatively associated with survival.In patients with astrocytoma, AGT rs5050 GG-genotype was associated with poor prognosis. We propose this germline genetic variant as a complementary biomarker, which can be detected practically and safely in blood samples or saliva."

The objective is to discover a group of users that are able to maximize the spread of influence across a network. The greedy algorithm gives a solution to the Influence Maximization problem while having a good approximation ratio. Nevertheless it does not scale well for large scale datasets. In this paper, we propose Matrix Influence, MATI, an efficient algorithm that can be used under both the Linear Threshold and Independent Cascade diffusion models. MATI is based on the precalculation of the influence by taking advantage of the simple paths in the node's neighborhood. An extensive empirical analysis has been performed on multiple real-world datasets showing that MATI has competitive performance when compared to other well-known algorithms with regards to running time and expected influence spread."
https://openalex.org/W2899369736,"Objective Neonatal morbidity and mortality can be influenced by maternal health status. Information on maternal and fetal biomarkers of adverse health outcomes is limited. This work aims at identifying maternal biomarkers associated with low and high birth weight for gestational age groups. Design and settings Population-based prospective cohort study of the potential adverse health effects of exposure to environmental contaminants on pregnancy and infant health. Methods Third trimester maternal plasma samples (n = 1588) from a pregnancy cohort (Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals Study, MIREC) were analyzed for changes in a target spectrum of biomarkers of vascular health (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases MMPs, vascular endothelial cell growth factor VEGF), inflammation (e.g. cellular adhesion molecules CAMs, cytokines, chemokines) by affinity-based multiplex protein array analyses. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to examine associations between target plasma biomarkers, maternal-infant characteristics, and birth weight outcomes assessed as small for gestational age (SGA) ≤10th percentile and large for gestational age (LGA) ≥90th percentile groups. Results and outcomes Our results revealed that maternal plasma biomarkers monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 MCP-1 (p<0.05, +ve) and VEGF (p<0.05, -ve) along with parity = 1 (p<0.01, -ve) and gestational hypertension (p<0.05, +ve) were associated with SGA births. Meanwhile, LGA was associated with maternal plasma VEGF (p<0.05, +ve) and MMP-9 (p<0.05, -ve) and gestational hypertension (p<0.01, +ve), pre-pregnancy body mass index (p<0.01, +ve), parity (p<0.05, +ve) and education (p<0.05, -ve). Conclusions Third trimester maternal plasma biomarkers in combination with maternal health and socioeconomic characteristics can be useful in predicting SGA and LGA outcomes. Maternal vascular health and inflammatory status may contribute to both SGA and LGA births through distinct molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2899489538,"Understanding the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in a population is of great importance to the planning and delivery of health services globally. The worldwide rise of HIV since the 1980's, and the recent increase in common STIs (including HPV and Chlamydia) in many countries, means that there is an urgent need to understand transmission dynamics in order to better predict the spread of such infections in the population. Unlike many other infections which can be captured by assumptions of random mixing, STI transmission is intimately linked to the number and pattern of sexual contacts. In fact, it is the huge variation in the number of new sexual partners that gives rise to the extremes of risk within populations which need to be captured in predictive models of STI transmission. Such models are vital in providing the necessary scientific evidence to determine whether a range of controls (from education to screening to vaccination) are cost-effective.We use probability sample survey data from Britain's third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3) to determine robust distributions for the rate of new partnerships that involve condomless sex and can therefore facilitate the spread of STIs. Different distributions are defined depending on four individual-level characteristics: age, sex, sexual orientation, and previous sexual experience. As individual behaviour patterns can change (e.g. by remaining in a monogamous relationship for a long period) we allow risk-percentiles to be randomly redrawn, to capture longer term behaviour as measured by Natsal-3. We demonstrate how this model formulation interacts with the transmission of infection by constructing an individual-based SIS-P (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible-Protected) transmission model for the spread of a generic STI, and observing overall population demographics when varying the transmission probability within a partnership, recovery rate and the level of population protection (e.g. from vaccination where applicable)."
https://openalex.org/W2898938190,"Previously we reported that the sensitivity of CD4+ T cells to ATP does not depend on P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) expression levels but on their activation and differentiation stages. Therefore, here we have investigated a potential relationship between the sensitivity of CD8+ T cells to ATP and their stages of differentiation. Thus, the CD8+ subpopulation exhibits a drastically reduced sensitivity to ATP with aging, which parallels the strong increase of an effector/memory CD8+ subset expressing high levels of CD44 cell adhesion molecule and CD45RB transmembrane phosphatase (CD44hiCD45RBhi). Using L-selectin/CD62L, CC-chemokine receptor 7, and CD127/IL-7 receptor-α markers, we showed that effector/memory CD8+ T cells belong to a central or effector memory subset. In contrast, the CD44hiCD45RBhi effector/memory subset is absent or poorly expressed in the CD4+ T subpopulation regardless of age. While ATP treatment can trigger channel and pore formation, CD62L shedding, phosphatidylserine exposure, and cell death in the CD44loCD45RBhi-naive CD8+ subset, it is unable to induce these cellular activities in the CD44hiCD45RBhi effector/memory CD8+ subset. Importantly, both CD44loCD45RBhi-naive and CD44hiCD45RBhi effector/memory subsets express similar low levels of P2X7R, demonstrating that the sensitivity of CD8+ T cells to ATP depends on the stage of differentiation instead of P2X7R expression levels.—Mellouk, A., Bobé, P.

https://openalex.org/W2898642240,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory joint disease that eventually leads to permanent bone and cartilage destruction. Fas has already been established as the regulator of inflammation in RA, but its role in bone formation under arthritic conditions is not completely defined. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Fas inactivation on the bone damage during murine antigen-induced arthritis. Subchondral bone of wild-type (WT) and Fas-knockout (Fas-/-) mice was evaluated by histomorphometry and microcomputerized tomography. Proportions of synovial bone and cartilage progenitors were assessed by flow cytometry. Synovial bone and cartilage progenitors were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and expression of Fas and Fas-induced apoptosis were analyzed in vitro. Results showed that Fas-/- mice developed attenuated arthritis characterized by preserved epiphyseal bone and cartilage. A proportion of the earliest CD200+ bone and cartilage progenitors was reduced in WT mice with arthritis and was unaltered in Fas-/- mice. During osteoblastic differentiation in vitro, CD200+ cells express the highest levels of Fas and are removed by Fas ligation. These results suggest that Fas-induced apoptosis of early CD200+ osteoprogenitor population represents potential mechanism underlying the impaired bone formation in arthritis, so their preservation may represent the bone-protective mechanism during arthritis.-Lazić Mosler, E., Lukač, N., Flegar, D., Fadljević, M., Radanović, I., Cvija, H., Kelava, T., Ivčević, S., Šućur, A., Markotić, A., Katavić, V., Marušić, A., Grčević, D., Kovačić, N.

https://openalex.org/W2898773325,"Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy with a median survival of 5-10 years. While current treatments initially cause remission, relapse almost always occurs, leading to the hypothesis that a chemotherapy-resistant cancer stem cell (CSC) remains dormant, and undergoes self-renewal and differentiation to reestablish disease. Our finding is that the mature cancer cell (CD138+, rapidly proliferating and chemosensitive) has developmental plasticity; namely, the ability to dedifferentiate back into its own chemoresistant CSC progenitor, the CD138-, quiescent pre-plasma cell. We observe multiple cycles of differentiation and dedifferentiation in the absence of niche or supportive accessory cells, suggesting that soluble cytokines secreted by the MM cells themselves are responsible for this bidirectional interconversion and that stemness and chemoresistance are dynamic characteristics that can be acquired or lost and thus may be targetable. By examining cytokine secretion of CD138- and CD138+ RPMI-8226 cells, we identified that concomitant with interconversion, Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF-1) is secreted. The addition of a small molecule MIF-1 inhibitor (4-IPP) or MIF-1 neutralizing antibodies to CD138+ cells accelerated dedifferentiation back into the CD138- progenitor, while addition of recombinant MIF-1 drove cells towards CD138+ differentiation. A similar increase in the CD138- population is seen when MM tumor cells isolated from primary bone marrow aspirates are cultured in the presence of 4-IPP. As the CD138+ MM cell is chemosensitive, targeting MIF-1 and/or the pathways that it regulates could be a viable way to modulate stemness and chemosensitivity, which could in turn transform the treatment of MM."
https://openalex.org/W2899028262,"Understanding fire impacts on peatland vegetation can inform management to support function and prevent degradation of these important ecosystems. However, time since burn, interval between burns and number of past burns all have the potential to modify impacts. Grazing regime may also affect vegetation directly or via an interaction with burning. We used new, comprehensive survey data from a hillslope-scale field experiment initiated in 1954 to investigate the effects of burning and grazing treatments on Sphagnum. Historical data were consulted to aid interpretation of the results. The unburned reference and the most frequently burned (10-year rotation) treatments had greater Sphagnum abundance and hummock height than intermediate treatments (20-year rotation and no-burn since 1954). Abundance of the most common individual species (S. capillifolium, S. subnitens and S. papillosum) followed similar patterns. Light grazing had no impact on Sphagnum-related variables, nor did it interact with the burning treatments.These results suggest that in some cases fire has a negative impact on Sphagnum, and this can persist for several decades. However, fire return interval and other factors such as atmospheric pollution may alter effects, and in some cases Sphagnum abundance may recover. Fire severity and site specific conditions may also influence effects, so we advise consideration of these factors, and caution when using fire as a management tool on peatlands where Sphagnum is considered desirable."
https://openalex.org/W2899397677,"Objectives To investigate acoustic noise reduction, image quality and white matter lesion detection rates of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans acquired with and without sequence-based acoustic noise reduction software. Material and methods Thirty-one patients, including 18 men and 13 women, with a mean age of 58.3±14.5 years underwent cranial MRI. A fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence was acquired with and without acoustic noise reduction using the Quiet Suite (QS) software (Siemens Healthcare). During data acquisition, peak sound pressure levels were measured with a sound level meter (Testo, Typ 815). In addition, two observers assessed subjective image quality for both sequences using a five-point scale (1 very good—5 inadequate). Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was measured for both sequences in the following regions: white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, lesion detection rates in white matter pathologies were evaluated by two observers for both sequences. Acoustic noise, image quality including SNR and white matter lesion detection rates were compared using the Mann-Whitney-U-test. Results Peak sound pressure levels were slightly but significantly reduced using QS, P≤0.017. Effective sound pressure, measured in Pascal, was decreased by 19.7%. There was no significant difference in subjective image quality between FLAIR sequences acquired without/with QS: observer 1: 2.03/2.07, P = 0.730; observer 2: 1.98/2.10, P = 0.362. In addition, SNR was significantly increased in white matter, P≤0.001, and gray matter, P = 0.006, using QS. The lesion detection rates did not decline utilizing QS: observer 1: P = 0.944 observer 2: P = 0.952. Conclusions Sequence-based noise reduction software such as QS can significantly reduce peak sound pressure levels, without a loss of subjective image quality and increase SNR at constant lesion detection rates."
https://openalex.org/W2898715782,"Background There is uncertainty about the variation in infection prevention practices for central venous catheters (CVC) in neonatal units (NNUs) and how practices relate to national guidance. Aim To evaluate evidence supporting infection prevention practices for CVCs recommended in national guidelines and to compare with reported practices for peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC), a type of CVC widely used in NNUs. Design We searched national guidelines for neonates and children to identify infection prevention practices for CVCs and conducted an overview of studies to determine the quality of evidence underpinning recommendations. We surveyed 134 NNUs in England and Wales to ascertain reported practice. Results We found low quality evidence supporting CVC care bundles and use of 2% alcoholic chlorhexidine to decontaminate catheter ports and skin before insertion. Moderate quality evidence supported recommendations against routinely replacing CVCs and against chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings. 90% (44/49) of NICUs and 40% (34/85) of LNUs responded. 66% (48/73) of NNUs reported using CVC care bundles for insertion; 62% (45/73) used bundles for maintenance. 63% (32/51) of those using bundles reported monitoring adherence. 85% (61/72) of NNUs did not routinely replace PICCs and 89% (63/71) did not use chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings. Antiseptic use varied with alcoholic 2% chlorhexidine used for skin preparation in 33% (23/71) of NNUs and for catheter ports in 52% (37/71). Conclusions Lack of consistency across NNUs in antiseptic use and low rates of reported CVC care bundle use may reflect the low quality of evidence of the effectiveness and safety of these interventions in NNUs. Clinical trials are needed to quantify benefits and harms of infection prevention practices in NNUs."

H. parasuis isolates can exhibit different virulence capabilities ranging from lethal systemic disease to subclinical carriage. To identify genomic differences between phenotypically distinct strains, we obtained the closed whole-genome sequence annotation and genome-wide methylation patterns for the highly virulent Nagasaki strain and for the non-virulent D74 strain. Evaluation of the virulence-associated genes contained within the genomes of D74 and Nagasaki led to the discovery of a large number of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems within both genomes. Five predicted hemolysins were identified as unique to Nagasaki and seven putative contact-dependent growth inhibition toxin proteins were identified only in strain D74. Assessment of all potential vtaA genes revealed thirteen present in the Nagasaki genome and three in the D74 genome. Subsequent evaluation of the predicted protein structure revealed that none of the D74 VtaA proteins contain a collagen triple helix repeat domain. Additionally, the predicted protein sequence for two D74 VtaA proteins is substantially longer than any predicted Nagasaki VtaA proteins. Fifteen methylation sequence motifs were identified in D74 and fourteen methylation sequence motifs were identified in Nagasaki using SMRT sequencing analysis. Only one of the methylation sequence motifs was observed in both strains indicative of the diversity between D74 and Nagasaki. Subsequent analysis also revealed diversity in the restriction-modification systems harbored by D74 and Nagasaki. The collective information reported in this study will aid in the development of vaccines and intervention strategies to decrease the prevalence and disease burden caused by H. parasuis."
https://openalex.org/W2898795516,"The arterial wall adapts to alterations in blood flow and pressure by remodeling the cellular and extracellular architecture. Biomechanical stress of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the media is thought to precede this process and promote their activation and subsequent proliferation. However, molecular determinants orchestrating the transcriptional phenotype under these conditions have been insufficiently studied. We identified the transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5; or tonicity enhancer-binding protein) as a crucial regulatory element of mechanical stress responses of VSMCs. Here, the relevance of NFAT5 for arterial growth and thickening is investigated in mice upon inducible smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific genetic ablation of Nfat5. In cultured mouse VSMCs, loss of Nfat5 inhibits the expression of gene sets involved in the control of the cell cycle and the interaction with the extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal dynamics. In vivo, SMC-specific knockout of Nfat5 did not affect the general vascular architecture and blood pressure levels under baseline conditions. However, proliferation of VSMCs and the thickening of the arterial wall were inhibited during both flow-induced collateral remodeling and hypertension-mediated arterial hypertrophy. Whereas originally described as a hypertonicity-responsive transcription factor, these findings identify NFAT5 as a novel molecular determinant of biomechanically induced phenotype changes of VSMCs and wall stress-induced arterial remodeling processes.—Arnold, C., Feldner, A., Zappe, M., Komljenovic, D., De La Torre, C., Ruzicka, P., Hecker, M., Neuhofer, W., Korff, T.

We used TEMPS-A to evaluate affective temperament and HADS scales to assess the intensity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Harvey Bradshaw scale, Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Mayo Score were used to evaluate clinical severity of the diseases. We observed significantly higher prevalence of depressive, cyclothymic and anxiety temperaments in CD patients compared to the control group. Harvey Bradshaw scale, CDAI and Mayo Self Report showed statistically significant outcomes, including significant positive correlations with depressive, cyclothymic and anxiety subscales of TEMPS-A, and negative correlation with the hyperthymic temperament in CD subjects. Our findings indicate significant differences between CD and UC due to temperament traits, and suggest distinct pathogenesis of mood disorders in IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2898204607,"Atmospheric methane is rapidly lost when it enters humid subterranean critical and vadose zones (e.g., air in soils and caves). Because methane is a source of carbon and energy, it can be consumed by methanotrophic methane-oxidizing bacteria. As an additional subterranean sink, it has been hypothesized that methane is oxidized by natural radioactivity-induced radiolysis that produces energetic ions and radicals, which then trigger abiotic oxidation and consumption of methane within a few hours. Using controlled laboratory experiments, we tested whether radiolysis could rapidly oxidize methane in sealed air with different relative humidities while being exposed to elevated levels of radiation (more than 535 kBq m-3) from radon isotopes 222Rn and 220Rn (i.e., thoron). We found no evidence that radiolysis contributed to methane oxidation. In contrast, we observed the rapid loss of methane when moist soil was added to the same apparatus in the absence of elevated radon abundance. Together, our findings are consistent with the view that methane oxidizing bacteria are responsible for the widespread observations of methane depletion in subterranean environments. Further studies are needed on the ability of microbes to consume trace amounts of methane in poorly ventilated caves, even though the trophic and energetic benefits become marginal at very low partial pressures of methane."

We investigated the change of the bacterial community and diversity of activated sludge fed with polyacrylate/ZnO nanocomposites in both low (500 mg COD /L) and high (1000 mg COD/L) doses. COD removal, dehydrogenase activity, and total protein of activated sludge system were monitored in all treatments over 30 days. The results demonstrated that the exposure to both polyacrylate/ ZnO nanocomposite and polyacrylate decreased the dehydrogenase activity at early stage comparing to the control, but had no significant influence on COD removal. Overall, the bacterial communities in activated sludge were resistant to polyacrylate/ZnO nanocomposites, and had higher levels of metabolic activity, protein accumulation and bioavailability when exposed to these chemicals comparing to the control especially at later stages of incubation (15–30 days), which indicated that these polyacrylate/ZnO nanocomposites of certain amount were biocompatible to activated sludge system."
https://openalex.org/W2899255546,"The accuracy and diversity of recommendation algorithms have always been the research hotspot of recommender systems. A good recommender system should not only have high accuracy and diversity, but also have adequate robustness against spammer attacks. However, the issue of recommendation robustness has received relatively little attention in the literature. In this paper, we systematically study the influences of different spammer behaviors on the recommendation results in various recommendation algorithms. We further propose an improved algorithm by incorporating the inner-similarity of user's purchased items in the classic KNN approach. The new algorithm effectively enhances the robustness against spammer attacks and thus outperforms traditional algorithms in recommendation accuracy and diversity when spammers exist in the online commercial systems."
https://openalex.org/W2898727775,"This paper presents a discretization methodology applied to the NBV (Next Best View) problem, which consists of determining the heuristical best position of the next scan. This new methodology is a hybrid process between a homogenous voxelization and an octree structure that preserves the advantages of both methods. An octree structure is not directly applicable to the NBV problem: as the point cloud grows with every successive scanning, the limits and position of the discretization, octree structure must coincide, in order to transfer the information from one scan to the next. This problem is solved by applying a first coarse voxelization, followed by the division of each voxel in an octree structure. In addition, a previous methodology for solving the NBV problem has been adapted to make use of this novel approach. Results show that the new method is three times faster than the homogenous voxelization for a maximum resolution of 0.2m. For this target resolution of 0.2m, the number of voxels/octants in the discretization is reduced approximately by a 400%, from 35.360 to 8.937 for the study case presented."
https://openalex.org/W2899321395,"Chia (Salvia hispanica L.) is an annual short-day plant whose growth has not been studied extensively in low-altitudes and at temperatures outside of its optimal range. The objective of this study was to describe the growth dynamics of a chia crop from an experimental plantation in south-east Mexico, on three different sowing dates. The chia grew at temperatures (18-37°C) and an altitude (9 m a.s.l.) outside of the recommended conditions (20-30°C, 500-1000 m a.s.l.). Three individual-plant responses were measured weekly, before seed harvest: height, number of leaves and number of inflorescences. Three theoretical nonlinear growth models were fitted to the data, a different model for each response. Mixed-effect model parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood, and the goodness of fit for each model was evaluated using two criteria: Modeling Efficiency and Root Mean Square Error. Chia seed yield was also measured in each treatment. Estimated parameters for plant height confirmed that medium sowing time (MST) and late sowing time (LST) plants had smaller heights than the early sowing time (EST) plants. Moreover, at the end of their life cycle, EST plants had a greater number of leaves and inflorescences, and higher seed yield. All of these differences were associated to the extended time of vegetative growth of EST plants favored by optimal photoperiod and temperature. Growth dynamics of chia during its ontogenic phases was explored, in more detail, with relative growth parameters derived from fitted models: a decrease in photoperiod influences the beginning of the reproductive phase, with the consequent reduction in speed of vegetative growth. In addition, nonlinear mixed-effects models can be useful in understanding the relation between growth parameters, plant maturity, and the suitable time for chia seed harvest. Our results suggest chia crops are adaptable to non-conventional environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2952889630,"Telomere length (TL) has been associated with a range of aging outcomes as well as mortality. Recent research has shown both high heritability (~70%) of TL as well as moderate spousal similarity (r~0.3) using European datasets. This paper explores the level of spousal concordance in telomere length in the Health and Retirement Study, a national sample of adults in the US. The results show that the spousal correlations are lower (r~0.11). Regression-based associations in TL in the US are low (beta~0.08) and also vary by the number of times respondents have been married, where spouses married a single time have higher associations in TL (beta~.12) than spouses married more once (beta~0.03). I also find variation in spousal TL association levels based on husband’s education level. These findings suggest the possibility of both assortative mating patterns related to telomere length as well as likelihood of shared environmental factors that cause TL similarity in people who are socially connected."
https://openalex.org/W2899098756,"All Canadian lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) populations are listed under the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) due to their complex life history, loss of habitat and negative interactions with anthropomorphic activities. Lake sturgeon diets vary considerably across their range and depend on the local benthic invertebrate fauna, substrata, and competition with congener species. Hence, determining population-specific prey assemblages is a vital contribution to effective conservation efforts. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to identify lake sturgeon prey preferences for juvenile (<100 cm) and adult (>100 cm) age classes and their trophic niche in the Saskatchewan River, SK, Canada. In this system, lake sturgeon were the top predator within the benthic food web with no direct competition for preferred prey items from congener species. Their diet was dominated by crayfish (49.1± 6.4%) and snails (36.3 ± 5.5%), with no significant differences between age classes. Furthermore, lake sturgeon favoured deep rocky pools throughout the river; a habitat where crayfish and snails are typically found. Therefore, conservation efforts should be directed at preserving these habitats for the residing benthic invertebrate community, and the lake sturgeon's ability to access them."
