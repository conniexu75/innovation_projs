https://openalex.org/W2094823810,"Francisella tularensis is one of the most infectious human pathogens known. In the past, both the former Soviet Union and the US had programs to develop weapons containing the bacterium. We report the complete genome sequence of a highly virulent isolate of F. tularensis (1,892,819 bp). The sequence uncovers previously uncharacterized genes encoding type IV pili, a surface polysaccharide and iron-acquisition systems. Several virulence-associated genes were located in a putative pathogenicity island, which was duplicated in the genome. More than 10% of the putative coding sequences contained insertion-deletion or substitution mutations and seemed to be deteriorating. The genome is rich in IS elements, including IS630 Tc-1 mariner family transposons, which are not expected in a prokaryote. We used a computational method for predicting metabolic pathways and found an unexpectedly high proportion of disrupted pathways, explaining the fastidious nutritional requirements of the bacterium. The loss of biosynthetic pathways indicates that F. tularensis is an obligate host-dependent bacterium in its natural life cycle. Our results have implications for our understanding of how highly virulent human pathogens evolve and will expedite strategies to combat them."

The core receptors recognizing lipopolysaccharide are CD14, TLR4, and MD-2. CD14 binds to lipopolysaccharide and presents it to the TLR4/MD-2 complex, which initiates intracellular signaling. In addition to lipopolysaccharide, CD14 is capable of recognizing a few other microbial and cellular products. Here, we present the first crystal structure of CD14 to 2.5 Å resolution. A large hydrophobic pocket was found on the NH2-terminal side of the horseshoe-like structure. Previously identified regions involved in lipopolysaccharide binding map to the rim and bottom of the pocket indicating that the pocket is the main component of the lipopolysaccharide-binding site. Mutations that interfere with lipopolysaccharide signaling but not with lipopolysaccharide binding are also clustered in a separate area near the pocket. Ligand diversity of CD14 could be explained by the generous size of the pocket, the considerable flexibility of the rim of the pocket, and the multiplicity of grooves available for ligand binding.

The innate immune response is the first line of defense against microbial infection (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6061) Google Scholar). It uses a group of receptors to distinguish non-self-microbial products from host molecules by recognizing conserved structural patterns in the foreign molecules. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, toll-like receptor; PGN, peptidoglycan; LRR, leucine-rich repeat.1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, toll-like receptor; PGN, peptidoglycan; LRR, leucine-rich repeat. is an outer membrane glycolipid of Gram-negative bacteria and a well known inducer of the innate immune response (2Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 3Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar). It is composed of a hydrophobic lipid A component and the hydrophilic polysaccharides of the core and O-antigen. The lipid A portion represents part of the conserved molecular pattern of LPS and is responsible for most of the LPS-induced biological responses. Engagement of LPS on the host cell initiates strong pro-inflammatory responses that stimulate host defenses but can also lead to a pathological condition, septic syndrome, if the inflammatory responses are amplified and uncontrolled (4Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, there is as yet no effective treatment for septic syndrome, which is one of the most common causes of death in intensive care units.The core receptors recognizing LPS are CD14, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and MD-2 (5Fujihara M. Muroi M. Tanamoto K. Suzuki T. Azuma H. Ikeda H. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 100: 171-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 6Miyake K. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2003; 3: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Binding of LPS to CD14 is enhanced by the serum LBP (LPS-binding protein) (7Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar), which is acutely induced by infection. Since CD14 does not have an intracellular signaling domain, transfer of LPS to another receptor component, the TLR4/MD-2 complex, is required for downstream signaling. TLR4 has a cytoplasmic signaling domain that recruits MyD88, IRAK1/IRAK4, and TRIF to activate the transcription factors AP-1, NF-κB, and IRF3 (5Fujihara M. Muroi M. Tanamoto K. Suzuki T. Azuma H. Ikeda H. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 100: 171-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Mouse strains that have mutations of the TLR4 gene locus are hyporesponsive to LPS (8Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752PubMed Google Scholar, 9Qureshi S.T. Lariviere L. Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp.

Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6383) Google Scholar). MD-2 is associated with the extracellular domain of TLR4 and is required for LPS binding by TLR4.CD14 is expressed on the surface of myelomonocytic cells as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein or in soluble form in the serum (2Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The crucial role of CD14 in LPS signaling has been confirmed with knock-out mice; CD14-deficient mice are highly resistant to septic shock initiated by injection of either LPS or live bacteria (11Haziot A. Ferrero E. Kontgen F. Hijiya N. Yamamoto S. Silver J. Stewart C.L. Goyert S.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The CD14 pathway has been suggested as a therapeutic target because anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies gave significant protection against septic shock in animal models (12Schimke J. Mathison J. Morgiewicz J. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13875-13880Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Leturcq D.J. Moriarty A.M. Talbott G. Winn R.K. Martin T.R. Ulevitch R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1533-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition to the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, CD14 can bind other microbial products such as peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoteichoic acid, lipoarabinomannan, and lipoproteins (14Dziarski R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1793-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Gregory C.D. Devitt A. Apoptosis. 1999; 4: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has broad ligand specificity and functions as a pattern recognition receptor by recognizing structural motifs in various microbial products (16Pugin J. Heumann I.D. Tomasz A. Kravchenko V.V. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. Glauser M.P. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Immunity. 1994; 1: 509-516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of ligand binding and transfer by CD14 has been intensively investigated by mutagenesis and epitope mapping of blocking antibodies. However, the structural basis of LPS binding and transfer between receptors remains to be clarified. As a first step to addressing these questions, we undertook structural studies of CD14.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of Soluble Recombinant CD14 —A cDNA of mouse CD14 (residues 5–313) was amplified by PCR using sense primer, 5′-actacggatcccgagccctgcgagctagacgaggaa-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-atccaggatccgcagagtccaaaaagggattt-3′. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and cloned into a modified pAcGP67A baculovirus vector (Pharmingen) that contains the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 and a thrombin site between the NotI and BglII restriction sites. To obtain the recombinant virus, the cloned plasmid was co-transfected with Baculogold (Pharmingen) into SF9 insect cells as described in the manufacturer's protocol. To produce the protein, Hi-5 insect cells (Invitrogen) cultured in SF900II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) were incubated for 3 days with the recombinant virus, and the secreted CD14-Fc fusion protein was purified by protein-A-Sepharose (Peptron, Daejeon) affinity chromatography. The Fc tag of the fusion protein was removed by thrombin digestion at 4 °C. This cloning strategy generates recombinant CD14 with an additional ADPGYLLEFRSGRLVPR sequence at its COOH terminus and an ADP sequence at its NH2 terminus. The cleaved CD14 protein was further purified by Hitrap Q anion exchange chromatography and Superdex-200 gel filtration chromatography (AP Biotech). CD14-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 30 mg/ml for crystallization.Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of CD14 were grown at 22 °C using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, by mixing 1 μl of the protein solution and 1 μl of crystallization buffer containing 100 mm sodium HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.9 m Li2SO4 and 5mm NiCl2. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions, a = 70.5 Å, b = 117.7 Å and c = 102.4 Å. Diffraction data were collected with the F2 beam line of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (MacCHESS) and the BL41XU beam line of Spring 8, using crystals flash-frozen at -170 °C in the crystallization buffer supplemented with 30% glycerol. The diffraction data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK packages (Table I) (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Initial phases were calculated using the program MLPHARE (18Collaborative Comutational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) with data obtained from crystals soaked in 5 mm thimerosal for 8 h, 5 mm lead acetate for 1 week, or 5 mm potassium osmate (VI) for 18 h. The phases were improved by 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging and solvent flattening, using the program DM (18Collaborative Comutational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). The initial CD14 model was refined with the CNS program (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). Atoms related by 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry were tightly restrained throughout the refinement (weight = 300 kcal/mol-1 Å2) except for the last modeling and refinement cycle. The refined atomic model contains two CD14 molecules corresponding to residues 5–313 and 200 water molecules. Three N-glycosylation sites with the clear electron densities of two to three carbohydrate residues are present (Fig. 1A). All eight cysteines of CD14 are involved in the formation of disulfide bridges (Fig. 1A). After refinement, strong and continuous electron densities were found inside the NH2-terminal pocket. These are probably derived from a mixture of endogenous lipid like molecules co-purified with CD14 (21Sugiyama T. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure Determination and Overall Structure of CD14 — We have determined the crystal structure of mouse CD14 to 2.5 Å resolution. The carboxyl-terminal 32 residues not needed for ligand binding or for signaling were deleted by cloning to improve the ability of the protein to crystallize (Fig. 1A) (22Juan T.S. Kelley M.J. Johnson D.A. Busse L.A. Hailman E. Wright S.D. Lichenstein H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1382-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The monomeric subunit of CD14 contains thirteen β strands, and 11 of them, from β3 to β13, overlap with conserved leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (Fig. 1). The concave surface of the horseshoe-shaped structure consists of a large β-sheet of 11 parallel and two antiparallel beta strands. The convex surface of CD14 contains both helices and loops, in no regular pattern. As a result, it is rough rather than smooth and contains several grooves and pockets that are crucial for ligand binding (discussed in the following paragraphs). CD14 forms a dimer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit as well as in solution (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Dimerization in the crystal is mediated by residues in β13 and in the loop between β12 and β13. Parallel β-sheets from the two monomers interact in an antiparallel fashion and form a large and continuous β-sheet encompassing the entire CD14 dimer. Surprisingly, the total number of LRR motifs in the CD14 dimer is close to that in TLR4, and therefore the overall shape of the two functionally related proteins is likely to be very similar.The NH2-terminal Hydrophobic Pocket—The most striking feature of the structure of CD14 is the NH2-terminal pocket. The pocket is located on the side of the horseshoe near the NH2 terminus, and it is entirely hydrophobic except for the rim (Figs. 1B and 2A). The main pocket contains a smaller sub-pocket at the bottom. This sub-pocket is formed by hydrophobic residues from β4–6, α4, α5, and connecting loops (Figs. 1A and 2B). It is narrow and deep with dimensions 4.5 Å wide, 9.6 Å long, and 8 Å deep. The bottom and walls of the main pocket are lined with residues from β1–3, α1–4, and their connecting loops (Fig. 2C). The main pocket is both wide and deep with dimensions, 8 Å wide, 13 Å long, and 10 Å deep. Overall, the pocket including the sub-pocket has a total volume of 820 Å3 and hence is large enough to accommodate at least part of the lipid chains of LPS. The residues on the hydrophilic rim of the main pocket are highly flexible (Fig. 2D). The average temperature factor of the rim residues is 79.9 Å2, significantly higher than 43.4 Å2 of the complete protein. Furthermore, some of the rim residues, Pro22, Lys23, Val54, and Asp55, have different conformations in the two subunits of the crystal asymmetric unit.Fig. 2Structure of the NH2-terminal pocket. A, surface representation of the NH2-terminal pocket. The molecular surface of the pocket is shown in mesh. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces are colored yellow and green, respectively. Kyte and Doolittle's scale (39Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17007) Google Scholar) was used for the calculation of hydrophobicity. Stereo views of the sub-pocket (B), wall and base (C), and the rim of the main pocket (D) are shown. The viewing orientation is approximately the same for all figures. The side chains of the pocket residues are shown in cyan. The α2 helix is omitted for clarity in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Pocket Area Is Responsible for LPS Binding—The-binding sites for LPS in CD14 have been intensively studied by mutagenesis and by epitope mapping of antibodies that block LPS binding, and four regions have been identified within the NH2-terminal 65 residues of CD14 (23Cunningham M.D. Shapiro R.A. Seachord C. Ratcliffe K. Cassiano L. Darveau R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3255-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Deletion or missense mutations of these regions significantly reduce LPS binding or responsiveness (23Cunningham M.D. Shapiro R.A. Seachord C. Ratcliffe K. Cassiano L. Darveau R.P. J.

We found that all of these regions are clustered around the pocket; region 1 is located close to the wall and region 3 is at the bottom of the pocket, whereas regions 2 and 4 are located on the rim of the pocket (Fig. 3A). Residues from the turn between the β1 and β2 strands constitute region 1. Region 2 is the loop between the β2 strand and the α1 helix. Monoclonal antibodies that recognize this area inhibited LPS binding (23Cunningham M.D. Shapiro R.A. Seachord C. Ratcliffe K. Cassiano L. Darveau R.P. J.

Region 3 is the most frequent target of LPS blocking antibodies. At least nine monoclonal antibodies that recognize the β2 and β3 strands reduce binding of LPS by soluble CD14 (23Cunningham M.D. Shapiro R.A. Seachord C. Ratcliffe K. Cassiano L. Darveau R.P. J.

This area is labile to proteolysis in the absence of bound LPS but becomes resistant when LPS is bound (31McGinley M.D. Narhi L.O. Kelley M.J. Davy E. Robinson J. Rohde M.F. Wright S.D.

Furthermore, the antibodies MEM18, CRIS-6, and 6C8 that block LPS binding bind to the same region (23Cunningham M.D. Shapiro R.A. Seachord C. Ratcliffe K. Cassiano L. Darveau R.P. J.

Collectively, these mutagenesis and epitope mapping data strongly suggest that the NH2-terminal pocket is the principal component of the LPS-binding site in CD14.Fig. 3Regions involved in LPS binding and signaling. A, the molecular surface of CD14 is depicted. The four LPS-binding regions, R1–R4, identified by previous mutagenesis experiments are colored in cyan (Fig. 1A). The view is rotated clockwise along the horizontal axis by 60 degrees from that of Fig. 1B. B, regions that interfere with LPS transfer are shown in green and labeled T1–T3 (Fig. 1A). The positions of the secondary structures are indicated. G1 and G2 indicate grooves that may play roles in LPS and/or PGN binding (see “Results and Discussion”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Model of LPS Bound to CD14 —LPS is a large amphipathic molecule with a molecular weight ranging from a few thousand to more than 10 thousand (3Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar). It has typically five to seven fatty acid groups with 12–14 carbon atoms attached to the phosphorylated diglucosamine backbone. A long carbohydrate chain of the conserved core and the highly variable O-antigen branches out from the glucosamine backbone. Based on our structural findings and previous biochemical investigations, we propose that the lipid portion of LPS binds to the NH2-terminal pocket. This proposal is based on the following reasoning: 1) as summarized in the previous paragraph, the epitopes of antibodies and mutations that block LPS binding map around the NH2-terminal pocket; and 2) the pocket is the only hydrophobic surface large enough to accommodate lipid portion of LPS.It is unlikely that binding of LPS induces a global structural change of CD14, since many residues making up the hydrophobic pocket are in conserved LRR motifs, and the overall shape of LRR proteins displays limited variability (32Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Besides, it has been reported that binding of LPS induces only minor changes in the tryptophan fluorescence and CD spectrum of CD14 (31McGinley M.D. Narhi L.O. Kelley M.J. Davy E. Robinson J. Rohde M.F. Wright S.D. Lichenstein H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5213-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, LPS binding can induce local structural changes especially within the highly mobile α2 and α3 helices and the connecting loops (31McGinley M.D. Narhi L.O. Kelley M.J. Davy E. Robinson J. Rohde M.F. Wright S.D. Lichenstein H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5213-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The long carbohydrate chain of LPS is hydrophilic and negatively charged and must have its own binding site, as previous research has shown that LPS that has been enzymatically delipidized retains some affinity for CD14 (33Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9904-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Previous studies of the binding of PGN to CD14 in vitro provide clues to the binding site of the carbohydrate portion of LPS, although the biological importance of PGN binding to CD14/TLR2 is under debate (34Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 35Travassos L.H. Girardin S.E. Philpott D.J.

The hydrophobic NH2-terminal pocket of CD14 is unlikely to be involved in PGN binding, since PGN is a completely hydrophilic molecule. However, the LPS- and PGN-binding sites must overlap, at least in part, because PGN competes with LPS for binding to CD14 (30Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The binding site of PGN appears to be shifted to the COOH-terminal side of the pocket, since deletion mutants of regions 1 and 2 that have a profound effect on LPS binding have only minor effects on PGN binding (Figs. 1A and 3A) (28Dziarski R. Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5254-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the other hand, deletion of region 4 reduces binding of LPS as well as of PGN, and region 4 is on the COOH-terminal side of the pocket. Furthermore, Dziarski et al. (30Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) reported that a monoclonal antibody, Leu_M3, specifically reduced the affinity for peptidoglycan without affecting that for LPS. The epitope of this antibody maps to the upper side of the G2 groove formed by the α5 helix and loops on the far COOH-terminal side of the pocket (Fig. 3A). Collectively, the LPS-binding site of CD14 appears to extend further beyond the NH2-terminal pocket and includes grooves in the neighboring area.The structural characteristics of the binding site may explain the broad ligand specificity of CD14. Although the hydrophobic bottom and walls of the pocket are rigid, the generous size of the pocket may allow structural variation in the hydrophobic portion of the ligand. Structural diversity in the hydrophilic part of the ligands could be explained by the considerable flexibility of the hydrophilic rim combined with the multiplicity of grooves available for ligand binding.Regions Responsible for LPS Signaling—To initiate signaling, LPS bound to CD14 should be transferred to the TLR4/MD-2 complex on the cell membrane. Several laboratories have reported CD14 mutants that have only minor defects in LPS binding but have virtually no signaling activity (36Muroi M. Ohnishi T. Tanamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42372-42379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Juan T.S. Hailman E. Kelley M.J. Wright S.D. Lichenstein H.S. J. Biol.

These regions are labeled T1–T3 in Figs. 1A and 3B. It is noteworthy that they are clustered on the same side of CD14, although most of them are far apart in the primary sequence (Figs. 1A and 3B). The sequences of Glu7–Asp10 and Asp9–Phe13 overlap with region 1 of the LPS blocking mutations. Therefore region 1 appears to play a role in both LPS binding and transfer because some mutations in this area block LPS binding and others LPS transfer. The sequences Leu91–Glu101 and Pro151–Leu153 are the lower parts of the two grooves, G1 and G2. As shown in Fig. 3B, all these mutations are located in the same area near the NH2-terminal pocket. These data suggest that the area close to the pocket plays an important role in the transfer of LPS from CD14 to the TLR4/MD-2 complex.In conclusion, we present here the first crystal structure of CD14. The structure provides evidence that different regions around the pocket contribute to LPS binding and signaling. Our structural studies provide new insights into the mechanism by which it recognizes LPS and may help in developing therapeutic agents to counteract septic shock syndrome. The innate immune response is the first line of defense against microbial infection (1Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev.

Although primarily known for their roles in actin rearrangements and membrane ruffling, translocated effectors also affect host cell processes that are not directly associated with invasion. Here, we show that SopB/SigD, an effector with phosphoinositide phosphatase activity, has anti-apoptotic activity in Salmonella-infected epithelial cells. Salmonella induced the sustained activation of Akt/protein kinase B, a pro-survival kinase, in a SopB-dependent manner. Failure to activate Akt resulted in increased levels of apoptosis after infection with a sopB deletion mutant (ΔsopB). Furthermore, cells infected with wild type bacteria, but not the ΔsopB strain, were protected from camptothecin-induced cleavage of caspase-3 and subsequent apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic activity of SopB was dependent on its phosphatase activity, because a catalytically inactive mutant was unable to protect cells from the effects of camptothecin. Finally, small interfering RNA was used to demonstrate the essential role of Akt in SopB-mediated protection against apoptosis. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of apoptosis and highlight how bacterial effectors can intercept signaling pathways to manipulate host responses.

The bacterial species Salmonella enterica consists of over 2,000 closely related serovars that cause a variety of diseases in humans as well as other animals. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, one of the most common food-borne pathogens, causes self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans and a similar diarrheal disease in calves and pigs. In contrast, infection of mice with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium produces a typhoid-like disease and is a useful animal model for systemic infection. Virulence factors can vary among S. enterica serovars, however, all possess two type III secretion systems (TTSS), 1The abbreviations used are: TTSS, type III secretion system; AMC, aminomethylcoumarin; CPT, camptothecin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; p.i., postinfection; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SPI, Salmonella pathogenicity island; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. which are used to deliver bacterial effector proteins directly into the host cell. The Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1-encoded TTSS is essential for invasion of non-phagocytic cells (1Galan J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 53-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 2Galan J.E. Fu Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 496-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the SPI2 encoded TTSS modulates post-invasion interactions with host cells and is required for intracellular growth and survival (3Waterman S.R. Holden D.W. Cell Microbiol. 2003; 5: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Although non-invasive SPI1-mutants are attenuated for enteropathogenicity, the roles of individual SPI1 effectors in enteropathogenesis and the mechanisms by which they disrupt intestinal function remain unclear (4Watson P.R. Galyov E.E. Paulin S.M. Jones P.W. Wallis T.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1432-1438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tsolis R.M. Adams L.G. Ficht T.A. Baumler A.J. Infect.

Immun. 2002; 70: 3843-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). One SPI1 translocated effector that has clearly been shown to play a role in enteropathogenesis is SopB, also known as SigD, which is required for fluid secretion and neutrophil accumulation in infected calf ileal loops (7Galyov E.E. Wood M.W. Rosqvist R. Mullan P.B. Watson P.R. Hedges S. Wallis T.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). SopB is a phosphatase that in vitro can hydrolyze a variety of inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides (8Norris F.A. Wilson M.P. Wallis T.S. Galyov E.E. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14057-14059Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Although sopB deletion mutants are only slightly attenuated for invasion and/or intracellular survival this effector is involved in actin rearrangements, phagocytosis and biogenesis of the Salmonella-containing vacuole in infected cells (9Terebiznik M.R. Vieira O.V. Marcus S.L. Slade A. Yip C.M. Trimble W.S. Meyer T. Finlay B.B. Grinstein S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 10Zhou D. Chen L.M. Hernandez L.

Science. 2004; 304: 1805-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously shown that SopB phosphatase activity is required for the activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B, in infected epithelial cells (12Steele-Mortimer O. Knodler L.A. Marcus S.L. Scheid M.P. Goh B. Pfeifer C.G. Duronio V. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37718-37724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). An important prosurvival kinase, Akt has recently been shown to play a role in the regulation of apoptosis in normal intestinal epithelial cells (13Zhang H.M. Rao J.N. Guo X. Liu L. Zou T. Turner D.J. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22539-22547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The Salmonella-induced activation of Akt could therefore potentially influence the onset and levels of apoptosis in epithelial cells during an infection. Although the subject of intense study since 1996, the role of apoptosis in Salmonella pathogenesis remains unclear, largely because multiple mechanisms are involved in a variety of cell types. Regardless of the mechanism, it is clear that apoptosis is induced by Salmonella in a number of cell types, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells (14Monack D.M. Detweiler C.S.

To further complicate the picture cell death may display classic signs of apoptosis, such as caspase-3 cleavage and cytochrome c release (19Jesenberger V. Procyk K.J. Yuan J. Reipert S. Baccarini M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or be more similar to necrosis (26Brennan M.A. Cookson B.T. Mol.

In macrophages, which have been more thoroughly studied, Salmonella can induce cell death via both SPI1- and SPI2-dependent pathways (29Hueffer K. Galan J.E. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Rapid onset cell death (occurring within 1 h of infection) is SPI1-dependent and involves activation of caspase-1 (16Hersh D. Monack D.M. Smith M.R. Ghori N. Falkow S. Zychlinsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 17Jarvelainen H.A. Galmiche A. Zychlinsky A.

SPI1 also mediates delayed (3 h after infection) cell death that is caspase-1-independent and has features of autophagy (15Hernandez L.D. Pypaert M. Flavell R.A. Galan J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Jesenberger V. Procyk K.J. Yuan J. Reipert S. Baccarini M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, both of these processes require SipB, although the exact role played by this SPI1 effector remains unclear, because it is required for the translocation of other SPI1 effectors (32Collazo C.M. Galan J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In addition, the SPI2 TTSS mediates apoptosis that occurs 12–24 h postinfection and is also, at least partially, caspase-1-dependent (14Monack D.M. Detweiler C.S. Falkow S. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 825-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23van der Velden A.W. Lindgren S.W. Worley M.J. Heffron F. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5702-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In intestinal epithelial cells Salmonella can also induce apoptosis but only after prolonged exposure of 24–28 h (21Paesold G. Guiney D.G. Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This delayed apoptosis involves the activation of caspase-3 and as yet unidentified SPI2 and spv genes (21Paesold G. Guiney D.G. Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because both SPI2 (33Cirillo D.M. Valdivia R.H. Monack D.M. Falkow S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and spv (34Fierer J. Eckmann L. Fang F. Pfeifer C. Finlay B.B. Guiney D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5231-5236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) genes are induced rapidly following internalization into host cells, but caspase-3 is not activated, we considered that a SPI1 effector could be actively delaying or inhibiting the onset of apoptosis in infected epithelial cells. Thus, based on the observations that (i) SopB activates Akt, (ii) Akt is an important regulator of apoptosis in epithelial cells, and (iii) apoptosis is delayed in Salmonella-infected epithelial cells, we have investigated the role of the SPI1 effector SopB in survival of infected epithelial cells. Using several complementary approaches we show that SopB has anti-apoptotic activity in infected epithelial cells, which is dependent on the phosphatase activity of SopB and the presence of Akt. Chemicals and Supplies—Disposable tissue cultureware was from Corning Life Sciences (Acton, MA). Biochemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Antibodies against Akt and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). M30 Cytodeath, a fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody that recognizes a caspase-cleaved, formalin-resistant epitope of human cytokeratin 18, was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 594 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Recombinant human epidermal growth factor was from Calbiochem. Cells and Bacterial Strains—HeLa cells (human adenocarcinoma cervix epithelial, ATCC CCL-2) and IEC-6 cells (rat small intestine epithelial, ATCC CRL-1592) were used within 10 passages of receipt from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HeLa cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, CA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen). IEC-6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS and 0.1 unit/ml bovine insulin. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium wild type strain SL1344 and the ΔsopB mutant were as described previously (12Steele-Mortimer O. Knodler L.A. Marcus S.L. Scheid M.P. Goh B. Pfeifer C.G. Duronio V.

Wenk M.R. Steele-Mortimer O. Finlay B.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The plasmid pDE C460S encodes a catalytically inactive SopB point mutant. To construct this mutant, pDE was partially digested with KpnI and blunt-ended by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and religated. A clone was chosen that retained the KpnI site within the sopB open reading frame, but lost the KpnI site downstream of sigE, and was designated pACDEΔKpnI. A 376-bp KpnI-StuI fragment containing the C460S mutation was then excised from pMWDE C460S (12Steele-Mortimer O. Knodler L.A. Marcus S.L. Scheid M.P. Goh B. Pfeifer C.G. Duronio V. Finlay B.B. J.

This mutant was originally designated pDE C462S (36Marcus S.L. Wenk M.R. Steele-Mortimer O. Finlay B.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) based on the original published sequence of sopB (GenBank™ accession number AAC46234) but has now been amended to pDE C460S based on the sopB sequence from the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 genome (accession number NP_460064). Preparation of SPI1-induced Bacteria—For bacterial infections, SPI1-induced bacteria were prepared by diluting 0.3 ml of overnight LB culture in 10 ml of fresh LB and incubating at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm). At late log phase (3.5 h), the bacteria were pelleted at 7,000 × g for 2 min and resuspended in an equal volume of Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) or phosphate-buffered saline. This suspension of hyperinvasive bacteria was then used to inoculate cells using invasion times of 10–45 min as indicated. Apoptosis Assays—For microscopic analysis of apoptosis, cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well plates 24 h prior to infection and serum-starved (0.5% FBS) for 3 h prior to infection. 5 (HeLa) or 10 μl (IEC-6) of SPI1-induced bacteria were then added directly to each well to give an multiplicity of infection of ∼100. After 15 (HeLa) or 45 min (IEC-6) of infection, the monolayers were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in fresh culture medium containing 0.5% FBS. After 20 min, fresh culture medium (0.5% FBS) containing 50 μg/ml gentamycin was added for 1 h followed by 5 μg/ml gentamycin for the remainder of the experiment. For HeLa cells, apoptosis was measured at 4 h postinfection (p.i.) using M30 Cytodeath staining according to the manufacturer's instructions. Levels of apoptosis in infected IEC-6 cells were measured at 4 h p.i. by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) using an In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For both cell types, nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Using a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope, cells were observed and scored for the number of Cytodeath-positive or TUNEL-positive cells/total cell nuclei (n ≥100/experiment). Results are the mean ± S.D. from at least three separate experiments. To directly assay the activity of caspases, cells grown in 10-cm dishes were serum-starved (0.5% FBS) and infected with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium as above. At 3 h p.i. cells were scraped into 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation (2,000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min). Pellets were then solubilized in 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol), flash frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Samples were thawed on ice and clarified by centrifugation (20,800 × g, 4 °C, 10 min). Caspase assays were performed in triplicate in 96-well plates. Each well contained 20 μl of cell-free extract diluted in 80 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) and a specific fluorogenic caspase substrate (final concentration of 0.18 mm). The fluorogenic substrates (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, PA) for caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 were Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp (IETD)-aminomethylcoumarin (AMC), Leu-Glu-His-Asp (LEHD)-AMC, and Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD)-AMC, respectively. Fluorescence due to the production of AMC was continuously recorded at 460 nm (excitation at 360 nm) at 37 °C using a Bio-Tek FL600 fluorescence plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Protein concentration was measured using the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting—HeLa cells were infected with bacteria as above except that serum starvation and subsequent incubations were carried out in 0% FBS. Immunoblotting after starving cells in 0.5% serum gave very similar results except that endogenous Akt-phosphorylation was not completely depleted (not shown). Briefly, SPI1-induced bacteria were added to subconfluent monolayers (multiplicity of infection = 100) for 10 min after which extracellular bacteria were removed. Monolayers were solubilized in boiling sample buffer at the indicated times and SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (12Steele-Mortimer O. Knodler L.A. Marcus S.L.

Phosphorylated Akt was revealed using phosphospecific (Ser-473) anti-Akt antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling), and the Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate detection system (Pierce). Caspase-3 cleavage was assessed using an antibody that recognizes the 32-kDa procaspase as well as the 17- and 20-kDa-cleaved forms (Cell Signaling). RNA-mediated Interference—Small interfering (siRNA) SMARTpool™ sequences targeting human Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 (Dharmacon RNA Technologies, Lafayette, CO) were diluted and stored according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa cells in 6-well plates were transfected 24 h after passaging with 50 pmol of siRNA/well using RNAiFect reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Infection with bacteria was carried out 48 h post-transfection when Akt protein levels had been reduced by 80–90% as assessed by immunoblotting. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least three times. Geometric means were determined and one way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey's post-hoc test was performed for significant differences. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. SopB Induces Sustained Akt Phosphorylation in Epithelial Cells—Previously we have shown that SopB induced Akt phosphorylation in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium-infected epithelial cells for at least 2 h p.i. (12Steele-Mortimer O. Knodler L.A. Marcus S.L. Scheid M.P. Goh B. Pfeifer C.G. Duronio V. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37718-37724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here we have further analyzed the kinetics of Akt phosphorylation using an antibody that specifically recognizes Akt when it is phosphorylated on Ser-473. Treatment of cells with stimuli such as epidermal growth factor causes a transient increase in phospho-Akt that peaks at 2–5 min (Fig. 1) and is no longer detectable after ∼10–20 min (12Steele-Mortimer O. Knodler L.A. Marcus S.L. Scheid M.P. Goh B. Pfeifer C.G. Duronio V. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37718-37724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In contrast, infection with wild type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium induced prolonged Akt phosphorylation that peaked at ∼20 min and was detectable for at least 4 h postinfection. This phosphorylation was dependent on SopB, because an isogenic sopB deletion strain (ΔsopB) induced no significant phospho-Akt at any time point studied (Fig. 1). Taken together with our previous data (12Steele-Mortimer O. Knodler L.A. Marcus S.L. Scheid M.P. Goh B. Pfeifer C.G. Duronio V. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37718-37724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) this shows that SopB is required for the sustained phosphorylation and activation of Akt in infected epithelial cells. Epithelial Cells Infected with the ΔsopB Mutant Have Increased Levels of Apoptosis at 4 h p.i.—Because Akt is a well characterized prosurvival kinase that mediates survival of intestinal epithelial cells, we next analyzed the levels of apoptosis in epithelial cells infected with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. In HeLa cells the cleavage of cytokeratin 18, one of several keratins cleaved by caspases (37Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), was used as an early indicator of apoptosis. The cleavage of cytokeratin 18 generates a stable fragment that accumulates in the cytosol and can be detected using an epitope-specific monoclonal antibody (M30) (37Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33197-33203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 38Leers M.P. Kolgen W. Bjorklund V. Bergman T. Tribbick G. Persson B. Bjorklund P. Ramaekers F.C. Bjorklund B. Nap M. Jornvall H. Schutte B. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Cells grown on glass coverslips were infected with Salmonella, fixed at 4 h p.i., and processed for immunofluorescence using the M30 antibody. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to facilitate the identification of all cells. Infection with the ΔsopB mutant caused a greater than 9-fold increase in apoptotic cells, whereas wild type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium increased the number of M30-reactive cells by only 5.0-fold (Fig. 2). In contrast, when the ΔsopB strain was complemented with a pACYC184-based plasmid (pDE), which expresses the sopBsigE operon (SigE is the type III chaperone for SopB) under the control of the sopB promotor (36Marcus S.L. Wenk M.R. Steele-Mortimer O. Finlay B.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 39Marcus S.L. Knodler L.A. Finlay B.B. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), apoptosis was increased by only 3.1-fold. We confirmed these results in IEC-6 cells, a non-transformed crypt cell line derived from the rat small intestine, using a TUNEL assay to detect apoptotic cells. Overall, we detected slightly higher levels of apoptosis in IEC-6 cells compared with HeLa cells, with -fold increases of 10.4, 17.2, and 9.0 after infection for 4 h by wild type, ΔsopB, and ΔsopB pDE strains, respectively. Thus, in both of the cell types studied, using different assays for apoptosis, the ΔsopB strain induced significantly higher levels of apoptosis than either the wild type or the sopB complemented strain at 4 h p.i. (Fig. 2). Together these experiments suggest a role for SopB in preventing or delaying the onset of apoptosis in epithelial cells. SopB Reduces Caspase-3 Activity in Infected Epithelial Cells—Caspases are the major executors of the apoptotic program. Therefore, to explore in more detail the mechanistic role of SopB, we measured caspase activity in infected HeLa cells. Cell-free lysates, prepared 3 h p.i., were incubated with fluorogenic caspase substrates and caspase activity was assayed by the release of the fluorescent compound AMC. Although substrates specific for caspases 3, 8, and 9 were compared, we only detected a statistically significant change in caspase-3 activity in cells infected with the ΔsopB strain compared with uninfected cells (a 1.6-fold increase). Complementation of ΔsopB with pDE abrogated the ability of this strain to induce caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3). These results confirm those of the previous experiment (Fig. 2) demonstrating that SopB mediates cellular survival. Furthermore, they suggest that the apoptosis induced by the ΔsopB mutant involves caspase-3 activation. SopB Protects Epithelial Cells against Camptothecin-induced Apoptosis—We next considered the possibility that SopB can actively protect epithelial cells from apoptosis by preventing the activation of caspase-3. Therefore, we investigated the ability of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium to protect cells against the activity of camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase inhibitor that induces apoptosis in a caspase-3-dependent manner (40Ray R.M. Viar M.J. Yuan Q. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C480-C489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Deng W. Balazs L. Wang D.A. Van Middlesworth L. Tigyi G. Johnson L.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 206-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For these experiments bacteria were internalized into HeLa cells for 10 min, extracellular bacteria were then removed by washing, CPT was added, and the cells incubated for a further 3 h. The cytokeratin 18 cleavage assay was then used to detect apoptotic cells. Under these conditions ∼13% of CPT-treated uninfected cells were M30 reactive and therefore apoptotic, compared with ∼1% of untreated HeLa cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4A). Infection with wild type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium reduced CPT-induced apoptosis by ∼50% (p = 0.003). This decrease was dependent on SopB, because the ΔsopB strain did not significantly affect the levels of CPT-induced apoptosis unless complemented with pDE. Furthermore, complementation of ΔsopB with a catalytically inactive mutant, SopB C460S, did not protect cells from drug-induced apoptosis. This indicates that the conserved cysteine residue Cys-460, which is essential for the inositol phosphatase activity of SopB and Akt activation (8Norris F.A. Wilson M.P. Wallis T.S. Galyov E.E.

SopB Inhibits Camptothecin-mediated Cleavage of Procaspase-3—Caspase-3 activation involves the cleavage of a 32-kDa precursor (p32) into 20-kDa (p20) and 12-kDa (p12) subunits, with p20 undergoing further conversion to a 17-kDa (p17) active subunit (42Han Z.

Bax is a major proapoptotic member of the Bcl2 family and a molecule required for apoptotic cell death. Growth factor (i.e. granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor)-induced phosphorylation of Bax has been reported to negatively regulate its proapoptotic function. Because Bax is ubiquitously expressed in both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer cells, nicotine may mimic growth factor(s) to regulate the activity of Bax. We found that nicotine potently induces Bax phosphorylation at Ser-184, which results in abrogation of the proapoptotic activity of Bax and increased cell survival. AKT, a known physiological Bax kinase, is activated by nicotine, co-localizes with Bax in the cytoplasm, and can directly phosphorylate Bax in vitro. Treatment of cells with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 or specific depletion of AKT expression by RNA interference can block both nicotine-induced Bax phosphorylation and cell survival. Importantly, nicotine-induced Bax phosphorylation potently blocks stress-induced translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria, impairs Bax insertion into mitochondrial membranes, and reduces the half-life of Bax protein (i.e. from 9-12 h to <6 h). Because knockdown of Bax expression by gene silencing results in prolonged cell survival following treatment with cisplatin in the absence or presence of nicotine, Bax may be an essential component in the nicotine survival signaling pathway. Thus, nicotine-induced survival and chemoresistance of human lung cancer cells may occur in a novel mechanism involving activation of PI3K/AKT that directly phosphorylates and inactivates the proapoptotic function of Bax.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and kills more people than cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, and pancreas combined in the United States (1Society American Cancer Cancer Facts & Figures. American Cancer Society Inc., Atlanta, GA2003: 13-14Google Scholar). More than 90% of lung cancer is related to cigarette smoke, which contains about 4,000 chemicals, 55 of which have been evaluated as carcinogens (2Benowitz N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 1318-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 3Schuller H.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 4Hecht S.S. J. Natl.

Nicotine not only promotes lung cancer development by activating the cell growth pathways but also reduces the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents by stimulating survival pathways (7Heeschen C.

However, the intracellular mechanism(s) by which nicotine induces survival and chemoresistance of human lung cancer cells remains elusive. Cell death through apoptosis may be a potential mechanism for lung cancer treatment. Apoptosis occurs by activation of an intrinsic or extrinsic pathway and can be divided into three interdependent phases: induction, decision, and execution. The decision phase is largely regulated by the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators, which comprises three subfamilies (10Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar). The subfamily that includes Bcl2 and Bcl-XL members blocks apoptosis, whereas the Bax subfamily, consisting of Bax and Bak, and the BH3-only subfamily, including Bad, Bid, Bok, Bik, and Bim, promote apoptosis (12Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 13Farrow S.N. Brown R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Bcl2 family members function in a tightly regulated network that protects the mitochondria or induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Studies have determined the functional significance of the conserved Bcl2 homology domains (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4) as well as the hydrophobic transmembrane domain that localizes the members of this family to the outer mitochondrial membrane. It is popularly held that antiapoptotic Bcl2 and Bcl-XL heterodimerize with proapoptotic Bax or Bak such that the hydrophobic crevices on their surfaces bind to the exposed BH3 domain of Bax or Bak to block their proapoptotic function. Thus, heterodimerization appears to regulate, at least in part, cell survival or death (14Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar). Further, the BH3 domain of the proapoptotic members is required for both their oligomerization and killing activity, although homodimerization does not necessarily correlate with killing activity (18Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Genetic studies using Bax and Bak single and double homozygous knock-out mice reveal that either Bax or Bak is essential for inducing mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by the release of potent caspase activators, including cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo, which initiate the intrinsic cell death pathway (19Wei M. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). Bax, the major promoter of cell death, has been identified as a promising prognostic indicator in patients with lung cancer (20Groeger A.M. Esposito V. Cassandro R. Baldi G. Rossiello L. De Luca L. Kadletz M. Kaiser H.E. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 3627-3630PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) involved in regulating the proapoptotic activity of Bax is not fully understood. It has been proposed that activation of the proapoptotic function of Bax likely occurs through several interdependent mechanisms, including translocation from cytosol to mitochondria (21Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), oligomerization, and insertion into mitochondrial membranes following stress (22Smaili S.S. Hsu Y.T. Carvalho A.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18361-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In healthy cells, Bax is predominantly a soluble monomeric protein, despite the fact that it possesses a C-terminal hydrophobic segment (25Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic domain, unlike those of Bcl2 and Bcl-XL, is sequestered inside a hydrophobic cleft (12Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 22Smaili S.S. Hsu Y.T. Carvalho A.C. Rosenstock T.R. Sharpe J.C. Youle R.J. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2003; 36: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Bax is translocated into mitochondria upon induction of apoptosis (26Eldering E. Mackus W.J. Derks I.A. Evers L.M. Beuling E. Teeling P. Lens S.M. Van Oers M.H. Van Lier R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1950-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Deng Y. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This translocation process appears to involve a conformational change in Bax to expose its C-terminal hydrophobic domain (28Nechushtan A.S. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). After translocation, Bax forms large oligomers, which insert into mitochondrial membranes, leading to cytochrome c release and cytotoxic activities. However, this has not been seen in other Bcl2 family proteins, such as Bid and Bad (23Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Lamensdorf I. Yoon S.H. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). A recent report indicated that GM-CSF induces Bax phosphorylation at Ser-184 in the hydrophobic C-terminal tail and inactivates the proapoptotic activity of Bax in neutrophils (29Gardai S.J. Hildeman D.A. Frankel S.K. Whitlock B.B. Frasch S.C. Borregaard N. Marrack P. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21085-21095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These findings reveal that the proapoptotic activity of Bax can be regulated by a post-translational modification (i.e. phosphorylation). Because inactivation of Bax has been found to promote tumorigenesis by rendering the tumor cells less susceptible to cell death (30LeBlanc H. Lawrence D. Varfolomeev E. Totpal K. Morlan J. Schow P. Fong S. Schwall R. Sinicropi D. Ashkennazi A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), nicotine may promote lung cancer development in a novel mechanism involving regulation of the proapoptotic activity of Bax. In this study, we demonstrated that nicotine can induce activation of PI3K/AKT, which directly phosphorylates and inactivates Bax in human lung cancer cells.

Protein Isolation—Cells were washed with 1× PBS, lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected as the cell lysate as described previously (31Jin Z. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol.

Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with phosphate-free RPMI medium and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 120 min. After agonist or inhibitor addition, cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed in detergent buffer. Bax was immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated Bax antibody. The samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at -80 °C. Bax phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. The same filter was then probed by Western blot analysis using a Bax antibody and developed using an ECL Kit from Amersham Biosciences as described previously (32Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J.

Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—A549 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 120 min and treated with nicotine (1 μm) for 60 min. 32P-Labeled Bax was immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated Bax antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane slice containing Bax was excised and hydrolyzed in 5.7 n HCl (Pierce) at 110 °C for 90 min under a vacuum. Cold phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine were added to the sample; they were applied together onto a TLC plate and separated by electrophoresis utilizing a Multiphor II apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) with an equal volume of pH 1.9 and pH 3.5 buffers as described previously (24Mikhailov V.

The location of phosphoamino acids was determined by ninhydrin staining and autoradiography. Phosphorylation of Bax in Vitro—Purified recombinant Bax protein was obtained from Protein X, Inc. (San Diego, CA). The endogenous Bax was immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated Bax antibody from lysates of A549 cells. Recombinant or endogenous Bax was resuspended in a kinase assay buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm ATP, 75 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm NaF, and Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated with purified active AKT at 30 °C for various times as indicated. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling prior to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of Bax was determined by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence—A549 cells were grown on a poly-d-lysinecoated cover slide, washed with 1× PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol, and blocked with 10% donkey serum. Then, cells were incubated with mouse against human Bax and rabbit against human AKT primary antibodies for 90 min. After washing, samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 60 min. Cells were washed with 1× PBS and observed under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). Pictures were taken and colored with the same exposure setting for each experiment. To determine subcellular regions of protein co-localization, individual red- and green-stained images derived from the same field were merged using Openlab 3.1.5 software from Improvision, Inc. (Lexington, MA). Areas of protein co-localization appear in yellow (see Fig. 3). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells (2 × 107) were washed with cold 1× PBS and resuspended in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture set I, homogenized with a polytron homogenizer operating for four bursts of 10 s each at a setting of 5, and then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to pellet mitochondria as described previously (31Jin Z. Gao F. Flagg T. Deng X. J. Biol.

The resulting supernatant is the cytosolic fraction. Mitochondria were washed twice with mitochondrial buffer and resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, rocked for 60 min, and then centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant containing mitochondrial proteins was collected. Protein (100 μg) from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bax was analyzed by Western blot using a Bax antibody. The purity of fractions was confirmed by assessing localization of the mitochondria-specific protein prohibitin (33Ikonen E. Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Alkali Extraction of Bax Peripherally Associated with Mitochondrial Membranes—Cells were treated with cisplatin (40 μm) in the absence or presence of nicotine (1 μm) for various times. Mitochondria were isolated by subcellular fractionation, resuspended in freshly prepared 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The alkali-extracted membrane pellet was resuspended with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, rocked for 60 min, and then centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the nonextractable mitochondrial proteins was collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The alkali-resistant Bax (i.e. nonextractable or integral) was determined by Western blot using a Bax antibody as described previously (21Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R.

Depletion of AKT Expression by RNA Interference (RNAi)—Human AKT siRNA was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A549 cells were transfected with AKT siRNA using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. A control siRNA (non-homologous to any known gene sequence) was used as a negative control. The levels of AKT expression were analyzed by Western blotting using an AKT antibody. Bax phosphorylation or cell viability was assessed following various treatments. Specific silencing of the targeted AKT gene was confirmed by at least three independent experiments. Vector-based Gene Silencing of Bax by RNAi—The Bax DNA target sequence for siRNA design is AACTGATCAGAACCATCATGG. This was determined by the siRNA Target Finder (Ambion) according to human Bax cDNA sequence. The Bax-specific hairpin siRNA insert (sense-loop-antisense) was determined using a computerized insert design tool based on a target sequence following instructions from Ambion's Web site. Then, the oligonucleotide-encoding Bax-specific hairpin siRNA insert was synthesized and ligated into pSilencer™ 2.1-U6 hygromycin vector. The pSilencer™ 2.1-U6 hygromycin plasmids bearing Bax hairpin siRNA were transfected into A549 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The stable clones persistently producing Bax siRNA were selected using hygromycin (0.8 mg/ml). The levels of Bax expression were analyzed by Western blot using a Bax antibody. Cell Viability Assay—The apoptotic and viable cells were detected using an ApoAlert Annexin-V kit from Clontech according to the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of viable cells or apoptotic cells was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described previously (35Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Cell viability was also confirmed using the trypan blue dye exclusion method (32Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Nicotine Induces Bax Phosphorylation in Association with Increased Survival of Human Lung Cancer Cells—A recent report shows that GM-CSF can induce Bax phosphorylation through activation of PI3K/AKT, which results in markedly decreased proapoptotic activity of Bax (29Gardai S.J. Hildeman D.A. Frankel S.K. Whitlock B.B. Frasch S.C. Borregaard N. Marrack P. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21085-21095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Because nicotine can potently induce activation of PI3K/AKT (36West K.A. Brognard J. Clark A.S.

Hildeman D.A. Frankel S.K. Whitlock B.B. Frasch S.C. Borregaard N. Marrack P. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21085-21095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and Bax is widely expressed in both SCLC and NSCLC cells (Fig. 1A), it is possible that nicotine may regulate the function of Bax in a mechanism involving its phosphorylation. To test this, A549 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bax were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine (1 μm) for 60 min. Phosphorylation of Bax was analyzed by autoradiography. Results indicate that nicotine potently stimulates serine phosphorylation of Bax (Fig. 1, B and C). To test a potential role for nicotine-stimulated Bax phosphorylation, A549 cells were treated with the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, which is widely used in the treatment of patients with lung cancer, in the presence or absence of nicotine for various times. Cell viability indicates that nicotine significantly prolongs survival of A549 cells following cisplatin treatment (Fig. 1D). These findings suggest that nicotine-induced survival and chemoresistance may occur, at least in part, in a mechanism involving Bax phosphorylation. Nicotine Induces Bax Phosphorylation at Ser-184, Which Results in Inactivation of the Proapoptotic Function of Bax—GM-CSF can induce Bax phosphorylation at Ser-184, which is located in the C-terminal hydrophobic domain (29Gardai S.J. Hildeman D.A. Frankel S.K. Whitlock B.B. Frasch S.C. Borregaard N. Marrack P. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21085-21095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis reveals that nicotine-induced Bax phosphorylation is located at serine amino acid(s) (Fig. 1C). To test whether nicotine induces Bax phosphorylation at Ser-184, WT, S184A, or S184E cDNA in the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector was transfected into H157 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000. We chose this cell line because H157 cells express relatively low levels of endogenous Bax (Fig. 1A). Thus, the proapoptotic function of individual Bax mutants could be more accurately evaluated because any possible effect from endogenous Bax could be minimized. After a 48-h transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine (1 μm), and phosphorylation of Bax was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the meantime, cells were treated with the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin (40 μm) in the absence or presence of nicotine for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using an ApoAlert Annexin-V kit. Results indicate that nicotine induces phosphorylation of WT but not the S184A or S184E mutant Bax (Fig. 2A), suggesting that nicotine stimulates Bax phosphorylation exclusively at the Ser-184 site. Importantly, expression of the nonphosphorylatable S184A results in more apoptotic cell death than WT. Nicotine can prolong the survival of cells expressing WT Bax but not the S184A Bax mutant (Fig. 2B). By contrast, the phosphomimetic S184E Bax exhibits no apoptotic activity. Nicotine has no additional survival effect in cells expressing S184E Bax mutant (Fig. 2B). These findings reveal that either nicotine-induced Ser-184 site phosphorylation or genetically mimicking Ser-184 site phosphorylation (i.e. S184E) results in abrogation of the proapoptotic function of Bax. AKT Is Co-localized with Bax in Cytoplasm and Activated by Nicotine, and the Active AKT Directly Phosphorylates Bax in Vitro—To assess a potential direct role for AKT as a physiological Bax kinase, subcellular distribution of AKT and Bax was assessed by immunofluorescent staining. A mouse antibody against human Bax, a rabbit antibody against human AKT, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse (green) or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit (red) secondary antibodies were used so that cells could be stained simultaneously without cross-reaction. Results indicate that Bax is primarily co-localized with AKT in the cytoplasm of A549 cells (Fig. 3A). To test whether AKT is a nicotine-activated Bax kinase, nicotine was assessed for its ability to activate AKT in A549 cells. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of nicotine for 60 min. Phosphorylation of AKT was analyzed by Western blot using a phospho-specific AKT antibody. Results indicated that nicotine can potently activate AKT in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). To determine whether AKT can directly phosphorylate endogenous Bax, Bax protein was immunoprecipitated from A549 cells and incubated with purified active AKT in a kinase assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results show that active AKT directly phosphorylates Bax in vitro (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, active AKT can also directly phosphorylate recombinant Bax protein (Fig. 3D). These findings suggest that nicotine-activated AKT has the potential to directly phosphorylate and inactivate Bax in human lung cancer cells. The PI3K-specific Inhibitor LY294002 Blocks Nicotine-induced Bax Phosphorylation and Promotes Apoptosis—To pharmacologically demonstrate a functional role of AKT as physiological nicotine-activated Bax kinase in vivo, LY294002, a PI3K-specific inhibitor that can block the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (37Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used. A549 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine (1 μm) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of LY294002 (0.1-10 μm) for 60 min. Results indicate that LY294002 can block nicotine-induced Bax phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Functionally, LY294002 inhibits nicotine-stimulated cell survival and promotes apoptotic cell death following treatment with cisplatin (Fig. 4B). These findings reveal that inhibition of Bax phosphorylation may restore the proapoptotic function of Bax. Thus, LY294002 may have therapeutic potential for treating patients with lung cancer expressing both AKT and Bax in a mechanism by blocking Bax"

However, it remains undefined whether it is the accumulation of cholesterol and/or gangliosides responsible for the disease phenotype. In this context, it has proven beneficial to utilize the BALB/c NPC1 mouse with homozygous NPC1 mutations that displays a biochemical phenotype similar to patients with NPC1 disease, including neurodegeneration (16Morris M.D. Bhuvaneswaran C. Shio H. Fower S. Am. J. Pathol. 1982; 108: 140-149PubMed Google Scholar), irregular dendritic trees and spines (17Higashi Y. Murayama S. Pentchev P.G. Suzuki K.

The continuous defective use of cholesterol in NPC1 neural tissues has been suggested to cause tauopathy (5Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Ninomiya H. Ohno K. Yanagisawa K.

Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1086-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). With respect to neuronal gangliosides, although some studies support the case for an accumulation of gangliosides causing neurodegeneration (20Walkley S.U. Siegel D.A. Dobrenis K. Zervas M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 845: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), another study indicates that an accumulation of gangliosides is not the cause for neurodegeneration in NPC1 mice (21Liu Y. Wu Y.P. Wada R. Neufeld E.B. Mullin K.A. Howard A.C. Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A more recent study has demonstrated that impaired neurosteroidogenesis, because of disordered cholesterol trafficking, affects neuronal growth and differentiation, and that allopreg-nanolone treatment delays the onset of neurological symptoms and lengthens the lifespan of NPC1 mice (22Griffin L.D. Gong W. Verot L. Mellon S.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism causing disrupted neurosteroidogenesis in NPC mice remains unclear. In this report, the BALB/c NPC1 mouse model was used to investigate the molecular basis for neuronal impairment in NPC1 disease. The results reveal a novel mechanism whereby an increased level of cholesterol in mitochondria membranes adversely affects the mitochondrial membrane potential, synthesis of ATP, and the level of cellular ATP in NPC1 mouse brains and neurons. Importantly, neuronal impairment in neurite outgrowth was restored by the addition of ATP, providing a potentially useful therapy for NPC1 disease. BALB/c NPC1NIH Mice—The animal care and experiments using animals were carried out in accordance with the institutional guidelines. A breeding pair of BALB/c NPC1NIH mice, heterozygous for NPC1 (NPC1+/-), were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MA). These heterozygous mice were maintained on a low-cholesterol diet (w/w) and low fat 6% (w/w) normal mouse diet. These mice were bred to produce normal (NPC1+/+), heterozygous (NPC1+/-), and homozygous affected (NPC1-/-) mice. For all experiments using brain samples from cerebral cortices in this report, only male mice at 9 weeks of age were investigated. For preparation of primary cultures, the cerebral cortices from embryonic day 16 or postnatal day 2 mouse brains were used. Genotype Analysis—For genotype analysis of mice and cultured cells prepared from embryos or postnatal day 2 mice, DNA was isolated from the tail tips of each mouse and PCR was performed at the NPC1 locus using primer pairs as previously described (7Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against cytochrome c (a mitochondrion marker), Na+,K+-ATPase β2 (a plasma membrane marker), GM130 (a Golgi marker), nucleoporin p62 (a nucleus marker), and Bip/GRP78 (an endoplasmic reticulum marker) were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against cathepsin L (a lysosome marker) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (a mitochondrial inner membrane marker) were purchased from Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY) and Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC: a mitochondrial outer membrane marker), fumarase (a mitochondrial matrix maker), and UCP2 (the uncoupling protein) were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO), Nordic Immunological Laboratory (Tilburg, the Netherlands), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy was performed as previously described (5Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Ninomiya H. Ohno K. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10314-10319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, the cerebella removed from NPC1+/+ and NPC1-/- mice at 9 weeks old were rinsed with PBS and fixed and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were double-stained with 2.0% uranyl acetate for 10 min and with a lead-staining solution for 5 min, and then examined using a JEOL JEM-1200EX transmission electron microscope. Cell Culture—The embryonic brains were removed on embryonic day 16 for neuronal cultures. The genotype of each embryo was determined using the tail as described above. Neuron-rich cultures were prepared from the cerebral cortex as previously described (23Michikawa M. Gong J.S. Fan Q.W. Sawamura N. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7226-7235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociated cells were suspended in medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture (DMEM/F-12; 50%: 50%), N2 supplements, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and plated onto poly-d-lysinecoated 6-well plates at a cell density of 2 × 104/cm2. On day 3 of culture, more than 99% of the cultured cells were identified as neurons by immunocytochemical analysis using a monoclonal antibody against microtubule-associated protein 2 (Sigma), a neuron-specific marker. To prepare astrocyte-rich cultures, the brains from postnatal day 2 mice were removed under anesthesia. After genotype analysis, the cortex was dissociated and cortical cells were seeded in 75-cm2 dishes at a cell density of 1 × 107 in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum as previously described (24Gong J.S. Kobayashi M. Hayashi H. Zou K. Sawamura N. Fujita S.C. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29919-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). After 10 days of incubation in vitro, astrocytes in the monolayer were trypsinized (0.1%) and reseeded into 6-well plates. The astrocyte-rich cultures were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum until use. Mitotracker Labeling—Primary neurons and astrocytes cultured for 5 and 14 days, respectively, were rinsed three times with PBS and then incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 3 μm Mitotracker JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 20 min at 37 °C. Stock solutions of 600 μm Mitotracker JC-1 were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Mitotracker JC-1 was rinsed from cells using Hanks' balanced salt solution and then cells were allowed to equilibrate in Hanks' balanced salt solution at room temperature for an additional 20 min. Fluorescent images were obtained using a model LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd., Jena, Germany) equipped with a ×63 Plan Apochromat numerical aperture and 1.4 oil immersion objective. Simultaneous two-channel recording was performed using excitation wavelength lines of 488 and 543 nm of an argon laser, and fluorescence was detected using 530 and 590 nm emission filters. For merged images, images were adjusted to similar intensities and then merged using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Determination of ATP Levels in Tissues and Cultured Cells—The brain, liver, and muscle were removed and homogenates were prepared with PBS containing protease inhibitors, Complete™ (Roche Diagnostics), using a glass/Teflon homogenizer (Iuchi, Osaka, Japan) with 10 up and down strokes at 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 rpm, respectively. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and then rinsed three times with PBS. For preparation of homogenates of cultured cells, harvested cultured cells in PBS containing protease inhibitors, Complete™, were homogenized using a glass/Teflon homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and then rinsed three times with PBS. The level of ATP in these samples was determined using the ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II (Roche). In brief, this was performed by resuspending the pellet into 50 μl of ice-cold ATP-lysis buffer (100 mm Tris and 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.75), to which 150 μl of boiling ATP-lysis buffer was added, and the samples were incubated for 2 min at 99 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants collected. Finally, the level of ATP was determined by combining 50 μl of the supernatant with 50 μl of luciferase reagent. After a 1.6-s delay, chemiluminescence was measured with a 10-s integration time using a microplate luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Luciferase activity was expressed as fluorescence units per μg of protein. Isolation of Brain Mitochondria—Cerebral cortices were isolated and homogenized in the isolation buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 70 mm sucrose, and 0.1% fat-free BSA) using a glass/Teflon homogenizer (Iuchi, Osaka, Japan) with 10 up and down strokes. The homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, with the resulting pellet being suspended into isolation buffer (P1), and the resulting supernatant (S1) being centrifuged at 10,300 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 41 rotor. The resulting supernatant (S2), was stored and the pellet (P2) was suspended in 2 ml of isolation buffer, loaded onto 8 ml of 30% (v/v) Percoll in gradient buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 225 mm mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% fat-free BSA), and centrifuged at 95,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (S3) was stored, and the mitochondrial pellet (P3) was rinsed with isolation buffer by centrifuging 15 min at 7,000 × g at 4 °C, and then resuspended in isolation buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic protein determination method (Pierce Chemical Co.). Subfractionation of Brain Mitochondria by Digitonin—A 2.0% digitonin stock solution was prepared immediately prior to use by dissolving digitonin in the isolation solution (210 mm mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 70 mm sucrose) as previously described (25Schnaitman C. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). One ml of ice-cold digitonin solution was added to 1 ml of mitochondrial protein (100 mg/ml). The resulting suspension was homogenized, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of isolation solution. This suspension was centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet from the second centrifugation is hereafter referred to as the “inner membrane” (IM). The supernatants from the first and second centrifugation were pooled, and fractionated by centrifugation at 144,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet from this centrifugation is hereafter referred to as the “outer membrane” (OM) and the supernatant the “contact sites” (CS) (26Wang X. Liu Z. Eimerl S. Timberg R. Weiss A.M. Orly J. Stocco D.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3903-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Analysis of Complex I + III, II + III, IV, and V—The mitochondria isolated from homogenates of cerebral cortices were used for enzymatic analysis. (a) The enzyme activity of NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex I + III) was determined as previously described (27Sottocasa G.L. Kuylenstierna B. Ernster L. Bergstrand A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). In brief, a 150-μl reaction buffer (50 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm NADH, 0.1 mm cytochrome c, and 0.3 mm KCN) with and without 1.5 μm rotenone, was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C, followed by the addition of 10 μl of mitochondria protein (3 μg/μl). NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity was immediately monitored at 550 nm and the difference in the reduction of cytochrome c with and without rotenone was calculated. (b) The enzyme activity of succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex II + III) was determined as previously described (28Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, a 150-μl reaction buffer (40 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 20 mm sodium succinate, 50 μm cytochrome c, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.25 mm KCN) was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C, followed by the addition of 10 μl of mitochondrial protein (3 μg/μl). Succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity was monitored at 550 nm and the difference in the reduction of cytochrome c was calculated. (c) The enzyme activity of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) was determined as previously described (29Zheng X. Shoffner J.M. Lott M.T. Voljavec A.S. Krawiecki N.S. Winn K. Wallace D.C. Neurology. 1989; 39: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex IV activity was measured as the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by cytochrome c oxidase at 550 nm. Ferrocytochrome c was first prepared from 10% cytochrome c by reduction with sodium ascorbate and dialysis against 0.01 m K2HPO4 (pH 7.0) using a 3.5-kDa exclusion dialysis membrane. A 150-μl reaction buffer (10 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 70 μl of ferrocytochrome c) was incubated 5 min at 30 °C, followed by the addition of 10 μl of mitochondrial protein (3 μg/μl). Cytochrome c oxidase activity was immediately monitored at 550 nm. (d) The enzyme activity of mitochondrial complex V was determined as previously described (29Zheng X. Shoffner J.M. Lott M.T. Voljavec A.S. Krawiecki N.S. Winn K. Wallace D.C. Neurology. 1989; 39: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured as the hydrolysis rate of ATP determined by a bioluminescence method. In brief, a 250-μl reaction buffer (10 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 300 mm d-mannitol, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 2 μm rotenone, 0.3 mm KCN) was combined with 100 μg of mitochondrial protein. The reaction was initiated by adding 1.5 μl of 500 mm ATP (at a final concentration of 3 mm) and run for 15 min at 37 °C then stopped by adding oligomycin at a final concentration of 10 μm. A control experiment was performed under the same conditions in the presence of 10 μm oligomycin to obtain the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of ATP. The solution was diluted to 1/10 and the ATP level was measured by the luciferinluciferase method using the ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II (Roche) in a luminescence spectrometer. For the determination of ATP synthase activity, 100 μg of mitochondrial protein from each sample was used to measure the synthesis of ATP. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μg of mitochondrial protein into 100 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 300 mm d-mannitol, 10 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. After a period of 1 min, 10 μl of ADP (50 μm) was added, and the intensity of bioluminescene was recorded at 37 °C, where the peak height was proportional to the amount of ATP that was synthesized. Effect of Removal of Cholesterol from the Mitochondria Membrane—To remove cholesterol from the mitochondria membrane, a stock solution of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) (150 mm) was prepared using distilled water, and then diluted into the P2 fraction derived from brains to a final concentration of 7.5 mm. The mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by an additional incubation for 10 min at room temperature and subjected to ultracentrifugation to purify mitochondria. For the cholesterol enrichment of mitochondria with or without methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a stock solution of cholesterol was prepared (5 mm in 100% ethanol) and added into the P2 fraction that was resuspended in isolation buffer (200 μl) at a final concentration of 50 μm, followed by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C. The mitochondria were rinsed twice and subjected to ultracentrifugation to purify mitochondria. The cholesterol level, protein content, and the ATP synthase activity associated with mitochondria were then determined as described above. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (5Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Ninomiya H. Ohno K. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10314-10319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal antibodies (cytochrome c, 1:1,000 dilution; Na+, K+-ATPase β2, 1:1000 dilution; GM130, 1:500 dilution; Bip/GRP78, 1:500 dilution; cathepsin L, 1:1000 dilution; nucleoporin p62, 1:1000 dilution; and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 1:1000 dilution), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (VDAC, 1:1000 dilution; fumarase, 1:500 dilution; and UCP-2, 1:1,000 dilution). After rinsing and incubation in the presence of appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the respective bands were detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Morphological Analysis—Cultured neurons maintained for 1, 2, and 3 days in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm ADP, or 0.5 mm AMP-PNP (Roche) were rinsed and then fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 0.1 m PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde fluoride. The cells were then rinsed with PBS, blocked in PBS containing 2.0% BSA, then incubated with monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (Covance, Richmond, CA, 1:500 dilution) in PBS containing 2% BSA overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then incubated with antimouse IgG (1:200) in 0.1 m PBS, 0.5% BSA for 1 h, rinsed, and visualized using the ABC method. Photographic images were captured using a CCD camera (DC500) (Leica Microsystems GMBH, Wetzar, Germany) attached with phase-contrast microscopy (Olympus IX70, Olympus Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The ratio of neurite number/cell and neurite total length/cell was determined using an image analyzer (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd., Jena, Germany). Determination of Cholesterol and Phosphatidylcholine (PC) Transport—To determine the transport of exogenously added cholesterol and PC into mitochondria in cultured cells, wild type astrocytes were labeled with 37 Bq/ml of [14C]acetate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The conditioned media was collected 5 days later and an equivalent amount of 14C-labeled HDL (cholesterol concentration at 1 μg/ml) was added into plates previously seeded with NPC1+/+, NPC1+/-, and NPC1-/- astrocytes. The cells were harvested at 4, 8, and 12 h following the addition of HDL and the mitochondria were isolated. The lipids were separated using sequential one-dimensional chromatography and the amounts of [14C]cholesterol and [14C]PC were quantified using BAS2500 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) as previously described (24Gong J.S. Kobayashi M. Hayashi H. Zou K. Sawamura N. Fujita S.C. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29919-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To measure lipid efflux from mitochondria and cells, cultured astrocytes were labeled for 5 days with 14C-labeled HDL. Five days following the commencement of labeling, the cells were rinsed in DMEM three times and incubated in DMEM. The cells were then harvested at 0, 2, and 4 h, and mitochondria were isolated from each culture. The amounts of [14C]cholesterol and [14C]PC remaining in the mitochondria and cells were determined as described above. Lipid Analysis—The concentration of cholesterol was determined using a cholesterol determination kit, LTCII (Kyowa Medex, Tokyo), whereas the concentration of phospholipids was determined using a phospholipid determination kit, PLB (Wako, Osaka, Japan), as previously described (24Gong J.S. Kobayashi M. Hayashi H. Zou K. Sawamura N. Fujita S.C. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29919-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Stat-View computer software, and multiple pairwise comparisons among groups of data were performed using the analysis of variance, and the Bonferroni t test. The Morphology and Membrane Potential of Mitochondria in Neurons and Astrocytes Isolated from Mouse Brains—The morphology and function of mitochondria were examined in NPC1+/+, NPC1+/-, and NPC1-/- mouse brains, and cultured cells prepared from cerebral cortices using electron and confocal microscopy. The examination of NPC1+/+ and NPC1-/- mouse brains using electron microscopy revealed that NPC1-/- mouse brains contained smaller and more rounded mitochondria, with a translucent matrix and irregular cisternae (Fig. 1, a and b). Next, the membrane potential of mitochondrial membrane within cultured neurons and astrocytes was determined using Mitotracker JC-1 (30Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). When mitochondrial membrane potential is normally polarized, JC-1 concentrates in the mitochondria and aggregates, resulting in a high red/green fluorescence intensity ratio. However, with decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, there is less aggregation of Mitotracker JC-1, therefore resulting in decreased red/green fluorescence intensity ratio. The results indicated a marked decrease in red fluorescence intensity in NPC1-/- neurons (Fig. 1e) compared with NPC1+/+ (Fig. 1c) and NPC1+/- neurons (Fig. 1d). In contrast, there was a marked increase in green fluorescence intensity observed in NPC1-/- neurons (Fig. 1"
https://openalex.org/W1971805318,"γ-Aminobutyric acidA receptor-interacting factor (GRIF-1) is a 913-amino acid protein proposed to function as a GABAA receptor β2 subunit-interacting, trafficking protein. GRIF-1 shares ∼44% amino acid sequence identity with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase interacting protein 106, OIP106. Both proteins contain predicted coiled-coil domains and probably constitute a novel gene family. The Drosophila orthologue of this family of proteins may be Milton. Milton shares ∼44% amino acid homology with GRIF-1. Milton is proposed to function in kinesin-mediated transport of mitochondria to nerve terminals. We report here that GRIF-1 and OIP106 also associate with kinesin and mitochondria. Following expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, both GRIF-1 and OIP106 were shown by co-immunoprecipitation to be specifically associated with an endogenous kinesin heavy chain species of 115 kDa and exogenous KIF5C. Association of GRIF-1 with kinesin was also evident in native brain and heart tissue. In the brain, anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) antibodies specifically co-immunoprecipitated two kinesin-immunoreactive species with molecular masses of 118 and 115 kDa, and in the heart, one kinesin-immunoreactive species, 115 kDa, was immunoprecipitated. Further studies revealed that GRIF-1 was predominantly associated with KIF5A in the brain and with KIF5B in both the heart and in HEK 293 cells. Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays and immunoprecipitations showed that GRIF-1 associated directly with KIF5C with the GRIF-1/KIF5C interaction domain localized to GRIF-1-(124–283). These results further support a role for GRIF-1 and OIP106 in protein and/or organelle transport in excitable cells in a manner analogous to glutamate receptor-interacting-protein 1, in the motor-dependent transport of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate glutamate excitatory neurotransmitter receptors to dendrites. γ-Aminobutyric acidA receptor-interacting factor (GRIF-1) is a 913-amino acid protein proposed to function as a GABAA receptor β2 subunit-interacting, trafficking protein.

GRIF-1 was also recently identified as a protein that interacts with the enzyme uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase or O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) (2Iyer S.P.N. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 3Iyer S.P.N. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24608-24616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). OGT catalyzes the post-translational modification of proteins by β-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the cell cytoplasm. GRIF-1 thus has the alternative name OGT-interacting protein 98 (OIP98). GRIF-1 (OIP98) shares ∼44% amino acid sequence identity over the full-length sequence with the human protein, OIP106, also known as KIAA1042 (4Kikuno R. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). OIP106 was also shown to associate with OGT, suggesting that GRIF-1 (OIP98) and OIP106 form a new gene family (1Beck M. Brickley K. Wilkinson H. Sharma S. Smith M. Chazot P.L. Pollard S.

Yoshiko Y. Skaug J. Fichter K. Nasir J. Martindale D. Koop B.F. Scherer S.W. Nicholson D.W. Rouleau G.A. Ikeda J-E. Hayden M.R. Genomics. 2001; 71: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a protein of unknown function. The Drosophila orthologue is probably Milton (6Stowers R.S. Megeath L.J. Gorska-Andrzejak J. Meinertzhagen I.A. Schwarz T.L. Neuron. 2002; 36: 1063-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Milton shares ∼44% amino acid homology with GRIF-1 (OIP98). Milton, like GRIF-1, is enriched in neuronal tissue. It was identified originally by a genetic screen of Drosophila mutations, searching for effects on the cell biology of the axon and synaptic terminals. Milton is a mitochondria-associated protein (6Stowers R.S. Megeath L.J. Gorska-Andrzejak J. Meinertzhagen I.A. Schwarz T.L.

Neurol. 2003; 463: 372-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The microtubule-based motor protein, kinesin, was found to be co-immunoprecipitated with Milton from extracts of fly heads, thus suggesting that it is required for the kinesin-mediated transport of mitochondria to nerve terminals. Here we report that GRIF-1 (OIP98) and OIP106 also coassociate with kinesin and mitochondria, thus demonstrating that Milton, GRIF-1, and OIP106 are indeed species orthologues, further supporting a role for GRIF-1 in protein and/or organelle transport in excitable cells. Constructs and Antibodies—pCISGRIF-1, pGADT7GRIF-1-(1–913), pGAD10GRIF-1-(8–633), and pGADT7GRIF-1-(124–283), pMBL33GABAA receptor β2 intracellular loop (residues 303–427), and affinity-purified anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) antibodies were as previously described (1Beck M.

Nagase (Kazusa Research Institute, Chiba, Japan). Each insert was excised by restriction enzyme digestion and used as template DNA for PCR amplification and cloning into pCRII TOPO (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Specific oligonucleotide primers incorporating the restriction sites for EcoRI and BamHI were used to amplify OIP106, and primers containing the restriction sites EcoRI and SalI were used to amplify KIF5C. The full-length OIP106 and KIF5C clones were subcloned from the respective pCRII TOPO constructs in frame into the modified (m) LexA vectors pGADT7 and pMBL33 to generate the fusion constructs pGADT7OIP106-(1–953) and pMBL33KIF5C-(1–957). Full-length OIP106 was also subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pCIS, to generate pCISOIP106 and into pCMVTag4a engineered to include an N-terminal c-Myc tag; KIF5C was subcloned into pcDNAHisMax (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNAHisMaxKIF5C. GRIF-1-(283–913) and OIP106-(124–283) were obtained by PCR amplification using pGADT7GRIF-1 and pGADT7OIP106 as templates, respectively, and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites of the pGADT7 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to generate pGADT7GRIF-1-(283–913) and pGADT7OIP106-(124–283). GRIF-1-(283–913), GRIF-1-(124–283), and OIP106-(124–283) were obtained by PCR amplification using pGADT7GRIF-1 and pGADT7OIP106 as templates, respectively, and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites of a modified pCMV4a plasmid to generate pCMVGRIF-1-(283–913), pCMVGRIF-1-(124–283), and pCMVOIP106-(124–283), where each protein was N-terminally c-Myc-tagged. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyser. Further, for all constructs used in yeast two-hybrid interaction assays, the expression of fusion proteins was verified by immunoblotting (data not shown). The peptide CNSGGSLLGGLRRNQSL that corresponds to GRIF-1-(874–889) with an N-terminal cysteine was coupled to thyroglobulin via the cysteine residue, and both rabbit and sheep anti-GRIF-1-(874–889) polyclonal antibodies were generated as described (8Stephenson F.A.

Mammalian Cell Transfection and Preparation of Detergent-solubilized Extract of Transfected Cells—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transfected with either pCISGRIF-1 or pCISOIP106 alone using the calcium phosphate method with a total of 5 μg of DNA or with pCISGRIF-1/pcDNAHisMaxKIF5C, pCISOIP106/pcDNAHisMaxKIF5C, or related deletion construct combinations using 1:1 ratios with a total of 10 μg of DNA.

Immunochemical Analyses of Mammalian Cells Transfected with pCISGRIF-1, pCISOIP106, and pCMVtag1milton—For immunocytochemical studies, HEK 293 cells were transfected with either pCISGRIF-1, pCISOIP106, or pCMVtag1milton as described previously (1Beck M.

Transfected cells were cultured for 20 h, cell culture media were removed, and cells were rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution at 37 °C.

Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% (v/v) goat serum, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) dl -lysine in TBS and incubated with transfected cells overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with TBS for 5 min each at 20 °C and then incubated with a 1:180 dilution of secondary antibody, either goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 or goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 50 min at 20 °C. Coverslips were washed with 5× TBS for 5 min at 20 °C, mounted in Citifluor (Citifluor Ltd., London, UK), and viewed with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope. Preparation of Detergent-solubilized Extracts of Rat Tissues—Forebrain, heart, and liver were dissected from adult rats and processed immediately. Forebrain was homogenized using a Wheaton/Dounce glass/glass homogenizer in ∼40 ml (∼20 volumes) of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 145 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, benzamidine (1 μg/ml), bacitracin (1 μg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), chicken egg trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 60 min at 4 °C. Liver was minced using scissors and then homogenized as above; heart tissue was also minced and then homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax (three 10-s pulses at medium speed) prior to detergent solubilization as before. Soluble extracts were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C at 100,000 × g, and immunoprecipitation assays were carried out. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as previously described using 25–50 μg of protein/sample precipitated using the chloroform/methanol method and SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions in 7.5 or 12% polyacrylamide slab minigels (1Beck M. Brickley K. Wilkinson H. Sharma S. Smith M. Chazot P.L. Pollard S. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30079-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Rabbit and mouse horseradish-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a final dilution of 1:2000, and immunoreactivities were detected using the ECL Western blotting system. Immunoprecipitation Assays—Detergent-solubilized extracts of either transfected HEK 293 cells (diluted to 1 mg of protein/ml with a final Triton X-100 concentration of 0.5% (v/v); 20 ml) or rat forebrain, heart, and liver (diluted to 2 mg of protein/ml with a final Triton X-100 concentration of 0.5% (v/v); 10 ml) were incubated for polyclonal antibodies with either affinity-purified anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) antibodies (10 μg) or protein A-purified nonimmune IgG (10 μg of protein) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (20 μl) was added, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. For monoclonal antibody immunoprecipitations, the primary antibody used was anti-His G (5 μg), and the control was anti-dynein (5 μg) with an incubation overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (20 μl) was added, and the samples were treated as for immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies. For both polyclonal and monoclonal immunoprecipitations, pellets were collected by centrifugation for 3 s at 2500 × g and washed with 3 × 1.5 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 145 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, benzamidine (1 μg/ml), bacitracin (1 μg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), chicken egg trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then analyzed by immunoblotting. Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assays—Yeast two-hybrid assays were carried out using a modified LexA system that uses a modified bait vector, pMBL33, and the fish vector is pGADT7. 2M. Beck, L. Demmel, A.-L. Schlaitz, P. Hsu, J. Havlis, A. Shevchenko, E. Krause, and C. Walch-Solimena, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the bait vector, pMBL33, was constructed as follows. The LexA/NLS sequence was amplified from plasmid, pEG202NLS, (DuplexA System, OriGene Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD) using primers ADH_prom (CACCATATCCGCAATGACAA) and ADH_term (GAGCGACCTCATGCTATACC) and the following profile: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 10 s; final extension at 72 °C for 5 min; and, finally, cooling of the reaction to 4 °C. The product size was 1221 bp. The PCR product (2 μl) and pGBKT7 (linearized with XhoI, NotI, and EcoRI; 1 μl) were transformed into competent AH109 cells (25 μl; BD Biosciences, Clontech). From 10 individual 5-ml cultures, DNA was prepared by lyticase digest, followed by minipreparation of plasmid DNA. Isolated yeast DNA was screened by PCR (primer ADH_plus and ADH_minus) and digested with BclI (expected 797 and 424 bp) and EcoRV (expected 742 and 479 bp). Positive DNA was transformed into competent DH5α Escherichia coli, prepared and sequenced by standard methods. Yeast cultures were grown on standard solid or in liquid media using either YPAD (yeast, peptone, adenine, dextrose; 2% (w/v) peptone, 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.003% (w/v) adenine) or SD (synthetic defined medium; 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base (BD Biosciences), 2% (w/v) glucose, 1× dropout supplement (Clontech)) as appropriate for the selection involved. All transformations were performed using the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method (10Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisae strain L40 (MATa his3Δ200 trp1-901 leu2-3112 ade2 LYS2:: (4lexAop-HIS3) URA3:: (8lexAop-lacZ) GAL4) was used. Resulting colonies were assessed for reporter gene activation by initial nutritional selection (growth on SD–His) and subsequent lacZ activity assay. lacZ activity was determined by filter lift analysis including appropriate positive and negative interaction controls. Preparation of Yeast Lysates—Yeast L40 lysates were prepared according to the Yeast Protocols Handbook (Clontech). Briefly, for each transformed yeast strain to be assayed, a 5-ml culture using a single colony dispersed in SD medium was incubated overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 220–250 rpm. Each overnight 5-ml culture was used to inoculate a 50-ml aliquot of YPAD, and cultures were incubated at 30 °C with shaking until the A600 reached 0.4–0.6. Each culture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold H2O and recentrifuged as above. Pellets were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Pellets were thawed and resuspended in complete cracking buffer, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 9 mm benzamidine, 44 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 8.8% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 6 μg/ml pepstatin A, 13 μg/ml leupeptin, 23 μg/ml aprotinin (100 μl per 7.5 A600 units). Cell suspensions were incubated with 425–600-μm glass beads, heated at 70 °C for 10 min, and mixed vigorously for 1 min, and supernatants were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C at 15,000 × g for 5 min and analyzed by immunoblotting. All fusion constructs yielded robust expression. Anti-GRIF-1 Antibody Specificities—GRIF-1 and OIP106 have 42% amino acid identity overall but 52% identity over the sequence GRIF-1-(8–633) that was used for the production of anti-GRIF-1 antibodies. It is thus probable, as suggested by Iyer et al. (2Iyer S.P.N. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), that anti-GRIF-1 antibodies recognize both GRIF-1 and OIP106. Indeed, when each was expressed alone in HEK 293 cells, anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) antibodies recognized three molecular mass species of 115, 106, and 98 kDa as reported previously for GRIF-1-transfected cells (1Beck M. Brickley K. Wilkinson H. Sharma S. Smith M. Chazot P.L. Pollard S. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30079-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and two molecular mass species of 170 and 115 kDa for OIP106-transfected cells (Fig. 1). OIP106 is a polypeptide consisting of 953 amino acids; therefore, the 115-kDa species is the monomeric protein, and the molecular size concurs with that reported by Iyer et al. (2Iyer S.P.N. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) for OIP106 (i.e. 106 kDa). Because of the observed antibody cross-reactivity, a second, different specificity anti-GRIF-1 antibody was raised. This antibody was directed against the sequence GRIF-1-(874–889) that shares no amino acid sequence homology with OIP106. Anti-GRIF-1-(874–889) antibodies did not recognize OIP106 when expressed alone in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1). Further, in adult rat forebrain, anti-GRIF-1-(874–889) antibodies recognized a single band of 115 kDa. This corresponds to the molecular mass of the major band detected by anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) antibodies and demonstrates clearly that GRIF-1 is indeed expressed in brain tissue. The lower molecular weight species not recognized by anti-GRIF-1-(874–889) antibodies may be proteolytic fragments of OIP106. Alternatively, GRIF-1 is known to be expressed as three splice forms. One splice variant is truncated at the C terminus and does not contain the GRIF-1-(874–889) epitope (1Beck M. Brickley K. Wilkinson H. Sharma S. Smith M. Chazot P.L. Pollard S. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30079-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The lower molecular weight species may thus correspond to this splice variant detected by anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) but not anti-GRIF-1-(874–889) antibodies (1Beck M. Brickley K. Wilkinson H. Sharma S. Smith M. Chazot P.L. Pollard S. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30079-30090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). GRIF-1 and OIP106 Both Co-associate with Endogenous Kinesin in Heterologous Expression Systems and in the Brain— Affinity-purified anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) antibodies successfully immunoprecipitated both GRIF-1 and OIP106 from detergent extracts of HEK 293 cells transfected separately with each of the individual respective clones (Fig. 2). Since Milton was found to co-immunoprecipitate with kinesin, it was of interest to determine whether such an association occurred in mammalian systems. In Fig. 2, it can be seen that indeed, using a broad spectrum anti-kinesin heavy chain antibody, kinesin immunoreactivity, 115 kDa, was found in immune pellets resulting from precipitation with anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) antibodies for both GRIF-1- and OIP106-transfected cells. No anti-kinesin immunoreactivity was detected in control immunoprecipitations where the primary antibody was nonimmune Ig (Fig. 2). Further specificity control experiments using yeast lysates expressing either GRIF-1 or KIF5C showed that anti-kinesin antibodies do not recognize GRIF-1 and vice versa (i.e. anti-GRIF-1 antibodies do not recognize kinesin) (Fig. 1). GRIF-1 and kinesin were also found to co-associate in native brain tissue. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) antibodies immunoprecipitated the three molecular weight species observed in the immunoblots. Probing with anti-GRIF-1-(874–889) confirmed that the Mr 115,000 immunoreactive band was indeed GRIF-1, and probing with anti-kinesin antibodies revealed the presence of kinesin in anti-GRIF-1-(8–633) but not control immune pellets. In the brain, two kinesin-immunoreactive bands of 118 and 115 kDa were detected (Fig. 3). An additional control using an anti-Kv1.2 potassium channel antibody showed no immunoreactivity in test and control immune pellets. Further, immune pellets from both the GRIF-1 HEK 293-transfected cells and the brain were also screened for reactivity with anti-β-actin, anti-β-tubulin, and anti-dynein antibodies. All antibodies yielded robust signals in detergent-solubilized extracts; however, no immunoreactivity was detected in the immune pellets for any of these three antibodies (results not shown). The Association between GRIF-1 and Kinesin is Direct: Demonstration and Specificity Using the Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assay—Association of two proteins by co-immunoprecipitation does not demonstrate definitively that two proteins interact directly, since they may co-associate via an intermediary adaptor protein molecule. Thus, to test whether GRIF-1 and OIP106 do associate directly with kinesin, yeast two-hybrid interaction assays were carried out. Kinesin is a member of the kinesin superfamily of proteins (i.e. the KIFs). In the human genome, there are 45 KIF members; 38 of these are expressed in the brain (11Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7004-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The anti-kinesin antibody employed initially in the immunoprecipitation studies was a monoclonal antibody, SUK4, which was raised against the 130-kDa kinesin heavy chain of sea urchin egg (12Ingold A.L. Cohn S.A. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2657-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This antibody was originally reported to cross-react with a 120-kDa heavy chain of bovine brain kinesin; hence its use in mammalian species (12Ingold A.L. Cohn S.A. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2657-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, more detailed information about the KIF subtype specificity of SUK4 is unfortunately unavailable. In the absence of this knowledge, KIF5C was selected for the yeast two-hybrid studies, since it is described as neuron-specific (11Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7004-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Also, the predicted size of KIF5C is similar to that of the kinesin-immunoreactive bands seen in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Figs. 2 and 3). The results of the yeast two-hybrid interaction assays are summarized in Table I.Table IGRIF-1 and the KIF protein, KIF5C, interact directly: Demonstration by yeast two-hybrid interaction assaysAD vectorDNA-BD vectorGrowth on -W, -L dropout mediumGrowth on -W, -L, -H dropout mediumβ-Galactosidase activitypGADT7GRIF-1-(1-913)pMBL33KIF5C-(1-957)++(+)(+)pGAD10GRIF-1-(8-633)pMBL33 KIF5C-(1-957)+++++pGADT7GRIF-1-(283-913)pMBL33 KIF5C-(1-957)++--pGADT7GRIF-1-(124-283)pMBL33 KIF5C-(1-957)+++++++pGADT7OIP106-(1-953)pMBL33 KIF5C-(1-957)++--pGADT7OIP106-(124-283)pMBL33 KIF5C-(1-957)++--pGADT7GRIF-1-(1-913)pMBL33++--pGAD10GRIF-1-(8-633)pMBL33++--pGADT7GRIF-1-(124-283)pMBL33++--pGADT7OIP106-(1-953)pMBL33++--pGADT7OIP106-(124-283)pMBL33++--pGADT7pMBL33 KIF5C-(1-957)++--pGADT7pMBL33++--pGAD10GRIF-1-(8-633)pMBL33 β2-IL+++++ Open table in a new tab Co-transformation of yeast with pGADT7GRIF-1-(1–913) with pMBL33KIF5C-(1–957) revealed a weak but significant interaction of the resulting two fusion proteins as determined by both nutritional selection on SD –W, –L, –H media and β-galactosidase reporter gene activity. The GRIF-1 truncated constructs, GRIF-1-(8–633) and GRIF-1-(124–283), were also found to interact with KIF5C, whereas GRIF-1-(283–913) did not interact. This therefore identifies the kinesin binding domain of GRIF-1 to within residues 124–283. This region coincides with the first coil of the predicted coiled-coil domain of GRIF-1. It was notable that the order for the strength of interaction between GRIF-1 and KIF5C was GRIF-1-(124–283) > GRIF-1-(8–633) > GRIF-1-(1–913). Co-transformation of either pGADT7OIP106-(1–953) or pGADT7OIP106-(124–283), a region that shares ∼60% amino acid identity and ∼80% amino acid similarity with GRIF-1-(124–283), did not result in colony growth on –3 SD –W, –L, –H media or β-galactosidase reporter gene activity despite robust expression detected by immunoblotting of the appropriate transformed yeast lysates. Co-association of GRIF-1 and OIP106 with KIF5C in Transfected HEK 293 Cells: Mapping of the KIF5C Binding Domain of GRIF-1—To confirm the yeast two-hybrid results, native GRIF-1, c-Myc-tagged GRIF-1-(283–913) (84 kDa), c-Myc-tagged GRIF-1-(124–283) (28 kDa), c-Myc-tagged OIP106, and c-Myc-tagged OIP106-(124–283) (32 kDa) were each co-expressed in HEK 293 cells with an N-terminal His-tagged KIF5C, and the association between the recombinant proteins was"

Tom40 is synthesized in the cytosol and contains information for its mitochondrial targeting and assembly. A number of stable import intermediates have been identified for Tom40 precursors in fungi, the first being an association with the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) of the outer membrane. By examining the import pathway of human Tom40, we have been able to elucidate additional features in its import. We identify that Hsp90 is involved in delivery of the Tom40 precursor to mitochondria in an ATP-dependent manner. The precursor then forms its first stable intermediate with the outer face of the TOM complex before its membrane integration and assembly. Deletion of an evolutionary conserved region within Tom40 disrupts the TOM complex intermediate and causes it to stall at a new complex in the intermembrane space that we identify to be the mammalian SAM. Unlike its fungal counterparts, the human Tom40 precursor is not found stably arrested at a SAM intermediate. Nevertheless, we show that Tom40 assembly is reduced in mitochondria depleted of human Sam50. These findings are discussed in context with current models from fungal studies.

Almost all mitochondrial proteins employ the TOM machinery for their import, since the vast majority are encoded by nuclear genes, synthesized in the cytosol, and subsequently trafficked into the organelle. Likewise, the TOM subunits must also be targeted to mitochondria and, following their integration into the membrane, are assembled into new TOM complexes. Whereas the import and assembly of individual TOM subunits has been studied in some detail, it seems that Tom40 follows a unique pathway for its biogenesis (17Rapaport D. Neupert W. J.

Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). How this complex is involved in the integration of Tom40 and other β-barrel proteins into the outer membrane is not yet known. Following its integration into the outer membrane, the Tom40 precursor binds small TOM subunits before its assembly into the TOM complex (28Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This final step requires recruitment of Tom22 via an interaction with Mdm10, which associates with the SAM complex (29Meisinger C. Rissler M. Chacinska A. Szklarz L.K. Milenkovic D. Kozjak V.

The steps before Tom40 associates with the SAM complex have not been well characterized due to the lack of detectable intermediates. However, it has been shown that Tom40 precursors require ATP for their initial targeting to mitochondria, suggesting that cytosolic chaperones may be involved (17Rapaport D. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Keil P. Weinzierl A. Kiebler M. Dietmeier K. Sollner T. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19177-19180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that Tom40 precursors initially interact with TOM receptors and also the TOM complex itself before being transferred to SAM. Integration of Tom40 into the outer membrane seems to occur via the intermembrane space (IMS) side (28Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 31Matouschek A. Glick B.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and this has recently been supported by studies showing that the IMS small Tim proteins facilitate this process (32Hoppins S.C.

J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the Tom40 precursor must first translocate across the outer membrane, presumably through pre-existing Tom40 channels. How the Tom40 precursor is directed to the mitochondrion and engages with members of the TOM and SAM machinery is not known. In order to address some of these questions, we investigated the biogenesis of human Tom40 (hTom40). We show that hTom40 is kept import-competent by the cytosolic chaperone Hsp90. In addition, we identify a stable association between hTom40 precursors and the TOM complex but not with the SAM complex. Deletion of an evolutionary conserved stretch of amino acids causes the precursor to bypass stable intermediate formation with the TOM complex, and instead it stalls at a complex of lower size that we show to be the human SAM complex. Cloning Procedures—The cDNA encoding human Tom40 (15Suzuki H. Okazawa Y. Komiya T. Saeki K. Mekada E. Kitada S. Ito A. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37930-37936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (accession number BC017224) was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (Medical Research Council, Cambridge, UK). The Tom40 open reading frame (ORF) was amplified by PCR and subsequently cloned into the vectors pGEM-4Z (Promega) and pCAGGS (34Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). For construction of a Tom40-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein, the human Tom40 ORF lacking its stop codon was cloned into the vector pE-GFP (Clontech) at EcoRI and BamHI sites and in-frame with the GFP coding region. A similar approach was employed for construction of a vector to encode GFP fused at the N terminus of Tom40. For construction of Tom40 N-terminal truncations, PCR of appropriate regions of the Tom40 ORF was performed followed by their ligation into pE-GFP. The cDNA encoding human Sam50 (accession number AAH11681) was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium. For creation of a hSam50-GFP fusion construct, the hSam50 ORF lacking its stop codon was cloned into the pE-GFP vector at SalI and NotI in frame with the GFP ORF. Similarly, for creation of a GFP-hSam50 fusion construct, the hSam50 ORF was amplified and cloned at BamHI and NotI into a modified form of the pE-GFP vector, to give in-frame C-terminal fusions to GFP. For creation of a hemagglutinin (HA)-hSam50 fusion, the hSam50 ORF was cloned at SalI and NotI of the pME-HA vector (35Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K.

For RNA interference studies, two complementary oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-GATCCGGTGATGACGCACTTCCAATTCAAGAGATTGGAAGTGCGTCATCACCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′; antisense, 5′-TTTCCAAAAAAGGTGATGACGCACTTCCAATCTCTTGAATTGGAAGTGCGTCATCACCGGATC-3′) were designed specifically for hSam50 depletion using pSilencer vectors according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion Inc.). The oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into pSilencer 3.0-H1 at BamHI and HindIII sites. A control plasmid containing a scrambled sequence (36Stojanovski D. Koutsopoulos O.S. Okamoto K.

Cell Culture and Transfection—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells growing on coverslips in 2-cm wells or in 9-cm plates were transfected with2or10 μg of plasmid DNA respectively, using Lipofectamine 2000, according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For microscopic analysis, cells were incubated with 80 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min before mounting coverslips onto glass slides. For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde, washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and incubated with appropriate antibodies (36Stojanovski D. Koutsopoulos O.S. Okamoto K. Ryan M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized using an Olympus BX-50 fluorescence microscope with a ×100 oil immersion objective. Images were captured with a SPOT RT 3CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments) and processed using SPOT Advanced software (Version 3.4). In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Plasmid DNA or PCR products (40Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 189-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). In vitro translation of the RNA transcripts using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine (TRANS-Label; ICN Biomedicals) was performed as previously described (40Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 189-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, hTom40 was in vitro transcribed/translated using a coupled system (Promega). In Vitro Import and Assembly Assays—Mitochondria were isolated from tissue culture cells (HEK 293T, HT1080, or HeLa) grown as monolayers according to Ref. 16Johnston A.J. Hoogenraad J. Dougan D.A.

For in vitro protein import studies, 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with isolated mitochondria at 20 or 37 °C for various times as indicated in the figures. Samples were subjected to various treatments as previously described (40Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 189-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BN-PAGE was performed according to Simpson et al. (41Simpson R.J. Proteins and Proteomics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2003Google Scholar). All mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in digitonin-containing buffer (1% (w/v) digitonin, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.0). BN-PAGE antibody shift assays were undertaken as previously described (16Johnston A.J. Hoogenraad J. Dougan D.A. Truscott K.N. Yano M. Mori M. Hoogenraad N.J. Ryan M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42197-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Inhibition Assays with C-90 and C-Bag Proteins—Plasmids coding for the hexahistidine-tagged C-terminal domain of Hsp90 (C-90) and the C-terminal domain of Bag-1 (C-Bag) were obtained from Jason Young (Munich) (42Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Purification of hexahistidine-tagged recombinant proteins was carried out using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose under native conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Purified proteins were subsequently dialyzed in import buffer minus sucrose (5 mm MgOAc, 80 mm KOAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ADP, 10 mm sodium succinate, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4). Inhibition assays were performed according to Young et al. (42Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Inhibitory recombinant protein (C-90 or C-Bag) or control bovine serum albumin (20 μm final concentration) was added to [35S]hTom40 in 150 μl of import buffer in the presence of 2.5 mm ATP. After preincubation at 37 °C for 5 min, mitochondria were added and incubated for various times. After import, mitochondria were reisolated, washed, and solubilized in 1% (w/v) digitonin buffer and subjected to BN-PAGE (40Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 189-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies—Antibodies specific for Tom20 and Tom22 were raised in rabbits (38Yano M. Hoogenraad N. Terada K. Mori M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7205-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Antibodies to hTom40 and hSam50 were raised against hexahistidine-tagged recombinant protein, expressed in E. coli and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography under denaturing conditions. Antigens were precipitated by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline and injected into rabbits using Freund's complete adjuvant and (for subsequent boosts) Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Antibodies against cytochrome c were purchased from BD Biosciences. Miscellaneous—Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE was performed as previously described (43Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled preproteins were detected using PhosphorImage storage technology and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Western blotting was performed using a semidry transfer method (44Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins from blots were detected using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Images were obtained using a ChemiGenius chemiluminescence detection system (SynGene). The hTom40 topology prediction was performed based on a hidden Markov method using the program PRED-TMBB (available on the World Wide Web at bioinformatics2.biol.uoa.gr/PRED-TMBB/input.jsp) (45Bagos P.G. Liakopoulos T.D. Spyropoulos I.C. Hamodrakas S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). hTom40 Assembly Intermediates—In order to analyze the assembly pattern of hTom40, we incubated in vitro translated [35S]hTom40 with mitochondria isolated from cultured human osteosarcoma (HT1080) cells for varying times at 37 °C, and complexes were subjected to BN-PAGE analysis. As can be seen (Fig. 1A), [35S]hTom40 assembled into a number of resolvable complexes in a time-dependent manner. At short incubations, hTom40 precursors were found in a ∼500-kDa complex (termed “I”; lanes 1 and 2), whereas after longer incubations, they assemble in a smaller ∼100-kDa complex (II) before finally accumulating in a ∼380-kDa complex (lane 4). The latter complex is identical in size to the mature TOM complex as verified by immunodecoration with anti-Tom40 and anti-Tom22 antibodies (lanes 5 and 6). In some cases, hTom40 precursors were also found in a poorly resolved, high molecular weight species. Since Western blot analysis shows that pre-existing Tom40 molecules are found in a single resolvable TOM complex at ∼380 kDa (lane 5), the other complexes observed during the import of Tom40 precursors most likely represent kinetically trapped assembly intermediates (28Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that [35S]hTom40 could be arrested specifically at the 500-kDa intermediate I complex after incubating with mitochondria for 4 min at 30 °C (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 7). After performing a chase at 20 °C, the radiolabel in the 500-kDa complex was reduced in intensity, accompanied by some increase in the intensity of complex II. In contrast, performing the chase at 37 °C resulted in a loss in intensity of the 500-kDa species with the corresponding assembly of Tom40 precursors into complex II and, more strongly, into the mature TOM complex (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–12). The profile of hTom40 assembly was verified in mitochondria isolated from other tissue culture cell lines (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that in human cells, Tom40 precursors first assemble into a 500-kDa intermediate before their maturation into the TOM complex via a 100-kDa intermediate. In contrast, in yeast, Tom40 precursors first stably associate with a protease-resistant SAM complex of ∼250 kDa, followed by its membrane insertion into a 100-kDa complex before its final assembly into the TOM complex (17Rapaport D. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The assembly pattern found for hTom40 resembles that of its yeast counterpart except that the size of the initial assembly intermediate I is significantly larger. Whereas this size difference is puzzling, it has been suggested that the SAM complex in yeast observed by BN-PAGE is the core complex, since additional SAM subunits may dissociate from the complex following membrane solubilization (29Meisinger C. Rissler M. Chacinska A. Szklarz L.K. Milenkovic D. Kozjak V. Schonfisch B. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Yaffe M.P. Guiard B. Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, the first assembly intermediate seen for hTom40 precursors might be an association with a more stable SAM complex present in human mitochondria. However, unlike the SAM-arrested Tom40 seen in yeast, the hTom40 precursor arrested at assembly intermediate I was accessible to externally added protease (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, when hTom40 was imported for longer times and assembled into the TOM complex, it was largely resistant to the addition of external protease, with the reduction in size of the complex corresponding to the shaving of the cytosolic domain of Tom22 (16Johnston A.J. Hoogenraad J. Dougan D.A. Truscott K.N. Yano M. Mori M. Hoogenraad N.J. Ryan M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42197-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 38Yano M. Hoogenraad N. Terada K. Mori M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7205-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The intermediate complex I might therefore represent the hTom40 precursor associated with the TOM complex. Tom40 has been shown to require TOM receptors for its initial recognition at the mitochondrial surface (15Suzuki H. Okazawa Y. Komiya T. Saeki K. Mekada E. Kitada S. Ito A. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37930-37936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Keil P. Weinzierl A. Kiebler M. Dietmeier K. Sollner T. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19177-19180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and indirect studies have suggested that yeast Tom40 precursors interact with the TOM channel before being passed on to the SAM complex (19Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W. Nature. 2003; 426: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 20Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Chacinska A. Schonfisch B. Rospert S. Ryan M.T. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Up to now, however, a stable interaction between native Tom40 precursors and the TOM complex has not been shown. Standard Western blot analysis does not detect a larger TOM complex, since the radiolabeled hTom40 precursor is present in only very small amounts (data not shown). We therefore employed a different technique, antibody shift analysis (Fig. 1D) (16Johnston A.J. Hoogenraad J. Dougan D.A. Truscott K.N. Yano M. Mori M. Hoogenraad N.J. Ryan M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42197-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 46Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Rehling P. Muller H. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Guiard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7780-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As can be seen, the intermediate complex is shifted with antibodies against Tom40 as expected. Antibodies to Tom22 also shifted the complex, indicating that this protein is present in the 500-kDa complex with hTom40 precursors. Antibodies specific for cytosolic Hsp70 (Hsc70), the abundant outer membrane protein VDAC, or preimmune serum did not shift the Tom40-containing intermediate. Antibodies to the receptors Tom20 and Tom70 also did not shift the complex, although these proteins do not remain with the TOM complex during the conditions used for BN-PAGE (16Johnston A.J. Hoogenraad J. Dougan D.A. Truscott K.N. Yano M. Mori M. Hoogenraad N.J. Ryan M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42197-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that the 500-kDa assembly intermediate represents hTom40 precursors stably arrested at the cytosolic face of the TOM machinery. Human Tom40 Precursors Require Hsp90 for Import—Yeast Tom40 translated from reticulocyte lysate has been shown to require ATP for its import (17Rapaport D. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 47Keil P. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that, at least in this in vitro system, mammalian chaperones are required. We sought to address the role of this ATP requirement using entirely mammalian components in an in vitro import. Following translation of hTom40, ATP was depleted from the lysate using the ATP-diphosphatase, apyrase, and added to mitochondria also depleted of ATP. A time course of import and assembly (Fig. 2A) showed that in the absence of ATP, hTom40 precursors accumulated at the high molecular weight position and did not form a stable 500-kDa intermediate. After 30 min of incubation, however, the hTom40 precursor assembled into the TOM complex but to a lesser extent than in the presence of ATP. The high molecular weight complex (labeled with an asterisk) resembles that of the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) precursor,"
https://openalex.org/W2084259901,"The Ca2+- and arachidonic acid-binding S100A8/A9 protein complex was recently identified by in vitro studies as a novel partner of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The present study demonstrated its functional relevance by the impaired oxidase activity in neutrophil-like NB4 cells, after specific blockage of S100A9 expression, and bone marrow polymorphonuclear neutrophils from S100A9-/- mice. The impaired oxidase activation could also be mimicked in a cell-free system by pretreatment of neutrophil cytosol with an S100A9-specific antibody. Further analyses gave insights into the molecular mechanisms by which S100A8/A9 promoted NADPH oxidase activation. In vitro analysis of oxidase activation as well as protein-protein interaction studies revealed that S100A8 is the privileged interaction partner for the NADPH oxidase complex since it bound to p67phox and Rac, whereas S100A9 did interact with neither p67phox nor p47phox. Moreover, S100A8/A9 transferred the cofactor arachidonic acid to NADPH oxidase as shown by the impotence of a mutant S100A8/A9 complex unable to bind arachidonic acid to enhance NADPH oxidase activity. It is concluded that S100A8/A9 plays an important role in phagocyte NADPH oxidase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1982491218,"The accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids results in cholestatic liver injury by increasing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of cell signaling pathways. Licorice root and its constituents have been utilized as antihepatotoxic agents. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential modulation by a primary component of licorice root, glycyrrhizin (GL), and its metabolite, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), in a hepatocyte model of cholestatic liver injury. Preincubation of fresh rat hepatocyte suspensions with GL or GA reduced glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDC)-dependent reactive oxygen species generation, with GA more potent than GL. Interestingly, GL and GA had opposing effects toward GCDC-induced cytotoxicity; GA prevented both necrosis and apoptosis, whereas GL enhanced apoptosis. GCDC promoted activation of caspase 10, caspase 3, and PARP; all were inhibited by GA but not GL. Induction of apoptosis by GCDC was also associated with activation of JNK, which was prevented by GA. Activation of caspase 9 and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential were prevented by GA but not GL. In liver mitochondrial studies, GL and GA were both potent inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition, reactive oxygen species generation, and cytochrome <i>c</i> release at submicromolar concentrations. Results from this study suggest that GL exhibits pro-apoptotic properties, whereas GA is a potent inhibitor of bile acid-induced apoptosis and necrosis in a manner consistent with its antioxidative effect."

Many eukaryotic proteins with nonconsecutive disulfide bonds expressed in E. coli require an additional protein for proper folding, the disulfide bond isomerase DsbC.

We show that AppA requires DsbC for its folding. However, the activity of an AppA mutant lacking its nonconsecutive disulfide bond is DsbC-independent. An AppA homolog, Agp, a periplasmic acid phosphatase with similar structure, lacks the nonconsecutive disulfide bond but has the three consecutive disulfide bonds found in AppA. The consecutively disulfide-bonded Agp is not dependent on DsbC but is rendered dependent by engineering into it the conserved nonconsecutive disulfide bond of AppA.

Although these results indicated that the information necessary for the proper folding of proteins was intrinsic to the amino acid sequence, the rate of disulfide bond formation in these experiments was much slower than the rates observed in living cells, and the yield of active enzyme was low. The low yields of properly folded enzyme were attributed to the formation of incorrect disulfide bonds in many of the assembled protein molecules. Thus, the in vitro studies, although remarkably successful, were unable to come close to replicating the rapid kinetics and the accuracy of in vivo disulfide bond formation. To explain this inaccuracy observed in biochemical experiments, Anfinsen and co-workers (1Anfinsen C.B. Haber E. Sela M. White Jr., F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1309-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) posited the existence in cells of an enzyme, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), 1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ORF, open reading frame. which would increase the yields of active enzyme by correcting incorrectly formed disulfide bonds. Such an enzymatic activity was discovered in beef liver cells (2De Lorenzo F. Goldberger R.F. Steers Jr., E. Givol D. Anfinsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1562-1567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The explanation for the slow in vitro rates was resolved much later with the discovery that in vivo an enzyme is required to catalyze the efficient formation of protein disulfide bonds (3Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 4Kamitani S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Peek J.A. Taylor R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6210-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) was originally detected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotes as an enzyme that catalyzes disulfide bond isomerization in vitro, its in vivo role is still unclear. PDI is required for the formation of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (6Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 7Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether PDI carries out both oxidation and isomerization reactions in the ER or whether the latter reaction might be performed by other ER proteins. In Gram-negative bacteria, the enzyme catalyst of disulfide bond formation is the protein, DsbA, which is located in the periplasmic space of bacteria (3Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 4Kamitani S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Peek J.A. Taylor R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6210-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A separate protein, DsbC, carries out protein disulfide bond isomerization (8Shevchik V.E. Condemine G. Robert-Baudouy J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). DsbC is a “Y”-shaped homodimer with two disulfide bonds in each 20-kDa monomer (10McCarthy A.A. Haebel P.W. Torronen A. Rybin V. Baker E.N. Metcalf P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The C-terminal disulfide bond (Cys140-Cys163) is required for folding and stability of DsbC, whereas the N-terminal redox active cysteines (Cys98-Cys101) are required for the isomerase activity and are maintained in a reduced form by the inner membrane protein DsbD (11Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It appears that cysteine 98 attacks incorrect disulfide bonds in misfolded substrates, and the resultant mixed disulfide between enzyme and substrate is resolved by cysteine 101 (11Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The pairs of N-terminal cysteines (Cys98-Cys101) of the dimeric DsbC face each other in a hydrophobic cleft formed by the two arms of the Y shape. Because misoxidized substrates of DsbC are likely to be misfolded with core hydrophobic residues surface-exposed, the hydrophobic cleft of DsbC might mediate the interaction between the misfolded substrate protein and cysteines 98-101. Furthermore, DsbC possesses chaperone activity that is independent of cysteines 98 and 101 (12Chen J. Song J.L. Zhang S. Wang Y. Cui D.F. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19601-19605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Joly and Swartz (38Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) reported that dependence on DsbC for proper folding shows an interesting pattern among eukaryotic proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. The proteins that did not require DsbC contained disulfide bonds that were formed between cysteines found in consecutive positions in the proteins. In contrast, the DsbC-dependent proteins contained nonconsecutive disulfide bonds, i.e. the latter class of proteins contain a disulfide bond between two cysteines that have between them in the amino acid sequence another cysteine or cysteines that is involved in a disulfide bond (see e.g. the disulfide bond between cysteines 155 and 430 in Fig. 1). Until recently, all the substrates used to study the isomerase activity of DsbC have been eukaryotic in origin. The reason that only eukaryotic proteins expressed in E. coli were employed in studies on DsbC function is that very few of the known proteins of the bacteria contained multiple disulfide bonds. Recently, Hiniker and Bardwell (13Hiniker A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12967-12973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have identified the E. coli periplasmic proteins RNase I and MepA as proteins whose stability is lessened or eliminated in mutants lacking DsbC. In this work, we use a bio-informatics approach to identify as a potential substrate of DsbC the E. coli periplasmic protein phytase (AppA). This protein was chosen because it contains four disulfide bonds, one of which involves a pair of cysteines located nonconsecutively in the amino acid sequence. By using mutant analysis of AppA and genetic engineering of an AppA homolog, Agp, we present evidence supporting the proposal that disulfide bond connectivity plays a critical role in making a protein DsbC-dependent. We discuss the implications of such a finding for the timing of disulfide bond formation during protein translocation. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Strains and plasmids were constructed using standard molecular and genetic techniques (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Plasmid-encoded variants of AppA and Agp were induced with 0.2% arabinose.Table IStrains and plasmids used in this studyStrains or plasmidsRelevant genotype or featuresSource or Ref.StrainsDHB4araD139, Δ(ara-leu)7697, Δ(codB-lac)X74, galE15, galK16, rpsL150, relA1, thi, ΔphoA (PvuII), phoR, ΔmalF3, F′ [lac+(lacI) pro], StrR11Rietsch A.

Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar). The appA ORF was amplified by PCR from a colony of DHB4 using the primer pair 5-RI-appA (5′-CCGGAATTCATATGAAAAGCGGAAACATA-3′) and 3-Xba-appA (5′-CTAGTCTAGATTACAAACTGCACGCCGGTAT-3′), whereas the agp ORF was amplified by using the primer pair 5-RI-agp (5′-CCGGAATTCGATAACAAAAAGGTGCCAGG-3′) and 3-Xba-agp (5′-CTAGTCTAGATTATTTCACCGCTTCATTCAACA-3′). The resulting fragments were digested with EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into EcoRI- and XbaI-digested pBAD18. To construct plasmids expressing appA with the indicated cysteine residues mutated to serine or alanine, we utilized the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as directed by the manufacturer. In order to construct Agp containing the nonconsecutive Cys155-Cys430 disulfide present in AppA, agp ORF from pBAD18-agp was amplified by PCR using the primer pair agp430-rev (5′-CTAGTCTAGATTACAAACTGCACGCCGGTATGCGCGCTTCATTCAACACGCTATCAAAC-3′) and BAD-fwd (5′-GACGCTTTTTATCGCAACTCTCTACTGT-3′). The resulting fragments were digested with EcoRI and XbaI, cloned into EcoRI- and XbaI-digested pBAD18, and named pAgp430. This construct replaced the C-terminal Val412-Lys413 amino acids from Agp with the C-terminal Arg-Ile-Pro-Ala-Cys430-Ser-Leu fragment from AppA, containing one of the nonconsecutive cysteines Cys430. A second construct of agp containing the other nonconsecutive cysteine from AppA was constructed by PCR amplifying agp ORF from pBAD18-agp using the primer pair agp155-fwd2 (5′-TCACCGGTACCGGCGTTTGCCAACTGGATTCCGCCGCATTCAGTGAACAGGCGGTGGCGG-3′) and agp155-rev2 (5′-ACGCCGGTACCGGTGATCACCGGGTTAAAGGTTGGGTCCATAGTGCCC-3′). The resulting fragment was digested with KpnI, ligated, and named pAgp155. This construct replaced Asp155 from Agp with the peptide Gly-Val-Cys155-Gln-Leu from AppA. The final Agp construct containing both Gly-Val-Cys155-Gln-Leu and Arg-Ile-Pro-Ala-Cys430-Ser-Leu was constructed by PCR amplifying agp155 from pAgp155 using the primer pair agp430-rev (5′-CTAGTCTAGATTACAAACTGCACGCCGGTATGCGCGCTTCATTCAACACGCTATCAAAC-3′) and BAD-fwd (5′-GACGCTTTTTATCGCAACTCTCTACTGT-3′). The resulting fragments were digested with EcoRI and XbaI, cloned into EcoRI- and XbaI-digested pBAD18, and named pAgp155/430. E. coli DHB4 strain with chromosomal deletions of dsbA and dsbC was constructed by using the now standard technique of gene disruption (17Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). Antibody Production—Anti-AppA rabbit polyclonal antisera was generated by using the overexpression plasmid pPhyt190 (18Miksch G. Kleist S. Friehs K. Flaschel E. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 59: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 strains harboring pPhyt190 were grown overnight in 2 liters of TB medium (12 g of casein peptone, 24 g of yeast extract, 4 g of glycerol, and 20 g of NaCl in 1 liter of deionized water) with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 40 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C in an Erlenmeyer flask. Because of the Kill cassette in pPhyt190, AppA is found predominantly in the supernatant. Bacteria were therefore removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was subjected to another round of centrifugation to remove any residual cell debris. The proteins in the supernatant fraction were precipitated by slowly adding NH4SO4 to a final concentration of 60% w/v and subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in dialysis buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4 at pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) and dialyzed in 2 liters of the same buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The dialyses buffer was changed three times. The dialyses resulted in the formation of protein precipitants that were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The final protein concentrate was applied to a nickel column, and the fusion protein AppA-6his was eluted into fractions with an imidazole linear gradient (0-200 mm). Fractions were checked for activity and purity in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Those fractions that showed high activity and relative purity were pooled together and used to raise antibodies in rabbit (Covance, Denver, PA). Assay for Acid Phosphatase Activity—Quantitative measurements of acid phosphatase activity for AppA and Agp were made with the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate as described earlier (19Touati E. Dassa E. Boquet P.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Assays were performed in 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.5 for Agp (20Cottrill M.A. Golovan S.P. Phillips J.P. Forsberg C.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2002; 48: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or 250 mm glycine at pH 2.5 for AppA (21Boquet P.L. Manoil C. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because of their varying pH optima. DHB4 cells expressing appA or agp were grown in the presence of 0.2% arabinose until mid-log in NZ media at 37 °C. 100 μl of appropriately diluted cells were incubated with 900 μl of 25 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped with the addition of 200 μlof10 n NaOH. The acid phosphatase activity was determined by measuring the absorbance of the formed p-nitrophenolate at 410 nm. One unit was defined as 1,000 × A410 per min/ml in analogy with β-galactosidase activity (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted in duplicate and replicated at least twice. Thiol Redox State Analyses—To determine the in vivo redox state of the proteins, free thiol groups were trapped with 15 mm 0.5-kDa redox reagent 4-acetamido-4′maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). When indicated the proteins were reduced with the reductant dithiothreitol (15Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Identification of Disulfide-bonded Proteins in E. coli—All Swiss-Prot records with names ending in “_ECOLI” were downloaded January 13, 2004. The records were classified according to subcellular localization as determined from “KW” and “CC” lines. Our subcellular localizations “Cytoplasmic,” “Periplasmic,” “Inner membrane,” and “Outer membrane” are generally derived from the KW lines, but in some cases other information in the record has been used. The subcellular localizations classified as Cytoplasmic are derived from the CC lines. “Signal” proteins are those listed with signal sequences but without being specific to one of the compartments. Search for Potential Substrates of DsbC—Based on previous studies indicating that the consecutiveness of disulfide bonds in a protein was a critical factor in determining whether it would be a substrate for DsbC, we performed a search for proteins known to contain nonconsecutive disulfide bonds in the native organism for DsbC, E. coli. By using the SwissProt data bank, we searched for all E. coli periplasmic proteins containing nonconsecutive disulfide bonds based on their crystal structure (Table II). Only a single protein, AppA, fulfilled this criterion. AppA was first identified as a histidine acid phosphatase (21Boquet P.L. Manoil C. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that hydrolyzes phosphate moieties from several different sugar phosphates (23Dassa E. Cahu M. Desjoyaux-Cherel B. Boquet P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6669-6676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It displays its highest activity and lowest kM with phytic acid as a substrate and therefore has been classified as a phytase (24Golovan S. Wang G. Zhang J. Forsberg C.W. Can. J. Microbiol. 2000; 46: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Its crystal structure (25Lim D. Golovan S. Forsberg C.W. Jia Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) shows the presence of four disulfide bonds, one of them nonconsecutive (Fig. 1). The RNase identified by Hiniker and Bardwell (13Hiniker A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12967-12973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) also contains nonconsecutive disulfide bonds but was not (and is still not) available in the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb/).Table IISearch of E. coli genome for candidates with nonconsecutive multidisulfide-bonded proteinsCompartmentNo.CysaDetermined from the sequence and the signal annotationS–SbDetermined from the “FT DISULFID” linesReal S–SCrossing S–ScIf the first residue number on an “FT DISULFID” line is lower than the second residue number of the preceding line, the bonds must cross because the lines are ordered by residue number of the first cysteineCytoplasm476433760I.M.557476530Periplasm17613127181dAppAO.M.111881730Signal31324844104eHeat-stable enterotoxinsUnclassified3203272415102fOxyR and heat-stable enterotoxinTotal48364100115505a Determined from the sequence and the signal annotationb Determined from the “FT DISULFID” linesc If the first residue number on an “FT DISULFID” line is lower than the second residue number of the preceding line, the bonds must cross because the lines are ordered by residue number of the first cysteined AppAe Heat-stable enterotoxinsf OxyR and heat-stable enterotoxin Open table in a new tab AppA Is a Substrate of DsbC—To study the in vivo DsbC dependence of AppA, we cloned the appA gene into the vector pBAD18 where it is expressed from an arabinose-inducible promoter. This plasmid was introduced into wild-type and various mutant strains. The DHB4 strain background, in which we did these studies, contains the chromosomal appA gene that is not expressed under our growth conditions (see below). DHB4 cells deleted for the dsbA gene display a 10-fold reduction in plasmid-expressed AppA acid phosphatase activity, indicating dependence of AppA on its disulfide bonds for folding into an active enzyme. Most importantly, DHB4 deleted for the dsbC gene displayed a 3- 4-fold reduction in AppA activity (Fig. 2A), indicating that some of its cysteines are misoxidized by DsbA, thus necessitating the isomerization activity of DsbC. However, we wanted to rule out the possibility that the defect in AppA assembly in the dsbC deletion strain was because of the missing chaperone activity of the protein rather than the missing isomerase activity. To this end, we expressed a mutant version of DsbC with its active site cysteines changed to serine, and we asked whether this protein, missing its isomerase but not its chaperone activity (11Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), was sufficient to restore full AppA activity. The AppA activity in the strain expressing this mutant dsbC remained at a low level, indicating that the defect seen in the dsbC deletion strain was because of the missing disulfide isomerase activity (data not shown). Western blots were carried out on the same samples to examine the level and redox state of AppA (Fig. 2B). Similar amounts of AppA protein were observed in wild-type cells and cells deleted of their copies of dsbA or dsbC, indicating that the reduced protein or misoxidized protein is not degraded by cell envelope proteases. Alkylation of free thiol groups by 4-acetamido-4′maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid showed that all of the cysteines in AppA are reduced in the absence of the periplasmic oxidant DsbA. In cells devoid of the isomerase DsbC, the redox state of AppA was similar to that of wild-type cells. These results indicate that correct disulfide bond formation in AppA is essential for its folding into an active conformation rather than its stability. We repeated the experiments with several different constructs expressing different levels of AppA (from a single chromosomal copy to a plasmid with a strong trc promoter), and we observed the same dependence on DsbA and DsbC (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when the experiments were repeated in a ΔappA strain (data not shown), confirming previous data that the chromosomal copy of the wild-type appA is not expressed in rich media at log phase (26Greiner R. Konietzny U. Jany K.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We also asked whether a second periplasmic disulfide bond isomerase, DsbG (27Shao F. Bader M.W. Jakob U. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13349-13352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), might play a role in isomerization of AppA. However, deletion of the dsbG gene had no effect on AppA activity (data not shown). Furthermore, a double mutant, containing deletions of both dsbC and dsbG, showed no greater reduction of activity than the dsbC mutant itself, indicating that the residual activity of AppA in the dsbC mutant was not due to DsbG activity (data not shown). Properties of AppA Mutants Missing Cysteine Residues—The observation that the absence of DsbC resulted in decreased activity of AppA indicates that at least some of the disulfide bonds of the enzyme are required for its proper assembly or that a misoxidized disulfide bond can interfere with that assembly. To begin to understand which disulfide bonds are essential for AppA activity, we generated mutants in which each of the eight cysteine residues was changed to serine separately. All of the mutant AppA proteins displayed reduced activity with six of the cysteine mutants retaining less than 10% activity (Fig. 3). These reductions in activity could be due to one of two effects related to disulfide bond formation. 1) The mutated cysteines are part of a disulfide bond that is important for the proper folding of AppA. 2) The unpaired cysteine, resulting from the elimination of its partner in a disulfide bond, can form incorrect disulfide bonds with other cysteines in the protein. To test further the role of the disulfide bonds of AppA in its activity, we constructed mutant forms of AppA where each of the cysteine pairs involved in disulfide bonds was mutated to serines. As with the single cysteine mutants, all of the mutant strains exhibited reduced amounts of AppA activity. Although all (except Cys200 and Cys210) of the single cysteine mutant versions of AppA described earlier displayed significantly diminished activity (<10% of wild type, Fig. 3), the double cysteine mutants of AppA discussed here displayed higher activities than did the single mutants (Fig. 4). The differences in activities between the single and double mutants may be due to the presence of unpaired cysteines in the former constructs that could enhance the probability of forming incorrect disulfide bonds, as suggested above. The misoxidized complexes with the single cysteine mutants are most likely misfolded and susceptible to protease degradation as indicated by the Western blots (Fig. 2). This is not the case when both the partner cysteines are mutated (Fig. 4). Most interestingly, cysteines 200 and 210, which are normally joined in a disulfide bond, showed the least loss of activity (70% for Cys200 and 35% for Cys210 in comparison to wild type). This was not surprising as a triple mutant of AppA (C200N/D207N/S211N) has been selected in a screen for increased stability studies of AppA (28Rodriguez E. Wood Z.A. Karplus P.A. Lei X.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Garrett J.B. Kretz K.A. O'Donoghue E. Kerovuo J. Kim W. Barton N.R. Hazlewood G.P. Short J.M. Robertson D.E. Gray K.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3041-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mutant AppAs That Contain Only Consecutive Disulfide Bonds Are Independent of DsbC—With the collection of mutants each lacking one of the disulfide bonds of AppA, but still expressing some level of activity, we had an opportunity to assess the role of each disulfide bond on DsbC dependence. We measured the activity of various mutated AppA constructs expressed in dsbC+ and ΔdsbC null mutant cells (Fig. 4). The results show that the mutant AppA lacking its nonconsecutive disulfide bond C155S/C430S does not require DsbC for its remaining activity. In contrast, mutants lacking the Cys99/Cys130 or Cys200/Cys210 disulfide bonds retained dependence on DsbC. The AppA Cys404-Cys413 double cysteine mutant, which exhibits the lowest AppA activity of all of the double cysteine mutants, appears to show little dependence on DsbC (10-30%). However, the low activity of this protein makes it difficult to evaluate the significance of this finding. Also, it could be that the most likely incorrect disulfide bond formed with the cysteine 430, for example, is one of the cysteines of pair 404-413 and that eliminating this pair reduces the chance of errors in disulfide bond formation. These findings are consistent with the proposal that the nonconsecutive disulfide bond of AppA (Cys155-Cys430) is the primary reason for the depen"

N., Tew, K. D., and Tapiero, H. (1999) Biomed. Pharmacother. 53, 169–180). Protein kinase C (PKC) γ is a unique isoform of PKC that is found in neuronal cells and eye tissues. This isoform is activated by ROS such as H2O2. Mutations (H101Y, G118D, S119P, and G128D) in the PKCγ Cys-rich C1B domain caused a form of dominant non-episodic cerebellar ataxia in humans (Chen, D.-H., Brkanac, Z., Verlinde, C. L. M. J., Tan, X.-J., Bylenok, L., Nochli, D., Matsushita, M., Lipe, H., Wolff, J., Fernandez, M., Cimino, P. J., Bird, T. D., and Raskind, W. H. (2003) Am. J. Hum.

(2003) Neurology 61, 1760–1765). This could be due to a failure of the mutant PKCγ proteins to be activated by ROS and to subsequently inhibit gap junctions. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the cellular mechanism of activation of PKCγ by H2O2 and the resultant effects on gap junction activity. H2O2 stimulated PKCγ enzyme activity independently of elevations in cellular diacylglycerol, the natural PKC activator. Okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, did not affect H2O2-stimulated PKCγ activity, indicating that dephosphorylation was not involved. The reductant, dithiothreitol, abolished the effects of H2O2, suggesting a direct oxidation of PKCγ at the Cys-rich C1 domain. H2O2 induced the C1 domain of PKCγ to translocate to plasma membranes, whereas the C2 domain did not. Direct effects of H2O2 on PKCγ were demonstrated using two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Results demonstrated that PKCγ formed disulfide bonds in response to H2O2. H2O2-activated PKCγ was targeted into caveolin-1- and connexin 43-containing lipid rafts, and the PKCγ phosphorylated the connexin 43 gap junction proteins on Ser-368. This resulted in disassembly of connexin 43 gap junction plaques and decreased gap junction activity. Results suggested that H2O2 caused oxidation of the C1 domain, activation of the PKCγ, and inhibition of gap junctions. This inhibition of gap junctions could provide a protection to cells against oxidative stress.

Results suggested that H2O2 caused oxidation of the C1 domain, activation of the PKCγ, and inhibition of gap junctions. This inhibition of gap junctions could provide a protection to cells against oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is closely related to aging and a diverse range of diseases in humans (1.McCord J.M.

Paul J. Ba G.N. Tew K.D. Tapiero H. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1999; 53: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). For instance, Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with oxidative stress, and H2O2 is implicated in this disease (4.Milton N.G. Drugs Aging. 2004; 21: 81-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). H2O2 is an uncharged and freely diffusible reactive oxygen species that is relatively high in brain (4.Milton N.G. Drugs Aging. 2004; 21: 81-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, platelet-derived growth factor, a normal cell growth factor, has been reported to cause an elevation in cellular H2O2 (5.Chen K.C.-W. Zhou Y. Xing K. Krysan K. Lou M.F. Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 78: 1057-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of H2O2 sensors in cells should be very critical to understanding the pathobiology of human diseases caused by oxidative stress (6.Stone J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 422: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which oxidative damage is signaled to adjacent cells is through open gap junctions that would pass apoptotic signals to adjacent cells. Gap junctions are clusters of channels that maintain homeostasis by intercellular exchange of ions, small metabolites, and cell signaling molecules (7.Wei C.-J. Xu X. Lo C.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 811-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). A gap junction channel is made of two hemi-channels called connexons, and each connexon consists of six membrane-spanning connexin protein molecules. Either closure or disassembly of gap junction channels causes inhibition of gap junction activity as determined through both gap junction activity assay (by scrape loading/dye transfer analysis) and cell surface gap junction plaques (by immuno-labeling assay) (8.Lin D. Boyle D. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previous publications (9.Huang R.P. Peng A. Hossain M.Z. Fan Y. Jagdale A. Boynton A.L. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10.Cho J.H. Cho S.D. Hu H. Kim S.H. Lee Y.S. Kang K.S. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1163-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) suggested that H2O2 induced hyperphosphorylation of connexins and inhibition of gap junctions. This inhibition may be due to closure of gap junction channels (11.Hossain M.Z. Jagdale A.B. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12.Todt I. Ngezahayo A. Ernst A. Kolb H.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 181: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, H2O2 also is reported to increase gap junctional communication in astrocytes, and prolonged treatment with H2O2 consequently caused cell death (13.Rouach N. Calvo C.F. Duquennoy H. Glowinski J. Giaume C. Glia. 2004; 45: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Connexin proteins have numerous kinase target sites, and Ser-368 is the site of phosphorylation of Cx43 by PKC (14.Lampe P.D. TenBroek E.M. Burt J.M. Kurata W.E. Jognson R.G. Lau A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (PKC) comprises a family of serine/threonine kinases that contain at least 11 isoforms and can be found in most cell types (15.Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). These isoforms are divided into three groups. Conventional PKCs are activated by both diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium. Novel PKCs are calcium-independent but can still be stimulated by DAG. Atypical PKCs are independent of both calcium and DAG. PKCγ is a conventional isoform of PKC and is required for brain cells, peripheral nerves, retina, and lens (16.Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 17.Saleh S. Takemoto L. Zoukhri D. Takemoto D. Mol.

Visual Neurosci. 1993; 10: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In peripheral nerves, PKCγ translocates to sites of nerve damage, and PKCγ knock-out mice show less pain sensitivity (20.Ohsawa M. Narita M. Mizoguchi H. Cheng E. Tseng L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 429: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21.Mao J. Price D. Phillips L. Lu J. Mayer D. Brain Res. 1995; 677: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and less protection against brain ischemia (22.Aronowski J. Grotta J. Strong R. Waxman M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The presence of PKCγ in brain tissues appears to prevent brain ischemia and is a target for ischemic preconditioning (22.Aronowski J. Grotta J. Strong R. Waxman M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23.Cardell M. Wieloch T. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Missense mutations (H101Y, G118D, S119P, G128D, or F643L) in PKCγ cause dominant non-episodic cerebellar ataxia in humans, suggesting that PKCγ-related and polyglutamine-related neurodegeneration may have a common pathway for neuronal cell damage and death in hereditary ataxia (24.Chen D.-H. Brkanac Z. Verlinde C.L.M.J. Tan X.-J. Bylenok L. Nochli D. Matsushita M. Lipe H. Wolff J. Fernandez M. Cimino P.J. Bird T.D. Raskind W.H. Am. J. Hum.

Since oxidative damage is known to be involved in neurodegeneration, proteins that respond to oxidative stress would be critical for the health of neural tissues. We have observed that PKCγ is present in lens epithelial cells and is the primary sensor of changes in diacylglycerol (DAG) at low or physiological levels (8.Lin D. Boyle D. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The PKCγ regulatory domain contains C1 and C2 motifs. PKCγ binds calcium at a C2 domain and DAG at a C1 domain (15.Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 27.Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). NMR structural analyses reveal that the C1 domain of PKCγ, like PKCα, has two zinc-finger motifs that are enriched with Cys residues and are called C1A and C1B (28.Xu R. Pawelczyk T. Xia T. Brown S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10709-10717Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both C1A and C1B domains of PKCγ have high affinity for DAG and are exposed, whereas only the C1A domain of PKCα has high affinity for DAG binding (29.Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46886-46894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Both C1A and C1B domains are involved in DAG-stimulated PKCγ activation at basal intracellular calcium levels (8.Lin D. Boyle D. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29.Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46886-46894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The C1 and C2 domains anchor PKC to plasma membrane, which in turn causes conformational changes and consequent protein activation (30.Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry: Biomolecules, Mechanisms of Enzyme Action, and Metabolism,3rd Ed. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, Hoboken, NJ2004Google Scholar). Sublethal exposure of cells to H2O2 causes numerous changes in the oxidation state of proteins (31.Cumming R.C. Andon N.L. Haynes P.A. Park M. Fischer W.H. Schubert D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21749-21758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). PKCγ is a logical candidate for redox modification by H2O2 at sublethal doses through oxidation of the Cys residues within the C1 domain. This would result in PKCγ activation and could cause inhibition of gap junctions, a cell-protective mechanism. Here we show that 100 μm H2O2 activates PKCγ through the C1 domain. The C1 domain of PKCγ translocated to membranes upon H2O2 stimulation. Oxidation of PKCγ by H2O2 resulted in off-diagonal migration of the proteins, suggestive of disulfide bond formation. H2O2-activated PKCγ was targeted to caveolin-1 (Cav-1)- and connexin 43 (Cx43)-containing lipid rafts, and the PKCγ interacted with Cx43 gap junction proteins and Cav-1 and consequently phosphorylated Cx43 on Ser-368. Moreover, activation of PKCγ by H2O2 decreased Cx43 gap junction plaques and gap junction activity. Thus, oxidation of the PKCγ C1 domain may be responsible for the H2O2-induced activation of this enzyme and in subsequent inhibition of gap junctions. These results demonstrate that PKCγ is an oxidative stress-sensing protein that provides a protective effect for cells through inhibition of gap junctions.

When they reached 95% confluency, the cells were used for experiments after 2 h of serum starvation. PKCγ Activity Assay—Specific PKCγ activity was analyzed by use of the PepTag assay kit as described (32.Zhou J. Fariss R.N. Zelenka P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5388-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33.Lin D. Lobell S. Jewell A. Takemoto D.J. Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 688-695PubMed Google Scholar). Equal protein amounts of whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with PKCγ antisera at 4 °C for 4 h as described previously (8.Lin D. Boyle D. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated PKCγ-agarose bead complexes were recovered and incubated with PKC reaction mixture (25 μl) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reactions were stopped by heating at 100 °C for 10 min, and fluorescent phospho-PepTag peptides (phosphorylated by PKCγ) were resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under UV light. The phosphorylated peptide bands were excised, and their fluorescence intensities were quantified by spectrophotometry at 570 nm. Endogenous Diacylglycerol Assay—Sample preparation and radioenzymatic assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions described previously (8.Lin D. Boyle D. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, total lipids extracted with chloroform/methanol were used as the substrates for diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase. The reaction product, phosphatidic acid, traced by 32P, was separated by TLC gel, and consequently the TLC gels were exposed to x-ray film overnight. The spots corresponding to [32P]phosphatidic acid were isolated and quantitated by scintillation counting. Cellular DAG levels were calculated from DAG standard curves. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were collected and lysed on ice with cell lysis buffer followed by homogenization and sonication. The cell lysis buffer contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm NaF, and 2 mm PMSF. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatants were collected and used as whole cell extracts. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described previously (8.Lin D. Boyle D. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Redox Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE—Formation of disulfide bonds was determined by “redox two-dimensional SDS-PAGE” as described (31.Cumming R.C. Andon N.L. Haynes P.A. Park M. Fischer W.H. Schubert D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21749-21758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) with modification. Whole cell extracts were treated with nonreducing SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol) for 3 min at 85 °C before loading. Proteins (100 μg) were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE in the first dimension. After electrophoresis, the gel lanes were cut and immersed in SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature. Each gel strip was then horizontally applied to the top of another 8% gel and was bridged by 0.6% agarose gel in 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. After electrophoresis, separated proteins in gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were subsequently stained in the Ponceau S solution to show prominent diagonal lines of proteins. After that, the membranes were immunoblotted with anti-PKCγ, PLCγ1, α-tubulin, or Cav-1 antisera, and immunoreacted proteins were visualized by ECL solution as described previously (8.Lin D. Boyle D. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34.Lin D. Zhou J. Zelenka P. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5259-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation and Isolation of Lipid Rafts—Lipid rafts-enriched membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (34.Lin D. Zhou J. Zelenka P. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5259-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from three 75-cm2 flasks were collected and sonicated in cell lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Whole cell extracts were mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in Mes-NaCl buffer containing 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm NaF, and 2 mm PMSF, loaded at the bottoms of 12-ml ultracentrifuge tubes, and then overlaid with 8 ml of a 5–35% continuous sucrose gradient in Mes-NaCl buffer containing 0.2% concentration of protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm NaF, and 4 mm PMSF. The samples were ultracentrifuged at 245,000 × g for 22 h at 4 °C with a Beckman swinging bucket rotor SW41 Ti. Fractions (1 ml each) were collected from the top of each gradient (12 fractions total). Protein samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immuno-visualized by Western blotting. In order to investigate protein interactions in lipid rafts, sucrose gradient fractions 3–6 were collected, combined, and further solubilized by sonication with addition of 0.1% SDS. The mixtures were used as Cav-1-containing lipid raft samples for coimmunoprecipitation assays (34.Lin D. Zhou J. Zelenka P. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5259-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cholesterol Content in the Sucrose Gradient Fractions—Sucrose gradient fractions were isolated as described above. Cholesterol content was measured as described (35.Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49631-49637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Total lipids in these fractions were extracted with 2:1 methanol/chloroform, followed by 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of water. Chloroform phase (containing lipids) was dried under nitrogen. Dry lipids were resuspended in isopropyl alcohol, and membrane cholesterol was assayed using Infinity cholesterol liquid stable reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Sci. 2003; 44: 5259-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), PKCγ fragments of the C1 (amino acid sequence: 36–150) or C2 (amino acid sequence: 170–260) domains were amplified by PCR to introduce both BglII sites at the N termini and EcoRI sites at the C termini and subcloned into pEGFP-N3 vectors, respectively. The sequences were confirmed by sequencing. The oligonucleotide sequences were designed as follows: C1 domain, forward primer 5′-GA AGATCT ATG CAC AAG TTC ACC GCT CGT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CG GAATTC GCA AAG GGA GGG CAC GCT-3′; C2 domain, forward primer 5′-GA AGATCT ATG GAT GAG ATC CAT ATT ACT GT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CG GAATTC GGA CAT GGC ACC CAT GAA GTC A-3′. Ataxia mutation H101Y was made using PKCγ:EGFP plasmid DNA as a template completely following the provided instructions for the QuikChange site mutation kit. The primer sequence is as follows with the mutation nucleotides underlined: PKCγ H101Y, 5′-C GAC CCT CGC AAC AAG TAC AAG TTC CGT CTG CAC AGC-3′.

Plasmid DNA transient transfection into 80% confluent N/N1003A cells or neuro-2A (N2A) cells was performed by Lipofectamine transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The GFP fluorescence and relocalization of GFP fusion proteins were checked using an ECLIPSE E600 Nikon fluorescent microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Protein Translocation Analysis—Confluent cells were homogenized with extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm NaF, and 2 mm PMSF. Soluble and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended with extraction buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described (8.Lin D. Boyle D. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Western blot bands were quantified by UN-Scan-It software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT) and expressed as pixel intensities. The average and/or total pixel intensity was analyzed and graphed from three separate experiments. The C1:EGFP and C2:EGFP fusion proteins from transient transfected cells were concentrated using Strata-Clean resin before loading. Endogenous PKCγ Knockdown—Endogenous PKCγ was knocked down by siRNA targeting to PKCγ DNA sequence 5′-AAC GGT GTA AAG CCA CGC TAA A-3′. The PKCγ siRNA was transfected into cells using RNAiFect siRNA transfection reagent according to the instructions provided. Knockdown of PKCγ was monitored by Western blot. Measurement of Cell Surface Gap Junctional Cx43 Plaques—Determination of endogenous Cx43 gap junction plaques was performed as described previously (8.Lin D. Boyle D. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34.Lin D. Zhou J. Zelenka P. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5259-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and labeled with anti-Cx43 for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the fixed cells were incubated with the secondary antisera that were attached to a fluorochrome and had specific excitation and emission wavelength. Alexa Fluor 568 is goat anti-rabbit antibody and has an excitation/emission wavelength of 578:603. The cells were then mounted onto slides and examined using a Nikon scanning confocal microscope. We photographed 10 points per slide, three slides for each treatment, and the examples are shown. For quantitation, the cell surface Cx43 plaques (larger than 1 μm in length) from single cells in each image were counted. The number of Cx43 plaques was expressed as mean ± S.E. Values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant (*). Gap junction plaque formation of Cx43:EGFP or Cx43S368A:EGFP in transfected N2A cells was confirmed by a Nikon scanning confocal microscope. Large gap junction plaques from single cells in each image were counted. The number of plaques was expressed as mean ± S.E. Values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant (*). Gap Junction Activity Assay—N/N1003A cell gap junction activity was measured by the scrape loading/dye transfer assay as described previously (8.Lin D. Boyle D. Takemoto D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Briefly, after H2O2 treatment, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then 2.5 μl of both 1% Lucifer Yellow and 0.75% rhodamine dextran in PBS were added at the center of the coverslip, and two cuts crossing each other were made passing through the dye. After incubation with the dye for 1 min, these cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with normal growth medium for an additional 10 min to allow dye transfer. The cells were then fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde"
https://openalex.org/W2087274273,"BAFF receptor (BAFFR) is a member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily that regulates the survival and maturation of B cells. BAFFR exerts its signaling function by inducing activation of NF-κB, although the underlying mechanism has not been well defined. By using a chimeric BAFFR, we show that BAFFR preferentially induces the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. This specific function of BAFFR is mediated by a sequence motif, PVPAT, which is homologous to the TRAF-binding site (PVQET) present in CD40, a TNFR known to induce both the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways. Mutation of this putative TRAF-binding motif within BAFFR abolishes its interaction with TRAF3 as well as its ability to induce noncanonical NF-κB. Interestingly, modification of the PVPAT sequence to the typical TRAF-binding sequence, PVQET, is sufficient to render the BAFFR capable of inducing strong canonical NF-κB signaling. Further, this functional acquisition of the modified BAFFR is associated with its stronger and more rapid association with TRAF3. These findings suggest that the PVPAT sequence of BAFFR not only functions as a key signaling motif of BAFFR but also determines its signaling specificity in the induction of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway.

Tangye S.G. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). BAFF interacts with three receptors of the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily: transmembrane activator, calcium modulator, and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), and BAFF receptor (BAFFR). Genetic evidence suggests that BAFFR is primarily responsible for mediating the role of BAFF in B-cell survival and maturation (2Thompson J.S. Bixler S.A. Qian F. Vora K. Scott M.L. Cachero T.G. Hession C. Schneider P. Sizing I.D. Mullen C. Strauch K. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Tschopp J. Browning J.L. Ambrose C. Science. 2001; 293: 2108-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 3Yan M.

Scott M.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2331-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that the BAFF/BAFFR system mediates B-cell survival by promoting the expression of anti-apoptosis genes belonging to the Bcl-2 family, such as A1 (also named Bfl-1) and Bcl-XL (6Patke A. Mecklenbrauker I. Tarakhovsky A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The BAFFR signal appears to function in cooperation with other signals, especially those elicited by the B-cell receptor (6Patke A. Mecklenbrauker I. Tarakhovsky A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), because recombinant BAFF is insufficient to trigger significant expression of the anti-apoptosis genes in cell culture (7Trescol-Biemont M.C. Verschelde C. Cottalorda A. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Biochimie. (Paris). 2004; 86: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Zarnegar B. He J.Q. Oganesyan G. Hoffmann A. Baltimore D. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8108-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A major signaling event induced by BAFF is activation of NF-κB, a family of inducible transcription factors that play pivotal roles in regulating diverse aspects of immune function (9Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar, 10Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 11Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family is composed of five members: RelA, RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1, and NF-κB2, which function as various dimeric complexes that transactivate specific target genes via binding to the κB enhancer (12Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). The function of NF-κB is normally suppressed by their physical association with inhibitory proteins, including IκBα and homologs as well as the NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 precursor proteins, p105 and p100 (13Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by most cellular inducers involves phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα and the concomitant nuclear translocation of p50/RelA and p50/c-Rel NF-κB complexes (14Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). This so-called canonical pathway of NF-κB activation is mediated by a multisubunit IκB kinase (IKK) composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (14Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Recently, another mechanism of NF-κB activation has been identified, which is based on the inducible processing of the NF-κB2 precursor protein p100 (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), an IκB-like molecule specifically inhibiting the nuclear translocation of RelB (16Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Carmona E.M. Bren G.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1405-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This mechanism, known as the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, is required for generation of p52 as well as the nuclear translocation of RelB-containing NF-κB complexes (17Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 693-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway is specifically mediated by a subset of TNFR family members, including BAFFR, CD40, lymphotoxin β receptor, and receptor activator of NF-κB (18Claudio E. Brown K. Park S. Wang H. Siebenlist U. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 19Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G.

Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Like BAFFR, CD40 plays an important role in regulating the function of B cells, although these two receptors regulate different aspects of B-cell function. Whereas BAFFR regulates the maturation of B cells, CD40 is particularly important for the survival and differentiation of antigen-activated B cells in the germinal centers (23van Kooten C. Banchereau J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Although the signaling mechanism of BAFFR remains poorly understood, the signaling function of CD40 has been extensively studied. The cytoplasmic domain of CD40 contains specific motifs for binding to members of the TNFR-associated factors (TRAF) (23van Kooten C. Banchereau J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). One such motif, PVQET, predominantly interacts with two TRAF members, TRAF2 and TRAF3 (23van Kooten C. Banchereau J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). This TRAF-binding motif, with the consensus sequence of PXQXT(S), has also been found in several other TNFR family members (24Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). CD40 is able to induce the activation of both noncanonical and canonical NF-κB signaling pathways (8Zarnegar B. He J.Q. Oganesyan G. Hoffmann A. Baltimore D. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8108-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 19Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 15: 5375-5385Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Further, ligation of CD40 is sufficient for triggering the expression of various target genes, including those encoding the apoptosis inhibitors Bfl-1/A1 and Bcl-XL (25Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Unlike CD40, BAFFR does not contain a conserved TRAF-binding motif. The signaling determinant of BAFFR has not been well defined, although truncation at its C-terminal region abolishes its signaling function (2Thompson J.S. Bixler S.A. Qian F. Vora K. Scott M.L. Cachero T.G. Hession C. Schneider P. Sizing I.D. Mullen C. Strauch K. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Tschopp J. Browning J.L. Ambrose C.

Starovasnik M.A. Dixit V.M. Immunity. 2002; 17: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The precise role of BAFFR in mediating different pathways of NF-κB activation also remains unclear. Whereas BAFFR clearly mediates the induction of the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway (18Claudio E. Brown K. Park S. Wang H. Siebenlist U. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 21Kayagaki N. Yan M. Seshasayee D. Wang H. Lee W. French D.M. Grewal I.S. Cochran A.G. Gordon N.C. Yin J. Starovasnik M.A. Dixit V.M. Immunity. 2002; 17: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), its role in activating the canonical pathway remains ambiguous (8Zarnegar B. He J.Q. Oganesyan G. Hoffmann A. Baltimore D. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8108-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Hatada E.N. Do R.K. Orlofsky A. Liou H.C. Prystowsky M. MacLennan I.C. Caamano J. Chen-Kiang S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). One complexity that may contribute to the discrepancy of the prior studies is the involvement of different BAFF-responding receptors: TACI, BCMA, and BAFFR (27Mackay F. Schneider P. Rennert P. Browning J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the specific signaling function of BAFFR using a chimeric receptor containing the ligand binding domain of CD40 and the intracellular signaling domain of BAFFR. We show that the BAFFR predominantly targets the activation of noncanonical NF-κB. Moreover, we have identified a signaling motif of BAFFR that is critical for its signaling function in NF-κB activation. This motif is homologous to the TRAF-binding site of CD40, although it does not contain all the conserved residues of the typical TRAF-binding motif. Substitution of the conserved residues with alanines completely abolishes the function of BAFFR in the induction of p100 processing. Interestingly, mutation of the BAFFR signaling motif to the typical TRAF-binding sequence rendered the BAFFR competent in activation of both the noncanonical and canonical NF-κB pathways. These findings suggest that the atypical TRAF-binding sequence of BAFFR not only functions as a key signaling motif but also determines the unique signaling property of BAFFR in mediating noncanonical NF-κB activation. Plasmid Constructs—The hCD40-BAFFR encodes the extracellular and transmembrane domains of human CD40 (amino acids 1–215) and the cytoplasmic domain of murine BAFFR (amino acids 98–175). The corresponding cDNA fragments were isolated by reverse transcription-PCR using human BJAB and murine M12 B cell lines, respectively, and cloned into the pCLXSN retroviral vector (provided by Dr. Inder M. Verma (28Naviaux R.N. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). To create the M1 and M2 mutants, site-directed mutagenesis was performed, using hCD40-BAFFR as template, to introduce the indicated amino acid substitutions in the cytoplasmic domain of BAFFR. pcDNA-HA-TRAF2 was described previously (29Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers for PCR and site-directed mutagenesis (sequences are available upon request) were synthesized at the Macromolecular Core of Penn State University College of Medicine. All the plasmids used in this work were sequenced at the Molecular Genetics Core of Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. Antibodies and Other Reagents—The antibodies for TRAF3 (H122), HRP-conjugated TRAF3, Oct-1 (C-21), Tubulin (TU-02), and RelB (C-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-p52 and anti-IκBα antibodies were from Upstate. HA monoclonal antibody (HRP-conjugated, 3F10) was from Roche Applied Science. Anti-mouse CD40 antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen, and anti-hCD40 monoclonal antibody was produced from a hybridoma (G28–5, American Type Culture Collection). The polyclonal anti-hCD40 antibody (LOB-11) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-hCD40 antibody was from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Retroviral Infection—Murine B cell line M12.4.1 (called M12 in this report) (30Hamano T. Kim K.J. Leiserson W.M. Asofsky R. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1403-1406PubMed Google Scholar) and its derivative stably transfected with hCD40 (M12-hCD40) (31Haxhinasto S.A. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Gail A. Bishop. The M12-hCD40-BAFFR, M12-hCD40-BAFFR M1, and M12-hCD40-BAFFR M2 cells were created by infecting the M12 cells with the pCLXSN retroviruses encoding wild type and mutant forms of the hCD40-BAFFR chimeras as previously described (32Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25222-25230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After drug selection (G418), bulk infected cells were used in the experiments to avoid clonal variations. All of these B-cell lines were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, antibiotics, and 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. The kidney carcinoma cell line 293T was cultured in Dulbecco's medium with the same supplements except the lack of 2-mercaptoethanol. Transient transfection of 293 cells was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For retrovirus production (32Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25222-25230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—About 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of FACS buffer (2% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline). The cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-hCD40 antibody and subjected to FACS analysis using a BD Biosciences FACScan at the Pennsylvania State College of Medicine Cell Science/Flow Cytometry Core Facility. RNase Protection Assays—Total cellular RNA was isolated from M12 and derivative cells using the TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). RNase protection assays were performed using the BD RiboQuant Reagents and mouse APO-2 template set according to the manufacturer's instruction (BD Biosciences). Immunoblotting and Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays—Whole cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (33Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and nuclear extracts were prepared as previous described (34Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The proteins were fractionated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and then subjected to immunoblotting using the indicated primary antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (35Uhlik M. Good L. Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Zandi E. Karin M. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were subjected to EMSA using a 32P-radiolabeled κB probe (34Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation Assays to Detect BAFFR/TRAF3 Binding— The coimmunoprecipitation assays were essentially according to Hostager et al. (36Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3318-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, M12 cells (2 × 107) stably expressing hCD40-BAFFR and derivatives or full-length hCD40 were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh growth medium and stimulated for the indicated times with anti-hCD40. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed in 600 μl of a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1/1000 volume of a protease inhibitor mixture, Sigma). The protein lysates were incubated in at 4 °C for 2 h with 30 μl of protein G-agarose to isolate the anti-hCD40/receptor immune complexes. After washing the agarose beads with lysis buffer for three times, the coprecipitated TRAF3 was eluted from the beads with SDS loading buffer and detected by IB using HRP-conjugated anti-TRAF3. BAFFR Preferentially Induces the Noncanonical NF-κB Signaling Pathway—To study the signaling function of BAFFR, we generated a chimeric receptor containing the cytoplasmic domain of murine BAFFR and the extracellular ligand-binding domain of human CD40 (hCD40) (Fig. 1A). Within this chimera, the signaling activity of BAFFR could be stimulated with an agonistic anti-hCD40 antibody without the interference of TACI and BCMA or the endogenous BAFFR. Further, this chimeric receptor allows direct comparison of the signaling functions of BAFFR and CD40 using the same stimulus. By retroviral infection, we stably expressed the hCD40-BAFFR chimera in a murine B cell line, M12 (30Hamano T. Kim K.J. Leiserson W.M. Asofsky R. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1403-1406PubMed Google Scholar), which has been used as a model for studying the signaling function of both CD40 (36Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Because close to 100% of the cells expressed hCD40-BAFFR (Fig. 1B), we used the bulk-infected cells for the signaling studies. To compare the signaling activity of BAFFR with that of CD40, we also included M12 cells stably expressing the wild type (intact) human CD40 (M12-hCD40). We examined the BAFFR-mediated activation of NF-κB signaling pathways by detecting the processing of p100 and degradation of IκBα, indicators of noncanonical and canonical NF-κB pathways, respectively (17Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 693-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of cross-reactivity of the anti-hCD40 (G28–5) with murine CD40 (31Haxhinasto S.A. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the parental murine M12 B cells did not respond to stimulation by the agonistic anti-hCD40 antibody (Fig. 1C, toppanel, lane 2). On the other hand, the hCD40-BAFFR cells efficiently responded to the anti-hCD40, as demonstrated by the inducible processing of p100 to p52 (lane 4). A similar result was obtained with the M12-CD40 cells (lane 6). Because the induction of p100 processing by recombinant BAFF is associated with degradation of TRAF3 (29Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), we examined whether the BAFFR chimera also induces TRAF3 degradation. Indeed, TRAF3 was lost concomitant with the induction of p100 processing by both CD40-BAFFR and the intact CD40 (Fig. 1C, middle panel). The loss of TRAF3 was not due to its translocation to the nucleus (data not shown) and could be detected at early time points of cell stimulation (see Fig. 2F). Using the CD40-BAFFR chimera system, we next examined whether BAFFR targets the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway by analyzing degradation of IκBα. Consistent with the ability of CD40 to activate canonical NF-κB, stimulation of M12-hCD40 cells resulted in efficient degradation of IκBα (Fig. 1D, upper panel, lanes 5–8). In contrast, however, stimulation of the M12-hCD40-BAFFR cells only led to a weak loss of IκBα (lanes 1–4). This result was not due to the lower expression of hCD40-BAFFR than hCD40 (Fig. 1B). Further, because the p100 processing was even more strongly induced by the hCD40-BAFFR than hCD40 (Fig. 1C), it is unlikely that the ineffectiveness of hCD40-BAFFR in inducing IκBα degradation was due to its intrinsically weaker signaling activity. Thus, unlike CD40, BAFFR is a TNFR member that preferentially stimulates the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. An Atypical TRAF-binding Sequence Motif Is Critical for BAFFR Signaling—The signaling function of TNFRs requires TRAF molecules. A specific TRAF-binding motif has been identified in a number of TNFR members (39Dempsey P.W. Doyle S.E. He J.Q. Cheng G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), with those in CD40 being the most extensively characterized (40Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To understand the biochemical mechanism mediating the unique signaling function of BAFFR, we compared the amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic domains of BAFFR and CD40. Interestingly, although BAFFR lacks a typical TRAF-binding motif, it possesses a sequence element (PVPAT) that shares significant homology, in both location and sequence, with the TRAF-binding motif of CD40 (Fig. 2A, bolded and underlined). To examine the role of this sequence element in BAFFR signaling, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to substitute the conserved amino acids within the hCD40-BAFFR chimera with alanines (Fig. 2B, M1). In parallel, we also mutated the BAFFR motif to the typical TRAF-binding sequence, PVQET, of CD40 (Fig. 2B, M2). FACS analyses revealed a comparable expression level between the wild type and mutant forms of hCD40-BAFFR (Fig. 2C). Importantly, the M1 mutant (harboring PVPAT to AVAAA mutations) completely lost the ability to induce p100 processing (Fig. 2D, top panel, lane 4). On the other hand, the M2 mutant remained competent in inducing p100 processing (lane 6). The mutations introduced into M1, but not M2, also abolished the induction of TRAF3 degradation (Fig. 2D, middle panel). A separate experiment using shorter stimulation time points revealed that the TRAF3 degradation by wild type BAFFR and M2 mutant occurred around 2 h following receptor cross-linking, but this response was not detected in cells expressing the M1 mutant (Fig. 2F). Because a primary consequence of p100 processing is nuclear translocation of RelB and p52 NF-κB heterodimer, we analyzed the expression of these two NF-κB members in the nucleus of the different M12 derivative cells. Upon stimulation of the cells expressing wild type hCD40-BAFFR by anti-hCD40, both RelB and p52 efficiently expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 2E, top two panels, lane 2). In agreement with the result of p100 processing, the M1 mutant of the hCD40-BAFFR failed to mediate the inducible nuclear expression of RelB and p52 (lane 4), whereas the M2 mutant was effective in this signaling function (lane 6). Thus, these data establish the PVPAT sequence as a key signaling motif of BAFFR that mediates the induction of p100 processing and nuclear expression of the noncanonical NF-κB members. The PVPAT Motif Also Determines the Signaling Specificity of BAFFR—An important question regarding BAFFR signaling is how its signaling specificity is regulated. As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), BAFFR preferentially stimulates the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway, whereas CD40 stimulates both the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways. One hypothesis we were considering was that the unique signaling function of BAFFR was likely due to its possession of an atypical TRAF-binding motif. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of PVPAT-to-PVQET conversion within the cytoplasmic domain of BAFFR on its ability to induce IκBα degradation. As expected, cross-linking of the wild type hCD40-BAFFR only led to a low level of IκBα degradation (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 1–4), which was not detected in the M1 mutant of the receptor (lanes 5–8). Remarkably, however, conversion of the PVPAT sequence to PVQET rendered the BAFFR capable of stimulating efficient degradation of IκBα (lanes 9–12). Thus, a two-amino acid substitution in the putative TRAF-binding site of BAFFR is sufficient to convert it into a receptor capable of stimulating the canonical pathway of NF-κB. One major difference between the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways resides in their signaling kinetics. Whereas the canonical pathway is rapid and transient, the noncanonical pathway is slow and persistent. We performed EMSA to examine the acute and delayed phases of NF-κB activation by the wild type and mutant forms of BAFFR. During the early phase of cell stimulation, the wild type BAFFR only mediated a weak activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3), but the M2 mutant of BAFFR caused a much stronger activation of NF-κB under the same conditions (lanes 6 and 7). This result was consistent with the elevated induction of IκBα degradation by the M2 mutant (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the acute NF-κB activation, no appreciable difference was detected in the late-phase NF-κB activation mediated by the wild type and M2 mutant of BAFFR (compare lanes 4 and 8). Further, the M1 mutant of BAFFR was defective in activation of both the acute and delayed phases of NF-κB(lanes 10–12). Thus, the PVPAT motif of BAFFR specifically mediates the delayed activation of NF-κB, which in turn is associated with the processing of p100 and nuclear translocation of RelB/p52 (Fig. 2, D and E). To further assess the signaling specificity of BAFFR, we examined the expression of downstream genes. Previous studies suggest that the BAFFR signal alone is insufficient for triggering significant induction of anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bfl-1/A1 (7Trescol-Biemont M.C. Verschelde C. Cottalorda A. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Biochimie. (Paris). 2004; 86: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Bfl-1/A1 gene can be potently stimulated by the CD40 signal (25Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 41D'Souza B.N. Edelstein L.C. Pegman P.M. Smith S.M. Loughran S.T. Clarke A. Mehl A. Rowe M. Gelinas C. Walls D. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1800-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We thus examined the mRNA levels of this downstream gene in cells expressing the chimeric BAFFR receptors. Consistent with the prior studies, stimulation of the wild type BAFFR did not appreciably induce the expression of Bfl-1/A1 mRNA (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–5). Interestingly, however, stimulation of the BAFFR harboring PVPAT-to-PVQET modifications led to potent induction of Bfl-1/A1 (lanes 11–15). Together, these data suggest that the atypical TRAF-binding motif of BAFFR not only serves as a key signaling motif but also regulates its signaling specificity. The PVPAT Motif Regulates Recruitment of TRAF3 to BAFFR—A prior study demonstrated that BAFFR specifically interacts with TRAF3 (42Xu L.-G. Shu H.-B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6883-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To directly determine the role of the PVPAT motif in TRAF binding, we examined the recruitment of TRAF3 to the hCD40-BAFFR receptor in cells stimulated with anti-hCD40. In agreement with the previous report, we found that TRAF3 was recruited to the wild type BAFFR upon ligation by anti-hCD40, although significant BAFFR/TRAF3 association was not detected until 1 h following anti-hCD40 treatment (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lane 3). More importantly, this physical interaction critically requires the PVPAT motif, because the M1 mutant (carrying the AVAAA mutation) failed to recruit TRAF3 (lanes 4–6). Interestingly, the M2 mutant (carrying the PVQET mutation) interacted with TRAF3 more strongly and more rapidly than the wild type BAFFR (lanes 7–9). This property of the BAFFR M2 mutant was reminiscent of the CD40 molecule, which potently and rapidly interacted with TRAF3 in response to the anti-hCD40 treatment (lanes 10–12). These biochemical results support the functional studies described above. We next examined whether the PVPAT to PVQET conversion was sufficient to render the modified BAFFR capable of binding to TRAF2. These studies were performed using transfected 293 cells. Consistent with a previous study, the wild type BAFFR did not interact with TRAF2 even under the overexpression conditions (Fig. 4B, upper panel, lane 2). Similarly, the M1 mutant was inactive in this physical interaction (lane 3). Interestingly, however, the M2 mutant, which carries the PVQET motif, exhibited a significant TRAF2-binding activity (lane 4). Together, these results suggest that the atypical TRAF-binding motif of BAFFR specifically interacts with TRAF3 but not with TRAF2, which likely contributes to the signaling specificity of BAFFR. Further, conversion of the atypical TRAF-binding motif to a conserved one is sufficient to alter the specificity of BAFFR in TRAF binding and NF-κB signaling. The results of this study provide an insight into the signaling mechanism of BAFFR. We have identified a signaling motif, PVPAT, within the cytoplasmic domain of BAFFR that shares significant sequence homology with the TRAF-binding motif, PVQET, of CD40. However, the BAFFR motif does not fall into the consensus sequence of the TRAF-binding sequence (PXQXT) present in several TNFR superfamily members. We propose that this atypical TRAF-binding motif is responsible for the unique signaling property of BAFFR that preferentially targets the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. We have obtained several lines of evidence that support this hypothesis. First, alanine substitutions of the conserved amino acids within the PVPAT motif abolishes the ability of BAFFR to induce p100 processing and nuclear translocation of RelB and p52 (Fig. 2), key steps in noncanonical NF-κB signaling (17Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 693-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Second, a two-amino acid substitution that converts the PVPAT sequence to the typical TRAF-binding sequence (PVQET) renders the modified BAFFR competent in activating the canonical NF-κB pathway (Fig. 3). Third, the PVPAT motif is essential for the suboptimal association of BAFFR with TRAF3, and the PVPAT-to-PVQET mutation significantly enhances the TRAF3-binding activity of BAFFR (Fig. 4A). Additionally, we have also shown that mutating PVPAT to PVQET has no obvious effect on BAFFR-mediated p100 processing or the delayed activation of NF-κB (Fig. 2), but this manipulation markedly enhances the acute-phase NF-κB activation known to be associated with canonical NF-κB signaling. Of note, the PVPAT to PVQET sequence change allows the modified BAFFR to interact with TRAF2, which may contribute to the gain-of-function in the canonical NF-κB signaling. We have recently shown that TRAF3 functions as a negative regulator of p100 processing induced by CD40 and BAFFR (29Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Our current study suggests that recruitment of TRAF3 to BAFFR is critical for BAFFR-mediated induction of p100 processing. The M1 mutant of BAFFR, which is deficient in recruiting TRAF3, also fails to induce p100 processing. It is unclear how the TRAF3 recruitment to BAFFR contributes to signal transduction leading to p100 processing. One possibility is that the receptor recruitment serves as a trigger for targeting the degradation of TRAF3, which appears to be an important step in the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway (29Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, the functionally inactive BAFFR mutant (M1) fails to induce TRAF3 degradation (Fig. 2D). However, it also remains possible that the receptor recruitment of TRAF3 plays an active role in the initiation of the noncanonical NF-κB signaling. Examination of this latter hypothesis will need genetically manipulated B cells lacking TRAF3. TRAF2 and TRAF3 are generally thought to bind to the same sequence present in the cytoplasmic tails of TNFR family members (23van Kooten C. Banchereau J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). However, detailed mutagenesis analysis using the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 reveals that TRAF2 and TRAF3 exhibit subtle differences in target sequence requirement (40Pullen S.S. Miller H.G. Everdeen D.S. Dang T.T. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11836-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the atypical TRAF-binding sequence within BAFFR favors binding to TRAF3 but does not interact with TRAF2. This biochemical property may in turn contribute to the signaling specificity of BAFFR in the induction of noncanonical NF-κB activation. In support of this hypothesis, conversion of the atypical TRAF-binding motif to a conserved TRAF-binding motif renders the modified BAFFR competent to interact with both TRAF3 and TRAF2 and to target both the noncanonical and canonical NF-κB signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W1992151914,"RS1, also known as retinoschisin, is an extracellular protein that plays a crucial role in the cellular organization of the retina. Mutations in RS1 are responsible for X-linked retinoschisis, a common, early-onset macular degeneration in males that results in a splitting of the inner layers of the retina and severe loss in vision. RS1 is assembled and secreted from photoreceptors and bipolar cells as a homo-oligomeric protein complex. Each subunit consists of a 157-amino acid discoidin domain flanked by two small segments of 39 and 5 amino acids. To begin to understand how the structure of RS1 relates to its role in retinal cell adhesion and X-linked retinoschisis, we have determined the subunit organization and disulfide bonding pattern of RS1 by SDS gel electrophoresis, velocity sedimentation, and mass spectrometry. Our results indicate that RS1 exists as a novel octamer in which the eight subunits are joined together by Cys59-Cys223 intermolecular disulfide bonds. Subunits within the octamer are further organized into dimers mediated by Cys40-Cys40 bonds. These cysteines lie just outside the discoidin domain indicating that these flanking segments primarily function in the octamerization of RS1. Within the discoidin domain, two cysteine pairs (Cys63-Cys219 and Cys110-Cys142) form intramolecular disulfide bonds that are important in protein folding, and one cysteine (Cys83) exists in its reduced state. Because mutations that disrupt subunit assembly cause X-linked retinoschisis, the assembly of RS1 into a disulfide-linked homo-octamer appears to be critical for its function as a retinal cell adhesion protein.

Affected individuals show a significant loss in central and in some cases peripheral vision, a splitting of the inner layers of the retina, and a loss in the b-wave of the electroretinogram.

The secreted protein associates with the surface of rod and cone photoreceptors at the level of the inner segment, outer nuclear, and outer plexiform layers and the surface of bipolar cells within the inner nuclear and inner plexiform layers of the retina. Biochemical studies further show that RS1 is tightly associated with the membrane fraction of retinal cell homogenates (6Molday L.L. Hicks D. Sauer C.G. Weber B.H. Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar). RS1 is generally believed to function as a retinal cell adhesion protein, because mice deficient in RS1 have a highly disorganized retina with displacement of bipolar cells into the outer retinal layer, gaps between bipolar cells within the inner retina, disruption of the photoreceptor-bipolar synapse, and progressive degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors (9Weber B.H.

The dominant structural feature of the RS1 polypeptide is the 157-amino acid discoidin domain, also known as an F5/8 type C domain, which comprises over 75% of the processed polypeptide chain (4Sauer C.G.

Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These domains consist of eight antiparallel β-strands arranged in a barrel-like structure with two or three loops, or “spikes,” projecting from one end of the core structure. In the case of Factors V and VIII, the spikes are involved in the attachment of these proteins to the phosphatidylserine-rich surface of platelets as a key step in the blood coagulation process (12Fuentes-Prior P. Fujikawa K. Pratt K.P. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 313-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The discoidin domain of RS1 has been modeled from the C2 discoidin domain of Factors V and VIII (20Wu W.W.H. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28139-28146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21Fraternali F. Cavallo L. Musco G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and, like these domains, the structure consists of eight core beta strands and three spike regions. In addition to its discoidin domain, RS1 contains a 23-amino acid leader or signal sequence, followed by a 39-amino acid segment known as the Rs1 domain. The leader sequence plays an essential role in the insertion of the nascent RS1 polypeptide chain into the ER membrane. It is subsequently cleaved in the lumen of the ER by a signal peptidase as a key step in the secretion of RS1 from cells (4Sauer C.G. Gehrig A. Warneke-Wittstock R. Marquardt A. Ewing C.C. Gibson A. Lorenz B. Jurklies B. Weber B.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 20Wu W.W.H. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28139-28146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The Rs1 domain contains four cysteine residues. One of these residues, Cys59, forms an intermolecular disulfide bond with Cys223 of another subunit to form a disulfide-linked homo-oligomeric complex (20Wu W.W.H. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28139-28146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The redox state or function of the three other cysteines in the Rs1 domain has not been determined. To date more than 133 mutations in the RS1 gene have been associated with XLRS (available at www.dmd.nl/rs). HEK 293 or COS-7 cells expressing RS1 mutants have been used to understand how selected mutations cause this disease (20Wu W.W.H. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28139-28146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Wang T. Waters C.T. Rothman A.M. Jakins T.J. Romisch K. Trump D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Most disease-linked missense mutations in the RS1 discoidin domain result in severe misfolding of the protein and retention in the ER. Mutations in the leader sequence prevent insertion of RS1 into the ER membrane resulting in mislocalization of these mutant polypeptides to the cytoplasm and rapid proteolytic degradation (22Wang T. Waters C.T. Rothman A.M. Jakins T.J. Romisch K. Trump D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Finally, two disease-linked cysteine mutations (C59S and C223R) outside the discoidin domain do not significantly affect protein folding or secretion from cells (20Wu W.W.H. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28139-28146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, these mutants fail to assemble into a normal multisubunit complex suggesting that oligomerization is crucial for the functioning of RS1 as an extracellular adhesion protein. Although previous studies have shown that RS1 exists as a disulfide-linked oligomeric protein, the number and arrangement of these subunits in the native complex and the role of intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds and noncovalent interactions in the assembly and stabilization of the RS1 complex have not been investigated. In this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis and expression together with velocity sedimentation and peptide mapping by mass spectrometry to gain insight into the oligomeric structure of retinal and recombinant RS1 under native and denaturing conditions. Here, we show that native RS1 has an unusual oligomeric structure consisting of disulfide-linked dimers within a disulfide-linked homo-octameric complex. Cysteines involved in the formation of key intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bridges are identified. RS1 Cysteine Mutants and the Rs1 3R10 Monoclonal Antibody— Human RS1 cDNA was subcloned into the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) using the XhoI and HindIII restriction sites. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce the following cysteine mutations: the double mutant C59S/C223S; the triple mutants C59S/C223S/C38S, C59S/C223S/C40S, C59S/C223S/C42S, C59S/C223S/C83S, and C38S/C40S/C42S; and the quadruple cysteine mutant C38S/C40S/C42S/C83S. All constructs were sequenced to verify the presence of the desired mutations and absence of random mutations. The Rs1 3R10 antibody was purified and coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 2B as previously described (9Weber B.H. Schrewe H. Molday L.L. Gehrig A. White K.L. Seeliger M.W. Jaissle G.B. Friedburg C. Tamm E. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6222-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cell Transfections and Protein Preparation—A version of HEK 293 cells known as HEK EBNA 293 (H293) cells (American Type Culture Collection) were transfected with WT and mutant RS1 cDNA as previously described (20Wu W.W.H. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28139-28146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The cellular fraction of the protein was obtained by washing the cells twice in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4) by low speed centrifugation. The final pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of PBS containing 20 mm NEM (Calbiochem) and added to an equal volume of PBS containing 2% Triton X-100, 20 mm NEM, and Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). After stirring for 20 min at 4 °C, the solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a TLA-100.4 rotor (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) for 20 min, and the supernatant was retained for SDS gel electrophoresis. The secreted fraction of the protein was obtained by centrifuging 10 ml of the media at 300,000 × g in a TLA-75 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C for 20 min to remove any insoluble membrane material. The samples were then incubated for 2 h with the Rs1 3R10-Sepharose 2B affinity matrix. After washing with column buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 20 mm NEM), bound protein was eluted with 4% SDS in column buffer. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Proteins were denatured in a denaturing solution (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol) in the presence or absence of 4% β-mercaptoethanol and separated on 6.5% or 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels or gradient polyacrylamide SDS gels as indicated. For 6.5% or 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels, a denaturing mixture of 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, and 10% glycerol was used. For gradient gels, the above mixture was used except 1% SDS was replaced with 2% lithium dodecyl sulfate, and 2 mm EDTA was also included. Gels were transferred to Immobilon P membranes for 20 min in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine) containing 20% methanol. For analysis of the C38S/C40S/C42S/C83S mutant, a 6.5% nonreducing gel was used, and the protein was transferred for 20 min in transfer buffer containing 7% methanol. Blots were blocked with 0.5% skim milk in PBS and labeled with the Rs1 3R10 antibody containing 0.5% skim milk in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. The blots were then washed and labeled with goat-anti-mouse Ig conjugated to CW800 dye (Licor, Lincoln, NE) containing 0.5% skim milk in PBS and 0.2% SDS for 30 min for detection by the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor). For octamer analysis, the samples were run on a 4–12% NuPAGE gradient gel (Invitrogen) using 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tris, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA as the running buffer. NuPAGE gels were transferred using transfer buffer containing 25 mm bicine, 25 mm Bis-Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% methanol. The nonreduced form of bovine retinal RS1 and the nonreduced form of the C59S/C223S RS1 dimer were analyzed on 3–8% NuPAGE gradient gels under denaturing conditions. Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation of RS1 from Cell Culture Media— Human WT RS1 and the C59S/C223S mutant were transfected as described above in T150 flasks. The media containing 10% fetal calf serum was replaced the following day with fresh media. One week later, it was replaced with media containing 2% fetal calf serum. The media containing 2% fetal calf serum was harvested once a week for 2 or 3 weeks. The secreted RS1 protein was precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate (final concentration) at 4 °C and resuspended in 1/40th the volume of the cell culture media. The protein solution was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl at 4 °C. Extraction of RS1 from Bovine Retina—Bovine retinas were washed twice in low salt containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, by centrifugation at 14,000 × g in an SS-34 Sorvall rotor (Kendro Laboratory Products, Asheville, NC). The cells were then disrupted as follows: the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NEM, and Complete Protease Inhibitor and incubated for 10 min on ice, followed by several passages through a 26-gauge needle attached to a syringe. To obtain the membrane fraction, the lysed cells were applied to a 60% sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 30 min at 38,000 × g in a TLS 55 rotor (Beckman). The membranes were collected at the top of the sucrose solution and washed with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, by centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a TLA 100.4 rotor. The membranes were then incubated with 2 m urea and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The washing procedure with 2 m urea was repeated, and retinal RS1 was subsequently extracted with buffer containing 6 m urea, 10 mm CHAPS, and 0.5 m NaCl. The extract was spun down at 100,000 × g and the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.1 m NaCl to remove the urea and CHAPS. Immunoprecipitation of RS1 from Bovine Retina—RS1 was immunoprecipitated from bovine retina on an Rs1–3R10-Sepharose column as follows: Five frozen bovine retinas were thawed and treated with lysis buffer as described above. The cells were then solubilized in buffer containing 18 mm CHAPS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm NEM, Complete Protease Inhibitor, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, for 20 min and subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of the Rs1–3R10-Sepharose beads for 1 h and washed in column buffer consisting of 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 2 mm CHAPS. After elution with column buffer containing 4% SDS, the sample was denatured in SDS solution and analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis. Velocity Sedimentation of Native RS1—Bovine retinal RS1, recombinant WT RS1, and RS1 containing the C59S/C223S mutation were sedimented through a 5–20% (w/w) linear sucrose gradient containing PBS at 4 °C for 17 h and 72,449 × g in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor. Bovine retinal RS1 was obtained by urea and CHAPS extraction as described above. The secreted fraction of transfected WT and C59S/C223S RS1 was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation as described above before subjecting to velocity sedimentation. Mouse IgG having a molecular mass of 160 kDa was run as a standard. All samples were spun for 20 min at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TLA 100.4 rotor prior to loading onto the sucrose gradient to remove any insoluble material. Three-drop fractions were collected, run on reducing gels, and blotted with the Rs1 3R10 antibody. The intensity of the labeled bands was quantified with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Sucrose concentration in each fraction was determined by refractometry to plot the percentage of each protein species versus the percentage of sucrose. In-gel Proteolytic Digestion of RS1 for Mass Spectrometry—In-gel digestion was performed by punching out the Coomassie Blue-stained RS1 bands with a glass Pasteur pipette. The gel pieces were washed with water several times to remove acetic acid. They were then destained in a 1:1 mixture of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 100% acetonitrile several times. After shrinking and drying the gels with 100% acetonitrile, the gels were incubated with either 50 mm NEM for nonreducing samples, or 10 mm DTT (Sigma) followed by 50 mm IAM (Sigma) for reducing samples, washed with ammonium bicarbonate, and dried from 100% acetonitrile. The gel pieces containing the samples were then incubated with the proteases at 12 ng/μl for 30 min on ice. The protease solution was removed, and the gel pieces were overlaid with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 5 mm calcium chloride. Nonreduced samples also contained 0.6 m urea. The samples were digested for 18 h at 37 °C. The solution was collected in a tube and the gel pieces were re-extracted with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate/66% acetonitrile (basic extraction) and with 5% formic acid/66% acetonitrile (acidic extraction). The samples were pooled, dried in a SpeedVac, and resuspended in 10 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, protease-digested RS1 (2 μl) was applied to an H4 chip (Ciphergen, Fremont, CA). The sample was dried and washed with two quick rinses of water before applying 20% α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid matrix in a solvent with 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were analyzed on a surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight (Ciphergen). Masses obtained were average masses. A Qstar XL LC/MS/MS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used for MS/MS sequencing of the RS1 peptides. Trypsinized samples were obtained as above and lyophilized and reconstituted in formic acid. A PepMap C18 column, with a 3-mm particle size and 100-Å pore size column from LC Packings (Amsterdam, Netherlands) was used for peptide separation. Solvents B and A contained 20% acetonitrile in water and 5% acetonitrile in water, respectively. LC conditions started at 2% solvent B, with a gradient to 60% B over 60 min, to 95% B at 93 min, and held for 3 min before returning to 2% B. Masses obtained were monoisotopic masses. The enzymes used were trypsin (Promega, Madison WI), endo-LysC (Roche Applied Science), and endo-AspN (Roche Applied Science). Background control enzyme digestions of blank gel pieces were also performed to subtract out peaks due to autoproteolysis and other contaminating peptides. RS1 Assembles as a Disulfide-linked Homo-octamer—In previous studies, RS1 was shown to migrate on SDS gels as a 24-kDa monomer under disulfide-reducing conditions and a high molecular weight oligomer under nonreducing conditions (20Wu W.W.H. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28139-28146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine the size of the RS1 oligomer, a C38S/C40S/C42S triple mutant displaying partial disruption of the oligomeric complex was expressed, secreted from HEK 293 cells, and analyzed on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels. As shown in Fig. 1A, the secreted mutant showed a ladder of eight distinct bands ranging from the 24-kDa monomer to the prominent 185-kDa octameric protein. The secreted fraction of HEK 293 cells expressing WT RS1 was also analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 1B, a ladder of bands was also evident for WT protein when Western blots were exposed for extended times, with the 185-kDa complex being the most prominent species. Unlike the C38S/C40S/C42S mutant, however, only seven bands were resolved for WT RS1, presumably due to the masking of the heptamer by the dominant octameric complex. This was confirmed by plotting the logarithm of the apparent molecular mass for the six lower bands against the logarithm of the acrylamide percentage at which these species migrated (23See Y.P. Jackowski G. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 1-21Google Scholar). From the linear relation (Fig. 1C), the number of subunits in the prominent top band of the WT complex was calculated to be 7.7. This suggests that WT RS1, like the C38S/C40S/C42S mutant, exists as a disulfide-linked octamer. Analysis of Cysteine Residues Involved in Disulfide-linked Dimer Assembly—Previously, we showed that the Cys59 and Cys223 residues of RS1 are responsible for disulfide-linked oligomer (octamer) assembly (20Wu W.W.H. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28139-28146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Substitution of these cysteine residues with serine resulted in a loss of the disulfide-linked oligomer and the appearance of a disulfide-linked dimer when analyzed on nonreducing SDS gels. To determine which of the one or more cysteine residues in RS1 are responsible for disulfide-mediated dimer formation, we individually replaced each of four cysteine residues (Cys38, Cys40, Cys42, and Cys83) with a serine in a C59S/C223S octamer-defective mutant, and analyzed the cellular and secreted protein fractions from transfected HEK 293 cells. These four cysteines were selected because previous studies had suggested that the remaining cysteines (Cys63, Cys110, Cys142, and Cys219) are involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds within the discoidin domain (20Wu W.W.H. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28139-28146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Under disulfide-reducing conditions, all four mutants exhibited similar levels of cellular expression and secretion on SDS gels and migrated as 24-kDa monomers (Fig. 2). Under nonreducing conditions, the parent C59S/C223S mutant from the secreted fraction ran solely as a 47-kDa dimer, whereas the three C59S/C223S mutants containing an additional C38S, C42S, or C83S mutation migrated as a mixture of dimers and monomers. Only the C59S/C223S mutant containing a C40S mutation ran as the monomer under nonreducing conditions in both the cellular and secreted fractions without detectable dimer. These studies suggest that Cys40 residues of individual subunits are directly involved in dimer formation. Partial loss in dimer formation present in the C38S and C42S mutants, and to a lesser extent the C83S mutant, most likely result from structural perturbations, which partially restrict the formation of Cys40-mediated intermolecular disulfide bonds. All of these cysteine mutants exhibit an additional protein band just above the 24-kDa monomer in the cellular fraction of nonreduced gels (Fig. 2, lower left). This upper band, not found in the secreted fraction, most likely corresponds to a misfolded monomer that migrates anomalously on nonreducing SDS due to the presence of abnormal intramolecular disulfide bonds. This species is recognized by the quality control system of the ER as a misfolded protein and therefore is not secreted from the cell. RS1 Contains Disulfide-linked Dimers within the Disulfide-linked Octamer—The finding that intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed been Cys59 and Cys223, and between individual Cys40 residues of different subunits, suggests two models. In one model (Fig. 3A, left), the Cys59-Cys223 disulfide bonds are solely responsible for octamer formation, and additional Cys40 disulfide bonds form between two adjacent or opposing sub"
https://openalex.org/W2012717668,"γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and glutathione synthetase (GS), distinct enzymes that together account for glutathione (GSH) synthesis, have been isolated and characterized from several Gram-negative prokaryotes and from numerous eukaryotes including mammals, amphibians, plants, yeast, and protozoa. Glutathione synthesis is relatively uncommon among the Gram-positive bacteria, and, to date, neither the genes nor the proteins involved have been identified. In the present report, we show that crude extracts of Streptococcus agalactiae catalyze the γ-GCS and GS reactions and can synthesize GSH from its constituent amino acids. The putative gene for S. agalactiae γ-GCS was identified and cloned, and the corresponding protein was expressed and purified. Surprisingly, it was found that the isolated enzyme catalyzes both the ATP-dependent synthesis of l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteine from l-glutamate and l-cysteine and the ATP-dependent synthesis of GSH from l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteine and glycine. This novel bifunctional enzyme, referred to as γ-GCS-GS, has been characterized in terms of catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and inhibition by GSH, cystamine, and transition state analog sulfoximines. The N-terminal 518 amino acids of γ-GCS-GS (total Mr 85,000) show 32% identity and 43% similarity with E. coli γ-GCS (Mr 58,000), but the C-terminal putative GS domain (remaining 202 amino acids) of γ-GCS-GS shows no significant homology with known GS sequences. The C terminus (360 amino acids) is, however, homologous to d-Ala, d-Ala ligase (24% identity; 38% similarity), an enzyme having the same protein fold as known GS proteins. These results are discussed in terms of the evolution of GSH synthesis and the possible occurrence of a similar bifunctional GSH synthesis enzyme in other bacterial species. γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and glutathione synthetase (GS), distinct enzymes that together account for glutathione (GSH) synthesis, have been isolated and characterized from several Gram-negative prokaryotes and from numerous eukaryotes including mammals, amphibians, plants, yeast, and protozoa.

Glutathione (l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine, GSH) is the main low molecular weight thiol in many Gram-negative bacteria and in virtually all eukaryotes except those few that lack mitochondria (e.g. Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia duodenalis) (1Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. Delcardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fahey R.C. Newton G.L.

In all GSH-containing species examined to date, the tripeptide is synthesized by the sequential action of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS 1The abbreviations used are: γ-GCS, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase; GS, GSH synthetase; L-S-BSO, L-buthionine-S-sulfoximine; l-SR-MSO, l-methionine-SR-sulfoximine; l-α-[14C]Aba, l-α-Amino[14C]butyrate; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.; Reaction 1; also known as glutamate cysteine ligase) and GSH synthetase (GS; Reaction 2). The two enzymes are coded by separate genes, gshA and gshB, respectively (gsh1 and gsh2, respectively, in eukaryotes). Glutathione synthesis is not known to occur in the archaebacteria and is rare among Gram-positive bacteria, being identified to date only in some species of Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium (1Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C. Delcardayre S.B. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Davies J. Fahey R.C. Davis C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1990-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fahey R.C. Brown W.C.

Although some species of Streptococcus (e.g. Streptococcus mutans) are thought to take up GSH from their medium, R. Fahey and co-workers (1Newton G.L. Arnold K. Price M.S. Sherrill C.

L−Glutamate+L−cysteine+ATP→L−γ−Glutamyl-L-cysteine+ADP+PiREACTION 1L−γ−Glutamate−L−cysteine+glycine+ATP→GSH+ADP+PiREACTION 1 In preliminary studies, we confirmed that carefully washed S. agalactiae cells contain GSH and showed further that crude homogenates of this species are able to carry out the ATP-dependent synthesis of γ-glutamyl-α-amino[14C]butyrate from l-glutamate and l-α-amino[14C]butyrate, a standard assay for γ-GCS activity. Efforts to purify γ-GCS from S. agalactiae were partially successful but were ultimately limited by low enzyme abundance and the instability of the isolated protein. As an alternative, we searched for genomic sequences in S. agalactiae that were consistent with amino acid sequences in the isolated enzyme or that had homology to previously reported prokaryotic or eukaryotic γ-GCS or GS genes. A single sequence coding for an 85-kDa protein was identified. The N-terminal 56-kDa region of that protein is 43% similar to Escherichia coli γ-GCS. No sequences homologous to GS were identified. The putative S. agalactiae γ-GCS gene was cloned into a Qiagen pQE30 His6 tag expression vector, and the protein was expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity (∼98% pure). Proteins unrelated to the 85-kDa putative streptococcal γ-GCS were essentially undetectable. Surprisingly, the purified streptococcal γ-GCS also exhibited GS activity with a specific activity similar to that of γ-GCS. The isolated protein is the first enzyme of GSH synthesis to be identified in a Gram-positive organism and is the first bifunctional γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase-GSH synthetase (γ-GCS-GS) to be reported in any species. A similar gene occurs in several other, mostly Gram-positive bacteria including Listeria, Clostridium, Enterococcus and Pasteurella species. Biochemical reagents were from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Di-l-γ-glutamyl-l-cystine was synthesized from GSSG as described (5Strumeyer D. Bloch K. Biochem. Prep. 1962; 9: 52-55Google Scholar). l-α-Amino[14C]butyrate (l-α-[14C]Aba) (6Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 76: 268-272Google Scholar) and l-buthionine-S-sulfoximine (l-S-BSO) (7Campbell E.B. Hayward M.L. Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were synthesized as described previously. An expression strain of E. coli, SG13009, was obtained from Qiagen. A sequenced strain of S. agalactiae, 2603 V/R S. agalactiae, was obtained from ATCC (ATCC number BAA-611). E. coli plasmids were obtained commercially: pCR2.1 (BD Biosciences), pREP4 and pQE30 (Qiagen), and pRARE (Promega). S. agalactiae were grown with or without agitation at 37 °C in Todd Hewitt broth (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% yeast extract (THY medium). E. coli were grown with agitation at 37 °C in 2× YT media (per L: 16 g tryptone, 10 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl). Purification of Endogenous S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS—Endogenous S. agalactiae γ-GCS activity was isolated and partially purified from 12-liter S. agalactiae cultures by modifying protocols routinely used to purify E. coli (8Huang C.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), rat (9Seelig G.F. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and human (10Misra I. Griffith O.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) γ-GCS. In brief, S. agalactiae were grown about 8 h (A600 ∼ 1.2), and then were harvested by centrifugation (∼50-g wet cell mass) and frozen at -80 °C to facilitate cell breakage. The cells were then thawed, resusupended in isolation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm l-Glu, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and broken by passage through a French pressure cell. The crude homogenate was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a 2.5 × 20-cm column of Whatman DE-52 anion exchange resin equilibrated with the isolation buffer. After washing with isolation buffer until A280 ∼ 0, S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS was eluted with a linear gradient established between 400 ml of isolation buffer and 400 ml of isolation buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl. Fractions containing γ-GCS activity, as determined by ADP formation (see below), were pooled, made 5 mm in MnCl2, and applied to a 1 × 8-cm column of ATP affinity resin (C8-linked, 9-atom spacer; Sigma catalog no. A2767) that was equilibrated with isolation buffer that contained 5 mm MnCl2 instead of 5 mm MgCl2. The column was washed successively with ∼50 ml of equilibration buffer and ∼25 ml of the original Mg2+-containing isolation buffer. S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS was then eluted with 25 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATP. Fractions that contained γ-GCS activity were pooled and dialyzed against 8 liter of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA. Construction of Plasmids for Expression of S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS—Genomic DNA was isolated from S. agalactiae as described previously (11Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 556-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and the putative γ-GCS-GS gene (SAG1821) was isolated by PCR using a nested primer approach. Thus, a fragment containing the γ-GCS-GS gene and ∼100 bp of flanking sequences was first amplified using 5′-GATTAATAAGATTGGACTCAAAAG-3′ and 5′-ATTATGAGAATTTTTGGAATAGCG-3′ as primers. That PCR product was then inserted into a TOPO cloning vector, pCR2.1. Accuracy of the resulting plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and it was then used as a template in a second PCR step in which primers 5′-CGCGAGATCTCATGATTATCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGCTGCAGCCTAGCCTAAGGAAC-3′ were used to introduce unique BglII and PstI restriction sites (underlined) at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The amplified fragment was cut and introduced into the pQE-30 expression vector immediately downstream of the His6 tag site. The insert and flanking regions were sequenced to confirm that the vector insert matched that reported for SAG1821 (12Tellelin H. Masaignani V. Cieslewicz M.J. Eisen J.A. Peterson S. Wessels M.R.

Expression and Purification of S. agalactiae γ-GCS—To facilitate expression, S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS was expressed in SG13009 E. coli cells that were transformed with either pREP4 or pRARE in addition to the γ-GCS-GS-bearing pQE-30 plasmid. The pREP4 plasmid, containing the lacI repressor, was used to prevent β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-independent expression. The pRARE plasmid contains the lacI repressor and also codes for ten tRNAs that recognize six codons known to be rare in E. coli (AUA, AGG, AGA, CUA, CCC, and GGA). The pQE-30, pREP4, and pRARE plasmids code for ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol resistance, respectively. Successful expression required fresh transformation of competent SG13009 [pREP4] or SG13009 [pRARE] E. coli with the γ-GCS-GS-bearing pQE-30 plasmid. A single transformant colony was then used to inoculate a 50-ml starter culture in 2× YT medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and either 50 μg/ml kanamycin or 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After growing overnight, 10-ml aliquots of that culture were used to inoculate each of four 1-liter flasks of 2× YT medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. Growth was at 37 °C, and expression of S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS was induced with 1 mm β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when A600 was ∼0.6. Following an additional 15 h of growth at 25 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and a portion of the cells (∼25 g, ∼50% of culture yield) was resuspended in ∼50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm l-glutamate, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were broken by passage through a French pressure cell. Unused cells could be stored at -80 °C for subsequent enzyme isolations. The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 143,000 × g for 75 min, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a column (2 × 8 cm) of Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm l-glutamate, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After washing with equilibration buffer, γ-GCS-GS was eluted using the same buffer supplemented with 200 mm imidazole. Fractions were monitored for protein (A280), and those eluted with imidazole-containing buffer were assayed for γ-GCS activity and GS activity using the ADP formation assays described below. Fractions showing significant amounts of both activities were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 8 liters of 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA. Purified enzyme was stored in dialysis buffer at 4 °C or in small aliquots at either -20 or -80 °C in dialysis buffer containing 25% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). Determination of Quaternary Structure of S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS—The Mr of S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS was estimated by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA. The proteins and other molecules used to produce the standard curve were as follows: thyroglobin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa) (“Gel Filtration Standards”; Bio-Rad). Blue dextran was included to identify the void volume. Standard and sample load volumes were 250 μl, and the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were monitored spectrophotometrically at 280 nm and at 620 nm (blue dextran). For γ-GCS-GS samples, both the γ-GCS and GS activities were assayed and found to co-elute. Assay of ADP Formation by γ-GCS or GS—To assay γ-GCS activity, amino acid-dependent ADP formation was monitored using a pyruvate kinase- and lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay modified from a previously described procedure (10Misra I. Griffith O.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In brief, standard reaction mixtures (final volume 1.0 ml) contained 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm ATP, 40 mm MgCl2, 100 mm l-glutamate, 10 mm l-cysteine (or 25 mm l-α-aminobutyrate), 10 mm phospho(enol)pyruvate, 0.42 mm NADH, 12.5 mm ammonium sulfate, 20 IU pyruvate kinase, and 30 IU lactate dehydrogenase. Reaction mixtures were equilibrated to 37 °C, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS. Background rates were determined in the absence of l-cysteine or l-α-Aba and subtracted. The rate of ADP formation was assumed to equal the rate of NADH oxidation as monitored at 340 nm (ϵ = 6.2 mm-1). One unit of γ-GCS activity is the amount of enzyme forming 1 μmol of product/h. Assay mixtures for determination of GS were similar to those used for γ-GCS, except l-glutamate and l-cysteine (or l-α-Aba) were replaced by 25 mm l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteine (generated in situ by the addition of dithiothreitol to stock solutions of di-l-γ-glutamyl-l-cystine) and 25 mm glycine. Background rates were determined in the absence of l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteine. One unit of GS is the amount of enzyme forming 1 μmol of product/h. All kinetic studies characterizing the Km values of γ-GCS and GS substrates were made using the ADP formation assays. Assay of Dipeptide Synthesis by γ-GCS and GSH Synthesis by GS—To determine dipeptide formation by the γ-GCS activity of S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS, the incorporation of l-α-[14C]Aba into l-γ-glutamyl-l-α-[14C]Aba or the incorporation of l-[35S]cysteine into l-γ-glutamyl-l-[35S]cysteine was quantitated. Reaction mixtures contained, in a final volume of 1 ml, 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, 100 mm KCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, 10 mm ATP, 20 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 mm l-glutamate, 10 mm l-α-[14C]Aba (or 2.5 mm l-[35S]cysteine), 9 units pyruvate kinase, and 1 mm aminooxyacetic acid (to inhibit contaminating transaminases). Reactions were initiated by the addition of crude homogenate or purified γ-GCS-GS, and portions (100 μl) were removed at specified time points and quenched by addition to ice-cold 20 mm acetic acid (1 ml). A 1-ml portion of those solutions was applied to a small column (0.5 × 8 cm) of Dowex 1 (acetate form), and the resin was then washed with 5 column volumes (10 ml) of 20 mm acetic acid to remove unreacted radioactive starting material. Dipeptide product was then eluted with 1.5 m ammonium acetate (4 ml) and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. A similar method, involving the incorporation of [14C]glycine into l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl[14C]glycine ([14C]GSH), was used to determine GSH formation by the GS activity (14Oppenheimer L. Wellner V.P. Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5184-5190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were identical to those described for γ-GCS above, except 20 μm [14C]glycine was added and either 10 mm l-cysteine replaced radiolabeled l-cysteine or l-α-Aba (combined γ-GCS and GS assay) or 25 mm l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteine (generated in situ as described above) replaced both l-glutamate and radiolabeled l-cysteine or l-α-Aba. Synthesis of GSH by γ-GCS-GS was confirmed by assaying for GSH directly. Reaction mixtures contained, in a final volume of 1 ml, 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm ATP, 40 mm MgCl2, 100 mm l-glutamate, 10 mm l-cysteine, 25 mm glycine, 10 mm phospho(enol)pyruvate, and 20 IU pyruvate kinase. Reactions were initiated by the addition of S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS. At set time points, 1- or 10-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture and assayed immediately for GSH as described below. Assay of GSH—Total GSH (GSH + 2× GSSG) was assayed as described previously (15Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar) using a GSSG reductase-dependent enzymatic recycling method based on a procedure originally described by Tietze (16Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5575) Google Scholar). Quantitation was made using a standard curve constructed with 0-5 nmol of GSH. Reaction mixtures contained, in a final volume of 1 ml, 125 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 6.3 mm EDTA, 0.21 mm NADPH, 0.6 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 0.9 IU of yeast GSSG reductase. Reactions were initiated by adding aliquots of a γ-GCS-GS reaction mixture (as described above) or of crude extract (as described below), and the rate of 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reduction, which is linearly proportional to total GSH added, was monitored at 412 nm. To determine the total GSH content of bacteria, 50-ml cultures were grown in appropriate media (THY for S. agalactiae, 2× YT for E. coli used as controls) for ∼18 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice by suspension in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline followed by recentrifugation. The cell pellet was then suspended in 500 μl of 20 mg/ml lysozyme in phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were broken by sonication (three 30-s pulses) on ice. Crude homogenates were clarified by centrifugation, and 20 μl of 50% 5′-sulfosalicyclic acid was added to a 200-μl aliquot of the supernatant to precipitate protein. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was assayed for total GSH as described. To confirm that S. agalactiae were able to synthesize GSH rather than simply take it up from the medium, S. agalactiae extracts were assayed for GSH levels after S. agalactiae was grown in chemically defined medium that lacked GSH (17Willett N.D. Morse G.E. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 91: 2245-2250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other than changing the growth medium, these studies were done identically to those described above. Inhibition of γ-GCS-GS by l-S-BSO—To characterize initial binding of l-S-BSO (i.e. reversible, competitive inhibition), a Ki was determined using the standard γ-GCS assay for ADP formation with l-glutamate concentrations ranging from 17 to 100 mm and l-S-BSO concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 mm. To characterize irreversible inhibition by l-S-BSO (i.e. mechanism-based inactivation), kinact, KD, and the t1/2 for inactivation were determined. In these studies, S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS was preincubated in 500-μl reaction mixtures containing 210 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm ATP, 35 mm MgCl2, and varying amounts of l-S-BSO (0.62-3.1 mm) at 37 °C. At set time points ranging from 1 to 30 min, 5-μl aliquots were removed and assayed for residual activity using the standard γ-GCS assay for ADP formation. Inhibition progress curves were plotted for each concentration of l-S-BSO (log % remaining activity versus time), and the apparent kinact values were calculated from the slopes of those lines. Reciprocals of the apparent kinact values were replotted versus 1/[l-S-BSO] to establish 1/kinact (y intercept) and -1/KD (x intercept). l-Methionine-SR-sulfoximine (l-SR-MSO) was tested similarly. Inhibition by GSH—GSH was tested as a competitive inhibitor for both the γ-GCS and GS activities of S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS using the ADP formation assays. Substrate concentrations of glutamate and γ-glutamylcysteine were altered to be at approximately Km levels (γ-GCS: l-glutamate, 25 mm; l-cysteine, 10 mm; GS: l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteine, 5 mm; glycine, 25 mm), and GSH was added at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 mm. GSSG was similarly tested for possible inhibition of the γ-GCS activity. Inhibition by Cystamine—Cystamine (0-100 mm) was tested as a possible inhibitor or inactivator of either the γ-GCS and GS activities of S. agalactiae γ-GCS-GS using a procedure similar to that used with GSH. Evidence that S. agalactiae Cells Synthesize GSH and Contain γ-GCS Activity—In preliminary studies, we confirmed that S. agalactiae, grown and washed as described under “Methods,” contain substantial levels of GSH as determined by a GSSG reductase-based enzymatic recycling assay (15Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). Using three independent cultures, levels of total GSH (GSH + 2× GSSG) in S. agalactiae and, for comparison, E. coli were 304 ± 11 and 19 ± 3 nmol GSH/mg of protein, respectively. As reported for some other facultative anaerobes (3Fahey R.C. Brown W.C. Adams W.B. Worsham M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GSH levels in S. agalactiae were found to be sensitive to growth conditions, being 3-fold lower in unagitated (i.e. less aerobic) cultures. To verify that S. agalactiae are able to synthesize rather than simply take up GSH, S. agalactiae were also grown in a chemically defined medium lacking GSH (see “Methods”), and crude homogenates were assayed for total GSH. Total GSH was 327 ± 12 nmol/mg protein for three independent, agitated cultures. γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was determined in crude homogenates of S. agalactiae and E. coli using a dipeptide formation assay in which l-glutamate and l-α-[14C]Aba are converted to radiolabeled l-γ-glutamyl-l-α-Aba (l-α-Aba is stable and frequently used as a surrogate for l-cysteine in established E. coli (8Huang C.-S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and mammalian (9Seelig G.F. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 10Misra I. Griffith O.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) γ-GCS assays). As shown in Fig. 1, crude homogenates of S. agalactiae form l-γ-glutamyl-l-α-Aba, albeit at rates substantially less that seen with a native E. coli strain (JM105). Although the endogenous activity is relatively low, we were able to isolate and partially purify a protein with γ-GCS activity from homogenates of S. agalactiae. In typical preparations, homogenates from ∼50 g of cell paste were clarified by centrifugation and sequentially chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose and ATP affinity resins to provide up to ∼20 μg of protein having estimated γ-GCS specific activities of 1400 ± 800 units/mg (overall activity yields typically 1-9%). For the best preparation, the isolated protein exhibited two major bands (85 and 55 kDa) on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Efforts to improve the purification protocol by adding steps useful with E. coli or mammalian γ-GCS (e.g. ammonium sulfate fractionation or gel filtration chromatography) met with no success. Furthermore, the isolated enzyme was found to lose γ-GCS activity quickly (>50% in 24 h) when stored at 4, -20, or -80 °C, with or without glycerol. Identification and Cloning of the S. agalactiae γ-GCS Gene and Expression and Purification of the Protein—Both major protein bands from the gel in Fig. 2 were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF analysis of the resulting fragments. The 55-kDa band could not be identified, but the 85-kDa band corresponded to a 1923-bp (641-amino acid) sequence in a 2797-bp contig (gbsa09061:s_agalactiae-strainA909) in the then partially completed S. agalactiae genome. 2H.

https://openalex.org/W2022466672,"Oculodentodigital dysplasia, a rare condition displaying congenital craniofacial deformities and limb abnormalities, has been associated with over 20 known human connexin43 (Cx43) mutations. The localization of two of these mutants, G21R and G138R, was examined in Cx43-positive normal rat kidney cells (NRK) and Cx43-negative gap junctional intercellular communication-deficient HeLa cells. Green fluorescent protein-tagged and untagged Cx43 G21R and G138R mutants were transported to the plasma membrane and formed punctate structures reminiscent of gap junction plaques in both NRK and HeLa cells. Further localization studies revealed no significant trafficking defects as subpopulations of Cx43 mutants were found in both the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes, not unlike wild-type Cx43. Dual patch clamp functional analysis of the mutants expressed in gap junctional intercellular communication-deficient N2A cells revealed that neither G21R nor G138R formed functional gap junction channels, although they successfully reached cell-cell interfaces between cell pairs. Importantly, when either mutant was expressed in NRK cells, dye coupling experiments revealed that both mutants inhibited endogenous Cx43 function. These studies suggest that, although patients suffering from oculodentodigital dysplasia possess one wild-type Cx43 allele, it is likely that Cx43-mediated gap junctional intercellular communication is reduced below 50% because of a dominant-negative effect of mutant Cx43 on wild-type Cx43.

Gap junctions are protein intercellular channels that link adjacent cells to allow for the exchange of small ions and molecules less than 1 kDa in size (1Alexander D.B. Goldberg G.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 2045-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Protein constituents of gap junctions, connexins, oligomerize to form hemichannels that dock with symmetrical connexin arrangements from the adjacent cell to form gap junction channels. At the cell surface, hundreds of gap junction channels cluster to form gap junction plaques (2Saez J.C. Berthoud V.M. Branes M.C. Martinez A.D. Beyer E.C. Physiol.

The molecular arrangement of a connexin consists of four transmembrane regions with both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains exposed to the cytosol, two extracellular loops, and one intracellular loop (2Saez J.C.

Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 564-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There are at least 21 unique connexins expressed in the human genome (6Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D.

Adhes. 2003; 10: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Because many cells express more than one connexin isoform, they can combine to form both homomeric and heteromeric hemichannels as well as both homotypic and heterotypic intercellular gap junction channels (8Evans W.H. Martin P.E. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). This diversity of combinations defines the nature of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), which in turn regulates many important physiological and developmental processes (2Saez J.C. Berthoud V.M. Branes M.C. Martinez A.D. Beyer E.C. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1359-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Connexin mutations are linked to several human diseases. Many mutations in Cx32 are associated with the peripheral neuropathy known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth X-linked disease (9Nelis E. Haites N. Van Broeckhoven C. Human Mutat. 1999; 13: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mutations in Cx26 account for roughly half of all cases of inherited non-syndromic deafness (10Steel K.P. Nat.

The first human disease found to be linked to germ line Cx43 mutations was oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) (14Gladwin A. Donnai D. Metcalfe K. Schrander-Stumpel C. Brueton L. Verloes A.

ODDD is a rare autosomal-dominant human disorder in which patients display symptoms of congenital craniofacial deformities and limb abnormalities (14Gladwin A. Donnai D. Metcalfe K.

Neurological symptoms are also frequent in this disorder with evidence of mild mental retardation (16Loddenkemper T. Grote K. Evers S. Oelerich M. Stogbauer F. J. Neurol. 2002; 249: 584-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To date, over 70 reports of the clinical features of ODDD in over 240 patients have been described (16Loddenkemper T. Grote K. Evers S. Oelerich M. Stogbauer F. J. Neurol. 2002; 249: 584-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The ODDD locus was mapped to chromosome 6q22-q24 by linkage analysis (14Gladwin A.

Genet. 2004; 41: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to characterize the distribution and functional properties of two of these mutants, G21R and G138R, which show a non-conservative amino acid change from a neutral glycine to a charged arginine (Fig. 1). G21R is predicted to be located within the first transmembrane domain, which is considered to be an important motif for connexin insertion into the membrane (19Falk M.M. Gilula N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7856-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). G138R is located within the intracellular loop, which has been shown to have gating function as proposed by the “ball and chain” model of channel regulation in which the carboxyl tail acts as a gating particle that interacts with the “receptor” encoded within the intracellular loop (21Morley G.E. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1294-1302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 22Morley G.E. Ek-Vitorin J.F. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. J. Cardiovasc.

It was the purpose of this study to examine the functional properties of select Cx43 disease-linked mutants, G21R or G138R, in an attempt to provide insight into the pathophysiology underlying the ODDD condition. Cells and Reagents—All culture media and reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Normal rat kidney (NRK), mouse neuroblastoma (N2A), and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were cultured in regular high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine (except N2A cells), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained at 37 °C in a moist environment of 95% air and 5% CO2 and subcultured as required. DNA Constructs and Transfection—Two Cx43 mutants (underline indicates nucleotide change in the following sequences) were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as directed. The G21R mutation was made by changing the nucleotide G to A at position 61. The G138R mutation was made by changing the G to A at position 412 and the T to G at position 414. The primer sequences used to generate the G21R mutation were forward 5′-GCCTACTCAACTGCTAGAGGGAAGGTGTGGCTG-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGCCACACCTTCCCTCTAGCAGTTGAGTAGGC-3′. The primer sequences used to generate the G138R mutation were forward 5′-GAAGTTCAAGTACAGGATTGAAGAGCATGG-3′ and reverse 5′-CCATGCTCTTCAATCCTGTACTTGAACTTC-3′. Following sequence verification, the wild-type Cx43, G21R, and G138R were cloned into the BamH1 and HindIII restriction sites of the pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Cx43, G21R, and G138R cDNAs were also cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences, Clontech, La Jolla, CA), using the BamH1 and KpnI restriction sites. The GFP tag was fused to the carboxyl-terminal of wild-type Cx43, G21R, and G138R after removal of the stop codon. The PCR primers used to engineer GFP-tagged constructs consisted of forward 5′-CGGGGTACCAACATGGGTGACTGGAGC-3′ and reverse 5′-CGCGGATCCTTGATCTCCAGGTCATCAG-3′. DNA sequencing was performed by the Robarts Research Institute DNA Sequencing Facility (London, ON, Canada) using an Applied Biosystems 3730 analyzer and compared with human Cx43 sequences available from NCBI. HeLa, NRK, and N2A cells were grown to 50–75% confluency in 60-mm culture dishes and transfected at 37 °C in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) containing Lipofectamine 2000 and 1–2 μg of plasmid cDNA. After 5 h, DNA/Lipofectamine suspension was removed and replaced with culture medium. Transfection efficiency was determined 24–48 h later by visualizing live or fixed cells under a fluorescence microscope. Immunofluorescent Labeling and Imaging—Following transient transfections with wild-type or mutant DNA plasmid, cells grown on 12-mm coverslips were fixed in ice-cold 80% methanol and 20% acetone solution for 10 min at 4 °C and then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and prepared for immunolabeling as previously described (24Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, immunolabeled with primary antibody, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and immunolabeled with appropriate secondary antibody. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and rinsed in double distilled H2O. The coverslips were mounted on slides with Airvol (Air Products & Chemicals, Inc., Allentown, PA) before storage at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used included rabbit anti-Cx43 polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution; Sigma), anti-Cx43 monoclonal antibody, P4G9 (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Antibody Development Group, Seattle, WA), mouse anti-trans-Golgi network38 antibody (1:200 dilution; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), rabbit anti-giantin antibody (1:1000 dilution; BAbCO, Richmond, CA), and rabbit/mouse anti-lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2) antibodies (1:40 dilution; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA; 1:50 dilution; H4B4; NICHD, National Institutes of Health Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA). Appropriate anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:200 dilutions) conjugated to fluorescein or Texas Red were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (Westgrove, PA). Hoechst 33342 (1:1000 dilution; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as a nuclear stain. Immunofluorescently labeled cells were imaged on a Zeiss (Thornwood, NY) LSM 510 META confocal microscope mounted on an inverted Axiovert 200 motorized microscope equipped with a ×63 oil (1.4 numerical aperture) objective. Fluorescent signals were imaged after excitation with 488, 543, or 730 nm laser lines produced by argon, heliumneon, or tunable Chameleon multiphoton lasers, respectively. All fluorescent signals were collected on a photomultiplier after a passage through appropriate filter sets. Digital images were prepared using Zeiss LSM, Adobe Photoshop 7.0, and CorelDraw software. Western Blotting and Densitometry—Lysates of NRK cells collected 48 h after transient transfection with 1 μg of cDNA encoding Cx43-GFP or GFP-tagged mutants were subjected to Western blotting as we have previously described (24Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Blots were immunolabeled for Cx43 using an anti-Cx43 monoclonal antibody, Cx43NT-1 (1:500; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Antibody Development Group, Seattle, WA). To estimate the ratio of GFP-tagged Cx43 and mutants to endogenous Cx43, unsaturated blots were scanned and densitometry was performed using Kodak Digital Science 1D 2.0 software to determine the total band intensities of both GFP-tagged and untagged Cx43. The ratio of GFP-tagged Cx43 and mutants to endogenous Cx43 was corrected for transfection efficiency, which was determined by counting all cells in five random fields of 92167 μm2 and calculating the percentage of cells exhibiting GFP fluorescence. Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Functional gap junctional coupling between paired N2A cells expressing human Cx43-GFP, G21R-GFP, or G138R-GFP was assessed using the dual whole-cell voltage clamp technique (25Srinivas M. Costa M. Gao Y. Fort A. Fishman G.I. Spray D.C. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 673-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cells were constantly perfused in an external solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CsCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, 5 mm d-glucose, 2 mm pyruvate, and 1 mm BaCl2, pH 7.4. Individual N2A cell pairs with obvious green fluorescent plaque(s) located at the junctions between the two cells were selected for recording. Junctional current was measured between cell pairs by using the dual whole-cell voltage-clamp technique with Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifiers (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA) at room temperature (22–25 °C). Recording patch pipettes were prepared with a puller (PP-83; Narishige Scientific Instrument, Tokyo, Japan). The patch pipette had a resistance of 3–5 mΩ when filled with an internal solution containing 130 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgATP, 2 mm Na2ATP, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, with CsOH. Data were filtered at 2 kHz and were acquired using pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments Inc.) and digitized at a 5–10 kHz sampling rate. Each cell of a pair was initially held at a common holding potential of 0 mV. To evaluate junctional coupling, 300-ms hyperpolarizing pulses from the holding potential of 0 to -20 mV were applied to one cell to establish a transjunctional voltage gradient (Vj), and the junctional current was measured in the second cell. Macroscopic junctional conductance (gj) was calculated, gj = Ij/Vj, where Ij is the measured junctional current and Vj is transjunctional voltage. The experimenter was blind to the connexin subtypes when performing the patch clamp experiments. Microinjection—NRK cells transiently transfected with cDNA encoding Cx43-GFP, G21R-GFP, or G138R-GFP were selected for microinjection. One cell within a cluster of NRK cells expressing the GFP-tagged protein was pressure microinjected with 1% Lucifer yellow in 0.15 m LiCl (Molecular Probes) until the cell was brightly fluorescent (<5 s) using an Eppendorf FemtoJet automated pressure microinjector. After 1 min, the percent of microinjected cells that transferred Lucifer yellow to at least one contacting cell was determined using a Leica DM IRE2 inverted epifluorescent microscope. In the case of cells expressing wild-type Cx43-GFP, dye transfer always spread to more than three cells. Digital images were collected with a charged coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) using OpenLab software (distributed by Quorum Technologies, Inc., Guelph, ON). As an internal control for every population of cells being assessed, NRK cells that did not express GFP-tagged Cx43 or Cx43 mutants were microinjected with Lucifer yellow as described above to ensure that the population of NRK cells remained functionally coupled during the experimental procedure. At least 30 microinjections were performed for each experimental condition. Cx43 Mutants Are Transported to, and Cluster at, the Cell Surface in the Presence or Absence of Endogenous Cx43—To determine the localization patterns of G21R and G138R Cx43 mutants, cDNA constructs were engineered where wild-type and Cx43 mutants were tagged with GFP (Fig. 1) and expressed in NRK and HeLa cells. GJIC-competent NRK cells, which express endogenous Cx43, were chosen to approximate the ODDD condition, where patients have one wild-type and one mutant Cx43 allele and thus are expected to co-express both wild-type and mutant Cx43. Exogenous wild-type and mutant Cx43 were readily identifiable by the covalently tagged GFP moiety. Confocal microscopy revealed that Cx43-GFP, G21R-GFP, and G138R-GFP were all transported to the cell surface when expressed in NRK cells and formed structures consistent with the appearance of gap junction plaques (Fig. 2, B–D), similar to that of endogenous Cx43 (Fig. 2A). Likewise, when Cx43-GFP, G21R-GFP, and G138R-GFP were expressed in GJIC-deficient and Cx43-negative HeLa cells, both wild-type and mutants were transported to the cell surface and formed structures reminiscent of gap junctions (Fig. 3, A–F). Additionally, an enrichment of intracellular structures that displayed inclusion body-like profiles was exhibited in HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged Cx43 and mutants (Fig. 3). Untagged wild-type and mutant Cx43 exhibited similar distribution patterns as the GFP-tagged connexins (Fig. 3, G–I), reducing the possibility that GFP was significantly altering connexin trafficking.Fig. 3Cx43 mutants exhibit intracellular localization patterns similar to Cx43-GFP in GJIC-deficient HeLa cells. HeLa cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding human Cx43-GFP, G21R-GFP, or G138R-GFP, fixed, and immunolabeled for the lysosomal protein LAMP-2 or a constituent resident protein of the Golgi apparatus (giantin). Similar to Cx43-GFP (A and D), both G21R-GFP (B and E) and G138R-GFP (C and F) were localized to the cell surface with profiles typical of gap junctions (arrows). A subpopulation of wild-type and mutant Cx43 localized to lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus (A–F, note yellow color). Small images represent the localization of Cx43, Cx43 mutants, and resident organelle proteins in gray scale (A1,2-–F1,2). Untagged wild-type (G, green) G21R (H, green), and G138R (I, green) Cx43 were localized to the cell surface with distribution profiles similar to their GFP-tagged counterparts. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (G–I, blue). Bars = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the intracellular compartments containing Cx43 mutants, NRK and HeLa cells expressing the mutants were immunolabeled with antibodies specific for resident proteins of the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes. Because Cx43 and the mutants were readily transported to the cell surface in NRK cells, no significant population of wild-type Cx43 or mutants co-localized with the resident Golgi protein, TGN-38 (Fig. 2, B–D), or with the endoplasmic reticulum resident, protein disulfide isomerase (data not shown). However, in HeLa cells, a subpopulation of wild-type and mutant Cx43 co-localized with the constituent lysosomal protein, LAMP-2 (Fig. 3, A–C), and the resident Golgi protein, giantin (Fig. 3, D–F). Cx43 Mutants Failed to Form Functional Gap Junction Channels when Expressed in N2A Cells—To determine whether the Cx43 mutants were able to form gap junction channels, GFP-tagged wild-type and G21R and G138R mutants were expressed in N2A cells. Cell pairs that had clear green plaque-like structures at cell interfaces were selected to perform dual whole-cell voltage clamp experiments, and the junctional conductance was determined. As expected, when Cx43-GFP, G21R-GFP, or G138R-GFP were expressed in N2A cells, they were transported to cell surfaces and formed structures consistent with the appearance of gap junction plaques between cell pairs (Fig. 4, A–C). Through blind analyses, 92% of cell pairs expressing Cx43-GFP exhibited cell coupling, whereas both mutants showed a complete absence of electrical coupling (Table I).Table ICx43 mutants are non-functional when expressed in N2A cellsProteinNo. of pairs recordedNo. of pairs coupledPercentage of couplingConductance (mean ± S.E.)Estimated number of channels*nSCx43-GFP24229235 ± 6350G21R-GFP240000G138R-GFP240000 Open table in a new tab Cx43 Mutants Exhibited a Dominant-negative Effect on Endogenous Cx43 in NRK Cells—To determine whether Cx43 mutants have a functionally dominant effect on endogenous Cx43, NRK cells expressing endogenous Cx43 were transfected with cDNAs encoding Cx43-GFP, G21R-GFP, or G138R-GFP and microinjected with the gap junction permeable dye, Lucifer yellow (Fig. 5, A–I). As expected, microinjected NRK cells overexpressing Cx43-GFP, in addition to endogenous Cx43, exhibited a high incidence of dye coupling (97%) consistent with wild-type NRK cells (26Feldman P.A. Kim J. Laird D.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Conversely, NRK cells expressing either the G21R-GFP or G138R-GFP mutant exhibited a marked decrease in the incidence of dye coupling with neighboring cells (17 and 13%, respectively) (Table II), suggesting that both G21R and G138R are functionally dominant when co-expressed with endogenous Cx43.Table IICx43 mutants exert a dominant-negative effect on endogenous Cx43-mediated GJIC when expressed in NRK cells GJIC-competent NRK cells expressing Cx43-GFP, G21R-GFP, or G138R-GFP were microinjected with Lucifer yellow, and dye transfer from injected cells was assessed.

Quantification of Western blots combined with an evaluation of the transfection efficiency revealed that Cx43 mutants were in 4.0–5.1-fold excess of endogenous Cx43 (Fig. 5J). Several studies have characterized the clinical features of ODDD and raised possible mutations linked to this disorder (14Gladwin A. Donnai D. Metcalfe K. Schrander-Stumpel C. Brueton L. Verloes A.

Recently, ODDD was definitively linked to mutations in the GJA1 gene encoding the gap junction protein, Cx43 (15Paznekas W.A. Boyadjiev S.A. Shapiro R.E. Daniels O. Wollnik B. Keegan C.E. Innis J.W.

However, because the specific cellular manifestations of such Cx43 mutants have not yet been established, our studies examined the localization and functional properties of two Cx43 mutants, G21R and G138R. Four major classes of Cx43 mutations are theoretically possible. The first includes those mutations that have no discernible effect on the normal operation of the gap junction channel, which could effectively be considered benign polymorphisms. The second class includes mutants that continue to assemble into gap junction channels, but with altered properties. For example, several mutant forms of Cx32 associated with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease hav"
https://openalex.org/W2150401271,"We studied estrogen effects on osteoclastic differentiation using RAW264.7, a murine monocytic cell line. Differentiation, in response to RANKL and colony-stimulating factor 1, was evaluated while varying estrogen receptor (ER) stimulation by estradiol or nonsteroidal ER agonists was performed. The RAW264.7 cells were found to express ERα but not ERβ. In contrast to RANKL, which decreased ERα expression and induced osteoclast differentiation, 10 nm estradiol, 3 μm genistein, or 3 μm daidzein all increased ERα expression, stimulated cell proliferation, and decreased multinucleation, with the effects of estrogen ≥ daidzein > genistein. However, no estrogen agonist reduced RANKL stimulation of osteoclast differentiation markers or its down-regulation of ERα expression by more than ∼50%. Genistein is also an Src kinase antagonist in vitro, but it did not decrease Src phosphorylation in RAW264.7 cells relative to other estrogen agonists. However, both phytoestrogens and estrogen inhibited RANKL-induced IκB degradation and NF-κB nuclear localization with the same relative potency as seen in proliferation and differentiation assays. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the direct effects of estrogen on osteoclast precursor differentiation and shows that, in addition to effecting osteoblasts, estrogen may protect bone by reducing osteoclast production. Genistein, which activates ERs selectively, inhibited osteoclastogenesis less effectively than the nonselective phytoestrogen daidzein, which effectively reproduced effects of estrogen. We studied estrogen effects on osteoclastic differentiation using RAW264.7, a murine monocytic cell line. Differentiation, in response to RANKL and colony-stimulating factor 1, was evaluated while varying estrogen receptor (ER) stimulation by estradiol or nonsteroidal ER agonists was performed. The RAW264.7 cells were found to express ERα but not ERβ. In contrast to RANKL, which decreased ERα expression and induced osteoclast differentiation, 10 nm estradiol, 3 μm genistein, or 3 μm daidzein all increased ERα expression, stimulated cell proliferation, and decreased multinucleation, with the effects of estrogen ≥ daidzein > genistein. However, no estrogen agonist reduced RANKL stimulation of osteoclast differentiation markers or its down-regulation of ERα expression by more than ∼50%. Genistein is also an Src kinase antagonist in vitro, but it did not decrease Src phosphorylation in RAW264.7 cells relative to other estrogen agonists. However, both phytoestrogens and estrogen inhibited RANKL-induced IκB degradation and NF-κB nuclear localization with the same relative potency as seen in proliferation and differentiation assays. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the direct effects of estrogen on osteoclast precursor differentiation and shows that, in addition to effecting osteoblasts, estrogen may protect bone by reducing osteoclast production. Genistein, which activates ERs selectively, inhibited osteoclastogenesis less effectively than the nonselective phytoestrogen daidzein, which effectively reproduced effects of estrogen. Estrogen is a key regulator of skeletal mass. Most estrogen effects are mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs) 1The abbreviations and schematic names used are: ER, estrogen receptor; estradiol, 17-β-estradiol; genistein, 5,7,4-trihydroxyisoflavone; daidzein, 7,4-trihydroxyisoflavone; CSF, colony-stimulating factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear κB ligand; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. 1The abbreviations and schematic names used are: ER, estrogen receptor; estradiol, 17-β-estradiol; genistein, 5,7,4-trihydroxyisoflavone; daidzein, 7,4-trihydroxyisoflavone; CSF, colony-stimulating factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear κB ligand; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. α and β, which are ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators. ERα, the classical sex-related receptor, has a wide tissue distribution and is found in osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors as well as osteoblasts; ERβ is primarily found in epithelial and mesenchymal tissues, including the mesenchymal stem cell-derived bone-forming cells, osteoblasts. There are also estrogen-binding proteins that are not transcription factors, and some estrogenic effects are mediated by membrane receptors linked to calcium (1.Brubaker K.D. Gay C.V. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 2.Guo Z. Krucken J. Benten W.P. Wunderlich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7044-7050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The effects of estrogens on skeletal cells are complex, and the mechanism(s) of action are controversial (reviewed in Ref. 3.Rickard D.J. Subramaniam M. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 32–33: 123-132Crossref Google Scholar). However, transgenic and knock-out mice with varying ERα and ERβ expression established that estrogen effects on bone involve ERα and ERβ, which modulate signaling pathways involving Erk and nitric oxide and perform direct transcriptional activity (4.Cuzzocrea S. Mazzon E. Dugo L. Genovese T. Di Paola R. Ruggeri Z. Vegeto E. Caputi A.P. Van De Loo F.A. Puzzolo D. Maggi A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1098-10107Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Estrogen responses in mesenchymal stem cell-derived bone-forming cells, osteoblasts, are extensively studied. The effects of estrogens on osteoblasts include regulation of synthesis of the osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL relative to its inhibitor osteoprotegerin (5.Bord S. Ireland D.C. Beavan S.R. Compston J.E. Bone (N. Y.). 2003; 32: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 6.Viereck V. Grundker C. Blaschke S. Siggelkow H. Emons G. Hofbauer L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which may secondarily regulate osteoclast formation and activity.In contrast, primary estrogen effects on osteoclast differentiation and function are largely uncharacterized. ERα is present in osteoclasts (7.Oreffo R.O. Kusec V. Virdi A.S. Flanagan A.M. Grano M. Zambonin-Zallone A. Triffitt J.T. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 111: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas ERβ is controversial. By immune localization, ERβ is reported in the nuclei of human osteoclasts (8.Braidman I.P.

Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 2309-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), but only ERα is reported to be found in isolated human osteoclast precursors or murine pre-osteoclastic RAW264.7 cells (10.Vegeto E.

Graulet A.M. de Vernejoul M.C. Cohen-Solal M.E. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2002; 13: 39-45PubMed Google Scholar). Available precedents suggest that the effects of estrogen on osteoclast progenitors and osteoclast differentiation may be more important than the effects on formed osteoclasts (12.Shevde N.K. Pike J.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 2683-2692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Fiorelli G. Gori F. Petilli M. Tanini A. Benvenuti S. Serio M. Bernabei P. Brandi M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

How osteoclast precursors respond to estrogen was the focus of the present study.We examined the effects of estrogen and nonsteroidal ER agonists genistein and daidzein on the proliferation and differentiation of murine RAW264.7 cells. Genistein (5,7,4-trihydroxyisoflavone) and daidzein (7,4-trihydroxyisoflavone) are naturally occurring plant substances that activate ER phytoestrogens. Substantial evidence shows that phytoestrogens have a protective effect against a variety of disorders related to steroid receptors or, in some cases, protein kinase-mediated signaling (15.Anderson J.J. Garner S.C. Bailliere's Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 2: 543-557Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16.Barnes S. Kim H. Darley-Usmar V. Patel R. Xu J. Boersma B. Luo M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 656S-657SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phytoestrogens are alternatives to estrogen replacement, but the effects of phytoestrogens on osteoclast differentiation are not clear. By receptor competition, genistein and daidzein have on the order of 1% the solution affinity of estradiol-17β. When studied by comprehensive luciferase promoter assays, genistein has a higher affinity for ERβ, with relative selectivity for ERβ at lower concentrations (17.Kuiper G.G. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, phytoestrogens give variable results depending on the cell type expressing the ER and on the target gene; in osteoblasts, genistein-regulated ERα-dependent transcription has been demonstrated (18.Rickard D.J. Monroe D.G. Ruesink T.J. Khosla S. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). There is particular interest in the differential effects of genistein relative to other ER agonists because of the additional properties of genistein, which inhibits several enzymes. These enzymes include protein tyrosine kinases, DNA topoisomerases I and II, and especially Src and ribosomal S6 kinase (16.Barnes S. Kim H. Darley-Usmar V. Patel R. Xu J. Boersma B. Luo M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 656S-657SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Akiyama T. Ishida I. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S.I. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other phytoestrogens, including daidzein, have no known enzyme inhibitory properties. The effect of genistein on kinase cascades is theorized to be the leading cause of the antiproliferative effects of genistein, with cell cycle arrest in G2M. In contrast, daidzein can be pushed to toxic concentrations without altering the cell cycle (20.Su S.J. Yeh T.M. Lei H.Y. Chow N.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 230-236PubMed Google Scholar).Our study examined the effects of estrogen and phytoestrogens on osteoclast precursors using the murine monocytic line RAW264.7, and we induced differentiation with recombinant cytokines. Osteoclastic features are induced in RAW264.7 by RANKL with much higher efficiency and reproducibility than can be achieved in untransformed cells, allowing subtle differences to be resolved. The in vitro differentiation model also avoids interference from mesenchymal family cells such as osteoblasts, which preclude separation of direct and indirect estrogen effects on osteoclast formation in vivo. Cell proliferation, fusion, and expression of osteoclast differentiation markers were studied as well as the effects of estrogen on key differentiation pathways. The experiments show that all of the estrogen agonists reduce RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, with the effects of daidzein being surprisingly similar to those of estradiol, but that genistein has a lower potency.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Murine monocytic RAW264.7 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4 mm l-glutamine, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Other cell lines used were as described previously (14.Cao L. Bu R. Oakley J.I. Kalla S.E. Blair H.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of steroids on growth or differentiation, media were charcoal-stripped and without phenol red. For osteoclast generation, cells at 2 × 104/cm2 were supplemented with 50 ng/ml RANKL and l0 ng/ml CSF-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Test substances (genistein, daidzein, and estradiol) were from Sigma. The Src inhibitor PP1 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). For proliferation assays, cells were plated at 1.25 × 104/cm2 and incubated for 24 h prior to the addition of estrogens or phytoestrogens, which were diluted from ethanol solutions with ethanol at the same concentration, generally 0.1%, added to control cultures.RNA-based Assays—Total RNA was isolated by guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (TRIzol, Invitrogen). mRNA was purified by oligo(dT) affinity (RNEasy, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First strand cDNA synthesis used oligo(dT) primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript, Invitrogen). Real time PCR used brilliant SYBR Green fluorescent DNA intercalating dye as the analyte. The dye was purchased in a master mixture containing nucleotides and buffer (Stratagene), and 2.5 mm Mg, 100 nm ± templates, and first strand mixture from 10 ng of RNA was added. After 10 min at 95 °C, cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C were performed with an MX3000P (Stratagene). Results, determined as mean threshold cycle for three replicates, were used to calculate the ratio of cDNA to matched control or were compared with GAPDH or actin, assuming linearity of the threshold cycle to log (initial copies). Primers for amplification of 80–200 nucleotide segments of murine double-stranded DNA were ERα (GenBank™ M38651), (+) ACACTGTGTTCAACTACCCCGAG and (–) CAGGCTGTTG-GGACTGAAGG; ERβ (GenBank™ U81451) Set 1, (+) TCTGTCCAGCCACGAATCAG and (–) AGCTTTTACGCCGGTTCTTG; Set 2, (+) CCTGGCTTTGTGGAGCTCAG and (–) GCTTTCCAA-GAGGCGGACTT; Set 3, (+) AATGCTCACACGCTTCGAGG and (–) GCACTCAGACCCCGAGATTG; and GAPDH (GenBank™ XM354601), (+) CAATGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCT and (–) GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTACCC.Proliferation, Viability, and Differentiation Assays—The number of live cells was determined by labeling with 0.5 mg/ml thiazolyl blue (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma) for 3 h (21.Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45566) Google Scholar), and total cell number was determined by labeling nuclei with 2 μm acridine orange. DNA synthesis was assayed by the [3H]thymidine incorporation (14.Cao L. Bu R. Oakley J.I. Kalla S.E. Blair H.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells expressing tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase were detected by their degradation of naphthol AS-BI phosphate substrate, pH 5, in acetate buffer, with 10 mm tartrate added to inhibit other acid phosphatases and fast garnet diazonium salt added to demonstrate degraded substrate as a red precipitate.Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell suspensions were produced by treating cultures with 0.2% EDTA and 0.05% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and fixed with 70% ethanol. Nuclei were labeled with 7-amino-actinomycin D (BD Biosciences). A FACSCalibur cytometer (Beckman-Coulter) with 488 nm laser excitation detecting 543–627 nm fluorescence was used for analysis. Data were obtained as the time span of half-height detector pulse and integrated pulse fluorescence to allow separation of singlet and multiple cells by doublet discrimination (22.Wersto R.P. Chrest F.J. Leary J.F. Morris C. Stetler-Stevenson M.A. Gabrielson E. Cytometry. 2001; 46: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). G0G1, S, and G2M groups were determined using data with singlet cells only by Dean-Jett-Fox analysis (23.Fox M.H. Cytometry. 1980; 1: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with FlowJo 3.4 software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA). Apoptotic cells were determined as hypodiploid sub-G1 cells (24.Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4408) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies—Protein extraction was performed at 0–4 °C. Cells were washed and lysed by adding 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, with 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min. Protein was measured by alkaline copper reduction with bicinchoninic acid (absorbance at 660 nm) (Pierce). Twenty-microgram samples were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels in Laemmli buffers and transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, blots were stripped for 20 min in 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, at 50 °C. Tyrosine 416-specific rabbit phospho-Src antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) was used at 1:1000. Monoclonal anti-actin (Sigma) was used at 1:500. Anti-Erk p44/42 and anti-phospho Erk p44/42 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:2000. Rabbit anti-IκB-α, rabbit anti-NF-κB, and rabbit anti-phospho-NF-κB p65 (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:2000 or at 1:25 to label NF-κB within fixed cells on glass. Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat peroxidase-labeled antibodies from Amersham Biosciences, used at 1:500 unless specified. For labeling of NF-κB cytoplasmic and nuclear components, secondary antibody was Alexafluor488-labeled goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), used at 1:500.Nuclear and Cytoplasmic NF-κB—RAW264.7 cells were plated on glass coverslips, and after the treatments indicated above, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized for 6 min with methanol at –20 °C. Labeling was at room temperature by incubation with anti-NF-κB p65 for 1 h followed by 1 h in secondary antibody. Cells were secondarily labeled with rhodamine phalloidin following immune labeling. Coverslips were mounted in 80% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mg/ml phenylenediamine for analysis. Images were acquired on a Nikon TE2000 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Spot 12-bit 1600 × 1200 pixel CCD camera. Green fluorescence used excitation at 450–490 nm, a 510-nm dichroic filter, and a 520-nm barrier. Red fluorescence used excitation at 536–556 nm, a 580-nm dichroic filter, and a 590-nm barrier. Fluorescent labels were photographed using 1.3 numerical aperture ×40 or ×100 oil objectives.RESULTSEstrogen Receptors in RAW264.7 Cells with or without Estrogen Agonists and RANKL—Because ER responses are central to the study, we examined the effect of estrogen on ER expression. ERs can be detected by Western blot with enhanced chemiluminescence in some cells, including osteoblasts (14.Cao L. Bu R. Oakley J.I. Kalla S.E. Blair H.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This approach did not give an adequate signal in RAW264.7 cells, so PCR and quantitative real time PCR were used. No ERβ was amplified (to 40 cycles on PCR or 50 cycles on real time PCR) from over a dozen cDNAs from RAW264.7, in growth or differentiation media with or without estrogen or phytoestrogen treatment. These studies used three different probe sets that amplified ERβ in MG63 or MCF7 cells. In addition, a Taqman-pretested ERβ real time PCR probe set (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used with the same result (Fig. 1.A) In contrast, ERα was uniformly positive, and quantitative assays showed ERα mRNA in RAW264.7 cells in growth or differentiation media, with or without estrogen agonists. As expected from reports that osteoclasts have less ER expression than precursor cells (11.Ramalho A.C. Couttet P. Baudoin C. Morieux C. Graulet A.M. de Vernejoul M.C. Cohen-Solal M.E. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2002; 13: 39-45PubMed Google Scholar), differentiation medium reduced ERα cDNA ∼75% relative to GAPDH (Fig. 1B). The estrogen agonists all counteracted this effect partially but significantly. In this case, the effects of the two phytoestrogens at 3 μm were slightly larger than those of estradiol at 10 nm, a high but physiological estradiol concentration.Effect of Estrogen Agonists on Growth and Differentiation of RAW264.7 Cells—All media were phenol red-free and charcoal-stripped to avoid interference by serum steroids. Differentiation medium, with 50 ng/ml RANKL and 10 ng/ml CSF-1, had a large negative effect on proliferation and, as expected, resulted in the formation of large numbers of TRAP-expressing polykaryons. Estradiol, 10 nm, had significant positive effects on cell proliferation by thymidine incorporation at 5 days (Fig. 2A) or on the total cell number, as determined with a Coulter counter (Fig. 2B). Estradiol had negative effects on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, which was assessed by the number of TRAP-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). Genistein and daidzein, 3 μm, had smaller effects in the same direction as estrogen, which sometimes did and sometimes did not reach significance; in most cases, differences in the effect of genistein were smaller than those of daidzein. The increases in cell number relative to RANKL and CSF-1 only and the decreased formation of TRAP-expressing osteoclast-like cells with estrogen or phytoestrogens suggested that estrogens reduce osteoclast formation and may retain cells in the proliferating pool of mononuclear cells. However, the effects of genistein and daidzein were smaller than those of estrogen and could not be clearly resolved by these methods; subsequent analysis will show that these differences are, however, meaningful. The concentrations of phytoestrogens used were such that maximal effects could be seen. These effects were consistent with maximal concentrations for estrogen transcription effects of genistein or daidzein in plasmid reporter studies (17.Kuiper G.G. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Gustafsson J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 10–7 m, the effects on RAW264.7 cell proliferation or differentiation were not measurable, whereas at 10–5 m, cell viability decreased. The concentration dependence of estrogen on Erk and NF-κB response was also determined directly. These determinations are described below.Fig. 2Effect of RANKL and estrogen agonists on DNA synthesis, cell number, and TRAP expression. A, DNA synthesis in growth media and differentiation media with and without phytoestrogens and estrogen. Relative to growth medium, differentiation media supported much lower rates of DNA synthesis (first versus second bar, note discontinuous scale). Estrogen agonists (3 μm genistein or daidzein, 10 nm estradiol-17β) had a modest but consistent counteracting effect (third, fourth, and fifth bars). In this determination, which is typical of several similar studies, thymidine incorporation in RANKL plus genistein or estradiol was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that in differentiation medium alone, but differences in RANKL with and without daidzein did not reach significance. B, total cell number in 5-day cultures under the same conditions as in A. A Coulter counter was used to measure the cell number after 25,000 cells were incubated for 5 days. The cell number was dramatically reduced by the differentiation medium (second bar), with a trend toward increased cell number (but not statistical significance) in genistein and daidzein and a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in estradiol (right bar). C, numbers of TRAP-positive cells in media. There were essentially no osteoclasts in growth medium (left bar) and many in RANKL-containing media (second bar). The phytoestrogens had a trend toward fewer TRAP-positive cells, but differences were modest and typically did not reach significance by manual cell counts. In cultures with RANKL and estradiol (far right bar) there was, however, a significant decrease in the number of TRAP-positive cells relative to RANKL alone. The phytoestrogen effects were, however, consistent with higher resolution studies by flow cytometry (Fig. 5), which show the same order of potency, estradiol > daidzein > genistein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Phytoestrogens on Osteoclast Differentiation—Beyond the modest effects of estrogen and phytoestrogen on cell number and TRAP-expressing cells, there were qualitative differences in the appearance of TRAP-positive cells, suggesting that estrogen, and to a lesser extent genistein and daidzein, reduced cell fusion and multinucleation (Fig. 3). Qualitative differences, such as the size of multinucleated cells, are notoriously difficult to determine by microscopy, so the cell cultures were analyzed by flow cytometry at 2-day intervals after the addition of differentiation agents. This method, which is illustrated in the supplemental material, used doublet discrimination analysis, Dean-Jett-Fox cell cycle analysis (23.Fox M.H. Cytometry. 1980; 1: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and sub-G1 populations to define single cells in the growth cycle, multinucleated cells, and apoptotic nuclei (22.Wersto R.P. Chrest F.J. Leary J.F. Morris C. Stetler-Stevenson M.A. Gabrielson E. Cytometry. 2001; 46: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23.Fox M.H.

Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4408) Google Scholar). Results of multinucleation, cell cycle, and apoptosis analysis for cells 2 days post-RANKL are shown (Fig. 4). This analysis showed a clear reduction in multinucleation and in total numbers of nuclei in multinucleated cells by genistein, daidzein, and estradiol. The effects of genistein were clearly intermediate between differentiation medium alone and the effect of estradiol, which was on the order of 60% at two days. The effects of daidzein were smaller in terms of total nuclei in multinucleated cells and were not statistically different from those of estrogen.Fig. 3Effect of estrogen and phytoestrogens on osteoclast differentiation. Each frame is a phase/TRAP photograph of a representative field from a 6-day culture without RANKL (left frames) or in medium with 50 ng/ml RANKL and 10 ng/ml CSF-1 (second frames). In the subsequent frames, the effect of 3 μm genistein, daidzein, or 10 nm estradiol is shown. The top row is a low power view, and the bottom row is a higher power view to show multinucleated TRAP-expressing cells (magenta, OC). There were a few TRAP-expressing cells (red) without RANKL, showing that spontaneous TRAP expression occasionally occurs in growth medium. Occasional foreign body-like differentiation (spread cells) also occurred, but ∼99% of the cells were ∼10 μm round macrophage-like cells. In contrast, in differentiation medium there were many large multinucleated TRAP-expressing cells. The TRAP-expressing cells in estradiol (far right frames) were smaller than those in the differentiation medium, and there were more unfused cells, whereas genistein or daidzein had intermediate appearances. Magnification is the same in all top frames, and all bottom frames are at twice the magnification of the top frames.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Effect of estrogens and phytoestrogens on multinucleation. A, comparison of the number of nuclei in multinucleated cells. Histograms for RANKL and CSF without or with phytoestrogens and estrogen are shown. The method is illustrated in the supplemental material. The average of two determinations and range are shown. The number of multinucleated cells without RANKL was small and is not illustrated. Relative to differentiation medium alone, all of the test substances reduced multinucleation, with estrogen being the most efficient, and with the largest number of multinucleated cells still having only two nuclei. In daidzein or genistein, the number of multinucleated cells was reduced but with smaller effects. B, number of nuclei in multinucleated cells by flow analysis. These data show the product of the number of cells for each nuclear number multiplied by the number of nuclei. The mean ± range for 2 determinations, each counting 25,000 events, is shown. All of the phytoestrogens had significantly reduced multinucleation, with effect of estrogen > daidzein > genistein. Differences between daidzein and estradiol did not reach significance, but all other differences were significant (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Estrogens and Phytoestrogens Reduce S-phase Cells and Modify the Apoptosis Rate—The effects of RANKL, phytoestrogens, and estrogen on the cell cycle are shown (Fig. 5A). Although many cells left the cell cycle, with differentiation and multinucleation (Fig. 4), of cells remaining in the cell cycle (shown in supplemental material), RANKL had surprisingly little effect other than a clear suppression of apoptosis (Fig. 5B).

https://openalex.org/W2031206331,"The NF-κB p50/p50 homodimer is mainly associated with transcriptional repression. Previously, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of NF-κB p50 Ser337 is critical for DNA binding. Here, we report that p50 Ser337 is constitutively phosphorylated by the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKAc) in three different cell types, which may account for the constant binding of p50/p50 to DNA in unstimulated cells. This was demonstrated first by showing that treatment of cells with PKAc-specific inhibitors blocked p50/p50 DNA binding. Second, phosphorylation of p50 by PKAc was prevented by substitution of Ser337 to alanine. Third, both p50 and PKAc proteins as well as kinase activity that phosphorylates p50 were found to co-fractionate following gel filtration chromatography. Finally, PKAc and p50 were shown to be able to reciprocally co-immunoprecipitate one another, and their physical association was blocked by a PKA catalytic site inhibitory peptide. This indicates that phosphorylation of p50 Ser337 involves direct contact with the PKAc catalytic center. In contrast to the dramatic elevation of nuclear p50/p65 heterodimers induced by tumor necrosis factor α, DNA binding of p50/p50 homodimers was not greatly altered. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time that there is a direct interaction between PKAc and p50 that accounts for constitutive phosphorylation of p50 Ser337 and the existence of DNA bound p50/p50 in the nuclei of most resting cells. This mechanism of DNA binding by p50/p50 following phosphorylation of Ser337 by PKAc may represent an important means for maintaining stable negative regulation of NF-κB gene expression in the absence of extracellular stimulation.

The nuclear factor NF-κB is a transcription factor identified by Sen and Baltimore nearly 20 years ago (1Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). NF-κB plays a critical role in transcription regulation of genes involved in immune response, inflammation, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis (2Chen L.F. Greene W.C.

Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, five members of NF-κB family have been identified. These include RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p50/p105), and NF-κB2 (p52/p100). All of these proteins share a highly conserved Rel homology domain termed RHD within the N-terminal 300 amino acid region. The RHD is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and interaction with IκB inhibitory proteins. Although all NF-κB family members can bind to DNA, only p65, RelB, and c-Rel contain a transactivation domain in their C-terminal regions. The NF-κB family members can form various homodimers and heterodimers among which the p50/p65 heterodimer is the most abundant and studied species. In most resting or unstimulated cells, p50/p65 heterodimers are confined in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by forming a complex with IκB proteins. Treatment of cells with NF-κB stimuli such as cytokines, mitogens, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide leads to phosphorylation of IκB by IκB kinase and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of IκB by the 26 S proteasome (7Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar, 8Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). This allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to many target promoters and transactivates gene expression. NF-κB transactivation activity requires phosphorylation of p65 at specific serine residues, which mediates interaction of NF-κB with transcriptional cofactors including CBP/p300 (9Zhong H. Voll R.E.

Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). A number of protein kinases have been identified for p65 phosphorylation. In response to lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; PKAc, protein kinase A catalytic subunit; MSK1, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole; PKI, PKA-specific peptide inhibitor; wt, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. treatments, protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKAc) and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK1), respectively, can phosphorylate serine 276 (Ser276) within the RHD of p65 (11Vermeulen L.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3910-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition, casein kinase II and IκB kinase α are able to phosphorylate Ser529 and Ser536, respectively, in the C-terminal transactivation domain (14Wang D. Westerheide S.D. Hanson J.L.

Other kinases including Ca2+/calmodulin kinase IV and cyclic GMP-dependent kinase have also been reported to phosphorylate p65 in the C-terminal region, although the exact phosphorylation site(s) has not been determined (17He B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20005-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In all of these cases, phosphorylation of p65 resulted in elevated transactivation activity of NF-κB. Because of the lack of transactivation domains, p50 is considered to be mainly responsible for DNA binding. Indeed, NF-κB DNA binding requires phosphorylation of p50 (19Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P.

Longo D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30089-30092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of p50 was shown to dramatically enhance the stability of the NF-κB DNA complex (22Li C.C. Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30089-30092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, p50 phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating NF-κB activity. In addition, p50 itself can form p50/p50 homodimers, which generally function as transcriptional repressors by inhibiting transactivation of p50/p65 heterodimers (10Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S.

In contrast to the cytoplasmic confinement of p50/p65 heterodimers, p50/p50 homodimers are found in the nuclei of most resting cells and are capable of DNA binding (10Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E.

This suggests that p50 is phosphorylated in resting cells. However, little is known about how p50 is phosphorylated and what kinase(s) is involved. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that Ser337 of p50 is phosphorylated and is critical for DNA binding (19Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45994-45998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Substituting this serine with an alanine dramatically reduced p50/p50 DNA binding activity. We now provide evidence showing that p50 Ser337 is phosphorylated by PKAc constitutively in different cell types. This is the first kinase that has ever been demonstrated to be responsible for p50 phosphorylation. We propose that this phosphorylation is essential to the mechanism by which p50/p50 homodimers maintain transcriptional repression of NF-κB target genes in unstimulated cells. Cell Culture—HeLa, COS-7, and KAd5 cells were cultured as described previously (19Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol.

Rabbit anti-PKAα catalytic subunit (PKAc, C-20) and goat anti-p50 (C-19), p65 [(A)-G], and MSK1 (H-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-PKAc antibody NT was acquired from Upstate Biotechnology. Rabbit anti-p50 (#1613), p65 (#1226), and IκBα (#1258) were kind gifts of Nancy Rice. Plasmids—Wild type (wt) p50 cDNA clones pCMV-hp50, pGEX-mp50, and their mutants pCMV-hp50S337A and pGEX-mp50S337A, respectively, were described previously (19Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45994-45998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To clone mouse PKAc, cDNA of the gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using primers 5′-TATAAGCTTCCACCATGGGCAACGCCGCCGCCGCC-3′ and 5′-ATATCTAGACTAAAACTCAGTAAACTCCTTGC-3′. PCR products were then cloned into BamHI and XbaI sites of plasmid pRC/CMV (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing. Cell Transfection—Transfection of COS-7 was performed using GeneJammer transfection regent (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Nuclear, Cytoplasmic, and Whole Cell Extracts—Nuclear, cytoplasmic and whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (19Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45994-45998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Kushner D.B. Ricciardi R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Gel Kinase Assay—200 μg of cytoplasmic proteins or 100 μg of nuclear proteins of HeLa cells was fractionated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%) containing purified glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-p50 wt, or mutant peptide (residues 249–363) with a serine to alanine mutation at position 337 (S337A) (6 μg/μl). After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice at room temperature for 1 h in 200 ml of 20% isopropanol in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, followed by another wash in buffer A (50 mm Tris, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0). The gel was denatured by washing twice in 200 ml of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 1 h and then renatured with five washes in 250 ml of buffer A containing 0.04% Tween 40 over a 18-h period at 4 °C. After incubation in 150 ml of kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCL2, pH 7.9) for 30 min at room temperature, the gel was soaked in 20 ml of kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (12.5 μCi/ml) for 1 h. The gel was washed extensively with 5% (w/v) of trichloroacetic acid containing 1% sodium pyrophosphate until the wash solution was free of radioactive counts. The gel was then dried and autoradiographed. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analyses—500 μg of cell lysates were precleared with protein G beads in 0.5 ml of PBS-NP buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.2% Nonidet P-40). Precleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1.2 μg of antisera at 4 °C overnight. Protein G beads were then added; immunocomplexes were collected 2 h later and washed four times with 800 μl of PBS-NP buffer. Immunoblot analysis was conducted as described before (21Kushner D.B. Ricciardi R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against PKAc as described above or fractionated on a gel filtration column (Superdex 200 HR 10/30, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitated complexes and the chromatographic fractions were then used for in vitro kinase assay as described (19Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45994-45998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was conducted as described previously (31Kralli A. Ge R. Graeven U. Ricciardi R.P. Weinmann R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6979-6988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide of the MHC class I R1 enhancer region, which contains an NF-κB recognition site, was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used as the probe as described elsewhere (19Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45994-45998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation Is Required for DNA Binding of p50/p50 Homodimers in HeLa Cells—p50/p50 homodimers have been found in the nuclei of many unstimulated cells including HeLa cells (10Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 23Driessler F. Venstrom K. Sabat R. Asadullah K. Schottelius A.J. Clin. Exp.

To test if p50/p50 in the nuclei of HeLa cells is phosphorylated and is able to bind to DNA, nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed for DNA binding by EMSA. A 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide of the R1 region of the MHC class I enhancer, which contains a recognition site for both p50/p50 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers, was used as a probe for the gel shift assay. DNA binding of only p50/p50 (but not p50/p65) was observed in unstimulated HeLa cells (Fig. 1, lane 1). This was confirmed by the ability to supershift with a p50 antibody but not a p65 antibody (lanes 3 and 4). Consistent with our previous findings that dephosphorylation prevents p50/p50 DNA binding (20Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3212-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Kushner D.B. Ricciardi R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), treatment of the HeLa cell nuclear extracts with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase completely abolished DNA binding of p50/p50 (lane 2). This result suggests that in HeLa cells constitutive phosphorylation of p50 is essential for DNA binding of the homodimer. Next we examined whether the p50/p50 DNA binding in HeLa cells could be enhanced by cytokine treatment as occurs with the p50/p65 heterodimer. As shown in Fig. 1, the p50/p50 DNA complexes were not significantly affected by treatment with TNFα (lane 5). This is in sharp contrast to the dramatic increase in p50/p65 DNA binding (lane 5) as identified by supershift with both p50 and p65 antibodies (lanes 7 and 8). As expected, calf interestinal alkaline phosphatase treatment abrogated the DNA binding activity of both the homodimer and the heterodimer in the cytokine treated HeLa cells (lane 6). Moreover, Western blot analysis on a native gel confirmed that TNFα treatment leads to a significant translocation of only p50/p65 heterodimers (data not shown). These findings emphasize that DNA binding of p50/p50 and p50/p65 is regulated by phosphorylation. In particular, the presence of only p50/p50 DNA binding in unstimulated HeLa cells, which is not influenced by cytokine induction, suggests that an unknown kinase phosphorylates p50 constitutively. In this regard, HeLa cells provide an excellent system for identifying the kinase that is responsible for phosphorylating p50. PKA Inhibitor H89 Blocks p50/p50 DNA Binding in Different Cell Types—To examine what kinase(s) is involved in the constitutive phosphorylation of p50, we first performed an in gel kinase assay using cytoplasmic extracts from HeLa cells as a source of kinases. Because phosphorylation of p50 Ser337 is critical for DNA binding (19Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45994-45998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), wt p50 peptide (residues 249–363) fused to GST served as the substrate (GST-p50). The negative control substrates were GST and GST-S337A, in which the p50 249–363 peptide contained a serine to alanine substitution at position 337. As shown in Fig. 2, there was little or no difference in kinase activities for the two control substrates GST and the p50 mutant GST-S337A when cytoplasmic extracts of HeLa cells were assayed (lanes 1 and 2). This result indicates that the p50 mutant cannot be phosphorylated by any kinase present in the HeLa cell extract. Compared with GST and the p50 mutant GST-S337A proteins, the wt p50 substrate GST-p50 generated three phosphorylated bands displaying greater kinase activity (denoted by arrows, lane 3). One of the kinase bands was ∼40 kDa and the other two were ∼90 kDa in mass. It is noted that because of the application of the denaturation-renaturation procedure of the in gel kinase assay the molecular masses assigned to the kinases represent the approximate sizes of their catalytic subunits. These data imply that there might be three different kinases in the cytoplasm involved in p50 Ser337 phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained when cytoplasmic extracts of TNFα-treated HeLa cells were subjected to in gel kinase assay (data not shown). This suggests that the cytokine does not activate additional kinases that are involved in p50 Ser337 phosphorylation. Interestingly, no difference in kinase activities was observed between GST-p50 and the two negative control substrates GST and GST-337A when nuclear extracts of unstimulated or TNFα-treated HeLa cells were analyzed (data not shown). These results indicate that p50 Ser337 is constitutively phosphorylated in the cytoplasm. Several potential kinases could phosphorylate the p50 Ser337 based on the sequence surrounding this residue (LRRKSDLE) as well as the sizes of the kinases determined by the in gel kinase assay. These kinases, with molecular masses of their catalytic subunits indicated, include PKA (∼41 kDa), casein kinase II (∼44 kDa), Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II (∼50 kDa), cyclic GMP-dependent kinase (∼85 kDa), and p90 RSK (∼90 kDa) and MSK1 (∼90 kDa). Because MSK1 is exclusively located in the nucleus (32Ballif B.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 397-408PubMed Google Scholar), this kinase seems unlikely to be involved in p50 Ser337 phosphorylation. To investigate if p50 is a substrate of any of these kinases that is critical for p50/p50 DNA binding, HeLa cells were treated with chemical inhibitors, and then EMSA analysis was performed. Treatment with KN-62, U0–126, and KT5823, which inhibit Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II, p90 RSK (through the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases) and cyclic GMP-dependent kinase, respectively, had little or no effect on p50/p50 DNA binding (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 3 and 6 of the upper panel) when compared with the mock treatment (lane 1). Casein kinase II inhibitor DRB blocked p50/p50 homodimer binding but surprisingly promoted p50/p65 heterodimer binding (lane 4). H89, a potent inhibitor of PKA, greatly inhibited p50/p50 DNA binding (lane 5). Western blot analysis using the same extracts confirmed the presence of equal amounts of p50 for each binding assay (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Similar results were obtained with KAd5 cells (Fig. 3B), which are mouse BALB/c kidney cells transformed by adenovirus type 5 (32Ballif B.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 397-408PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that in KAd5 cells, p50 is hyperphosphorylated and NF-κB binds to DNA constitutively (21Kushner D.B. Ricciardi R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Liu X. Ge R. Ricciardi R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Treatment of KAd5 cells with H89 inhibited both p50/p50 and p50/p65 DNA binding activities (Fig. 3B, lane 5). In contrast, there was little or no inhibition effect on NF-κB DNA binding when the other inhibitors were applied (lanes 1–4 and 6). Interestingly, DRB treatment increased p50/p65 heterodimer binding (Fig. 3B, lane 4), which is consistent with the result obtained from HeLa cells. To further determine the kinase(s) for p50 phosphorylation, p50 plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells in which the expression of NF-κB proteins is minimal. Following transfection, the cells were treated with the kinase inhibitors mentioned above, and whole cell extracts were then prepared and analyzed by EMSA. Treatment with H89 led to a decreased p50/p50 DNA binding (Fig. 3C, lanes 6 and 7), although DRB also reduced the homodimer binding activity (lane 5). In agreement with the results obtained from HeLa and KAd5 cells, the other reagents exhibited little or no inhibition in p50/p50 DNA binding (lanes 2–4 and 8). Because only H89 consistently inhibited p50 DNA binding activity in the three different cell types tested, it is likely that PKA is the major kinase responsible for p50 phosphorylation. PKAc Is the Kinase Responsible for Constitutive Phosphorylation of p50 Ser337—Although the above data indicate that PKA is likely responsible for phosphorylation of p50, we cannot absolutely exclude the possibility that MSK1 is also involved because H89 can inhibit both PKA and MSK1. To address this, HeLa cells were treated with cell-permeable myristoylated PKA-specific inhibitory peptide (Myr-PKI), which contains a serine to alanine substitution within the consensus sequence for PKA substrates. Because the ERK signaling pathway is involved in MSK1 activation (32Ballif B.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 397-408PubMed Google Scholar), HeLa cells were also treated with cell-permeable ERK inhibitory peptide (ERKI). As seen in Fig. 4, constitutive DNA binding of p50/p50 was blocked by Myr-PKI in HeLa cells (lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, the DNA binding activity was not affected by ERKI (lane 4) or mock treatment (lane 1). Furthermore, when HeLa cells were treated with a combination of inhibitors SB203580 and PD98059, which completely inhibit MSK1 by blocking the p38 and ERK signaling pathways, respectively (11Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vanden Berghe W. Haegeman G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), no change was observed for p50/p50 DNA binding (data not shown). These results strongly indicate that PKA, rather than MSK1, is the kinase responsible for p50 phosphorylation. To demonstrate that cellular PKA can directly phosphorylate p50, we performed an in vitro kinase assay. PKA was immunoprecipitated from HeLa and KAd5 cells using an antibody against PKAc. The immunopellet was then analyzed for kinase activity using substrates GST-p50 wt and GST-S337A, which contain residues 249–363 of p50. As expected, the immunoprecipitated PKAc from both cell types was able to phosphorylate the wt p50 (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 3) but failed to phosphorylate the mutant p50 S337A (lanes 2 and 4). This is in agreement with our previous finding that purified PKAc is able to phosphorylate wt p50 but not mutant p50 S337A produced from bacteria (19Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45994-45998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, no kinase activity was immunoprecipitated with a control antibody (data not shown). To further characterize p50 phosphorylation, lysates of HeLa cells were fractionated on a gel filtration column, and fractions were analyzed by in vitro kinase assay. Although several fractions were able to phosphorylate the wt p50 substrate to some extent, fraction 8 distinctly exhibited the highest kinase activity (Fig. 5B). Coinciding with this, the level of PKAc was the greatest in fraction 8 as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5B). Significantly, the endogenous p50 level also peaked in the same fraction as with PKAc. Contrarily, the regulatory subunit of PKA (PKAr) was not detected in fraction 8, whereas the NF-κB inhibitor protein IκBα was present in every fraction tested. Because Ser337 is the only PKA consensus phosphorylation site in p50, these results suggest that PKAc is the kinase responsible for p50 Ser337 phosphorylation and that PKAc (but not PKAr or IκBα) is likely associated with cellular p50. The fact that MSK1 was found only in fraction 10 provided further evidence that this kinase does not contribute to p50 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). The PKA holoenzyme is comprised of two inactive catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits leads to dissociation and activation of the catalytic subunits. To examine if p50 phosphorylation by PKAc relies on cAMP levels, we treated HeLa cells with cAMP analogues 8-Br-cAMP and dibutyryl cAMP as well as cAMP antagonist Rp-8-Br-cAMP. Gel shift analyses using nuclear extracts revealed that these treatments had no effect on p50/p50 DNA binding (data not shown). This indicates that p50 phosphorylation by PKAc is independent of cAMP. Next we performed immunoprecipitation-Western blot analyses to determine the association of PKAc with p50. PKAc and p50 plasmids were co-transfected into COS-7 cells. After 24 h, whole cell extracts were prepared and used for immunoprecipitation-Western blot analyses with antibodies against PKAc and p50. As shown in Fig. 6A, PKAc and p50 were reciprocally co-immunoprecipitaed from the transfected cells by antibodies against p50 and PKAc, respectively, but not by control IgG nor when lysates from non-transfected COS-7 cells were used. Co-immunoprecipitation of PKAc and p50 was also obtained from HeLa and KAd5 cells (Fig. 6B). To further confirm the association of PKAc with p50, we tested if PKAc-specific inhibitory peptide PKI 6–22 amide could interfere with the interaction between PKAc and p50. To this end, lysates of HeLa cells were first incubated with different amounts of the PKI and then subjected to immunoprecipitation-Western blot analyses. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the PKI peptide inhibited the interaction between PKAc and p50 in a dose-dependent manner. Because PKI binds to the catalytic center of PKAc, these data demonstrate that PKAc physically associates with p50 via its catalytic site.Fig. 7Inhibition of PKAc and p50 interaction by PKI. Lysates of HeLa cells were incubated with different amounts of PKI 6–22 amide, which binds to the catalytic site of PKAc. The PKI-treated lysates were immunoprecipitated with p50 antibody and analyzed by Western blot using PKAc antibody as the probe. IgG cont, control IgG.

Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45994-45998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that PKAc is the kinase responsible for p50 Ser337 phosphorylation in a cAMP-independent manner. Substitution of Ser337 abolished p50 phosphorylation by PKAc. Repression of PKAc activity in cells with specific inhibitors blocked p50/p50 DNA binding. Physical association of PKAc with p50 was found to occur in three different cell types. Moreover, a PKA-specific inhibitory peptide, which binds to the catalytic site of PKAc, blocked the physical association between PKAc and p50. These data reveal that the direct association between PKAc and p50 leads to constitutive phosphorylation of p50 Ser337 and subsequent binding of p50/p50 homodimers to DNA. Phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in other aspects of NF-κB regulation in addition to DNA binding. These include degradation of IκB proteins, nuclear translocation of NF-κB, transcriptional activation, and processing of p105 and p100 to generate p50 and p52, respectively (2Chen L.F. Greene W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 34Beinke S. Ley S.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In particular, phosphorylation of p65 has been shown to be required for NF-κB transactivation following induction by cytokines or other stimuli (2Chen L.F. Greene W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). At least four serine residues of p65, including Ser276, Ser311, Ser529, and Ser536, may be phosphorylated by one or more kinases that include PKAc, MSK1, PKCζ, casein kinase II, RSK1, IκB kinases, Ca2+/calmodulin kinase IV, cyclic GMP-dependent kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT kinase, and GSK3β (2Chen L.F. Greene W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 17He B. Weber G.F. Eur. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20005-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same serine residue in p65 can be targeted by different kinases in different cell types or in response to distinct stimuli. For example, Ser276 in the RHD of p65 is phosphorylated by PKAc or MSK1 upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or TNFα, respectively (11Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vanden Berghe W. Haegeman G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 12Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Importantly, in resting cells, NF-κB (p50/p65) is associated with IκB and PKAc in the cytoplasm to form a NF-κB·IκB·PKAc complex in which the PKAc activity is blocked by IκB (12Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB in response to lipopolysaccharide and other stimuli leads to activation of PKAc, which in turn phosphorylates Ser276 of NF-κB p65 in a cAMP-independent manner. Phosphorylation of Ser276 results in a conformational change of p65, which following translocation into the nucleus facilitates recruitment of co-activator CBP/p300 to NF-κB to enhance transcription of target genes (9Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Unlike PKAc, MSK1 phosphorylates Ser276 of p65 in the nucleus (11Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vanden Berghe W. Haegeman G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Based on sequence comparison, Ser276 of p65 is the residue directly corresponding to Ser337 of p50. However, in contrast to phosphorylation of p65 Ser276 by PKAc, we have shown in this study that phosphorylation of p50 Ser337 by PKAc is constitutive and does not require degradation of IκB. This suggests that IκB does not associate with the p50/p50-PKAc complex, which is consistent with the finding that IκB binds efficiently to p50/p65 heterodimers but not to p50/p50 homodimers (35Liou H.C. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Fujita T. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3003-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In accordance with lack of involvement of IκB in the constitutive phosphorylation of p50, our data revealed that TNFα-induced degradation of IκB only led to dramatic nuclear translocation of p50/p65 heterodimers but not p50/p50 homodimers. Therefore, it is unlikely that the same PKAc molecule that phosphorylates p65 in the NF-κB-IκB-PKAc complex is also responsible for constitutive phosphorylation of p50/p50. Because PKAc is known to function in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (36Griffioen G. Thevelein J.M. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it will be important to establish in which cellular compartment p50/p50 homodimers are phosphorylated by the kinase. Although future experiments are required to resolve this question, our in gel kinase experiments suggested that PKAc might phosphorylate p50 in the cytoplasm. If so, it is interesting to consider that p105, the precursor of p50 that is capable of binding to p50 and blocking its nuclear translocation (34Beinke S. Ley S.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), may also serve to inhibit p50 phosphorylation by PKAc. Because in all cells p50 is produced through constitutive processing of p105 (34Beinke S. Ley S.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), the partial degradation of p105 could relieve the inhibitory effect on p50 phosphorylation by PKAc. It is thus tempting to speculate that constitutive processing of p105 is correlated or even coupled with constitutive phosphorylation of p50. Sustained activation of NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimers is associated with many chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer disease (37Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 72-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 38Makarov S.S. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 39Feldmann M. Maini R.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 163-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). This highlights the importance of being able to negatively regulate NF-κB target genes that are essential for maintaining normal physiology. p50/p50 homodimers are capable of suppressing the transactivation activities of p50/p65 by occupying the same κB sites. This inhibitory function can be more effective when p50/p50 homodimers interact with the transcriptional co-repressor histone deacetylase (10Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). In most resting cells, p50/p50 homodimers are bound to the DNA (10Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 23Driessler F. Venstrom K. Sabat R. Asadullah K. Schottelius A.J. Clin. Exp.

Science. 1992; 256: 1452-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In particular, constitutive DNA binding of p50/p50 is apparently an important mechanism used by immune cells to suppress expression of NF-κB target genes. For example, p50/p50 homodimers have been found to inhibit interleukin-2 gene expression in resting T lymphocytes (24Grundstrom S. Anderson P. Scheipers P. Sundstedt A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8460-8468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Kang S.M. Tran A.C. Grilli M. Lenardo M.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1452-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and are involved in interleukin-10-mediated anti-inflammation as well as in an autocrine-modulated inhibition of TNFα expression in macrophages (23Driessler F. Venstrom K. Sabat R. Asadullah K. Schottelius A.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2004; 135: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 40Baer M. Dillner A. Schwartz R.C. Sedon C. Nedospasov S. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5678-5689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is noted that in a few instances p50/p50 homodimers can also activate gene expression when complexed with co-activators, such as Bcl-3 (29Thornburg N.J. Pathmanathan R. Raab-Traub N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8293-8301PubMed Google Scholar, 41Budunova I.V. Perez P. Vaden V.R. Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Jorcano J.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7423-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This cofactor mediated transactivation effect of p50/p50 on one gene would not undermine the suppressive function of the homodimer on other genes. Importantly, our study proposes that regardless of whether p50/p50 functions as a repressor or an activator, the binding of the homodimer to DNA is dependent on phosphorylation of Ser337 by PKAc. Given the potential complexity for phosphorylation of p50, we cannot rule out that other kinases in addition to PKAc could phosphorylate Ser337. However, our study strongly indicates that in several types of unstimulated cells PKAc serves to constitutively phosphorylate p50 Ser337 directly to enable continuous DNA binding of p50 homodimers. In addition, whereas phosphorylation of p50 is known to be important for DNA binding of NF-κB (p50/65) (21Kushner D.B. Ricciardi R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Li C.C. Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30089-30092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it remains to be determined how the p50 subunit of NF-κB becomes phosphorylated. One possibility is that the p50 subunit is phosphorylated on Ser337 by PKAc as shown in this study and then partners with the p65 subunit in the NF-κB-IκB complex. Alternatively, the PKAc contained in the NF-κB-IκB complex that serves to phosphorylate p65 (12Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) could also phosphorylate the p50 subunit component of NF-κB. Future studies are needed to resolve this issue."

The class E phenotype is described as an enlarged late endosomal compartment, which presumably arises because of an inability to invaginate the limiting membrane that would normally form the MVB. In higher eukaryotes, studies on the internalization and degradation of growth factor receptors as well as studies on viral budding have helped to elucidate the importance of MVBs, because many enveloped RNA viruses utilize components of the MVB to bud from cells (8Futter C.E.

Examination of genomic data bases showed that SBP1 (or the data base gene name DRG-1) was homologous to Vta1p, with most of the homology in the carboxyl terminus of the reported sequence.

The sequence of LIP5/DRG-1 is homologous to Vta1p; the two proteins show 20.2% identity and 48.9% similarity. In this paper we demonstrate that LIP5 is homologous to Vta1p and like Vta1p functions in MVB sorting. Depletion of LIP5 by siRNA reduces the degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and reduces HIV-1 budding. We further show that LIP5 specifically interacts with CHMP5/Hspc177, the homologue of the S. cerevisiae class E protein Vps60p (21Kranz A. Kinner A. Kolling R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Depletion of CHMP5 by RNA interference alters the degradation of EGFR, but in contrast to LIP5, CHMP5 silencing leads to an increase in HIV particle release. Finally, we show that there are marked differences on the behavior of the endocytic apparatus in cells depleted for CHMP5 compared with cells in which CHMP5 with a large epitope is overexpressed. Cells and Reagents—HeLa cells, fibroblasts, HEK293T cells, and Cos-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Alexa 594-dextran, Alexa 594-transferrin, Alexa 594-phallodin, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Constructs—LIP5 and CHMP5 were PCR-amplified from I.M.A.G.E. Consortium clone 3961637 and GST-CHMP5 fusion clone (22von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M. Chung H.Y. Morita E. Wang H.E.

Sequencing of LIP5 cDNA indicated that the published sequence was incorrect. We suggested that the published sequence is incorrect because of a frameshift at position +263 resulting in an early stop codon. The I.M.A.G.E. Consortium cDNA encodes a larger protein of 307 amino acids. PCR products were cloned into either pEGFP (C1) or pDsRed (N1) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). LIP5-FLAG was PCR-amplified from the same I.M.A.G.E. Consortium clone and cloned into pcDNA 3.1(-) (Invitrogen). CHMP5-FLAG, CHMP4B-FLAG, and CHMP2A-FLAG were PCR-amplified from GST-CHMP fusion constructs and subsequently cloned into pcDNA 3.1(-) (Invitrogen). CHMP4B-DsRed, CHMP2A-DsRed, SKD1-DsRed, and SKD1(E235Q)-DsRed were generated as described previously (22von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M. Chung H.Y. Morita E. Wang H.E. Davis T.

LIP5 protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen). CHMP5 was cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), expressed in E. coli as a CHMP5-GST fusion protein and purified without the GST as per the manufacturer's instructions. Purified LIP5 or CHMP5 proteins were emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) and injected into host animals. Following subsequent immunizations with recombinant protein, serum was obtained and tested for immunoreactivity by Western analysis. Transient Transfections and Western Analysis—Cos-7, HeLa, and wild type fibroblast cells were plated onto tissue culture plates and allowed to grow for 24–48 h to 50–80% confluence. The cells were transfected with various constructs using GeneJammer (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's directions. Protein expression was determined by solubilizing 2–4 × 106 cells in 1.0% Triton X-100 with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) plus 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To analyze membranes, Cos-7 cells were homogenized using a ball-bearing homogenizer. A post-nuclear supernatant was obtained from an 800 × g, 5-min centrifugation, and membrane and cytosolic fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The samples were solubilized in 1.0% Triton X-100, and protein determinations were performed to normalize for protein using a BCA assay (Pierce) and 25 μg of protein/sample loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a 1:10,000 dilution of mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) or mouse anti-GFP antibody (Covance, Berkeley, CA) followed by incubation in a 1:12,500 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Rabbit anti-LIP5 and rabbit anti-CHMP5 were used at a concentration of 1:500 followed by a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The blots were developed using Western Lightning reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fluorescence Microscopy—Transiently transfected Cos-7 cells, HeLa cells, or mouse fibroblasts expressing GFP or DsRed epitope-tagged proteins were imaged live using an epifluorescence Olympus microscope with a 100× oil immersion objective. The cells expressing GFP or DsRed epitope-tagged proteins were fixed using 3.7% formaldehyde with PBS, 2.0% paraformaldehyde, or -20 °C methanol. The cells were permeabilized in either 0.1% saponin with PBS or 0.2% Triton X-100, 1.0% bovine serum albumin and stained for either Lamp2 (1:200) (H4B4 or GL2A7 Developmental Hybridoma, Iowa City, IA), EGFR (1:200; NeoMarkers, Fremont CA), p230 (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA), or mannose-6 phosphate receptor (1:1000, a gift from Dr. Peter Lobel). For detection of FLAG-tagged proteins, mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:750. The secondary antibodies included Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:750), Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:750), Alexa 647-conjugated goat-anti mouse IgG (1:750), Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:750), and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:750) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted in 0.1% saponin with PBS and bovine serum albumin. The cells were visualized using an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus Inc., Melville, NY) with a 100× oil immersion objective. The images were acquired using Magnafire analysis software. For confocal microscopy, the images were collected at single wavelengths on an Olympus FVX confocal fluorescence microscope with a 60× Pianapo objective (1.4 numerical aperture oil) using Fluoview 2.0.39 software. Affinity Purification—Transfected cells were washed and scraped into PBS with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail and 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and pelleted at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The cells were solubilized using 1.0% Triton X-100 with PBS plus 1× protease inhibitor cocktail plus 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. The supernatants were obtained, and each supernatant was added to 100 μl of anti-FLAG (M2) agarose beads and rocked at 4 °C overnight. The beads were pelleted and washed 10 times with PBS. The beads were eluted three times with 1.0 mg/ml FLAG peptide and then eluted twice with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. For Western analysis, the samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed for proteins of interest. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Proteins—For mass spectrometry analysis, the samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Blue. Bands of interest were excised and analyzed by the University of Utah Mass Spectrometry Core Facility. Each excised protein gel band was transferred to a 1.5-ml tube and destained. In-gel digestion was then performed by adding 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at a 1:50 enzyme:substrate ratio and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Tryptic peptides were extracted twice in 100 μl extraction buffer (0.1% trifluoro-acetic acid, 50% acetonitrile, pH 2.5). Two extracted peptide solutions were combined and dried in a Speed-Vac device. Analysis was carried out using a Simadzu HPLC system interfaced to a Finnigan LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) with electrospray ionization. Each tryptic peptide sample was reconstituted in 10 μl of 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and was injected onto an HPLC column (Thermo Hypersil-Keystone, Bellefonte, PA; 100 × 0.32 mm, 5-μm particle size). A 53-min gradient of 10–80% solvent B (solvent A was 05% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; solvent B was 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) was selected for separation of peptides. The spectra were acquired in automated triple play mode for recording of mass and mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry data. The scan range for mass spectrometry mode was set at m/z 400–1800. Automated analysis of peptide tandem mass spectra was performed with SE-QUEST/MASCOT computer algorithms for protein identification. RNA Interference—siRNA pools matching selected regions of LIP5 and CHMP5 cDNA sequences and a random sequence pool were purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). Individual RNA oligonucleotide sequences are listed in Table I. siRNA for TSG101 was as described (23Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W. Morham S.G. Zavitz K.H. Wang H.E. Wettstein D.A. Stray K.M. Cote M. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Sundquist W.I. Cell. 2001; 107: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed on HeLa cells or 293T plated at 50% confluence using OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) with siRNA pools at a final concentration of 100 nm. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were trypsinized and plated onto 100-mm plates. Forty-eight hours later the cells were either processed for immunofluorescence microscopy or solubilized in 1.0% Triton, PBS, protease inhibitor cocktail with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis probing for either LIP5, CHMP5, TSG101, or EGFR. Viral Replication Assays—Human 293T cells in 6-well plates were transfected twice at 24-h intervals with 1.33 μg of siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (23Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W. Morham S.G. Zavitz K.H. Wang H.E. Wettstein D.A. Stray K.M. Cote M. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Sundquist W.I. Cell. 2001; 107: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The cells were cotransfected with an HIV-1 vector system comprising the following plasmids: 0.38 μg of pCMVΔR8.2 (24Naldini L. Blomer U. Gage F.H. Trono D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11382-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar), 0.12 μg of pRSV-Rev (25Dull T. Zufferey R. Kelly M. Mandel R.J. Nguyen M. Trono D. Naldini L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8463-8471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 0.12 μg of pMD.G (26Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), and 0.38 μg of pWPTS-nlsLacZ (www.tronolab.unige.ch) during the second transfection. Supernatants containing virions were harvested 48 h after the second transfection, and the cells were harvested at the same time for Western blot analyses. To measure titers, virus particles were diluted 1:100 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and 20 μg/ml DEAE-dextran, and infectivity was assayed by transducing human HeLa-M cells with the diluted vector in 96-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde, washed twice with PBS, and stained with an X-gal staining solution containing 4 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 4 mm potassium ferricyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mg/ml X-gal. For Western analysis the following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-HIV CA antibody from Hans-Georg Krausslich (Heidelberg, Germany; at 1:4000), rabbit anti-HIV MA from Didier Trono (Geneva, Switzerland; at 1:40,000), and murine monoclonal anti-TSG101–4A10 from GeneTex, Inc. (San Antonio, TX; at 1:1000). Characterization and Subcellular Distribution of LIP5—To examine the role of LIP5 in membrane trafficking in mammalian cells, we generated a polyclonal antibody directed against a bacterially expressed LIP5. The specificity of the LIP5 antibody was examined by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. The antiserum detected recombinant LIP5 protein, and this interaction could be blocked by preincubation of anti-LIP5 antiserum with recombinant LIP5 (Fig. 1A). LIP5 has a predicted molecular mass of 34 kDa, but the recombinant protein showed an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The yeast LIP5 homologue, Vta1p, also migrates more slowly than predicted by its sequence (18Shiflett S.L. Ward D.M. Huynh D. Vaughn M.B. Simmons J.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10982-10990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular location of LIP5 in vivo, Cos-7 cells were homogenized, a membrane fraction was obtained, and both membrane and cytosolic fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. The LIP5 antibody detected two bands: a membrane bound protein of ∼65 kDa and a soluble protein of 39 kDa (Fig. 1B). To determine which band represented LIP5, we preabsorbed the anti-LIP5 antiserum with bacterially expressed recombinant LIP5. Only the 39-kDa band was not detected when the antibody was pretreated with recombinant LIP5; therefore, we believe that the larger band is a nonspecific protein detected by the rabbit antiserum. Although the antibody was able to detect LIP5 by Western analysis, it was unable to detect LIP5 by either immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation. To characterize LIP5 further, we cloned the LIP5 cDNA into expression vectors with an amino-terminal GFP or a carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope. The constructs were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells or HeLa cells. Examination by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1C) and Western analysis (Fig. 1D) showed that overexpressed GFP-LIP5 or LIP5-FLAG (data not shown) was cytosolic. LIP5-GFP has a predicted molecular mass of 61 kDa but showed a slightly higher molecular mass when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Overexpression of LIP5-GFP or LIP5-FLAG did not affect membrane trafficking in the endocytic or secretory pathways, as determined by localization of organelle specific markers including Alexa 594-Tf, Alexa 594-EGF, p230 (trans-Golgi marker),and Lamp2 (late endosome/lysosomal marker) (Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed for Tf receptor and EGFR (data not shown). The distribution of a fluid phase marker, Texas Red dextran, which is found in endosomes and lysosomes, was unaffected upon overexpression of GFP-LIP5 (Fig. 2B). Decreased expression of LIP5, however, revealed a role for LIP5 in MVB trafficking. Decreased expression of LIP5 was accomplished by transfecting HeLa cells with siRNA pools directed against LIP5. No loss of LIP5 protein was seen in cells transfected with a random siRNA pool (Fig. 3A) or siRNA directed against Lamin (data not shown). The average reduction in LIP5, as determined by Western analysis, was ∼85% (n > 10). The cells transfected with siRNA against LIP5 showed no alteration in the distribution of Alexa 594-Tf or Lamp2 (Fig. 3B). The yeast homologue of LIP5, Vta1p, plays a role in MVB formation, and deletion of VTA1 results in a marked decrease in the degradation of internalized plasma membrane proteins (17Yeo S.C. Xu L. Ren J. Boulton V.J. Wagle M.D. Liu C. Ren G. Wong P. Zahn R. Sasajala P. Yang H. Piper R.C. Munn A.L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3957-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Shiflett S.L.

To test whether the loss of LIP5 affects the degradation of plasma membrane proteins in mammalian cells, we examined the effect of LIP5 silencing on the internalization and degradation of EGFR. In control cells, either untransfected cells or cells transfected with a random siRNA pool, the addition of EGF resulted in the rapid degradation of EGFR (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the addition of EGF to LIP5 siRNA-treated cells led to decreased degradation with a 2-fold change in EGFR half-life. The addition of nonspecific RNA interference oligonucleotides had no effect on the rate of EGFR degradation. A change in EGFR degradation could reflect a decrease in proteolysis or a decrease in internalization of receptor from the cell surface. To distinguish between these possibilities we examined cells for EGFR distribution by immunofluorescence. EGFR is found predominantly on the cell surface (Fig. 3D). The addition of EGF to control cells or cells transfected with a random siRNA pool resulted in the disappearance of cell surface EGFR and a marked reduction in immunofluorescence throughout the cell. In cells depleted of LIP5, the addition of EGF resulted in the disappearance of EGFR from the cell surface and the accumulation of EGFR in large intracellular vesicles. The increased accumulation of EGFR was observed in 53% (n = 37/70) of the cells silenced for LIP5. Incubation with EGF did not affect transferrin receptor or Lamp2 distribution in LIP5 silenced cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that LIP5 is involved in the sorting and down-regulation of the EGFR. In the absence of LIP5, the degradation of EGFR is reduced, and EGFR accumulates in intracellular vesicles. LIP5 Interacts with CHMP5—To determine whether LIP5 interacts with other proteins, we expressed GFP-LIP5-FLAG in Cos-7 cells, solubilized cells with detergent, and affinity-purified LIP5 using anti-FLAG beads followed by elution with FLAG peptide. SDS-PAGE/Coomassie analysis of the eluate revealed two bands, overexpressed GFP-LIP5-FLAG, and a second protein of ∼27 kDa (Fig. 4A), which was identified by mass spectrometry as Hspc177/CHMP5 (n = 3). This protein belongs to a family of small coiled-coil proteins (21Kranz A. Kinner A. Kolling R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae homologue of CHMP5 is Vps60p, a class E Vps protein whose precise role in MVB formation has not been defined (4Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). We generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody to bacterially expressed CHMP5. The antibody detected two prominent bands in bacterial lysates expressing GST-CHMP5, but a 27-kDa band was dramatically diminished when the antibody was preabsorbed with purified recombinant CHMP5 (Fig. 4B). Based on these data and silencing data discussed below, we conclude that the 27-kDa protein is CHMP5. Subcellular fractionation followed by Western analysis showed CHMP5 to be primarily cytosolic (Fig. 4C). The CHMP5 antibody did not work for immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation. To examine CHMP5 localization in vivo, we generated a CHMP5 protein with either a carboxyl-terminal GFP or DsRed. CHMP5-DsRed or CHMP5-GFP was found on vesicles near the nucleus (Fig. 4D). Coexpression of CHMP5-DsRed and LIP5-GFP resulted in LIP5-GFP, a cytosolic protein, now associating with the CHMP5-DsRed vesicles. There are 10 mammalian CHMP proteins that exhibit a series of common features including a predicted coiled-coil motif. It is therefore possible that other CHMP proteins interact with LIP5 through conserved sequence or structural elements. To test this possibility, we generated FLAG-tagged CHMP2A, CHMP4B, and CHMP5 constructs, transfected the constructs into Cos-7 cells, purified the FLAG-tagged CHMP proteins using FLAG affinity resin,"
https://openalex.org/W2044708468,"2-Hydroxyfatty acids, constituents of brain cerebrosides and sulfatides, were previously reported to be degraded by an α-oxidation system, generating fatty acids shortened by one carbon atom. In the current study we used labeled and unlabeled 2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid to reinvestigate the degradation of this class of lipids. Both in intact and broken cell systems formate was identified as a main reaction product. Furthermore, the generation of an n–1 aldehyde was demonstrated. In permeabilized rat hepatocytes and liver homogenates, studies on cofactor requirements revealed a dependence on ATP, CoA, Mg2+, thiamine pyrophosphate, and NAD+. Together with subcellular fractionation data and studies on recombinant enzymes, this led to the following picture. In a first step, the 2-hydroxyfatty acid is activated to an acyl-CoA; subsequently, the 2-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA is cleaved by 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase, to formyl-CoA and an n–1 aldehyde. The severe inhibition of formate generation by oxythiamin treatment of intact fibroblasts indicates that cleavage through the thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase is the main pathway for the degradation of 2-hydroxyfatty acids. The latter protein was initially characterized as an essential enzyme in the peroxisomal α-oxidation of 3-methyl-branched fatty acids such as phytanic acid. Our findings point to a new role for peroxisomes in mammals, i.e. the breakdown of 2-hydroxyfatty acids, at least the long chain 2-hydroxyfatty acids. Most likely, the more abundant very long chain 2-hydroxyfatty acids are degraded in a similar manner. 2-Hydroxyfatty acids, constituents of brain cerebrosides and sulfatides, were previously reported to be degraded by an α-oxidation system, generating fatty acids shortened by one carbon atom.

In mammals, 2-hydroxyfatty acids (2-OH-FA) 1The abbreviations used are: 2-OH-FA, 2-hydroxyfatty acids; 2-HPCL, 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase; ν, substrate/BSA ratio; PAHX, phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum abumin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: 2-OH-FA, 2-hydroxyfatty acids; 2-HPCL, 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase; ν, substrate/BSA ratio; PAHX, phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum abumin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. are present in several tissues but are most abundant in brain, where they represent ∼6% of the total fatty acids. The 2-hydroxy derivatives of C18 to C26 straight chain saturated and/or mono-unsaturated fatty acids appear to be present exclusively in cerebrosides, cerebroside sulfates, and ceramides, most of which are found in myelin (1Kishimoto Y. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1963; 58: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Furthermore, in brain cerebrosides even more than half of the fatty acids are 2-OH-FA, and also odd-numbered fatty acids are present in an unusually large proportion (2Hajra A.K. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1963; 58: 270-278Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The ratio of 2-OH-FA to normal fatty acids increases during myelination, whereas the percentage of odd-numbered fatty acids continues to increase up to the age of 10–15 years (3Svennerholm L. Stallberg-Stenhagen S. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 215-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1964 Levis and Mead (4Levis G.M. Mead J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 77-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported for the first time the existence of an α-oxidation system for the degradation of the C20 to C26 straight chain fatty acids of rat brain sphingolipids. It was postulated that this pathway would consist of two steps, generating first 2-hydroxy even-numbered fatty acids, and subsequently odd-numbered fatty acids one carbon atom shorter. Later, it was reported that in rat brain the decarboxylation reaction was performed by a microsomal enzyme and that a 2-keto fatty acid, found only in small amounts, was formed as an intermediate (5Lippel K. Mead J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 152: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). α-Oxidation of straight chain fatty acids has also been studied in plants, and the formation of an n – 1 aldehyde was reported by several authors (6Gerhardt B. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 417-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Andersen Borge G.I. Slinde E. Nilsson A. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22648-22655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). α-Oxidation has also been described in yeast (9Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3608-3613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in protozoa (10Kaya K. Ramesha C.S. Thompson Jr., G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3548-3553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the involvement of peroxisomes in the α-oxidation of cerebronic acid (2-hydroxytetracosanoic acid) was described. The decarboxylation of 2-hydroxytetracosanoic acid was apparently independent of the preceding formation of an acyl-CoA and was supposed to be distinct from the α-oxidation of 3-methyl-branched fatty acids such as phytanic acid (11Sandhir R.

The latter pathway is currently thought to proceed as follows; 1) activation to a CoA ester, 2) hydroxylation of carbon 2 by phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (PAHX), and 3) cleavage of the hydroxylated CoA-ester by 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase (2-HPCL) to formyl-CoA (12Croes K. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Casteels M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and a 2-methyl-branched fatty aldehyde (13Croes K. Casteels M. Asselberghs S.

According to our data PAHX does not act on straight chain fatty acids or their CoA esters (15Croes K. Foulon V. Casteels M. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Foulon V. Asselberghs S. Geens W. Mannaerts G.P. Casteels M. Van Veldhoven P.P. J.

Kershaw N.J. Schofield C.J. Wierzbicki A.S. Lloyd M.D. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Regardless of this discrepancy, a recently described fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, highly abundant in brain and encoded by the FA2H gene (18Alderson N.L. Rembiesa B.M. Walla M.D. Bielawska A. Bielawski J. Hama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48562-48568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), is likely responsible for the formation of 2-hydroxyfatty acids in man. The current study was undertaken to elucidate the degradation of 2-hydroxyfatty acids and to highlight a possible role of 2-HPCL in this process. Hereby, we made use of 2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid, labeled and unlabeled, and its unlabeled CoA ester. These substrates are easier to synthesize and manipulate than the more abundant very long chain 2-hydroxyfatty acids. Although 2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid is a less abundant 2-hydroxyfatty acid, it forms a more than negligible fraction of the 2-hydroxyfatty acids in brain cerebrosides (4% in newborn, 1% in adult brain) and sulfatides (15 and 1%, respectively) (3Svennerholm L. Stallberg-Stenhagen S. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 215-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty Acids and Derivatives—[1-14C]Hexadecanoic acid was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 2-Hydroxyhexadecanoic and 2-hydroxyeicosanoic acid were from Larodan. 2-Keto-octanoic acid was obtained from Serva. The synthesis of most fatty acids/derivatives has been described before: 2-hydroxy-3-methyl[1-14C]hexadecanoic acid, labeled and unlabeled 3-methylhexadecanoic acid, 3-methylhexadecanoyl-CoA, and 2-hydroxy-3-methylhexadecanoyl-CoA (19.Croes, K.

Soc. 1936; : 283-285Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar)). Stearic acid treated with PBr3 was brominated in dry dichloromethane in a closed screw-capped thick-wall vial for 72 h at 70 °C (Hell-Volhard-Zelinski reaction; molar ratio acid/PBr3/Br2, 1/12/36). After removal of the solvent, water was carefully added to hydrolyze the 2-bromooctadecanoylbromide, and the 2-bromooctadecanoic acid (Rf = 0.50; Silica gel 60; hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid, 60/40/1, v/v; stearic acid Rf = 0.59) was extracted into diethyl ether. The bromo group was converted to a hydroxyl group in two steps. The dried diethyl ether extract was dissolved in acetic acid containing potassium acetate and placed under reflux at 120 °C for 24 h. After dilution with water, the 2-acetoxyoctadecanoic acid (Rf = 0.26) was extracted into diethyl ether, dried, and hydrolyzed in 1.5 n NaOH/methanol (15/85, v/v) for 2 h under reflux. The mixture was acidified, and the formed 2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid was extracted into diethyl ether and further purified by preparative TLC (Rf = 0.14). Overall yield was 35%. 2-Hydroxy[1-14C]octadecanoic acid and 2-hydroxynonadecanoic acid were synthesized in a similar manner, starting from [1-14C]octadecanoic acid (Moravek Biochemicals, Inc.) and nonadecanoic acid (Fluka), respectively. The CoA esters of 2-OH-FA were prepared by transesterification of their thiophenol ester, prepared with N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in 0.5 m NaHCO3/tetrahydrofuran/ethanol (1/5/2, v/v) and purified on a C18-SPE cartridge (1 g; Supelco). Yield was 66% based on CoA input. Animals and Cell Lines—Male Wistar rats weighing ∼200 g were maintained on a standard laboratory diet and a constant light-dark cycle and were fasted overnight before sacrifice. All studies were approved by the University Ethics committee. Control human skin fibroblasts and fibroblasts from X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy patients were kindly provided by Dr. G. Matthys (Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium). Skin fibroblasts from patients affected with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, and Zellweger syndrome were provided by Dr. J. Van Hove (University Hospitals, Leuven). Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 fibroblasts and rat C6 glial cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The preparation of fibroblasts from Pex5+/– and Pex5–/– mice has been described before (23Baes M. Gressens P. Baumgart E. Carmeliet P. Casteels M. Fransen M. Evrard P. Fahimi D. Declercq P.E.

Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Glutamax (Invitrogen) and a mixture of antibiotics and antimycotics (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) or 2% Ultroser G (BioSepra). Rat hepatocytes were isolated as described by Mannaerts et al. (24Mannaerts G.P. Debeer L.J. Thomas J. De Schepper P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4585-4595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and permeabilized as described by Croes et al. (25Croes K. Casteels M. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1255: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mouse hepatocytes were prepared as slightly modified from Honkakoski and Negishi (26Honkakoski P. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), plated in collagen-coated T25 culture flasks at 0.5 × 106 cells, and used after an overnight recovery period. Preparation of Homogenates, Subcellular Fractions, and Cell Lysates—Homogenates of rat liver and brain were prepared in 0.25 m sucrose containing 5 mm Mops-NaOH, pH 7.2, and 0.1% (v/v) ethanol (homogenization medium). Subcellular fractionation of rat liver and brain was done essentially as described previously (27Declercq P.E. Haagsman H.P. Van Veldhoven P. Debeer L.J. Van Golde L.M. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9064-9075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for rat liver, with some slight modifications for brain; the pellet obtained after centrifugation of a rat brain postmitochondrial supernatant at 13,000 × g (L-fraction) was resuspended in 0.85 m sucrose containing 5 mm Mops-NaOH, pH 7.2, and 0.1% (v/v) ethanol, overlaid with an equal volume of homogenization medium, and centrifuged for 45 min at 108,000 × g (Beckman SW55) to remove most of the myelin (28Kovacs W.J. Faust P.L. Keller G.A. Krisans S.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4850-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal membranes were obtained after subfractionation of the peroxisomal fraction over a Nycodenz gradient and subsequent separation of matrix and membranes by sonication and centrifugation. Marker enzymes and protein were measured as described previously (27Declercq P.E. Haagsman H.P. Van Veldhoven P. Debeer L.J. Van Golde L.M. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol.

Cells, grown to confluence in 175 cm2 flasks, were harvested by trypsinization, pelleted, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized by sonication (Branson Sonifer; output 4) in 1 ml of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. Fatty Acid Oxidation by Intact and Permeabilized Cells—For measurement of fatty acid oxidation in intact rat hepatocytes, 1.25 × 106 cells were incubated for 10 min in 0.5 ml of Krebs-Henseleit buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 μm defatted albumin, 20 mm Hepes buffer, and 50 μm concentrations of the appropriate substrate (standard conditions). Incubations with permeabilized and washed hepatocytes were started by adding a 100-μl cell suspension (1.25 × 107 hepatocytes/ml) to 400 μl of incubation mixture containing 50 μm labeled substrate and the appropriate cofactors. Adherent cells (mouse hepatocytes, human and mouse fibroblasts, and rat C6 glial cells) were grown to near confluence in 25-cm2 flasks and incubated (mouse hepatocytes for 6 h (30Dirkx R. Vanhorebeek I. Martens K. Schad A. Grabenbauer M. Fahimi D. Declercq P.E. Van Veldhoven P.P. Baes M. Hepatology. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), other cells for 24 h) with 4 μm labeled substrate in culture medium in the presence of 0.2% Ultroser (31Van Veldhoven P.P. Huang S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Oxidation rates in homogenates and subcellular fractions were measured in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 25 μm BSA, 50 μm radioactive substrate, and the appropriate cofactors. All reactions were terminated after 10 min by adding HClO4 to a final concentration of 2% unless otherwise specified. The released 14CO2 and the amounts of [14C]formate and 14C-labeled acid-soluble material were determined as described before (19.Croes, K. (1998) α-Oxidation of 3-Methyl-branched Fatty acids: a Revised Pathway, Ph.D. thesis, Acta Biomedica Lovaniensa, Leuven University Press, LeuvenGoogle Scholar). Enzyme Activity Measurements—The production of acyl-CoA esters was measured in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 12.5 μm BSA, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CoA, and 50 μm 1-14C-labeled substrate (250 μl final volume). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 ml of isopropanol/0.1 n HCl (1/1, v/v); fatty acids were extracted with 4 ml of heptane, and an aliquot of the water layer containing the CoA-esters was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). When using 1-14C-labeled substrates 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase activity was quantified by measuring [14C]formate and its oxidation product, 14CO2 (32Casteels M. Croes K. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1973-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), since the primary 2-HPCL product, [14C]formyl-CoA, is quickly hydrolyzed to formate (12Croes K. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Casteels M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Incubations (37 °C) were performed in a final volume of 250 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6.6 μm BSA, 0.8 mm MgCl2, and 20 μm TPP (referred to as standard conditions) with 40 μm substrate (2-hydroxy[1-14C]octadecanoic acid, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl[1-14C]hexadecanoyl-CoA, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl[1-14C]hexadecanoic acid, 3-methyl[1-14C]hexadecanoyl-CoA, 3-methyl[1-14C]hexadecanoic acid, [1-14C]hexadecanoyl-CoA, or [1-14C]hexadecanoic acid). For the competition experiments a substrate concentration of 10 μm was used, and a 50 μm concentration of a related compound was added. When using unlabeled substrates (2-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-CoA, 2-hydroxy-3-methylhexadecanoyl-CoA), 2-HPCL activity was quantified by measuring the formation of the n – 1 aldehyde. Lipid Analysis—The identification of the CoA esters was based on the formation of fluorescent acyl etheno-CoA derivatives by bromoacetaldehyde (prepared by refluxing bromodiethylacetal under acidic conditions and brought to pH 4.6 with sodium acetate, up to a final concentration of 100 mm acetate) (adapted from Larson and Graham (33Larson T.R. Graham I.A. Plant J. 2001; 25: 115-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Briefly, standard incubations (250 μl final volume) containing 50 μm unlabeled substrate were stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 1 n H2SO4. After the addition of 25 nmol of the appropriate internal standard, the samples were extracted with 1.2 ml of isopropanol/heptane (4/1, v/v), and the upper phase was evaporated under N2. The residue was reconstituted in 100 μl of water and transferred to a derivatization vial. Bromoacetaldehyde reagent (200 μl; ∼250 mm, pH 4.6) was added, the samples were kept in the dark, placed at 80 °C for 15 min, and immediately afterward put on ice. An aliquot of the derivatization mixture was injected onto a C18 column (Symmetry; 150 × 4.6 mm; 5 μm; 100 Å, Waters) on a Waters 1525 HPLC. The acyl-CoA esters were eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.25 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0: linear gradient 10–66%, 15 min; linear gradient 66–80%, 2 min; isocratic 80%, 2 min; linear gradient 80–10%, 2 min; isocratic 10%, 6 min. Detection was performed on a Waters 2475 fluorescence detector (excitation 230 nm; emission 420 nm). For the identification and analysis of aldehydes, reactions were stopped with 125 μl of 2 n HCl. After the addition of 2.5 nmol of the appropriate internal standard and 125 μl of a solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (3.75 mg in 5 ml of 2 n HCl), the samples were incubated for 30 min at 50 °C (in this and subsequent steps samples were protected from light). After adding 0.5 ml of methanol, the hydrazones were extracted into 2 ml of hexane. 1.75 ml of the upper phase was evaporated, the residue was dissolved in 88 μl of acetonitrile, and 50 μl (1.25 nmol of internal standard) was injected on a C18 column (Symmetry 150 × 4.6 mm; 5 μm, 100 Å Waters; Waters 1525 HPLC system) eluted with acetonitrile under isocratic conditions. Detection was done at 360 nm (Waters 484 tunable absorbance detector). Generation and Purification of Recombinant Hs 2-HPCL—Human 2-HPCL cDNA was amplified from a human liver cDNA library with primers Hs 2-HPCL-F8 (5′-CGCGGATCCGATGCCGGACAGTAAACTTCGC) and Hs 2-HPCL-R8 (5′-AATGCATGCTTACATATTAGAGCGGGTC), and after digestion with BamHI and SphI, the corresponding PCR product was subcloned in pJR233 (34Brocard C. Lametschwandtner G. Koudelka R. Hartig A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (construct yVF3). Plasmid yVF3 was transformed into competent Saccharomyces cerevisiae CB80 cells. Transformants were selected and grown on minimal essential medium containing 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% (w/v) glucose, and a supplement of bases and amino acids (20–150 μg/ml) as required (Sc-ura). Positive colonies were grown at 33 °C in 50 ml Sc-ura containing 0.5% glucose as the sole carbon source. After 12–15 h, cells from 15 ml of culture were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and broken with glass beads in 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm TPP, and a mix of protease inhibitors). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and lyase activity was measured on 50-μl samples. To generate a polyhistidine fusion product of Hs 2-HPCL, two oligos (Hs 2-HPCL-H1, 5′-CAAGATGGGCATCATCATCATCATCATCGG, and Hs 2-HPCL-H2, 5′-ATCCCGATGATGATGATGATGATGCCCCATCTTGGTAC) were allowed to hybridize to generate a small linker. The resulting adaptor sequence was cloned between the KpnI-BamHI sites of yVF3 (yVF7), and S. cerevisiae CB80 cells, transformed with yVF7, were grown for 18 h in 400 ml of Sc-ura containing 0.5% (w/v) glucose. The fusion protein was purified from cell lysate (prepared as described before in 8 ml of lysis buffer) on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose essentially as described for the purification of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (16Foulon V. Asselberghs S. Geens W. Mannaerts G.P. Casteels M. Van Veldhoven P.P. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2349-2355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Analysis of the purified fraction by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide, w/v) and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-His antibody (Clontech) revealed one single polyhistidine-tagged protein with a molecular mass of ∼63 kDa. The yield was 77–400 μg of protein with a specific activity of about 26 milliunits/mg of protein (substrate, 40 μm 2-hydroxy-3-methyl[1-14C]hexadecanoyl-CoA). Analysis of the medium of control human fibroblasts and rat C6 glial cells incubated with 2-hydroxy[1-14C]octadecanoic acid for different possible labeled degradation products revealed formate as the major acid-soluble oxidation product (Table I). In intact isolated rat and cultured mouse hepatocytes, on the other hand, the amount of acid-soluble material was markedly higher than the amount of formate generated (Table I), suggesting that in these cells, apart from formate, another metabolite was generated as the primary reaction product or that formate/CO2 was subsequently converted into another acid-soluble metabolite. When intact rat hepatocytes were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled formate, the production of 14CO2 from 2-hydroxy[1-14C]octadecanoic acid decreased dramatically (Fig. 1). This decrease was accompanied by a compensatory increase in the generation of [14C]formate (Fig. 1), as was shown earlier for 3-methylhexadecanoic acid (Ref. 35Croes K. Casteels M. de Hoffmann E. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 1), whereas the β-oxidation of straight chain fatty acids was unaffected throughout the whole formate concentration range (Fig. 1). Hence, these results support the contention that 2-hydroxyfatty acids are shortened by a process resembling the α-oxidation of phytanic acid whereby not CO2, but formyl-CoA/formate is the primary oxidation product that is subsequently converted into CO2 and possibly other metabolites.Table IOxidation of 2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid in intact cellsCell typeActivityCO2FormateASMIntact rat hepatocytes (n = 2)nmol/108 cells/min6.360.672.11Confluent mouse hepatocytes (n = 3)nmol/mg protein/6 h2.68 ± 0.480.11 ± 0.103.20 ± 1.30Confluent fibroblasts (n = 3)nmol/mg protein/24 h2.60 ± 0.5617.43 ± 4.0916.56 ± 1.30Confluent C6 glial cells (n = 2)nmol/mg protein/24 h0.015.496.24 Open table in a new tab To obtain a first insight in the organelle(s)/enzymes involved, the oxidation of 2-hydroxy[1-14C]octadecanoic acid was analyzed in fibroblasts from patients affected with various fatty acid oxidation disorders. In patients with the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency or multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, characterized by a deficiency in the medium chain or multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, respectively, no decrease in oxidation rates was observed (Table II). Hence, these data exclude a significant role of these mitochondrial dehydrogenases in the degradation of 2-hydroxylated straight chain fatty acids. Furthermore the oxidation rates of the 2-hydroxyfatty acids were not reduced either in cells from X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy patients, characterized by a deficiency in the peroxisomal activation/import of very long chain fatty acids, or in those from a rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 patient with a proven deficiency of Pex7p, the import receptor for peroxisomal matrix proteins containing a peroxisomal targeting signal-2 (Table II). Only in fibroblasts from a patient with Zellweger syndrome, with a demonstrated defect in the peroxisomal import of proteins containing a peroxisomal targeting signal-1, was a decrease (43%) in oxidation rate noticed. A similar decrease was seen in fibroblasts from Pex5–/– mice, a mouse model for Zellweger syndrome (Table II). These data suggest that peroxisomes are important and that peroxisomal enzymes with a peroxisomal targeting signal-1 signal are probably involved in the degradation of 2-OH fatty acids. The addition to the culture medium of etomoxir or tetradecylglycidic acid, inhibitors of carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase and, hence, of fatty acyl-CoA entry into the mitochondria, did not significantly affect the oxidation of 2-hydroxy[1-14C]octadecanoic acid (results not shown), another indication that mitochondria are likely not involved.Table IIOxidation of 2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid in human and murine fibroblastsCO2FormateCO2 + formatenmol/mg protein/24 hHumanControl fibroblasts (n = 3)2.60 ± 0.5617.43 ± 4.0920.03 ± 4.00MADD fibroblasts (n = 1)2.6017.5420.15MCAD fibroblasts (n = 1)2.7013.9816.68X-ALD fibroblasts (n = 3)3.13 ± 1.3019.90 ± 2.9123.03 ± 1.52RCDP fibroblasts (n = 1)0.6716.1016.80Zellweger fibroblasts (n = 1)1.0510.3411.39MousePex5+/- fibroblasts (n = 1)2.359.6111.96Pex5-/- fibroblasts (n = 1)1.364.115.48 Open table in a new tab To study the necessary cofactors, rat hepatocytes, permeabilized with α-toxin to deplete the cytosolic cofactors (25Croes K.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anti-cancer agent with tumor-selective apoptotic activity. Here we present a novel approach that combines EGFR-signaling inhibition with target cell-restricted apoptosis induction using a TRAIL fusion protein with engineered specificity for EGFR. This fusion protein, scFv425:sTRAIL, comprises the EGFR-blocking antibody fragment scFv425 genetically fused to soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL). Treatment with scFv425:sTRAIL resulted in the specific accretion to the cell surface of EGFR-positive cells only. EGFR-specific binding rapidly induced a dephosphorylation of EGFR and down-stream mitogenic signaling, which was accompanied by cFLIPL down-regulation and Bad dephosphorylation. EGFR-specific binding converted soluble scFv425:sTRAIL into a membrane-bound form of TRAIL that cross-linked agonistic TRAIL receptors in a paracrine manner, resulting in potent apoptosis induction in a series of EGFR-positive tumor cell lines. Co-treatment of EGFR-positive tumor cells with the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor Iressa resulted in a potent synergistic pro-apoptotic effect, caused by the specific down-regulation of c-FLIP. Furthermore, in mixed culture experiments binding Lof scFv425:sTRAIL to EGFR-positive target cells conveyed a potent apoptotic effect toward EGFR-negative bystander tumor cells. The favorable characteristics of scFv425:sTRAIL, alone and in combination with Iressa, as well as its potent anti-tumor bystander activity indicate its potential value for treatment of EGFR-expressing cancers.

Co-treatment of EGFR-positive tumor cells with the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor Iressa resulted in a potent synergistic pro-apoptotic effect, caused by the specific down-regulation of c-FLIP. Furthermore, in mixed culture experiments binding Lof scFv425:sTRAIL to EGFR-positive target cells conveyed a potent apoptotic effect toward EGFR-negative bystander tumor cells. The favorable characteristics of scFv425:sTRAIL, alone and in combination with Iressa, as well as its potent anti-tumor bystander activity indicate its potential value for treatment of EGFR-expressing cancers. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; memTRAIL, membrane TRAIL; sTRAIL, soluble TRAIL; scFv, single chain fragment of variable regions; cFLIPL, cellular flice inhibitory protein long; Z-, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; memTRAIL, membrane TRAIL; sTRAIL, soluble TRAIL; scFv, single chain fragment of variable regions; cFLIPL, cellular flice inhibitory protein long; Z-, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase comprising an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (1Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2Holbro T. Civenni G. Hynes N.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Binding of epidermal growth factor or transforming growth factor-α results in EGFR dimerization and subsequent activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Phosphorylated EGFR concomitantly triggers downstream mitogenic signaling via both the p44/42 MAPK and PI3K pathways (3Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5538) Google Scholar). Normal EGFR signaling plays a pivotal role in organ development and repair and in the regulation of cell survival. Aberrant EGFR signaling strongly contributes to the malignant features in cancer including an increased resistance to apoptosis. Aberrant signaling can be the result of EGFR overexpression by EGFR gene amplification, which can lead to very high cell surface expression of up to 106 EGFR molecules per tumor cell. Alternatively, various oncogenic mutations of EGFR have been described including EGFRvIII, an EGFR mutant that possesses ligand-independent tyrosine kinase activity (5Wong A.J. Ruppert J.M. Bigner S.H. Grzeschik C.H. Humphrey P.A. Bigner D.S. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) and that appears to be selectively expressed in tumor cells since it is not found in normal cells. Recently, also mutations in the EGFR-tyrosine kinase domain have been identified in a subset of lung cancer patients that appear to activate anti-apoptotic pathways (6Lynch T.J. Bell D.W. Sordella R. Gurubhagavatula S. Okimoto R.A. Brannigan B.W. Harris P.L. Haserlat S.M. Supko J.G. Haluska F.G. Louis D.N. Christiani D.C. Settleman J. Haber D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 2129-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (9916) Google Scholar).Several targeted strategies have been developed to specifically inhibit aberrant EGFR signaling. Monoclonal antibodies, e.g. mAb C225 (Cetuximab) and mAb 425 (7Rodeck U. Herlyn M. Koprowski H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 35: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Gabler B. Aicher T. Heiss P. Senekowitsch-Schmidtke R. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 3157-3159PubMed Google Scholar), competitively inhibit the binding of natural ligands to the extracellular ligand binding domain. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, e.g. Iressa (also known as ZD1839 or Gefitinib) (9Normanno N. Maiello M.R. De Luca A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Barker A.J. Gibson K.H. Grundy W. Godfrey A.A. Barlow J.J. Healy M.P. Woodburn J.R. Ashton S.E. Curry B.J. Scarlett L. Henthorn L. Richards L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), competitively inhibit with ATP for binding to the EGFR-tyrosine kinase domain. The clinical efficacy of these agents appears to rely on multiple anti-cancer mechanisms, including inhibition of cell cycle progression, inhibition of metastasis, and an increase in the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis.However, despite promising anti-tumor activity in clinical trials (11Chan K.C. Knox W.F. Gee J.M. Morris J. Nicholson R.I. Potten C.S. Bundred N.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 122-128PubMed Google Scholar, 12Raben D. Helfrich B.A. Chan D. Johnson G. Bunn Jr., P.A. Semin.

Therefore, additional EGFR-targeted strategies or combination with other therapeutic approaches are under investigation. In this respect strong synergistic tumoricidal effects have been reported for strategies in which EGFR-signaling antagonists are combined with radiation or chemotherapy (12Raben D.

Assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex sequentially activates initiator caspases (caspase 8 or 10) and effector caspases (e.g. caspase 3 and 7) and ultimately ends in apoptotic cell death. memTRAIL can be proteolytically cleaved into a soluble form (sTRAIL). Several recombinant forms of sTRAIL have been generated that show strong tumoricidal activity in vitro and in xenografted mouse tumor models without toxic side effects (31Ashkenazi A. Pai R.C.

Nevertheless, several recent reports described apoptotic activity of sTRAIL toward various normal human cells, including primary human hepatocytes (35Jo M. Kim T.H. Seol D.W. Esplen J.E. Dorko K.

Lancet. 2000; 356: 827-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Previously we and others showed that sTRAIL can be genetically fused to a tumor-selective antibody fragment (39Bremer E.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4101-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), resulting in fusion proteins with enhanced and tumor-restricted apoptotic activity. Here we present and analyze the mode of action of a novel and promising strategy that combines EGFR-signaling inhibition with target cell-restricted apoptosis induction using a TRAIL fusion protein with engineered specificity for EGFR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell LinesThe following cell lines were purchased from the ATTC (Manassas, VA): Jurkat (ALL T-cell line), A431 (epidermoid vulva carcinoma), A172, Hs683 (glioblastoma), SW948, and WiDr (colon carcinoma). Cell line Jurkat.EGFRvIII was generated by electroporation of Jurkat cells with plasmid pHβApr-1-neo/EGFRvIII (a kind gift of Dr. D. Bigner, Duke University Medical Center, NC), after which transfectants were selected by G418 selection (500 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Jurkat, SW948, and WiDr cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Cambrex Bio Science, Verviers, France) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. A431, HS683, and A172 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 4 mm l-glutamine (Cambrex Bio Science).Monoclonal Antibodies and InhibitorsTRAIL-neutralizing mAb 2E5 was purchased from Alexis (10P, Breda, The Netherlands). mAb 425 (kindly provided by Merck) is a murine IgG2a with high binding affinity for the extracellular domain of both EGFR and EGFRvIII. mAb 425 blocks EGF binding to EGFR and competes with scFv425 for binding to the same epitope. Total caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK, and caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK were purchased from Calbiochem. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor Iressa was kindly provided by AstraZeneca Inc (Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK). PI3K inhibitor wortmannin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Final working concentrations of inhibitors were diluted in serum-free medium from a stock of 10 mm in Me2SO.Production of scFv425:sTRAILFusion protein scFv425:sTRAIL was constructed and produced essentially as described previously (39Bremer E. Kuijlen J. Samplonius D. Walczak H. de Leij L. Helfrich W. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, in the first multiple cloning site of vector pEE14, the high affinity antibody fragment scFv425 (Vh-(G4S)3-Vl format) (41Muller K.M. Arndt K.M. Pluckthun A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Merck, was directionally inserted using the unique SfiI and NotI restriction enzyme sites. In the second MCS a PCR-truncated 593-bp DNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain of human TRAIL (sTRAIL) was cloned in-frame using restriction enzymes XhoI and HindIII, yielding plasmid pEE14-scFv425:sTRAIL. Expression plasmid pEE14-scFv425:sTRAIL was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions, after which transfectants were selected by the glutamine synthetase system as described (42Cockett M.I. Bebbington C.R. Yarranton G.T. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Single cell sorting using the MoFlo high speed cell sorter (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO) established clone 100F1, stably secreting 2.4 μg/ml scFv425:sTRAIL into the culture medium.EGFR-specific Binding of scFv425:sTRAILEGFR-specific binding of scFv425:sTRAIL was assessed by flow cytometry using the EGFR-positive tumor cell line A431 and the EGFR-negative cell line Jurkat. In short, 1 × 106 cells were incubated with scFv425:sTRAIL (300 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of mAb 425 (3 μg/ml). Specific binding of scFv425:sTRAIL was detected using phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-TRAIL mAb B-S23 (Diaclone SAS, Besançon, France) and subsequent fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using an EPICS ELITE flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Mijdrecht, The Netherlands). Incubations were carried out for 45 min at 0 °C and were followed by 2 washes with serum-free medium.Target Cell-restricted Induction of Apoptosis by scFv425:sTRAILTarget cell-restricted induction of apoptosis by scFv425:sTRAIL was assessed by analysis of tumor cell viability, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ), caspase 8 and 3 activation, and PARP cleavage/DNA fragmentation factor degradation, as described in more detail under “Immunoblot Analysis.” Where indicated, treatment with scFv425:sTRAIL was performed in the presence of mAb 425 (3 μg/ml) or mAb 2E5 (1 μg/ml).Apoptosis Assessed by Viability AssayCells were precultured in a 96-well plate at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well. Subsequently, cells were treated for 16 h with the various experimental conditions in a final volume of 200 μl. Cell viability of adherent cell lines was determined by crystal violet staining (Sigma) as described previously (40Wajant H. Moosmayer D. Wuest T. Bartke T. Gerlach E. Schonherr U. Peters N. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4101-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cell viability of suspension cell lines was determined using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega Benelux b.v., Leiden, The Netherlands). Experimental apoptosis induction was quantified as the percentage of apoptosis induction compared with base-line apoptosis in medium control, which was set at 0% apoptosis. Each experimental condition consisted of six independent wells.Apoptosis Assessed by Loss of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψ)Δψ was analyzed using the stain DiOC6 (Eugene, The Netherlands) as previously described (39Bremer E. Kuijlen J. Samplonius D. Walczak H. de Leij L. Helfrich W. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were precultured in a 24-well plate at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/well. Subsequently, cells were treated for 16 h with the various experimental conditions, after which cells were harvested and incubated for 20 min with DiOC6 (0.1 μm) at 37 °C, harvested (1000 × g, 5 min), resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and assessed for DiOC6 staining using flow cytometry.Immunoblot AnalysisCells were precultured at 1.5 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate, after which cells were incubated with scFv425:sTRAIL in the presence or absence of mAb 425 or mAb 2E5 for the indicated time points. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (39Bremer E. Kuijlen J. Samplonius D. Walczak H. de Leij L. Helfrich W. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Subsequently, 30 μg of lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting.Apoptosis Signaling—Caspase activation was detected using antibodies directed against caspase-8 and active caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation factor degradation was assessed using anti-PARP mAb F2 and polyclonal anti-DNA fragmentation factor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Expression of c-FLIPL and Bad phosphorylation was determined using anti-c-FLIPL mAb clone NF6 (Alexis) and polyclonal anti-phospho Bad Ser136 antibody (Cell Signaling).EGFR Signaling—Expression levels of total and active EGFR were assessed using anti-total EGFR (Cell Signaling) and anti-activated EGFR (Tyr-1173) (Santa Cruz). The MAPK signal transduction pathway was analyzed using polyclonal anti-phospho p44/42 MAPK, and the PI3K signal transduction pathway was analyzed using polyclonal total and anti-phospho-AKT Thr-308 and Ser-437 (Cell Signaling). Equal protein loading was assessed using anti-actin mAb (Roche Applied Science). Specific binding was visualized using appropriate secondary Horseradish Peroxidase-conjugated antibody (DAKO Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science).Differential Quantification of Apoptosis in Target and Bystander Cells during Mixed Culture ExperimentsDifferential cell membrane labeling of target and bystander cells was achieved using the Vybrant multicolor cell-labeling Kit (Molecular Probes). Briefly, Jurkat.EGFRvIII target cells were labeled with the red fluorescent dye DiI. Labeling was performed by incubation of Jurkat.EGFRvIII cells (1 × 106 cells/ml in serum free medium) with 5 μm DiI (37 °C, 5 min) followed by 3 washes with standard medium. DiI-labeled Jurkat.EGFRvIII target and non-labeled Jurkat bystander cells were mixed at the indicated ratio at a final concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/well in a 24-well plate. After treatment differential fluorescent characteristics of target cells and bystander cells were used to separately evaluate induction of apoptosis in both populations by Δψ as described above.Synergistic Induction of Apoptosis by scFv425:sTRAIL and IressaJurkat.EGFRvIII cells and A431 cells were simultaneously treated with suboptimal concentrations of scFv425:sTRAIL and Iressa. Where indicated cells were co-incubated with mAb 425 (3 μg/ml), mAb 2E5 (1 μg/ml), Z-VAD-FMK (1 μg/ml), Z-IETD-FMK (1 μg/ml), Z-LEHD-FMK (1 μg/ml), or PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (10 μm). After 16 h of treatment apoptosis was assessed by Δψ as described above. The effect of single-agent and co-treatment of scFv425:sTRAIL and Iressa on apoptotic signaling and EGFR signal transduction by PI3K and MAPK was assessed by immunoblot as described above.RESULTSEGFR-specific Binding of scFv425:sTRAIL—To assess whether scFv425:sTRAIL displayed specific and enhanced binding to EGFR-positive cells, A431 cells were incubated with scFv425:sTRAIL and analyzed for binding by flow cytometry. Strong binding of scFv425:sTRAIL was detected on the cell surface (Fig. 1A, solid line) that could be specifically inhibited by preincubation with parental EGFR-blocking mAb 425 (Fig. 1A, dashed line). In contrast, binding of scFv425:sTRAIL to TRAIL receptors on the cell surface of EGFR-negative Jurkat cells was barely detectable (Fig. 1B). The intensity of scFv425: sTRAIL binding directly correlated to the amount of cell surface-expressed EGFR (data not shown).EGFR-restricted Induction of Apoptosis by scFv425: sTRAIL—Treatment of EGFR-positive tumor cell lines with scFv425:sTRAIL (300 ng/ml) potently induced apoptosis (Fig. 2A: A431, 66%; HS683, 85%; WiDr, 68%; SW948, 78%; A172, 70%; Jurkat.EGFRvIII, 82%), whereas EGFR-negative Jurkat cells were fully resistant to treatment (3%). Apoptosis was specifically inhibited when cells were co-incubated with mAb 425 or TRAIL-neutralizing mAb 2E5 during treatment with scFv425:sTRAIL (Fig. 2B). Binding of scFv425:sTRAIL to cell surface-expressed EGFR results in the reciprocal activation of agonistic TRAIL receptors in a paracrine fashion, whereby apoptotic activity can also be directed toward neighboring tumor cells that are devoid of EGFR expression. To investigate the presence of such a bystander effect, Jurkat.EGFRvIII target cells were mixed with Jurkat bystander cells (ratio 1:1) and treated with scFv425:sTRAIL. After treatment, bystander and target cells were separately assessed for apoptosis, which identified a potent bystander effect of 64% apoptosis in Jurkat bystander cells (Fig. 2C). Apoptosis in Jurkat.EGFRvIII target cells reached ∼50%. In both target cells and bystander cells, apoptosis was specifically inhibited by co-treatment with mAb 425 or mAb 2E5 (Fig. 3C).Fig. 2EGFR-restricted induction of apoptosis by scFv425:sTRAIL.A, a panel of EGFR-positive tumor cell lines (A431, Hs683, WiDr, SW948, A172, and Jurkat.EGFRvIII) and an EGFR-negative cell line (Jurkat) were treated with 300 ng/ml scFv425:sTRAIL. Apoptosis induction was analyzed after 16 h using viability assay. B, WiDr and Jurkat.EGFRvIII were treated with scFv425:sTRAIL (300 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of mAb 425 or TRAIL-neutralizing mAb 2E5. After 16 h apoptosis induction was assessed by Δψ. C, mixed cultures of Jurkat.EGFRvIII target cells and parental Jurkat bystander cells (ratio 1:1) were treated for 16 h with scFv425:sTRAIL in the presence or absence of mAb 425 or mAb 2E5. Differential fluorescent labeling of the target and bystander population was used to separately assess apoptosis by Δψ. Indicated values in bar graphs represent the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Inhibition of EGFR signaling and sensitization to apoptosis by scFv425:sTRAIL. A431 cells were challenged with 300 ng/ml scFv425:sTRAIL in the presence of 1 μg/ml cycloheximide for 10 min, 1 h, and 3 h. At the elapsed time point 3 h, cells were additionally treated with scFv425:sTRAIL in the presence or absence of mAb 425 or mAb 2E5. A, cell lysates were analyzed for the amount of total and phosphorylated EGFR (pTyr1173) using immunoblot. B, cell lysates were analyzed for the MAPK and PI3K pathway activity by measurement of phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK, total and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt). Actin levels were determined to confirm equal protein loading. C, cell lysates were analyzed for the apoptosis-associated features of caspase-8 activation, the expression level of cFLIPL, and the phosphorylation status of Bad at residue Ser-136.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of EGFR Signaling and Subsequent Sensitization to Apoptosis by scFv425:sTRAIL Treatment—Because scFv425: sTRAIL primarily binds via its EGFR-blocking antibody fragment scFv425, the effect of scFv425:sTRAIL treatment on EGFR signaling was determined. In A431 cells, scFv425:sTRAIL induced a rapid dephosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr-1173 within 10 min, whereas total EGFR levels remained constant (Fig. 3A). The phosphorylation of EGFR observed during normal culture conditions was most likely because of a previously described transforming growth factor-α-induced autophosphorylation loop (43Van de Vijver M.J.

Specific inactivation of EGFR signaling was accompanied by a decrease in MAPK pathway activity, which was detected by a dephosphorylation of MAPK at 1 and 3 h of treatment (Fig. 2B). In addition, the PI3K pathway was markedly inhibited after 1 and 3 h of treatment, as measured by dephosphorylation of Akt at residues Tyr-308 and Ser-473 (Fig. 2B), whereas total Akt levels remained constant.Resistance to apoptosis by EGFR signaling is partly mediated by its effect on the anti-apoptotic protein cFLIPL and the phosphorylation of Bad via PI3K signaling. Because PI3K signaling was inactivated by scFv425:sTRAIL treatment, cFLIPL expression and Bad phosphorylation were investigated in more detail. At the early time points of 1 and 3 h of treatment a decrease was detected in the e"

Aph-1 is implicated in the stabilization of this complex, although its precise mechanistic role remains unknown. Substitution of the first glycine within the transmembrane GXXXG motif of Aph-1 causes a loss-of-function phenotype in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, using an untranslated region-targeted RNA interference/rescue strategy in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, we show that Aph-1 contributes to the assembly of the γ-secretase complex by multiple mechanisms involving intermolecular and intramolecular interactions depending on or independent of the conserved glycines. Aph-1 binds to nicastrin forming an early subcomplex independent of the conserved glycines within the endoplasmic reticulum. Certain mutations in the conserved GXXXG motif affect the interaction of the Aph-1·nicastrin subcomplex with presenilin that mediates trafficking of the presenilin·Aph-1·nicastrin tripartite complex to the Golgi. The same mutations decrease the stability of Aph-1 polypeptides themselves, possibly by affecting intramolecular associations through the transmembrane domains. Our data suggest that the proper assembly of the Aph-1·nicastrin subcomplex with presenilin is the prerequisite for the trafficking as well as the enzymatic activity of the γ-secretase complex and that Aph-1 functions as a stabilizing scaffold in the assembly of this complex. γ-Secretase cleaves type I transmembrane proteins, including β-amyloid precursor protein and Notch, and requires the formation of a protein complex comprised of presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 for its activity.

Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2002; 1: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Aβ is derived from the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) through sequential cleavages by β- and γ-secretases (2.Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies suggest that PS is essential for the γ-secretase-mediated intramembrane cleavage of βAPP. Additional type 1 transmembrane proteins (e.g. notch, ErbB4, and CD44) also are cleaved by γ-secretase to release intracellular domains that harbor biological activities (3.Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PS-dependent γ-cleavage is involved in a novel mode of intramembrane proteolysis-dependent signal transduction. PS is a highly conserved, polytopic integral membrane protein that spans the membrane eight times and undergoes endoproteolysis to generate amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments (reviewed in Ref. 4.Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Drug News Perspect. 2004; 17: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The endoproteolytic fragments of PS form a heterodimer and are then incorporated into a highly stabilized, high molecular weight (HMW) protein complex, whereas the PS holoprotein forms a low molecular weight complex and is rapidly degraded (5.Ratovitski T.

Moreover, solubilized γ-secretase activity is recovered in HMW fractions associated with PS fragments, and transition state analogue γ-secretase inhibitors covalently label PS fragments but not PS holoproteins (11.Esler W.P.

These results suggest that the stabilized HMW PS complex harbors γ-secretase activity and that the paired intramembrane aspartates in PS fragments serve as the active center of the γ-secretase, which functions as a novel type of membrane-bound aspartic protease. The molecular composition and the mechanism of assembly of the γ-secretase complex have remained elusive. However, recent studies have identified several putative PS complex components. Nicastrin (Nct) is a type 1 transmembrane protein harboring a large ectodomain that is highly glycosylated in mammalian cells (14.Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L. Yu H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E. Smith M. Janus C. Zhang Y. Aebersold R. Farrer L.S. Sorbi S. Bruni A. Fraser P. St George-Hyslop P. Nature. 2000; 407: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Fully glycosylated Nct is selectively associated with PS fragments, and genetic studies indicate a requirement of Nct for γ-secretase activity (15.De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have revealed two additional polytopic membrane proteins, Aph-1 and Pen-2, that also are required for the γ-secretase activity (16.Goutte C.

We and others have shown that overexpression of Aph-1 together with Nct facilitates the formation of a stabilized but γ-secretase-inactive HMW complex containing PS holoproteins and that Pen-2 subsequently facilitates the formation of PS fragments, conferring γ-secretase activity (18.Hu Y.

Biochemical studies support the notion that a membrane protein complex comprised of these four proteins represents the minimal framework of γ-secretase (23.Farmery M.R. Tjernberg L.O. Pursglove S.E.

Recently, it was reported that Aph-1 preferentially interacts with immature Nct to form an intermediate subcomplex during the early biosynthetic process of γ-secretase in mammalian cells (25.LaVoie M.J.

To investigate the mechanistic roles of Aph-1 in the formation of the PS complex, we focused on the conserved glycine residues within transmembrane domain 4 (TMD4) that form a GXXXG motif. In C. elegans, a glycine to aspartate substitution of the initial glycine residue of this motif causes the aph-1(or28) allele, which is a recessive, maternal effect mutation (16.Goutte C. Tsunozaki M. Hale V.A. Priess J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Aph-1 mutant worms lack the anterior pharynx through a defect in Notch signaling, suggesting that this glycine is obligatory for Aph-1 function. It was shown that the GXXXG motif of mammalian Aph-1a is critical for the assembly and activity of γ-secretase (28.Lee S.F. Shah S. Yu C. Wigley C. Li H. Lim M. Pedersen K. Han W. Thomas P.

However, the specific protein-protein interactions and stoichiometry of individual components as well as the molecular basis for the stabilizing effect of Aph-1, including the mechanistic role of the GXXXG motif, remain unknown. Notably, the amount of exogenous γ-secretase component proteins that can acquire proper functions is limited, because they need to compete with the endogenous proteins for binding with other components in a proper stoichiometry and acquire stability to form a functional γ-secretase complex (30.Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the presence of multiple homologues/isoforms of Aph-1 in the mammalian genome that form different complexes containing either PS1 or PS2 (32.Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Haass C. Steiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41340-41345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) may confound the results of overexpression experiments of Aph-1. To overcome these technical obstacles, we developed a complementation assay using 3′-untranslated region (UTR)-targeted RNAi knock-down followed by transfection of the coding sequence of mutant Aph-1 with artificial UTR derived from an expression vector in Drosophila S2 cells, the latter harboring single presenilin (Psn) or Aph-1 genes, respectively, to minimize the effect of endogenous proteins. Using this system, we analyzed the role of Aph-1 in γ-secretase complex formation, as well as the effect of mutations in the GXXXG motif on the function and metabolism of Aph-1. Construction of Expression Plasmids—Expression plasmids for Psn, Nct-V5, Aph-1-FLAG, hemagglutinin-Pen-2, and the carboxyl-terminal 99-amino acid fragment of βAPP fused to a signal peptide of rat preproenkephalin cDNA (SC100) were generated as described previously (9.Takasugi N.

Establishment of a Complementation Assay by 3′-UTR-targeted RNAi Knock-down in Drosophila S2 Cells—To minimize the effect of endogenous Aph-1 proteins in the analyses of the exogenous mutant Aph-1, we generated short interfering RNAs targeted to the 3′-UTR of the Drosophila Aph-1 gene using a computer-based prediction program (33.Ui-Tei K.

UTR-targeted RNAi in S2 cells expressing SC100, the carboxyl-terminal 99-amino acid fragment of βAPP fused to a signal peptide of rat preproenkephalin cDNA, decreased the levels of Psn fragments (i.e. amino-terminal fragment or carboxyl-terminal fragment) in a similar manner to that observed in cells treated with coding sequence (CDS)-targeted RNAi (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a robust accumulation of APP carboxyl-terminal stubs (i.e. the α-stub-like; see Fig. 1) and a significant reduction in Aβ secretion (24.9 ± 1% of those with GFP-RNAi) were observed (data not shown; see Fig. 2B). These data suggest that the UTR-targeted RNAi against the Aph-1 gene caused a reduction in the levels of endogenous Aph-1 proteins, thereby leading to the breakdown of the γ-secretase complex and inhibition of its activity. We next expressed the wild-type Aph-1 protein that is encoded by an expression plasmid containing the CDS of Aph-1 with a vector-derived artificial UTR. As expected, exogenous proteins were expressed in cells despite UTR-targeted RNAi, whereas these proteins were abolished by the CDS-targeted RNAi (Fig. 1). These data were consistent with the previous reports demonstrating that transitive RNAi is absent in Drosophila (41.Celotto A.M. Graveley B.R.

Moreover, in UTR knockdown cells, the levels of Psn fragments as well as the γ-secretase activity were completely restored by the exogenous wild-type (wt) Aph-1 protein (Fig. 2, A and B). These data suggested that the complementation assay in cells treated with UTR-targeted RNAi enables us to analyze the activity and metabolism of exogenous Aph-1 proteins under the Aph-1-null phenotype in Drosophila S2 cells.Fig. 2Effect of glycine substitutions in the GXXXG motif of Aph-1 on γ-secretase complex formation and γ-secretase activity.A, immunoblot analysis of S2 cells transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding wt or mt Aph-1 (as indicated at the top) together with dsRNAs.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the role of this glycine residue in the metabolism of the γ-secretase complex, we transiently transfected Aph-1/G112D, which is mutated at an equivalent residue to the G122D mutant of C. elegans, into S2 cells deficient in endogenous Aph-1. Immunoblot analysis revealed that Aph-1/G112D failed to restore Psn fragments, suggesting that substitution of the first glycine of the GXXXG motif abolished the formation of γ-secretase complex (Fig. 2A). Conserved residues in TMD4 comprise two GXXXG motifs, known as a transmembrane helix-helix packing motif (43.Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 44.Curran A.R. Engelman D.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Previous data from a TOXCAT assay that investigated TMD association in biological membranes using artificial TMD fused with transcription factors indicated that the replacement of glycine with small side-chain amino acids (e.g. alanine or serine) in the GXXXG motif facilitated the oligomerization of TMDs, whereas bulky amino acids (e.g. tyrosine or phenylalanine) or hydrophilic residues destabilized the TMD association (45.Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Furthermore, large aliphatic residues such as leucine, isoleucine, or valine are disfavored at the positions of the glycines within the GXXXG motif, although these are the most frequent residues in TMDs (46.Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). To elucidate the roles of glycines in the GXXXG motif of TMD4 of Aph-1, we further transfected Aph-1 harboring G112A, G112F, G112L, G116D, G116A, or G116L substitutions into the Aph-1 knock-down cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that G112F, G112L, G116D, or G116L mutant (mt) Aph-1 failed to rescue the Psn fragments just as G112D mt Aph1 failed, whereas mt Aph-1 harboring the alanine substitution (i.e. G112A or G116A) restored the levels of Psn fragments to a similar extent as those restored by wt Aph-1 (Fig. 2A). In addition, the steady-state levels of Aph-1 polypeptides were lower in G112D, G112F, G112L, G116D, or G116L mutants as compared with those in wt or alanine mt Aph-1. To further characterize the effect of the glycine mutations of Aph-1 on γ-secretase activity, we analyzed the metabolism of SC100 and quantitated the levels of Aβ secreted from knockdown cells transiently expressing SC100. Mutants that were unable to rescue the Psn fragments (e.g. G112D) also failed to diminish the accumulation of the α-stub-like by knockdown of Aph-1, whereas alanine mutants rescued these fragments in a similar manner as that of wt Aph-1 (Fig, 2A). Similarly, overexpression of wt Aph-1 as well as the alanine mutants led to a complete rescue of Aβ secretion (Fig. 2B) (e.g. 109.0 ± 1.0% for wt Aph-1, 107.9 ± 1.8% for G112A, and 111.2 ± 2.5% for G116A, respectively, in Aβ40 secretion compared with those with GFP-RNAi). In contrast, the levels of secreted Aβ from Aph-1 knockdown cells transfected with mt Aph-1 (i.e. G112D, G112F, G112L, G116D, and G116L) were not recovered (25.3 ± 0.9, 25.8 ± 1.4, 26.7 ± 1.2, 23.4 ± 0.9, and 24.0 ± 0.8%, respectively, in Aβ40 secretion as compared to those with GFP-RNAi), suggesting that these mutations cause a loss-of-function in γ-secretase activity. These results suggest that the small size and hydrophobic nature of the conserved glycine residues within TMD4 of Aph-1 are important for the function of Aph-1 to facilitate the generation of the active γ-secretase complex. Certain Mutations of the Conserved Glycines of Aph-1 Abolish the Formation of a Functional γ-Secretase Complex through Assembly with Psn or Pen-2 but Not with Nct—We next established S2 cell lines stably expressing wt or mt Aph-1 (i.e. G112D, G112F, G112L, G116D, or G116L) together with Nct and Pen-2 (wt or mt ANPen cells, respectively). Overexpression of wt Aph-1 together with other components resulted in a significant increase in the levels of Psn fragments as described previously (19.Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). However, the levels of the Psn fragments, Nct, and Pen-2, in mt ANPen cells were lower than those in wt ANPen cells (Fig. 3A, left, lysate) as observed in transient rescue experiments in Aph-1 knockdown cells (Fig. 2A). To gain more insight into the roles of these mutations of the conserved glycines, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays in ANPen stable cell lines (Fig. 3A, right). Endogenous Psn as well as exogenously transfected Nct or Pen-2 were co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged wt Aph-1, consistent with our previous results (19.Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M.

https://openalex.org/W2122323193,"Leptin resistance is a common feature of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. However, the regulated expression of the leptin receptor (Ob-R) has not been studied in detail. Expression profiling of liver mRNA in leptin-treated wild-type mice revealed a marked increase in leptin receptor mRNA levels, which had not previously been described. This was confirmed by isoform-specific real-time PCR, which showed a >25-fold increase in the mRNAs encoding the short forms (Ob-Ra, Ob-Rc) and a >10-fold increase in the mRNA encoding the long (Ob-Rb) form of the leptin receptor in liver. In parallel, we also observed induction of plasma-soluble leptin receptor (SLR) protein by leptin administration, pair feeding, and short term food restriction. However, induction of SLR by leptin is abolished in mice with selective deletion of Ob-R from liver using Cre-LoxP technology. These data suggest that the liver is a major source of Ob-R mRNA expression under conditions of negative energy balance. Membrane-bound Ob-R is then shed into the circulation as SLR. Our study thus reveals an unexpected role of the liver in modulating total circulating leptin levels and possibly its biological activity.

The hormone leptin is the afferent signal in an endocrine program regulating energy balance, metabolism, and neuroendocrine function (1Friedman J.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Mice lacking leptin (ob/ob) or its receptor (db/db) are massively obese and hyperphagic (2Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M.

Leptin administration in wild-type and ob/ob mice causes a dose-dependent reduction in food intake and body weight (6Halaas J.L. Boozer C. Blair-West J. Fidahusein N. Denton D.A. Friedman J.M. Proc.

Leptin elicits metabolic effects that cannot be explained by its actions on food intake alone, characterized by selective depletion of peripheral tissue lipid and enhanced insulin sensitivity (7Cohen P. Miyazaki M. Socci N.D. Hagge-Greenberg A. Liedtke W. Soukas A.A. Sharma R. Hudgins L.C. Ntambi J.M. Friedman J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 8Cohen P.

A small number of humans with morbid obesity and marked hyperphagia with null mutations in leptin have been identified (9Montague C.T. Farooqi I.S. Whitehead J.P. Soos M.A. Rau H. Wareham N.J.

As in mice, leptin-deficient patients can be successfully treated with leptin replacement (11Gibson W.T. Farooqi I.S. Moreau M. Depaoli A.M. Lawrence E. O'Rahilly S. Trussell R.A. J. Clin.

Although these findings establish a role for leptin therapy in humans, the preponderance of obese humans overproduce leptin and are thus leptin resistant (14Ravussin E. Pratley R.E. Maffei M. Wang H. Friedman J.M. Bennett P.H. Bogardus C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A more complete understanding of the molecular components of the pathway regulating energy homeostasis will be necessary to develop effective therapeutics for obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Leptin acts by binding to its receptor, Ob-R, which in rodents can be alternatively spliced into five different isoforms (Ob-Ra–e) (4Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). Ob-Rb is the only isoform that has been shown to mediate signal transduction in vivo and is expressed most abundantly in the brain (15Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Physiological and genetic studies have shown that the effects of leptin are mediated via its action in the brain (16Kowalski T.J. Liu S.M. Leibel R.L. Chua S.C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Cohen P. Zhao C. Cai X. Montez J.M. Rohani S.C. Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. Friedman J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). However, the leptin receptor is broadly expressed, and the role of leptin in peripheral tissues and of isoforms other than Ob-Rb is less well defined (18Fei H. Okano H.J. Li C. Lee G.H. Zhao C. Darnell R. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7001-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). One of the splice variants of the leptin receptor, Ob-Re, does not encode a transmembrane domain and is secreted. Although Ob-Re mRNA has been identified in rodents, the Ob-Re splice form has not been found in humans; however, soluble leptin receptor (SLR) 1The abbreviations used are: SLR, soluble leptin receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. circulates in human plasma (19Chan J.L.

Young S.J. Chung W.K. Leibel R.L. Genomics. 1997; 45: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that SLR may be generated by ectodomain shedding of membrane-spanning receptors mediated by a metalloprotease (21Ge H. Huang L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45898-45903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Maamra M. Bidlingmaier M. Postel-Vinay M.C. Wu Z. Strasburger C.J. Ross R.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4389-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of Ob-Re mRNA-derived SLR to ectodomain shedding-derived SLR in plasma is not known, as the sizes of circulating SLR generated by either mechanism are indistinguishable by Western blotting analysis. The generation of SLR protein is regulated under physiological conditions. In mice, expression of Ob-Re mRNA in the placenta is strongly induced at later stages of pregnancy, causing an up to 40-fold increase in SLR (23Gavrilova O. Barr V. Marcus-Samuels B. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30546-30551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In humans, levels of SLR are inversely related to adiposity (24van Dielen F.M. van't Veer C. Buurman W.A. Greve J.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 1708-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Previously, we and others reported that SLR is the major determinant of plasma leptin levels and acts to stabilize circulating leptin without increasing leptin transcription in adipose tissue (25Landt M. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Huang L. Wang Z. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6343-6349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We also found both in vitro and in vivo that similar to human SLR, murine SLR may be generated by ectodomain shedding of membrane spanning receptors (21Ge H. Huang L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45898-45903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Subsequent in vitro studies demonstrated that, when leptin is bound to its soluble receptor, the leptin-SLR complex is incapable of activating Ob-Rb, although it does not inhibit the action of free leptin (27Yang G. Ge H. Boucher A. Yu X. Li C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1354-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results suggest that SLR serves to sequester leptin from productive interactions with its signaling receptor. In aggregate, these findings point to SLR as an important determinant of leptin action. However, the nutritional regulation of SLR levels remained incompletely studied, and its tissue site of production was unknown. In this study, we report the induction of Ob-R mRNA in the liver by leptin administration, with a parallel increase in plasma levels of SLR. We also show that SLR is induced by pair feeding and fasting. Induction of SLR was not observed in mice with selective deletion of Ob-R in liver generated using the Cre-LoxP system. These data indicate that the liver is a major source of SLR expression in states of negative energy balance and demonstrate a novel role for the liver in modulating leptin action.

X-ray film was from Denville Scientific Inc. (Metuchen, NJ). Animals—Male C57Bl/6 and ob/ob mice at 10 weeks of age were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). C57Bl/6 and ob/ob mice were fed a standard rodent chow. The mice were maintained between 21–23 °C on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle. Mice were housed and cared for by the staff at The Rockefeller University and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Animal Resource Centers. For leptin treatment, the mice were individually caged and allowed to acclimate for approximately 1 week prior to the start of the experiment. Alzet 2002 mini-osmotic pumps were filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or leptin (5 μg/ml) and implanted subcutaneously under anesthesia. Leptin-treated mice received 60 μgof leptin/24 h. Groups of mice were sacrificed at days 6 and 8 of treatment. On day 8, the subcutaneous pumps were removed from the remaining mice under anesthesia, and the mice were then sacrificed at 1, 2, 3, or 4 days following withdrawal. For the second time course experiment, animals were treated with PBS or the same dose of leptin for up to 10 days. Pair-fed mice were treated with PBS but only allowed to eat as much as leptin-treated mice voluntarily consumed. For food deprivation experiments, animals had their food removed and were sacrificed 24 h later. Ob-RAlbKO mice, which have a hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ob-R, and littermate controls were generated as described previously (17Cohen P. Zhao C. Cai X. Montez J.M. Rohani S.C. Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. Friedman J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). These animals were treated with PBS or 5 μg/ml leptin for 10 days. Upon sacrifice, tissues were removed and snap-frozen at –80 °C for RNA and protein isolation. Plasma was collected using heparinized tubes on EDTA. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the policies of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Rockefeller University and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Real-time PCR—Ob-R levels were quantitated using Taqman® realtime PCR. Total RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers with reverse transcription reagents from Roche. Expression levels were determined using 25 ng of each cDNA sample assayed in duplicate and amplified with the ABI Prism 7700® sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Ob-R probes were labeled with FAM dye. As a control for the input amount, each cDNA sample was also amplified using primers and a probe labeled with VIC dye for cyclophilin. The sequences of the primers and probes were as follows: Ob-Rcommon probe, 5′-AAACCACATAGAATTTCT GACACATCATCTTTC-3′; Ob-Rcommon forward primer, 5′-AGGAATCGTTCTGCAAATCCA-3′; and Ob-Rcommon reverse primer, 5′-TATGCCAGGTTAAGTGCAGCTATC-3′. For isoform-specific quantitation, all assays were done using the same probe 5′-AAATTCAGTCCTTGTGCCCAGGAACAATT-3′ and the same forward primer 5′-TGTTTTGGGACGATGTTCCA-3′. Reverse primers were: for Ob-Ra, 5′-ATTGGGTTCATCTGTAGTGGTCATG-3′; Ob-Rb, 5′-GCTTGGTAAAAAGATGCTCAATG-3′; and Ob-Rc, 5′-TGGCATCTAAACTGCAACCTTAGA-3′. For cyclophilin, the probe and primers were as follows: cyclophilin probe, 5′-ACACGCCATAATGGCACTGGTGG-3′; forward primer, 5′-TGTGCCAGGGTGGTGACTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCAAATTTCTCTCCGTAGATGGACTT-3′. Data were analyzed with the ABI Sequence Detector® software. Every set of reactions contained a set of four serial 2-fold dilutions of the same liver cDNA source, which was used to generate a standard curve for both Ob-R and cyclophilin. The amounts of each transcript were calculated from the standard curve, and levels of Ob-R were corrected for levels of cyclophilin (Ob-R level/cyclophilin level). Plasma Preparation and Soluble Leptin Receptor Assay—Plasma (50 μl) from ob/ob or wild-type mice was diluted in PBS to 1 ml and incubated with 15 μl of leptin-Sepharose resin (2 μg leptin/μl beads) overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS each and then boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Resin suspension was loaded directly onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted with an anti-leptin receptor polyclonal antibody as described previously (5Li C. Ioffe E. Fidahusein N. Connolly E.

Northern Blotting Analysis of Ob-R RNA Levels in Liver—Total RNA was extracted from the livers of mice treated with or without leptin. To prepare a probe that would detect all forms of Ob-R, PCR was performed on a plasmid encoding full-length Ob-Rb cDNA, pcDNA3.1(–)/jmyc/HisA-Ob-Rb, as described previously (28Li C. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9677-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Primer sequences were: forward, 5′-GTGGTAAAGACTTGAGGTGAAC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAATTATGACTCTAAGGTCCATC-3′. The PCR product (0.5 kb) corresponds to part of the ectodomain of Ob-R (21Ge H. Huang L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45898-45903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To detect Ob-Re mRNA, three copies of Ob-Re-specific cDNA sequence were ligated in tandem in a head-to-tail fashion and subcloned into pBluescript SK(+), named pBS3Re. Each copy of the Ob-Re-specific sequence was amplified using the following primers, each containing an EcoRI site for subcloning: forward primer, 5′-CGGAATTCGTATGTGTACTGTACTTTTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGGAATTCGAGGTTGTCATTAAATGATT-3′, using as a template a cDNA clone encoding full-length Ob-Re (26Huang L. Wang Z. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6343-6349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). PCR products were digested with EcoRI, self-ligated, and run on gel to purify the ligated fragment that runs between 300 and 500 bp. The purified fragment is then ligated into pBluescript SK(+) to generate pBS3Re, which was verified by sequencing analysis. Northern blotting was performed by loading 10 μg of total RNA/lane on a formaldehyde-agarose gel. RNA was transferred onto Hybond-N+ membrane. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP with a random primer labeling kit. Hybridization was performed in Rapid-hyb buffer at 65 °C for 2 h. The membrane was washed in washing buffer (1% SSC, 0.1% SDS) three times, 15 min each, at the same temperature and exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C. Adenovirus Infusion—Mice were divided into three groups of two mice each. Groups 1 and 2 were wild-type C57Bl/6 mice; group 3 was ob/ob mice. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding FLAG-Ob-Rb or β-galactosidase were injected into the jugular vein of the mice. Each mouse received 2 × 1011 total virus particles in 0.2 ml of PBS under anesthesia by mouse/rat mixture (500 mg of ketamine, 50 mg of xylazine, 10 mg of acepromazine in 20 ml of sterile H2O). Three days after virus infection, 50 μl of plasma sample from each mouse were collected from the tail vein. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and livers were dissected immediately, washed with PBS, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total protein was extracted by homogenization in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) on ice. Liver lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was harvested and stored for use. To determine the levels of SLR in plasma or Ob-Rb in liver, 20 μl of plasma or 10 mg of total liver lysate from virus-infected mice was diluted with PBS to 1 ml and incubated with leptin-Sepharose resin at 4 °C overnight. Leptin beads were processed as above. Statistical Methods—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad software. Significance was evaluated using the unpaired Student's t test. Expression Profiling of Livers of Leptin-treated Wild-type Mice—Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to examine the molecular effects of leptin treatment on the livers of wild-type mice. We previously used expression profiling to show that leptin induces robust changes in the expression profile of ob/ob livers, and in the process identified stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) as a key mediator of the metabolic effects of leptin (7Cohen P. Miyazaki M. Socci N.D. Hagge-Greenberg A. Liedtke W. Soukas A.A. Sharma R. Hudgins L.C. Ntambi J.M. Friedman J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 29Cohen P. Ntambi J.M. Friedman J.M. Curr. Drug Targets Immune. Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 2003; 3: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Wild-type mice were treated with leptin or saline via implanted osmotic pumps for up to 8 days. As an additional control to evaluate the effects of a shift from negative to positive energy balance, another cohort of mice were treated with leptin for 8 days, after which treatment was withdrawn and the animals were allowed to feed freely (leptin withdrawal). Body weight and food intake of these mice is shown in Fig. 1, A and B. Food intake reached its nadir at day 3, which has previously been shown to be temporally associated with the complete depletion of adipose tissue mass (7Cohen P. Miyazaki M. Socci N.D. Hagge-Greenberg A. Liedtke W. Soukas A.A. Sharma R. Hudgins L.C. Ntambi J.M. Friedman J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Thereafter, food intake rebounded and weight loss stabilized. Upon withdrawal of leptin, mice were markedly hyperphagic and returned to baseline body weight within 4 days. Plasma levels of leptin, insulin, and glucose were measured in each animal. Leptin levels were significantly increased at days 6 and 8 of treatment, with levels >80-fold that of untreated controls (Fig. 1C). Upon withdrawal of leptin, at day 9, leptin levels were virtually undetectable, as these mice had been treated with leptin until their adipose stores were completely depleted and thus lacked both exogenous and endogenous leptin. This hypoleptinemia stimulated the marked hyperphagia observed in the leptin withdrawal group, leading to a rapid return to basal body weight and normalization of plasma leptin levels. Plasma insulin levels were significantly reduced at days 6 and 8 of leptin treatment, relative to controls, but upon leptin withdrawal, increased significantly, as these mice rapidly shifted from a state of negative to positive energy balance (Fig. 1D). Glucose levels were also reduced with leptin treatment, but returned to baseline levels upon leptin withdrawal (Fig. 1E). Leptin-treated or saline-treated control mice were sacrificed at 6 and 8 days of treatment and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 days after leptin withdrawal. Liver RNA was isolated and cRNA was synthesized and hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays. RNA levels in each sample were normalized to those from livers of untreated wild-type mice. We were interested in identifying genes that were either markedly induced or repressed upon chronic leptin treatment and subsequently normalized upon leptin withdrawal (30Soukas A. Cohen P. Socci N.D. Friedman J.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 963-980PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that these genes would be important mediators of the effects of leptin on energy homeostasis. Induction of Leptin Receptor (Ob-R) mRNA by Leptin Treatment—One gene found to be strongly induced by chronic leptin treatment and normalized upon leptin withdrawal was that encoding Ob-R, the leptin receptor. Ob-R encodes five splice variants, denoted Ob-Ra–e. Ob-Rb, the long form, has been shown to mediate signal transduction and is expressed at its highest levels in hypothalamic nuclei, important in regulating food intake and energy homeostasis. Ob-Re, which encodes SLR, binds leptin and circulates in the plasma. SLR can also be generated by ectodomain shedding of membrane-bound forms of Ob-R. Although the leptin receptor is broadly expressed, a physiological role in the liver has not previously been identified. Real-time PCR (Taqman) was performed to validate the microarray data. Relative to controls, at 6 and 8 days of leptin treatment, Ob-R RNA was induced ∼15- and 70-fold, respectively (Fig. 2A). Upon leptin withdrawal and a switch to positive energy balance, Ob-R RNA levels rapidly returned to control levels. The data in Fig. 2A were generated using primers and probes that amplify all Ob-R splice variants. Real-time PCR using primers and probes specific to individual splice variants showed that Ob-Ra, Ob-Rb, and Ob-Rc all followed a qualitatively similar trend, with robust induction at days 6 and 8 of leptin treatment and return to basal levels with leptin withdrawal (Fig. 2B). Induction of SLR by Chronic Leptin Treatment—The marked induction of the RNA encoding multiple Ob-R isoforms suggested that chronic leptin treatment might be associated with increased plasma-soluble leptin receptor protein SLR by ectodomain shedding of membrane-bound isoforms. To test this prediction, a separate time course experiment was performed in which wild-type mice were treated with the same dose of leptin for either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 days. As additional controls, groups of free-fed saline-treated mice and pair-fed saline-treated mice were also studied. Pair-fed mice were only allowed to eat as much food as leptin-treated mice voluntarily consumed. No significant difference in body weight was noted between leptin-treated and pair-fed mice (data not shown). As in Fig. 1B, food intake reached its lowest level at day 3 of leptin administration, and thereafter, weight loss leveled off and food intake rebounded. Plasma was isolated at each time point, and SLR levels were measured using a leptin-Sepharose pull-down assay (see “Materials and Methods”). SLR levels were slightly induced, relative to saline-treated controls, as early as day 1 of leptin treatment (Fig. 3A). However, SLR was significantly up-regulated at day 3, the time point at which food intake was at its nadir and animals were in a state of maximal negative energy balance. SLR levels remained up-regulated at the remaining time points, with a slight decrease at day 10. SLR was also induced by pair feeding, although not nearly as dramatically as by leptin treatment. This suggests that although leptin may be the most potent stimulus for inducing SLR, other conditions that induce a state of negative energy balance, such as pair feeding, may also be associated with SLR up-regulation. Short Term Fasting Elevates Plasma-soluble Leptin Receptor Levels—Leptin treatment of mice causes a reduction in food intake, which creates a negative energy balance. To determine the effects of nutrient reduction or deprivation, we measured SLR levels in fasted mice. As shown in Fig. 3B, short term acute food deprivation of wild-type mice also resulted in increased soluble leptin receptor levels. In aggregate, these results demonstrated that both leptin administration and food restriction cause a rise in plasma soluble leptin receptor in wild-type mice. These findings provide examples of additional mechanisms regulating SLR induction in vivo. However, the up-regulation of SLR with pair feeding or fasting was much less potent than that with leptin. Increased SLR Levels Are Not Due to Increased Ob-Re RNA Levels—The above data indicate that leptin administration induced liver Ob-R RNA, with a concomitant increase in plasma SLR levels. We hypothesized that this phenomenon was the result of cleavage of the membrane-bound receptor. To test this theory, we evaluated the alternative hypothesis that increased SLR levels were derived from an up-regulation of Ob-Re RNA. An Ob-Re isoform-specific real-time PCR assay was not possible, because the unique portion of the Ob-Re message is too short to generate specific primers and probes. Therefore, Northern blotting was done using a pan-Ob-R probe and an Ob-Re-specific probe generated from concatamers of the unique Ob-Re sequence. Blotting with the pan-Ob-R probe revealed a robust increase in RNA levels at days 6 and 8 of leptin treatment (Fig. 4A). Upon withdrawal of leptin (Fig. 4A, lanes 5–8), Ob-R RNA levels rapidly diminished to undetectable levels, as shown in Fig. 2A. As a comparison, placenta RNA, which is the richest known source of Ob-Re RNA, was run in the last lane. Pan-Ob-R RNA levels from this tissue were even greater than those from leptin-treated livers, but the band migrated at a lower molecular weight, indicating that the induction of Ob-R RNA in liver was accounted for by induction of membrane-bound isoforms. To confirm this prediction, Fig. 4A, lower panel, shows the same samples blotted with an Ob-Re-specific probe. Only placenta showed a detectable signal, suggesting that the increased Ob-R RNA levels in leptin-treated liver and associated up-regulation of plasma SLR were because of increased RNA levels and cleavage of membrane-bound Ob-R isoforms. Production of SLR Protein by the Liver—Although our data established liver Ob-R RNA induction as a physiological source of increased plasma SLR levels in leptin-treated animals, we wished to determine the extent to which the liver was responsible for plasma SLR production in states of negative energy balance. Previously reported microarray analysis of white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle RNA from leptin-treated mice did not detect any induction in Ob-R RNA levels. To examine this question more directly, we treated Ob-RAlbKO mice with leptin. These mice, generated by Cre-loxP technology, have a hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ob-R and thus have a significant reduction in liver Ob-R RNA levels. A time course experiment was performed in which Ob-RAlbKO or littermate controls were treated with leptin or saline for 10 days. Both groups of mice showed equivalent reductions in body weight and food intake (data not shown) with similar kinetics to the time course in Fig. 1. Saline-treated Ob-RAlbKO and littermate controls had similar levels of plasma SLR (Fig. 4B). Although leptin treatment of the controls led to a robust increase in plasma SLR levels (Fig. 4B, lane 2), as shown in Fig. 3, leptin-treated Ob-RAlbKO only showed a moderate increase in plasma SLR levels (Fig. 4B, lanes 6–8). This indicates that the liver is the predominant source of increased plasma SLR in leptin-treated animals. Shedding of Membrane-bound Ob-R Is Independent of Leptin Action—To determine whether ectodomain shedding of Ob-R requires leptin action, ob/ob mice were fasted for 24 h (as for wild-type mice) or infused with adenoviruses encoding Ob-Rb or a control protein, β-galactosidase. Similar to that in wild-type mice (Fig. 3B), levels of plasma-soluble leptin receptor became elevated after a 24-h fast (Fig. 5A). Liver and plasma samples were prepared 3 days after virus infection to detect adenovirally expressed full-length Ob-Rb as well as shed SLR. Ob-Rb was tagged at the N terminus with a FLAG tag so that shedding from virally generated Ob-Rb could be easily detected with a FLAG antibody. Blotting of total liver lysate confirmed that Ob-Rb was expressed in the livers of Ad-Ob-Rb-infused mice (Fig. 5, B and C, upper panels). As expected, Ad-Ob-Rb expression in wild-type mice resulted in the appearance of two circulating forms of Ob-R (Fig. 5, B and C, lanes 3 and 4, lower panels), as we reported previously (21Ge H. Huang L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45898-45903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the ob/ob mouse that is deficient for leptin, the same species of circulating Ob-R fragments were also observed (Fig. 5, B and C, lane 5, lower panels), which were not detected in Ad-β-Gal-treated mice (Fig. 5, B and C, lanes 1 and 2, lower panels). Because no leptin was given to ob/ob mice either during fasting or adenovirus expression, these data demonstrate that shedding is independent of leptin action. In this report, we demonstrated that soluble leptin receptor is induced by both leptin treatment and food deprivation. Microarray analysis of liver from leptin-treated mice showed an unexpected and robust induction in Ob-R mRNA levels, accounted for by increased levels of RNA encoding Ob-Ra–c, the membrane-bound forms of the receptor (4Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). This was associated with increased levels of plasma SLR. Although SLR is preferentially induced by leptin administration, pair feeding and short term food restriction in both wild-type and ob/ob mice also increased levels of SLR. The increased levels of plasma SLR appear to be the result of cleavage and shedding of membrane-bound Ob-R, as leptin treatment and food restriction had no effect on levels of Ob-Re RNA, which encodes a soluble form of the receptor. We further showed that the leptin-mediated increase in plasma SLR was predominantly, or perhaps entirely, derived from the liver. Ob-RAlbKO mice, which have a Cre-mediated deletion of Ob-R in hepatocytes, only showed a modest induction in plasma SLR following leptin treatment. This small level increase may be derived from residual Ob-R, as the efficiency of Ob-R deletion varies between mice but never reaches 100% efficiency. Finally, to understand the trigger for membrane shedding, we showed that cleavage of membrane-bound Ob-R is independent of leptin action. Although induction of liver Ob-R RNA and plasma SLR was first identified using a microarray screen for leptin-induced genes in wild-type liver, we further showed that pair feeding and starvation may also induce SLR. This suggests that a state of negative energy balance, rather than leptin administration per se, is the stimulus for SLR up-regulation. Induction of SLR by a 72-h fast has also been reported in humans (19Chan J.L. Bluher S. Yiannakouris N. Suchard M.A. Kratzsch J. Mantzoros C.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). SLR induction in leptin-treated mice was temporally associated with the time of most rapid weight loss. Some signal during this physiological state likely acts to increase Ob-R RNA levels and concomitant membrane shedding. This signal could be reduced plasma insulin levels, with decreased signaling through the liver insulin receptor acting to stimulate Ob-R transcription and membrane shedding. Alternatively, the mechanism for SLR induction could involve other endocrine factors or molecules, perhaps not previously appreciated to be involved in energy homeostasis. The physiological role of Ob-R RNA induction and increased SLR levels remains to be determined. We and others have previously shown in vitro that SLR can sequester leptin from its membrane-bound receptor, thereby limiting leptin action (27Yang G. Ge H. Boucher A. Yu X. Li C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1354-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Soluble receptors for a number of cytokines exist and, in many cases, also inhibit the action of these cytokines at their respective target sites. SLR-bound leptin may be blocked from entering the central nervous system or from acting on peripheral tissues. Given that SLR induction is associated with states of negative energy balance, perhaps this phenomenon arose as an adaptation to limit the effects of leptin in periods when nutrients are scarce. This would represent an additional level of control over the increasingly intricate molecular circuit regulating energy homeostasis. SLR has been shown to be highly induced during pregnancy, secondary to increased Ob-Re production by the placenta (23Gavrilova O. Barr V. Marcus-Samuels B. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30546-30551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This may represent one means to limit leptin action and increase energy storage during pregnancy, with clear adaptive value. On the other hand, SLR levels in humans have been shown to be inversely related to the measures of adiposity (24van Dielen F.M. van't Veer C. Buurman W.A. Greve J.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 1708-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Obese humans may have inappropriately low levels of SLR and consequently be exposed to chronically elevated free leptin. This could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of leptin resistance. As SLR binding stabilizes leptin and increases its half-life, it is also plausible that SLR facilitates leptin action. In fact, SLR may act as a buffer serving to maintain free plasma leptin levels within a specified range. When plasma leptin levels are low, SLR may potentiate leptin action, and when plasma leptin levels are high, SLR may inhibit leptin action. Such a role has previously been demonstrated for insulin-like growth factor and the family of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (31Mazerbourg S. Callebaut I. Zapf J. Mohan S. Overgaard M. Monget P. Growth Horm IGF Res. 2004; 14: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Further studies are currently underway to better define the role of SLR induction in rodents and humans. The above data clearly establish a role for liver Ob-R in generating plasma SLR. However, the possibility exists that ablation of liver Ob-R would also block leptin signaling in the liver (32Cohen B. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Science. 1996; 274: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), which could affect the release of a hormone/cytokine that regulates Ob-R cleavage or Ob-Re mRNA levels in another tissue. The biochemical events leading to cleavage of the membrane-bound receptor and the regulation of SLR-leptin binding and dissociation remain to be elucidated. Although we have shown that the induction of liver Ob-R RNA is closely associated with increased plasma SLR levels, the increased Ob-R, particularly that of the signaling isoform Ob-Rb, may be associated with a signaling role within the liver. These data represent the first demonstration of a role for liver Ob-R in modulating the biological effects of leptin. The induction of Ob-R and plasma SLR levels appears to represent an additional level of control over the physiological actions of leptin. SLR may play an important role in energy homeostasis, and alterations in SLR levels may be relevant to the pathogenesis of leptin resistance and obesity. Further work may point to SLR as a therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders. We thank Drs. Roger Unger and Joyce Repa for many discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1992754142,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which degrades heme into three products (carbon monoxide, free iron, and biliverdin), plays a protective role in many models of disease via its anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-proliferative actions. Overexpression of HO-1 has been shown to suppress immune responses and prolong the survival of allografts; however, the underlying mechanism is not clear. We demonstrate two ""new"" properties of HO-1 that mediate activation induced cell death (AICD) of allo-antigen-responsive murine CD4+ T cells, resulting in immunomodulation. First, it functions in vivo and in vitro to ""boost"" the proliferative response of CD4+ T cells to allo-antigens in the early phase of allo-antigen-driven immune responses. This ""boosting"" effect is accompanied with a significant increase of activation markers and IL-2 production. Second, it exerts a pro-apoptotic effect in those activated T cells after the initial burst of proliferation. We further show that the AICD effect is mediated through the Fas/CD95-FasL signal transduction pathway. Correlating with the above-mentioned findings is the observed prolongation of mouse heart graft survival when HO-1 is expressed in vivo in both donor and recipient. In conclusion, induction of HO-1 expression accelerates clonal deletion of peripheral alloreactive CD4+ T cells by promoting AICD, which is presumably a key mechanism for its immunomodulatory effects such as in prolonging the survival of transplanted organs."
https://openalex.org/W2122537519,"CD44 is a receptor for hyaluronic acid and is found on the surface of hematopoetic cells and in mesenchymal tissue. It is also expressed on endothelial cells (EC). Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of prostaglandins in EC. Here we show that engagement of CD44 with signaling monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or its natural ligand hyaluronic acid induces COX-2 and prostacyclin (PGI2) formation in human EC. This induction was blocked by mAbs that have been shown to inhibit CD44-mediated intracellular signaling. COX-1 induction was not observed after CD44 ligation. CD44-stimulated COX-2 activation/PGI2 production was accompanied by the production of the potent endothelial mitogen, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and was inhibited by a neutralizing VEGF antibody. Moreover, this COX-2 induction was also associated with an increase in EC proliferation that was inhibited by the blocking anti-CD44 mAbs and a COX-2-specific inhibitor. This is the first study to show that engagement of CD44 with mAbs or its natural ligand induces COX-2, generates VEGF, and thus leads to an increase in EC proliferation. Results from this study may have important and widespread implications for the development of novel therapeutic agents for modulating blood vessel growth during ischemic heart disease, during inflammation, or around solid tumors."

Stress conditions generated in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells by the administration of a single exposure of 5 Gy IR resulted in the activation of ERK but not p38 or JNK, along with an enhancement of the NF-κB transactivation and GADD45β expression. Overexpression of dominant negative Erk (DN-Erk) or pre-exposure to ERK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited NF-κB.

Interestingly, NF-κB is also associated with the mitochondrial stress resulting in the activation of calcineurin and mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme Mn-SOD (20.Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Devalaraja M.N.

Yan-Sanders Y. Lyn-Cook B.D. Wang T. Tamae D. Ogi J. Khaletskiy A. Li Z. Weydert C. Longmate J.A. Huang T.T. Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Li J.J. Mol. Cell.

These findings illustrate a possibility that a group of stress-sensitive proteins are required for cell survival. The context of the IR-induced NF-κB and other signaling elements needs to be elucidated. Accumulating results suggest that the group of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), i.e. ERK, JNK, p38, functions to signal responses to IR (23.Hara T. Namba H. Yang T.T. Nagayama Y. Fukata S.

Therefore, ERK activation appears to be a necessary event in signaling cell proliferation and survival (26.Meier K.E. Gause K.C. Wisehart-Johnson A.E. Gore A.C. Finley E.L. Jones L.G. Bradshaw C.D. McNair A.F. Ella K.M. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27.Kurada P. White K.

In contrast, although JNK, a key member of MAPKs, induces NF-κB in anti-apoptotic responses (35.Javelaud D. Besancon F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4365-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), NF-κB-targeted genes are shown to inhibit JNK required for initiating tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis (8.Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Recent data further indicate that ERK-mediated anti-apoptotic response is dependent upon its cellular locations and interaction with NF-κB·IκB complexes (36.Ajenjo N. Canon E. Sanchez-Perez I. Matallanas D. Leon J. Perona R. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32813-32823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether ERK and MAPKs are associated with NF-κB-mediated radioprotection. GADD45β (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible β, also named MyD118) is key member of nuclear proteins inducible by DNA-damaging stresses and has been shown to play an active role in cell cycle adjustment that affects cell survival (37.Lu B. Ferrandino A.F. Flavell R.A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It has been long observed that IR-induced GADD45β expression (38.Papathanasiou M.A. Kerr N.C. Robbins J.H. McBride O.W. Alamo Jr., I. Barrett S.F. Hickson I.D. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Experiments of antisense transfections find that GADD45β interacts with cyclin B1 complex during S and G2/M checkpoints following UV irradiation (41.Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). GADD45β is also required in T cell receptor-induced responses and ERK, p38, and JNK activation are all substantially suppressed in GADD45β-deficient CD4(+) T cells (37.Lu B. Ferrandino A.F. Flavell R.A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting a tight link between GADD45β and MAPKs pathways. NF-κB is shown to induce Gadd45β promoter activity (42.Jin R. De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Nguyen D.U. Papa S. Jones J. Cox C. Gelinas C. Franzoso G. DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and GADD45β induced by NF-κB can down-regulate the pro-apoptotic JNK (43.De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U.

To characterize the signaling network of NF-κB activation that appears to play a key role in cell death or survival after high dose IR, we have examined the hypothesis that NF-κB, ERK, and GADD45β co-operate in radiation response. Inhibition of either factor by transfection of dominant negative mutant or pre-treatment with inhibitor compounds blocks the activity of other two components in a loop-like connection. Because antisense blocking gadd45β inhibited NF-κB and ERK but not other MAPKs, i.e. p38 and JNK, ERK, and gadd45β are likely to be specifically required for signaling NF-κB-mediated cell protection. The present study thus reveals a novel connection of NF-κB with activation of ERK and GADD45β in defending cell survival after IR insults. Cell Culture and Exposure to Ionizing Radiation—MCF-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (passage number: 126) and maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential media (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1% l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C. Exponentially growing cells with 60–80% confluence were exposed to IR at room temperature with a Cs-137 mark I irradiator (dose rate, 436 cGy/min, J. L. Shepherd & Associates). Cells sheltered from IR source were used as the sham-IR control. After IR, cells were cultured at 37 °C incubator for further experiments. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Gel Shift Analyses—Subsequent to IR exposure, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Following 15 min of incubation on ice, the cell lysates were vortexed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min to obtain the nuclear pellet and the cytosolic protein-containing supernatant. The nuclear pellets were washed using the aforementioned buffer with the exclusion of Nonidet P-40. Then the nuclei were resuspended in the ice-cold solution (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). After 30 min of incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was saved as nuclear extracts stored in the–80 °C freezer until use. Gel shift analysis was performed with 3 μg of nuclear proteins incubated on ice for 10 min in a total 20 μl of DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml polydeoxyinosinnicdeoxycytidylic acid strand DNA) and then incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 5 × 104 cpm 32P-labeled NF-κB oligonucleotides probe. The DNA·protein complexes were resolved on 10% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized in x-ray film. For supershift assays nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies p65 (sc-7151) or p50 (sc-7178) at room temperature for 20 min prior to the addition of the radioactive-labeled DNA oligonucleotides. Immunoblotting Analysis—Cellular extracts were fractionated using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred by way of a semidry apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunoblot analysis was carried out using antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and visualized using the horseradish peroxidase-coupled mouse anti-rabbit immunoglobulins followed by the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Transient Co-transfection of NF-κB Reporters with Dominant Negative Mutant IκB or Dominant Mutant Erk—Transfection of NF-κB luciferase reporter with dominant negative mutant IκB-α vector (22.Guo G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14595-14601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) were performed as previously detailed (22.Guo G. Yan-Sanders Y. Lyn-Cook B.D. Wang T. Tamae D. Ogi J. Khaletskiy A. Li Z. Weydert C. Longmate J.A. Huang T.T. Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Li J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2362-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Cells in 12-well plates were co-transfected with 0.3 μg of NF-κB and 0.2 μg of β-galactosidase reporters for 3 h, and luciferase activity was measured 24 h following exposure to sham or IR. Luciferase activity was measured using an illuminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). An aliquot of the same cell lysate was used for measurement of β-galactosidase activity to normalize luciferase results. Establishment of Stable Transfectants MCF-7/mIκB and MCF-7/DN-Erk—MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with dominant negative mutant mIκB or dominant negative Erk (DN-Erk) plasmids, and stable transfectants were obtained using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (22.Guo G. Yan-Sanders Y. Lyn-Cook B.D. Wang T. Tamae D. Ogi J. Khaletskiy A. Li Z. Weydert C. Longmate J.A. Huang T.T. Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Li J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2362-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells (5 × 106 in 100-mm cell culture dishes) were transfected with 15 μg of mIκB or DN-Erk plasmid, 2 μg of G418 marker DNA pcDNA3, and 40 μg of Lipofectamine in 6 ml of serum-reduced OPTI-EMEM (Invitrogen). pcDNA3 only was transfected into MCF-7 cells as a vector control. Cells were transfected with transfection solution for 72 h and recovered for 24 h in complete medium, trypsinized, and cultured in the selecting medium for 14–21 days. The selected mutant and vector control clones were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and all transfectants were cultured for at least two passages in G418-free medium before experiments. Clonogenic Survival Assay—Prior to conducting clonogenic assays, the plating efficiency of the wild type MCF-7, mutant gene transfectants MCF-7/mIκB and MCF-7/DN-Erk, and vector control transfectants MCF-7/V were determined. Contingent upon these phycoerythrin findings, the number of cells seeded was calculated to give an identical number of clones for the controls. The number of cells seeded ranged from 1,000 to 200,000 according to the radiation doses 2–12 Gy. 14–18 days after irradiation, the plates were stained and colonies with more than 50 cells were counted and normalized to the plating efficiency of control and transfected cell lines. Cell Proliferation Assay—Exponentially growing MCF-7 cells were digested with trypsin, and different cell numbers were plated into multiple well plates for 18–24 h. Cells were then treated with PD98059 or Gadd45β antisense oligonucleotides followed by an exposure to a single dose 5 Gy IR. Cell proliferation was measured by cell numbers calculated with hemocytometers or by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay (Promega, Madison, MI). Protein Kinase Assays—Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after radiation with the lysis buffer provided in the Bio-Rad Cell Lysis Kit by following the user manual. Protein concentration was measured with a DC™ protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and protein concentration was adjusted using the cell lysis buffer. p-JNK, p-p38, and p-ERK1/2 were measured using the Bio-Plex™ phosphoprotein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Briefly, the filter plate was rinsed with 100 μl of phosphoprotein wash buffer, followed by adding 50 μl of antibody-conjugated beads, 25 μl of each cell lysate, and 25 μl of phosphoprotein assay buffer. The plate was shaken overnight and incubated with biotinylated anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (ERK1/ERK2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody, incubated with 50 μl of streptavidin-labeled phycoerythrin, and read on the Bio-Plex™ system. PD98059 and IR Treatment—PD98059 (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and MCF-7 cells were incubated with control Me2SO or Me2SO with a range of concentrations of PD98059 for 2 h. Treatments were terminated by replacing with complete medium without PD98059, and cell pellets were collected 24 h after exposure to a single dose of IR. Proteins were purified from control and PD98059/IR-treated cells, and ERK kinase activity was measured by using the Bio-Plex™ phosphoprotein assay (Bio-Rad) and Western blotting. In a parallel experiment, cells were plated into multiple-well plates, and cell growth was determined after PD98059 and IR treatments. Antisense Preparation and Treatments—Phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides of Gadd45β (5′-GAAGTTGCGGAAACCAACGGT-3′) were synthesized with the gene sequence obtained from GenBank™ (AF533019; 1836–1856). MCF-7 cells grown in a T-75 tissue culture flask were transfected with a specific range of antisense concentrations and Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were exposed to antisense oligonucleotides for 24 h and then replaced with the complete medium and treated with or without IR. At different time intervals cell pellets were collected for analysis of MAPK activity. In a parallel experiment, cells were plated into multiple well plates, and cell proliferation was determined after antisense and IR treatments. Imaging of ERK/p65 Interactions in Living Cells—Plasmids with full-length sequence encoding human NF-κB p65, ERK1, and ERK2 were fused to N- and C-terminal fragments of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. The EEK1, ERK2, p65 coding regions were connected by linker sequences as described (46.Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). These expression vectors encoding p65-YC156, ERK1-YN173, and ERK2-YN173 were kind gifts from Dr. C. D. Hu, and co-transfection was performed as previously described (22.Guo G. Yan-Sanders Y. Lyn-Cook B.D. Wang T. Tamae D. Ogi J. Khaletskiy A. Li Z. Weydert C. Longmate J.A. Huang T.T. Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Li J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2362-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), and cells in 24-well plates were co-transfected with the expression vectors indicated in each experiment (a total of 0.4 μg of DNA in each well) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The fluorescence emissions were observed in living cells 14–16 h after transfection using a Nikon TE300 inverted fluorescence microscope with a cooled charge-coupled device camera. IR Activates NF-κB and ERK but Not p38 or JNK—Accumulating results in literature (47.Gius D. Botero A. Shah S. Curry H.A. Toxicol.

To get insight of the network of NF-κB-mediated radioprotection, the activity of a group of MAPKs was measured in irradiated breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. Agreeing with NF-κB activation (Fig. 1A), a single exposure to 5 Gy IR significantly induced the kinase activity of p-ERK (75% increase compared with the sham-IR controls; Fig. 1B). In contrast, no difference was detected in the basal and IR-induced kinase activities of p-p38 and p-JNK. Thus, ERK kinase activity appears to be specifically paralleled with IR-induced NF-κB activation. Overexpression of mIκB Blocked IR-induced ERK Activity and GADD45β Expression—To test the hypothesis that IR-induced NF-κB and ERK activation is mutually dependent, IR-induced ERK activity was measured with the inhibition of NF-κB. The dose dependence of NF-κB inhibition by overexpression of the dominant negative mutant IκB is shown in Fig. 2A. The mutant form of IκBα that has been shown to inhibit NF-κB activity in MCF-7 cells (22.Guo G. Yan-Sanders Y. Lyn-Cook B.D. Wang T. Tamae D. Ogi J. Khaletskiy A. Li Z. Weydert C. Longmate J.A.

IR-mediated NF-κB DNA binding activity was assayed by gel shift analysis in stable transfectants (MCF-7/mIκB, with vector control transfectants MCF-7/V as a control). Compared with the wild type MCF-7 and MCF-7/V cells, a striking reduction in IR-induced NF-κB DNA binding was induced in MCF-7/mIκB transfectants (Fig. 2B). Both NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 were found to be present in the IR-induced NF-κB·DNA binding complexes (Fig. 2C), suggesting that p65 and p50 are the major components of IR-induced NF-κB complexes. ERK activity measured by substrate Elk-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2D) and GADD45β measured by Western blot (Fig. 2E) were significantly enhanced by IR in the wild type (MCF-7) and vector cont"

The relatively small size of the heptameric PA63 pore (∼12 Å) raises questions as to how large molecules such as LF and EF can move through the pore. In addition, the reported high binding affinity between PA and EF/LF suggests that EF/LF may not dissociate but remain complexed with activated PA63. In this study, we found that purified (PA63)7-LF complex exhibited biological and functional activities similar to the free LF. Purified LF complexed with PA63 heptamer was able to cleave both a synthetic peptide substrate and endogenous mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase substrates and kill susceptible macrophage cells. Electrophysiological studies of the complex showed strong rectification of the ionic current at positive voltages, an effect similar to that observed if LF is added to the channels formed by heptameric PA63 pore. Complexes of (PA63)7-LF found in the plasma of infected animals showed functional activity. Identifying active complex in the blood of infected animals has important implications for therapeutic design, especially those directed against PA and LF.

The LF and EF proteins bind to the prepore, and the whole complex then undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis. The acidic environment in the endosomes causes PA to undergo a conformational change that promotes membrane insertion and formation of a transmembrane channel. In a recent study, this process of insertion was shown to occur in the early endosomes, whereas the delivery of the enzymatic moieties required the involvement of the late endosomes (11Abrami L.

Nature. 2003; 424: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), thereby allowing the growth and infection of the bacterium. To date, the direct causal relation between inactivation of the MAPK signaling and lethal toxin-induced cytotoxicity remains unclear.Under saturating conditions, the PA heptamer in solution binds to three molecules of the ligand (16Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Prior studies by Singh et al. (17Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Goel S. Swain P.K. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1853-1859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that PA63 in either the monomeric or the oligomeric form can bind LF in a 1:1 ratio. Nevertheless, both the enzymatic moieties EF and LF bind the heptamerized PA63 competitively and with high affinity (Kd ∼1 nm) (18Elliott J.L. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This interaction is not affected by low pH conditions (pH 5.2) (18Elliott J.L. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To date, there is no direct evidence showing that full-length LF dissociates from the PA63 heptamer complex either during or after translocation through the PA pore or that LF bound to the PA63 heptamer is capable of cleaving its substrates. In this study, we provide experimental evidence showing that LF bound to the PA63 heptamer is active and exhibits biological and biophysical properties similar to those of free LF.MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification of (PA63)7-LF Complex—Purified PA83, PA63, and LF proteins (List Biological laboratories Inc.) from B. anthracis were used for these studies. Purified PA63 and LF proteins were mixed at either a 3:2 or 3:1 molar ratio of PA63 monomer:LF monomer and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The resulting (PA63)7-LF complex was purified over a Superose 6 size exclusion column (Amersham Bio-sciences), previously equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The total protein concentration of the complex fraction was determined by the Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). The protein concentration of LF in the complex was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly, 2-fold serially diluted LF protein or the complex was coated on microtiter plates (Nunc) for 16 h at 4 °C. The wells were washed four times with Tris-buffered saline-Tween-20 (0.1%) and incubated with anti-LF polyclonal antibody (1:500) for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed as above and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody at 1:2000 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed, and reactivity was developed with one-component 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Color development was monitored at a wavelength of 405 nm. A calibration curve was established using the LF protein as a standard, and LF concentration in the complex was determined based on the standard curve.LF Activity Assay—LF activity in the complex was determined using a fluorescence plate-based assay, as described previously (19Panchal R.G. Hermone A.R. Nguyen T.L. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Schmidt J. Lane D. McGrath C. Turk B.E. Burnett J. Aman M.J. Little S. Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Cantley L.C. Liddington R.C. Gussio R. Bavari S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, a reaction mix containing 40 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 0.05% Tween 20, and different concentrations of free LF or complexed LF was added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 μm optimized peptide substrate (20Turk B.E. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Jarrell E.T. Leppla S.H. Collier R.J. Liddington R.C. Cantley L.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) MCA-KKVYPYPME(dnp)K amide, and kinetic measurements were obtained every minute for 30 min using a fluorescence plate reader (Tecan, Safire). The peptide has an excitation peak at 324 nm and an emission peak at 395 nm.Alternatively, LF activity was also measured after capture of the complex using PA antibody. The PA monoclonal antibody (PAI 3F10) was bound to Nunc Immuno Maxisorp surface (Nunc) plates for 2 h at room temperature and then blocked overnight with Tris-buffered saline-Tween-20 (0.1%) containing 6% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C. The plate was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline-Tween-20, and purified complex (either 200 ng/well or 20 ng/well of LF in complex form) was added to the antibody plate and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the reaction mixture containing 20 μm fluorogenic LF peptide substrate was added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 min. Cleavage of the peptide by bound LF was monitored by an increase in fluorescence intensity in a plate reader.An HPLC-based LF activity assay was used to determine the kinetic constants (Vmax and Km values) of both LF in complex and free LF (19Panchal R.G. Hermone A.R. Nguyen T.L. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Schmidt J. Lane D. McGrath C. Turk B.E. Burnett J. Aman M.J. Little S. Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Cantley L.C. Liddington R.C. Gussio R. Bavari S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Reaction mixture (30 μl total volume) containing 40 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 0.05% Tween 20, and seven different concentrations of peptide substrate ranging from 2 to 40 μm was incubated with free LF or LF in the complex (1 μg/ml) for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 8 m guanidine hydrochloride in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. Substrate and products were separated on a Hi-Pore C18 column (Bio-Rad) using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/70% acetonitrile (solvent B). The column effluent was monitored at 365 nm, at which the substrate and C-terminal cleavage products had the strongest absorbance.MAPKK Cleavage by Western Blot—J774A.1 macrophage cells (∼1 × 106) seeded in a 6-well plate were incubated with either anthrax toxin (PA (88 ng/ml) and LF (16 ng/ml)) or purified complex (20 ng/ml or 200 ng/ml LF in complex form) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma). The cell lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. Cell extracts (30 μg) were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE and then subjected to Western blotting. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL).Collection of Plasma from Infected Animals—Rabbits and guinea pigs that appeared moribund were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine, xylazine, and acepromazine under the guidance of staff veterinarians. Blood was drawn directly into tubes containing EDTA to inhibit proteases known to cleave PA83 to PA63, mixed, centrifuged, and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and stored at -70 °C. Plasma from the infected animals was then used to detect LF activity in the (PA63)7-LF complex using either the antibody plate capture assay or electrophoresis, in a 4–15% native or SDS gradient gel for immunoblot analysis of the complex.Antibodies—The antibodies used in this study include MEK1 NT (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) and MEK2 NT, MEK3 C-19, MEK4 N terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The PA and LF proteins in the complex were detected with rabbit anti-PA polyclonal antibody and a previously characterized LF monoclonal antibody (LFIII-5D2-1-1), respectively (21Little S.F. Leppla S.H. Cora E. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cell-based Cytotoxicity Assay—J774A.1 cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate. The next day, cells were treated with 2-fold serially diluted anthrax toxin (PA (500 ng/ml) and LF (500 ng/ml)) or complex (500 ng/ml LF in complex). After a 4-h incubation with the toxin, 25 μl of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (1 mg/ml) dye was added, and the cells were further incubated for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of lysis buffer (20% N,N-dimethylformamide and 20% SDS, pH 4.7). Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and absorbance was read at 570 nm in a multiwell plate reader. Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated three independent times for the toxin and the complex samples. The results are given as averages with standard deviation.Electrophysiology—Channel recordings were carried out with planar lipid bilayer membranes as described previously (22Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Briefly, solvent-free diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine membranes were formed on a 50–100-μm-diameter hole in a thin Teflon partition. The partition separated two identical Teflon chambers that each contained ∼2 ml of aqueous solution (0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MES, pH 6.6). Voltage was applied across the membrane via Ag-AgCl electrodes. The current was amplified using a patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments 200B), recorded with an analog to digital converter (DigiData 1322), and analyzed off-line. A negative transmembrane potential drove anions from the cis to the trans chamber. Details of this particular method were summarized elsewhere (23Kasianowicz J.J. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 94-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Channels were formed by adding small aliquots (∼100 ng) of the purified (PA63)7-LF complex to the aqueous electrolyte solution bathing one side of the membrane (called cis). The formation of individual channels was indicated by the stepwise changes in ionic current monitored at -50 mV applied potential. Data acquisition began after the current achieved a steady-state value. We applied brief (0.5-s) voltage pulses (typically +160 to -160 mV in 10-mV steps) across the membrane and averaged the first 100 ms of the signal to obtain the instantaneous current-voltage (I-V) relationship.RESULTSPurification and Characterization—To generate the (PA63)7-LF complex, activated PA63 was incubated with LF either in 3:2 (Fig. 1A) or in 3:1 (Fig. 1B) molar ratio of PA63 monomer to LF monomer, to demonstrate the titration of free LF. The complex was isolated by size-exclusion chromatography. Peak fractions were collected and analyzed by native PAGE (Fig. 1C) and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D). As seen in Fig. 1A, a small amount of aggregated protein eluted first followed by the peak corresponding to the (PA63)7-LF complex. Unbound or free LF eluted last. The protein peak corresponding to high molecular weight aggregate was not detectable by Coomassie Blue staining; however, some LF activity was detected in this fraction (data not shown), suggesting that this aggregated protein does contain some LF. Electrophoresis of PA63 (Fig. 1C, lane 2) on native gel showed a smear, probably due to complexes of different molecular sizes. However, binding of LF to PA63 resulted in a distinct (PA63)7-LF complex band (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 5). SDS-PAGE of purified (PA63)7-LF complex shows the presence of LF, PA63 monomer, and SDS-stable and heat-resistant PA63 heptamer (Fig. 1D, lane 3).Alternatively, complex was also prepared and purified by mixing trypsin cleaved PA63 and LF proteins (data not shown). The peak fraction corresponding to the (PA63)7-LF complex generated by either of the two methods was tested in different functional assays and displayed similar biological activity and biophysical properties.Purified (PA63)7-LF Complex Can Cleave Optimized Peptide Substrate—To test functional activity of LF in the complex, equal concentrations of either bound or free LF forms were incubated with an optimized peptide substrate that had a fluorogenic coumarin group at the N terminus and a 2,4-dinitrophenyl (dnp) quenching group at the C terminus (19Panchal R.G. Hermone A.R. Nguyen T.L. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Schmidt J. Lane D. McGrath C. Turk B.E. Burnett J. Aman M.J. Little S. Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Cantley L.C. Liddington R.C. Gussio R. Bavari S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Kinetic measurements were made using a fluorescence plate reader at an excitation and emission maxima of 324 and 395 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A, LF in the complex form exhibits proteolytic activity, as it was able to cleave the peptide substrate and produce an increase in the fluorescence intensity.Fig. 2LF complexed with PA63 heptamer can cleave synthetic peptide substrate.A, representative data of fluorescent plate reader assay showing that LF in the complex form exhibits similar activity to the free LF. Equal concentrations of either free LF or LF in complex form were incubated with 20 μm optimized peptide substrate (19Panchal R.G. Hermone A.R. Nguyen T.L. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Schmidt J. Lane D. McGrath C. Turk B.E. Burnett J. Aman M.J. Little S. Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Cantley L.C. Liddington R.C. Gussio R. Bavari S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and kinetic measurements were obtained every min for 30 min at excitation and emission maxima of 325 and 394 nm, respectively. B, LF activity was observed when the complex was bound to the PA antibody plate. PA monoclonal antibody (PAI3F10) was bound to a MaxiSorp plate, blocked overnight, washed, and then incubated with the purified complex (either 200 ng/well or 20 ng/well of LF in complex form). After extensive washing, a reaction mixture containing 20 μm fluorogenic LF peptide substrate was added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 min. Cleavage of the peptide by bound LF was monitored by an increase in fluorescence intensity in a plate reader. As control, free LF (10 μg/ml) did not show any nonspecific binding to the PA monoclonal antibody. LF activity in the bound form could be inhibited by a previously identified small molecule LF inhibitor NSC 12155 (10 μm) (19Panchal R.G. Hermone A.R. Nguyen T.L. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Schmidt J. Lane D. McGrath C. Turk B.E. Burnett J. Aman M.J. Little S. Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Cantley L.C. Liddington R.C. Gussio R. Bavari S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the rate of hydrolysis of the peptide substrate by LF in both the free and the bound forms, kinetics were studied by HPLC (19Panchal R.G. Hermone A.R. Nguyen T.L. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Schmidt J. Lane D. McGrath C. Turk B.E. Burnett J. Aman M.J. Little S. Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Cantley L.C. Liddington R.C. Gussio R. Bavari S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were obtained from plots of initial rates with seven different concentrations of the substrate. The Vmax and Km values for free LF were 1.8 ± 0.9 μmol/min/mg and 18.9 ± 0.14 μm, respectively. LF in the bound form had a Vmax value of 2.45 ± 0.21 μmol/min/mg and a Km of 25 ± 4.3 μm. Thus, LF showed a similar rate of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the peptide substrate whether in the free or in the bound form. A slightly higher Km value for bound LF may indicate that the LF active site was not as accessible to the peptide substrate (with respect to free LF).To address concerns about free LF contamination in the purified complex, we bound the complex to a PA monoclonal antibody coated onto a Maxisorp microtiter plate. After washing, the reaction mixture containing the optimized LF peptide substrate was added and incubated for 30 min. The increase in fluorescence intensity after peptide cleavage was measured using a fluorescence plate reader. As shown in Fig. 2B, LF activity was indeed observed when the complex was bound to the PA antibody plate, suggesting that LF in complex with PA63 heptamer was active. Furthermore, the activity of LF in the complex form was inhibited by NSC 12155, a previously reported small molecule LF inhibitor (19Panchal R.G. Hermone A.R. Nguyen T.L. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Schmidt J. Lane D. McGrath C. Turk B.E. Burnett J. Aman M.J. Little S. Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Cantley L.C. Liddington R.C. Gussio R. Bavari S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Additionally, to show that free LF did not nonspecifically bind to the PA antibody, purified LF (10 μg/ml) was added to the PA antibody plate, and LF activity was measured (Fig. 2B). Subsequent analysis indicated no LF activity, suggesting that LF does not nonspecifically bind to the PA antibody.Purified Complex Can Cleave MAPKK Substrates and Kill Susceptible Macrophage Cells—Anthrax LF is known to cleave several different isoforms of MAPKK both in vitro and in macrophage cells. To determine whether LF in the complex form could cleave endogenous MAPKK substrates, J774A.1 cells were treated with either the complex or the anthrax toxin (PA83 and LF), and cellular lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against four different isoforms of MAPKK (Fig. 3A). The efficiency of the complex to cleave the four different isoforms of endogenous MAPKK was not significantly different from that of the toxin (PA83 and LF). A 2–10-fold excess of complexed LF was needed to obtain complete cleavage of endogenous MAPKK (compared with anthrax toxin), raising the possibility that not all the LF active sites in the complexed form were easily accessible to the endogenous substrate.Fig. 3Purified (PA63)7-LF complex exhibits biological activity.A, proteolytic cleavage of endogenous MAPKK by LF in the complex. J774A.1 macrophages were either not treated (lane 1) or treated with anthrax toxin (88 ng/ml PA83 and 16 ng/ml LF) (lane 2), LF in complex (20 ng/ml LF in complex) (lane 3), or LF in complex at a different strength (200 ng/ml LF in complex) (lane 4) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to four different isoforms of MAPKK. A housekeeping transferrin protein was used to show uniform loading of the lysates. B, LF in the complex kills macrophages. J774A.1 cells were incubated for 4 h with 2-fold serial dilutions of anthrax toxin (starting with 0.5 μg/ml PA83 and 0.5 μg/ml LF) or complex (starting with 0.5 μg/ml LF in complex). Cell viability was then measured by an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether LF in the complex form was capable of killing susceptible macrophages, J774A.1 cells were treated with different concentrations of either the complex or the anthrax toxin and incubated for 4 h, and cell viability was measured by the standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Fig. 3B). Above 100 ng of LF, the killing efficiency between the complex and lethal toxin (mixed PA83 and LF) was not significantly different.Purified Complex Forms Functional Channels in Planar Bilayer Membranes—Previous electrophysiological studies in planar bilayers demonstrated that PA63 heptamer at low pH (∼ pH 6.5) forms cation-selective channels in lipid bilayers (24Blaustein R.O. Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2209-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 25Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and in cell membranes (26Milne J.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To study the biophysical properties of the (PA63)7-LF complex, we first measured the ionic conductance of (PA63)7 channels in both the absence and the presence of LF. Purified (PA63)7 added to the electrolyte solution (0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MES, pH 6.6) spontaneously formed channels in bilayer membranes, as is shown in Fig. 4A, with each step in current (∼4 pA at -50 mV applied potential) corresponding to the formation of a new channel. Interestingly, under similar conditions, adding purified (PA63)7-LF complex also formed channels (Fig. 4B). However, the characteristic single channel current was ∼1.8 pA (V = -50 mV). Thus, even with LF bound to the heptameric PA63, it is still possible to form channels.Fig. 4(PA63)7 and purified (PA63)7-LF complex form functional channels in planar bilayer membranes. The discrete steps in ionic current in A and B correspond to the spontaneous formation of single channels of (PA63)7 and purified (PA63)7-LF complex, respectively. The applied potential was -50 mV. The representative data of instantaneous current-voltage (I-V) relationship for (PA63)7 in the absence (C) and presence (D)of ∼1 nm LF demonstrate that LF added to the cis compartment converted the (PA63)7I-V relationship from a slightly nonlinear to extremely rectifying. E, similar experiments show that channels formed from purified (PA63)7-LF complex (< 200 ng of LF in the complex) also exhibited a highly rectifying I-V relationship. F, a"
https://openalex.org/W1990225407,"Gadd45a is an important player in cell cycle G2-M arrest in response to genotoxic stress. However, the underlying mechanism(s) by which Gadd45a exerts its role in the control of cell cycle progression remains to be further defined. Gadd45a interacts with Cdc2, dissociates the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex, alters cyclin B1 nuclear localization, and thus inhibits the activity of Cdc2/cyclin B1 kinase. These observations indicate that Gadd45a nuclear translocation is closely associated with its role in cell cycle G2-M arrest. Gadd45a has been characterized as a nuclear protein, but it does not contain a classical nuclear localization signal, suggesting that Gadd45a nuclear translocation might be mediated through different nuclear import machinery. Here we show that Gadd45a associates directly with B23 (nucleophosmin), and the B23-interacting domain is mapped at the central region (61–100 amino acids) of the Gadd45a protein using a series of Myc tag-Gadd45a deletion mutants. Deletion of this central region disrupts Gadd45a association with B23 and abolishes Gadd45a nuclear translocation. Suppression of endogenous B23 through a short interfering RNA approach disrupts Gadd45a nuclear translocation and results in impaired Gadd45a-induced cell cycle G2-M arrest. These findings demonstrate a novel association of B23 and Gadd45a and implicate B23 as an important regulator in Gadd45a nuclear import."

https://openalex.org/W2035646931,"The GCM proteins GCMa/1 and GCMb/2 are novel zinc-containing transcription factors critical for glial cell differentiation in fly and for placental as well as parathyroid gland development in mouse. Previous pulse-chase experiments have demonstrated differential protein stabilities of GCM proteins with half-lives from ∼30 min to 2 h (Tuerk, E. E., Schreiber, J., and Wegner, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 4774–4782). However, little is known about the machinery that controls GCM protein degradation. Here, we report the identification of an SCF complex as the GCM ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) that regulates human GCMa (hGCMa) degradation. We found that SKP1 and CUL1, two key components of the SCF complex, associate with hGCMa in vivo. We further identify the human F-box protein FBW2 (hFBW2) as the substrate recognition subunit in the SCF E3 complex for hGCMa. We show that hFBW2 interacts with hGCMa in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and promotes hGCMa ubiquitination. Supporting a critical role for hFBW2 in hGCMa degradation, knockdown of hFBW2 expression by RNA interference leads to a reduction in hGCMa ubiquitination and a concomitant increase in hGCMa protein stability.

Our study identifies the SCFhFBW2 E3 complex as the key machinery that targets hGCMa to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system. The gcm1 (glial cell missing 1) gene was first identified in a Drosophila melanogaster mutant line that produces additional neurons at the expense of glial cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of gcm1 leads to glial differentiation at the expense of other cell types (1Hosoya T. Takizawa K. Nitta K. Hotta Y.

Cell. 1995; 82: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In D. melanogaster, GCM1 mediates the differentiation of lateral (but not midline) glial cells and the proliferation of plasmatocyte precursors (1Hosoya T. Takizawa K. Nitta K. Hotta Y.

Cell. 1995; 82: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Recently, another gcm gene in D. melanogaster, gcm2, was identified and shown to have biological functions similar to those of gcm1 (3Alfonso T.B. Jones B.W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4Kammerer M. Giangrande A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4664-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two homologs of Drosophila gcm1 named GCMa and GCMb have also been isolated from mouse and human (5Kanemura Y. Hiraga S. Arita N. Ohnishi T. Izumoto S. Mori K. Matsumura H. Yamasaki M. Fushiki S.

A. 1998; 95: 12364-12369Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Unlike the Drosophila gcm genes, the mammalian GCM genes are not primarily expressed in the nervous system. Mouse GCMa is highly expressed in labyrinthine trophoblast cells (7Basyuk E. Cross J.C. Corbin J. Nakayama H. Hunter P. Nait-Oumesmar B. Lazzarini R.A. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 214: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The GCMa knockout mouse is embryonic lethal, with a failure to form a labyrinth layer and no fusion of trophoblast cells to syncytiotrophoblasts (8Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D.

Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast, mouse GCMb is expressed in parathyroid cells, and the GCMb knockout mouse fails to develop a parathyroid gland (10Gunther T. Chen Z.F. Kim J. Priemel M. Rueger J.M. Amling M. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Anderson D.J. Karsenty G. Nature. 2000; 406: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Therefore, although Drosophila gcm and mammalian GCM genes are evolutionarily conserved at the nucleotide and protein levels, they appear to execute different biological functions during development. GCM proteins form a novel family of transcription factors that all share sequence homology in the N-terminal region that constitutes the DNA-binding domain called the GCM motif, which has a preferred binding sequence of 5′-(A/G)CCC(T/G)CAT-3′ or its complement (11Akiyama Y. Hosoya T. Poole A.M. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14912-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Schreiber J. Enderich J. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2337-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, two zinc ions have been found to be tightly coordinated by cysteine and histidine residues and to be required for the DNA-binding activity in the GCM motif (13Cohen S.X. Moulin M. Hashemolhosseini S. Kilian K. Wegner M. Muller C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1835-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Sequence homology is less preserved outside the GCM motif; a transactivation domain has been identified in the C terminus of GCM proteins (11Akiyama Y. Hosoya T. Poole A.M. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14912-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Target genes of fly GCM1 include gcm1 and several glial cells-specific genes such as pointed, repo, tramtrack, and prospero (15Van De Bor V. Giangrande A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Target genes of human (h) 1The abbreviations used are: h, human; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; RNAi, RNA interference; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Ub, ubiquitin; λ-PPase, λ-protein phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. GCMa have been reported recently. For instance, the promoter region of a placental aromatase gene that is responsible for estrogen biosynthesis has been found to contain GCM-binding sites that are recognized by GCMa (16Yamada K. Ogawa H. Honda S. Harada N. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32279-32286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that hGCMa regulates expression of the syncytin gene, which encodes a fusogenic membrane protein mediating the fusion of trophoblast cells (17Yu C. Shen K. Lin M. Chen P. Lin C. Chang G.-D. Chen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50062-50068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, hGCMa appears to be a key factor in the formation of the human syncytiotrophoblast layer. GCM proteins contain PEST sequences, which are frequently found in labile proteins. Previous pulse-chase experiments have shown that GCM proteins have short half-lives from ∼30 min to 2 h (18Tuerk E.E. Schreiber J. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4774-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because GCM proteins are labile and because little is known about the machinery that controls GCM protein degradation, in this study, we investigate the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system in GCM protein turnover. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation plays an important role in controlling numerous processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, receptor down-regulation, and endocytosis. Ubiquitin is a polypeptide of 76 amino acids, and its primary sequence is highly conserved from yeast to mammals. Ubiquitin conjugation of target proteins requires a cascade of reactions. First, ubiquitin is activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme in an ATP-dependent process. Second, activated ubiquitin is transferred to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (ubiquitin carrier protein (E2)). Finally, E2 transfers ubiquitin to a substrate protein by itself or in cooperation with ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) by formation of an amide isopeptide bond between the carboxyl group of the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin and the ϵ-amino group of an internal lysine residue of the substrate protein (19Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). The monoubiquitinated substrate protein becomes polyubiquitinated via the same cascade of reactions. In eukaryotes, polyubiquitinated proteins are targeted to the 26 S proteasome, which consists of a proteolytic core particle, the 20 S proteasome, and two 19 S regulatory complexes (20Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system, E3 controls substrate specificity and transfers ubiquitin to lysine residues of the substrate protein. E3 ligases have been classified into HECT (homologous to E6-AP Cterminus) domain E3 ligases, single-subunit RING finger E3 ligases, and multisubunit RING finger E3 ligases. In the ubiquitination process, HECT E3 ligases form thioester catalytic intermediates with ubiquitin, whereas RING finger E3 ligases facilitate direct transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to substrate, probably without formation of covalent intermediates. The SCF (SKP1/cullin/F-box protein) complex belongs to the multisubunit RING finger E3 ligases, which are composed of CUL1, SKP1, RBX1, and an F-box protein. CUL1 functions as a scaffold and interacts with SKP1 and RBX1 at its N and C termini, respectively. RBX1 is a RING finger protein that recruits E2 to the E3 complex. SKP1 interacts with the F-box domain of an F-box protein, which mediates substrate recognition via another interaction domain (21Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that hGCMa can be ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Moreover, the human F-box protein FBW2 (hFBW2) is identified to interact with hGCMa in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and to promote ubiquitination of hGCMa. The interaction between hGCMa and hFBW2 and the critical role of hFBW2 in proteasome-mediated degradation of hGCMa are further characterized by domain mapping and RNA interference (RNAi). Our study identifies the SCFhFBW2 E3 complex as the key machinery that targets hGCMa to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system. Plasmid Constructs—The GCMa expression plasmid phGCMa-FLAG, encoding full-length hGCMa plus a triple FLAG tag at its C terminus, was constructed by cloning the open reading frame of hGCMa into p3XFLAG-CMV14 (Sigma). The pHA-hGCMa expression plasmid was constructed by cloning N-terminally triple hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged full-length hGCMa into p3XFLAG-CMV14. pCS2-HA-HsSKP1 (renamed pHA-hSKP1 in this study) and pcDNA3.1/Zeo-Py2His6-CUL1 were kindly provided by Dr. R. J. Deshaies (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). The open reading frame of CUL1 was PCR-amplified from pcDNA3.1/Zeo-Py2His6-CUL1 and subcloned into p3XFLAG-CMV14 to generate phCUL1-FLAG. The cDNAs encoding the F-box proteins hFBW2, hSKP2, hFBL3A, hβTrcp, and hFBX7 were PCR-amplified from a human placental cDNA library or expressed sequence tag clones and subcloned into a cytomegalovirus expression vector containing four copies of the Myc tag at the C termini. The wild-type and mutant pGal4-hGCMa-FLAG expression plasmids were constructed by first cloning the Gal4 DNA-binding domain into p3XFLAG-CMV14 and subsequently the cDNA fragments of full-length hGCMa or its deletion mutants (see Fig. 4A, lower panel). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method. Cell Culture and Transfection—The 293T cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. The BeWo cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained at 37 °C in Kaighn's modification of Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and the same antibiotics mentioned above. To study the effects of protease inhibitors on hGCMa protein stability, 293T cells in 60-mm culture dishes were transfected with phGCMa-FLAG by calcium phosphate/DNA coprecipitation at 37 °C for 18 h and treated with 40 μm MG132, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, or N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal for another 18 h. The protein level of hGCMa-FLAG was detected by Western analysis using mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Sigma). For reprobing, the membranes were incubated in a stripping buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min. The stripped membranes were probed with mouse anti-β-actin mAb (Sigma). Stable BeWo lines expressing HA-hGCMa were established using a retroviral vector as described by Bender et al. (22Bender M.A. Palmer T.D. Gelinas R.E. Miller A.D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the stability of HA-hGCMa in BeWo cells, stable BeWo cells expressing HA-hGCMa were grown in 6-well culture plates and treated with 200 μm cycloheximide for 2 h prior to incubation with or without 40 μm MG132 for the indicated times. HA-hGCMa proteins were detected by Western analysis with rat anti-HA mAb (Roche Applied Science). In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—To study ubiquitination of hGCMa, 293T cells were cotransfected with pHA-hGCMa and the His-tagged ubiquitin (Ub) expression plasmid pHis-Ub for 18 h and treated with or without 40 μm MG132 for another 18 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested for purification of His-ubiquitinated proteins by immobilized metal affinity chromatography essentially as described by Aberle et al. (23Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation—To study the interaction of hGCMa and components of the SCF complex, 293T cells were transfected with pHA-hGCMa and phCUL1-FLAG. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) 48 h post-transfection. Aliquots were taken as input samples for Western analysis, and the remainder were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mAb. After five extensive washings, i.e. shaking for 4 min at room temperature per wash with lysis buffer A, the immune complexes were analyzed by Western analysis with anti-FLAG mAb. A reciprocal experiment was performed for 293T cells transfected with pHA-hGCMa, phCUL1-FLAG, and pHA-hSKP1 by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG mAb and Western analysis with anti-HA mAb. To determine whether an F-box protein was interacting with hGCMa, 293T cells were cotransfected with pHA-hGCMa and phFBW2-Myc, phSKP2-Myc, phFBL3A-Myc, phβTrcp-Myc, or phFBX7-Myc. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-HA mAb, and the immune complexes were detected by Western analysis using mouse anti-Myc mAb (Roche Applied Science). Metabolic Labeling Using [32P]Orthophosphate and in Vitro Pull-down Assays—To study phosphorylation of hGCMa in vivo, 293T cells were transfected with pHA-hGCMa for 24 h and then incubated with phosphate-free medium supplemented with 4% dialyzed fetal bovine serum plus 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 16 h. HA-hGCMa was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb as described above. Dephosphorylation of HA-phospho-hGCMa was performed by treating the immune complexes with 400 units of λ-protein phosphatase (λ-PPase; New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To study the effect of phosphorylation of hGCMa on the interaction of hGCMa and hFBW2, 293T cells were cotransfected with pHA-hGCMa and phFBW2-Myc or phSKP2-Myc for 48 h. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ZnCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture) or modified lysis buffer B without the phosphatase inhibitors (0.5 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, and 10 mm Na4P2O7) and treated with 1200 units of λ-PPase, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mAb and Western analysis with anti-Myc mAb. For in vitro pull-down experiments, HA-hGCMa proteins immunopurified from the pHA-hGCMa-transfected 293T cells were treated with or without 800 units of λ-PPase and incubated with 2.5 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-hFBW2 or GST in lysis buffer B at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washing, the immune complexes were analyzed by Western analysis using rabbit anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Mapping the Interaction Domains of hGCMa and hFBW2—To map the domain of hGCMa that interacts with hFBW2, 293T cells were cotransfected with phFBW2-Myc and pGal4-hGCMa-FLAG or its deletion mutant plasmids. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-Myc mAb, and the immune complexes were analyzed by Western analysis using anti-FLAG mAb. To map the domain of hFBW2 that interacts with hGCMa, full-length hFBW2 and its deletion mutants were cloned into the expression vector pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) (see Fig. 4B, lower panel). GST-hFBW2 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified on glutathione 4B-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HA-hGCMa-containing cell lysate was prepared by harvesting pHA-hGCMa-transfected 293T cells in lysis buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). GST pull-down experiments were performed by incubating 180 μg of cell lysate and 2.5 μg of GST or the indicated GST-hFBW2 fusion protein in lysis buffer C containing glutathione beads at 4 °C for 18 h. After extensive washing, the beads were analyzed by Western analysis using anti-HA mAb. Gene Silencing by RNAi—For generation of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for hFBW2, the gene-specific oligonucleotides 910 (5′-AGATGGACTTCTCTGTACAGG-3′) and 1112 (5′-GACATTGTCTGTCTCTGAGGA-3′), followed by a non-complementary spacer (5′-GAGTCGTCG-3′) and the reverse complements of the oligonucleotide 910 and 1112 sequences, were synthesized and cloned into the pSuppressorRetro plasmid (Imgenex Corp., San Diego, CA). The resultant psiRNA910 and psiRNA1112 expression plasmids were characterized for silencing exogenous and endogenous hFBW2 expression (see Fig. 5, A and B). An unrelated siRNA expression plasmid (psiRNANC; Imgenex Corp.) harboring a sequence (5′-TCAGTCACGTTAATGGTCGTT-3′) showing no significant homology to human gene sequences was used as a negative control. To study the effect of gene silencing of hFBW2 on the ubiquitination of hGCMa, 293T cells were transfected with different combinations of phGCMa-FLAG, pHA-Ub (kindly provided by Dr. A. Moustakas, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden), psiRNA910, and psiRNA1112 as indicated in the figure legend to Fig. 5C and treated with MG132. Analysis of ubiquitinated hGCMa was performed by immunoprecipitation using anti-HA mAb and by Western analysis using anti-FLAG mAb. In addition, a reciprocal experiment was performed by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG mAb and by Western analysis using anti-HA mAb. To study the effect of gene silencing of hFBW2 on the protein stability of hGCMa, 293T cells were transfected with pHA-hGCMa plus psiRNANC or psiRNA910. 36 h post-transfection, cells were pulse-labeled with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 2 h and chased with unlabeled methionine for the indicated times. Cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mAb and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The Proteasome Is Involved in the Degradation of hGCMa—To test whether the hGCMa protein is degraded by the 26 S proteasome degradation system, 293T cells were transfected with phGCMa-FLAG and treated with or without protease inhibitors, including N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, and MG132. As shown in Fig. 1A, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal, an inhibitor of cathepsins and calpains, did not affect the protein level of hGCMa-FLAG compared with the untreated control. However, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, an inhibitor of calpains and the 26 S proteasome, significantly increased the protein level of hGCMa-FLAG. Similarly, MG132, an inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome, also increased the protein level of hGCMa-FLAG. These results suggest that the protein level of hGCMa can be regulated by the 26 S proteasome degradation system in vivo. Because GCMa is primarily expressed in placenta, we next tested whether hGCMa is also degraded by the 26 S proteasome degradation system in placental cells. To this end, the BeWo human placental cell line was used to establish stable lines expressing HA-hGCMa via a retroviral expression system. Stable HA-hGCMa-expressing BeWo cells were treated with cycloheximide and incubated for different periods of time in the presence or absence of MG132. As shown in Fig. 1B, HA-GCMa maintained a half-life of between 1 and 2 h in BeWo cells in the absence of MG132. However, the HA-GCMa protein level remained unchanged for 6 h in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the GCMa protein is degraded by the 26 S proteasome degradation system in placental cells. Because the 26 S proteasome mediates the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, we tested whether hGCMa is ubiquitinated in vivo. To this end, 293T cells were transfected with pHA-hGCMa and pHis-Ub and treated with or without MG132. Ubiquitinated proteins in the cell lysate from transfected 293T cells were then purified and enriched by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The level of ubiquitinated HA-hGCMa in the purified ubiquitinated proteins was further detected by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C (lower panel), the protein level of HA-hGCMa decreased when His-Ub was coexpressed, which is very likely due to a higher level of His-Ub promoting protein degradation. In contrast, the protein level of HA-hGCMa increased in the presence of MG132 even though His-Ub was coexpressed (Fig. 1C, lower panel). In the analysis of GCMa ubiquitination, no signal for His-ubiquitinated HA-GCMa was detected in cells transfected with pHA-hGCMa alone, as expected (Fig. 1C, upper panel). However, signals for His-ubiquitinated HA-GCMa were detected in the HA-hGCMa and His-Ub coexpression group and were further enhanced in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 1C, upper panel). These results suggest that hGCMa can be ubiquitinated in vivo. Likewise, Drosophila GCM1 and mouse GCMb were also ubiquitinated when His-Ub was coexpressed with them in the presence of MG-132 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that GCM proteins can be ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Characterization of the F-box Protein Interacting with hGCMa—Because the SCF E3 complex is involved in the degradation of many transcription factors, we now tested whether an SCF E3 complex is required for the degradation of hGCMa. We first tested whether hGCMa interacts with components of the SCF complex by transfecting 293T cells with pHA-hGCMa and phCUL1-FLAG in co-immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 2A, the hCUL1-FLAG protein was detected in the precipitated HA-hGCMa complex. Furthermore, a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed using 293T cells transfected with pHA-hGCMa, phCUL1-FLAG, and pHA-hSKP1. An interaction among HA-GCMa, hCUL1-FLAG, and HA-SKP1 was also observed (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that hGCMa associates with the SCF E3 complex in vivo. Because the substrate specificity for an SCF E3 complex depends on its associated F-box protein, we next identified the F-box protein that recognizes hGCMa. We searched the literature for several human F-box proteins known to be expressed in placenta, including hSKP2, hFBW2, hFBL3A, hβTrcp, and hFBX7, and tested them for interaction with hGCMa in co-immunoprecipitation assays. We detected a specific interaction between hGCMa and hFBW2, but not hSKP2, hFBL3A, or hβTrcp (Fig. 2C) or hFBX7 (data not shown). These results suggest that hFBW2 is the F-box protein that specifically recognizes hGCMa. Phosphorylation-dependent Interaction between hGCMa and hFBW2—We further tested whether phosphorylation of hGCMa is required for interaction with hFBW2 because several well characterized F-box proteins such as βTrcp, SKP2, and FBW7 recognize their cognate substrates in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (23Aberle H.

We first investigated whether hGCMa is a phosphoprotein by in vivo metabolic labeling of hGCMa with [32P]orthophosphate in 293T cells transfected with pHA-hGCMa. As shown in Fig. 3A, the HA-hGCMa protein was phosphorylated in 293T cells, and its phosphate moieties could be cleaved off by λ-PPase. Therefore, hGCMa is a phosphoprotein in vivo. We then tested whether phosphorylation of hGCMa is required for interaction with hFBW2. To this end, 293T cells were first transfected with pHA-hGCMa and phFBW2-Myc or phSKP2-Myc. Then, the cell lysate from transfected 293 cells was collected in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors and further challenged with λ-PPase, followed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 3B, a specific interaction between hGCMa and hFBW2 (but not hSKP2) was observed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Interestingly, this interaction was significantly diminished when the lysate was collected in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 3B), suggesting that phosphorylation of hGCMa is required for interaction with hFBW2. Additionally, pull-down experiments were performed to further confirm the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between hGCMa and hFBW2. HA-hGCMa was first immunopurified from pHA-hGCMa-transfected 293T cells and treated with or without λ-PPase, followed by incubation with GST-hFBW2 or GST. Again, a specific interaction was observed between HA-hGCMa and GST-hFBW2 (Fig. 3C). However, this interaction was abolished when the immunopurified HA-hGCMa protein was pre-treated with λ-PPase (Fig. 3C). No interaction was seen between GST and HA-hGCMa either pretreated or not with λ-PPase (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that hFBW2 preferentially recognizes the phosphorylated form of the hGCMa protein. Identification of the Interaction Do"
https://openalex.org/W1987391832,"Myosin IXb, a member of the myosin superfamily, is a molecular motor that possesses a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Rho. Through the yeast two-hybrid screening using the tail domain of myosin IXb as bait we found BIG1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf1), as a potential binding partner for myosin IXb. The interaction between myosin IXb and BIG1 was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous myosin IXb and BIG1 with anti-BIG1 antibodies in normal rat kidney cells. Using the isolated proteins, it was demonstrated that myosin IXb and BIG1 directly bind to each other. Various truncation mutants of the myosin IXb tail domain were produced, and it was revealed that the binding region of myosin IXb to BIG1 is the zinc finger/GAP domain. Interestingly, the GAP activity of myosin IXb was significantly inhibited by the addition of BIG1 with IC50 of 0.06 μm. The RhoA binding to myosin IXb was inhibited by the addition of BIG1 with the concentration similar to the inhibition of the GAP activity. Likewise, RhoA inhibited the BIG1 binding of myosin IXb. These results suggest that BIG1 and RhoA compete with each other for the binding to myosin IXb, thus resulting in the inhibition of the GAP activity by BIG1. The present study identified BIG1, the Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factor, as a new binding partner for myosin IXb, which inhibited the GAP activity of myosin IXb.

It is well established that Rho GTPases act as molecular switches that cycle between the GTP-bound on state and the GDP-bound off state and play key roles in diverse cellular functions under the control of two major regulators: a GTPase activating protein (GAP) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; Arf, ADP-ribosylation factor; BIG, brefeldin A-inhibited GEF; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; β-gal, β-galactosidase; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; NRK, normal rat kidney.1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; Arf, ADP-ribosylation factor; BIG, brefeldin A-inhibited GEF; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; β-gal, β-galactosidase; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; NRK, normal rat kidney. that enhances the hydrolysis of GTP and thus makes Rho GTPases in GDP-bound forms, and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that promotes the exchange of GDP to GTP and thereby turns them on to the GTP-bound form (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar). The numbers of the regulators for the Rho family GTPases found in mammals are reported to be ∼80 for GAPs and about 60 for GEFs (2Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Even though the numbers may be lowered because they are likely to contain some redundant counts (3Peck J. Douglas G.T. Wu C.H. Burbelo P.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the numbers exceed far more than the number of Rho GTPases (i.e. 20, Ref. 2Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar), which leads us to think that Rho GTPases must be tightly regulated in a spatial and temporal manner. Such regulations will seem to be more crucial when we see how diverse functions are controlled by Rho GTPases: migration, adhesion, morphogenesis, axon guidance, and phagocytosis, as in the actin-dependent processes, and the microtubule cytoskeleton, cell polarity, gene expression, cell cycle progression, and membrane transport pathways, examples of other functions besides actin-related functions (4Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). As a member of the ninth class of the myosin superfamily, which now consists of 18 classes (5Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), myosin IX has a motor domain that is common throughout the superfamily, and IQ domains that serve as the light chain binding sites. One of the unique features of myosin IX is that it possesses a RhoGAP domain and a zinc finger motif in the tail domain (6Reinhard J. Scheel A.A. Diekmann D. Hall A. Ruppert C. Bahler M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Two isoforms are known in myosin IX: myosin IXa and IXb (7Chieregatti E. Gartner A. Stoffler H.E. Bahler M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3597-3608PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gorman S.W. Haider N.B. Grieshammer U. Swiderski R.E. Kim E. Welch J.W. Searby C. Leng S. Carmi R. Sheffield V.C. Duhl D.M. Genomics. 1999; 59: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although they have a zinc finger motif and a GAP domain in common, they differ in the number of the light chain binding IQ motif, where IXa-isoform has six and IXb has four, and the length of the tail domain, where the tail of IXa is ∼70 kDa longer than that of IXb (8Gorman S.W. Haider N.B. Grieshammer U. Swiderski R.E. Kim E. Welch J.W. Searby C. Leng S. Carmi R. Sheffield V.C. Duhl D.M. Genomics. 1999; 59: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is also reported that the two isoforms differ in their expression patterns in human tissues; IXa are mainly expressed in brain and testis, whereas IXb are found more ubiquitously (7Chieregatti E. Gartner A. Stoffler H.E. Bahler M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3597-3608PubMed Google Scholar). However, the physiological function of IXb is largely unknown. It was shown recently that myosin IXb is a processive motor (9Post P.L. Tyska M.J. O'Connell C.B. Johung K. Hayward A. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11679-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Inoue A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that moves on the actin track for a long distance without dissociating from actin. This finding suggests that myosin IX functions as a cargo carrier in cells. A critical issue is the identity of such cargo molecules for myosin IX. To address this question, we attempted to find a binding partner of myosin IXb by using yeast two-hybrid screening strategy. As a result, we obtained BIG1, a GEF for another member of the Ras GTPase superfamily Arf. Among all six members of Arfs, Arf1 and -3, which are known to play a role in several types of vesicle formation on the Golgi (11Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), were preferentially activated by BIG1 (12Mansour S.J. Skaug J. Zhao X.H. Giordano J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12308-12315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that BIG1 as a new binding partner of myosin IXb down-regulates the GAP activity of myosin IXb through the competition in RhoA binding. Materials—Vectors pBTM-116 and pGAD-424 and yeast strain L40 were kind gifts from Dr. Stephen Lambert (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). The cDNA of RhoA was a kind gift from Dr. Alan Hall (University College, London, UK). The baculovirus expression system including a vector pFastBac-HT and Sf9 cells was from Invitrogen. The vector containing the FLAG tag was constructed by introducing the FLAG tag sequence in pFastBac-HT at downstream of the His tag sequence. Ni-NTA-agarose was from Qiagen. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel was from Sigma. Antibodies were made by Genemed (South San Francisco, CA) against the C-terminal peptides: CSASTESLLEERAVRGAAEE and CSQPPEQELGINKQ for anti-myosin IXb and anti-BIG1 antibodies, respectively. Antibodies used in this study are all affinity purified with the antigen peptides and stored at –80 °C. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The LexA system was used in the yeast two-hybrid assays. As for bait to be used in the yeast two-hybrid screening, myr5 (GenBank™ accession number X77609), the rat homolog of myosin IXb, was digested at BamHI and SalI sites that were created by the site-directed mutagenesis in the position of 4229 and 6090 nucleotides, respectively. This tail portion of myr5 was then inserted in-frame and ligated into pBTM-116 at BamHI/SalI sites. The rat lung Matchmaker cDNA library was purchased from Clontech. Both bait and the library vectors were used for co-transformation of yeast L40 strain, which has LacZ and HIS3 reporter genes. The transformants streaked on a plate lacking Trp/Leu and incubated at 30 °C. Colonies grown on the plate were replicated on a –His plate and selected for potential positive clones. After colonies were restreaked on a His plate, the plate was replicated on four plates, each lacking either –Trp, –Leu, –His or none, to confirm the positive clones grown on a–His plate without the loss of bait or prey vector. The positive colonies were further tested for the β-galactosidase (β-gal) assay by first transferring them onto a blotting paper, freezing and thawing the colonies once with liquid nitrogen, and incubating them with buffer containing 100 mm NaHPO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4 and 0.5 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 2 h. For the yeast two-hybrid binding assay, five constructs were made using the tail portion of myr5, and the residues included are: pBTM-P (amino acids 1364–1593), pBTM-PZ (amino acids 1364–1657), pBTM-ZG (amino acids 1532–1855), pBTM-GA (amino acids 1659–1980), and pBTM-A (amino acids 1836–1980). All of these constructs were co-transformed with the rat BIG1 cDNA (4023–5961 nucleotides) in pACT2, which was isolated in the screening, and tested for its interactions in the same way as described above. Molecular Cloning of Human BIG1 and Plasmid Constructions for Protein Expression—Human full-length BIG1 was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. The template cDNA was generated from the HeLa cell total RNA using Superscript reverse transcryptase II (Invitrogen) with specific oligonucleotide primers according to the manufacturer's protocol. The BIG1 cDNA was inserted in-frame to FLAG-tagged pFastBacHT at BamHI/SalI sites. Human myosin IXb cDNA encoding the entire coding region (GenBank™ accession number NM_004145.2, the short version with exon 36 spliced out) was inserted in-frame to FLAG-tagged pFastBacHT at EcoRI/SpeI sites. The tail portion of this myosin IXb (M9b-tail, amino acids 1252–2005) was subcloned in-frame to pFastBacHT using the SpeI site. RhoA cDNA containing the entire coding sequence was subcloned in-frame to pFastBacHT using the EcoRI site. Protein Purification—All proteins were produced by the baculovirus expression system according to the manufacturer's protocol. For His-tagged protein purification, Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus were harvested and centrifuged, and the pellets were suspended in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 4 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. After sonication, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose and gently rotated for 20 min at 4 °C. After a wash with the buffer described above, the bound protein was eluted with a buffer containing 150 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The purified protein was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mm EGTA and 0.2 mm DTT; then sucrose was added to 20%, and the protein was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. For FLAG-tagged proteins, the infected Sf9 cells were lysed in the same buffer described above, except that 2 mm ATP was added for the myosin IXb purification, the cells were centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was passed through the column containing anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. After an extensive wash with the lysis buffer, the recombinant proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 4 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm FLAG peptide. The purified proteins were then stored at –80 °C as described above. M9b-tail, RhoA, and Arf1 are flanked by His tag, and full-length myosin IXb and BIG1 were flanked by His-FLAG tag. These are used in the experiments unless otherwise indicated. After the initial purification step by Ni-NTA-agarose, myristoylated Arf1 was separated as described (14Randazzo P.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, Arf1 purified by Ni-NTA-agarose was applied to the phenyl-Sepharose HP column, and the protein was eluted with a descending NaCl gradient from 3000 to 100 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Arf1-containing fractions were collected, concentrated, and dialyzed against the same buffer with 100 mm NaCl. The purified Arf1 was stored at –80 °C as described above. Protein Binding Assay—In vitro pull-down assay was performed using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. The FLAG-tagged protein was first bound to the beads in the solution containing phosphate-buffered saline and 10 mg/ml BSA. After a brief wash with the same buffer, the beads were incubated with the full-length or the tail portion of myosin IXb for 30 min at 4 °C in the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol). Beads were spun down and washed twice with 70 times the bed volume of the binding buffer. Then the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The kinetic parameters for the protein binding activity were determined by the non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. For the binding assay of RhoA on M9b-tail, Ni-NTA-agarose was used. His-tagged M9b-tail and RhoA were incubated with the beads in the binding buffer as described above. RhoA was treated with TEV protease (Invitrogen) to remove the tag according to the manufacturer's protocol before incubating with the beads. The binding reaction was carried out in the binding buffer for 30 min at 4 °C, and the beads were washed twice with 70 times the bed volume of the binding buffer. Then the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. Endogenous BIG1 or myosin IXb of NRK cells were co-immunoprecipitated with or without the purified FLAG-tagged proteins (0.5 μm) using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. The NRK lysate was prepared by homogenizing the cell pellets with 9-fold volumes of the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mm l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 0.1 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1% Triton X-100), incubating the cell pellets on ice for 20 min, washing them three times with the lysis buffer, and centrifuging them at 18,000 × g for 10 min thus obtaining the supernatants. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by the Western blot analysis using antibodies as indicated in the figures. The co-immunoprecipitation assay for the endogenous protein complex was carried out in the same way as described above except that the extract was made by adding the lysis buffer of four times the volume of the cell pellets. 0.2 mg/ml final of either the affinity purified anti-BIG1 antibody or non-immune IgG was added to the lysate and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The complex was centrifuged, and the pellets were subjected to the Western blot analysis. GAP Assay—To measure the GTPase activity of RhoA, the filter binding assay was performed based on the protocol described previously (15Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with some modifications. First, 5 μm RhoA was preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP in the preloading buffer (15 μm [γ-32P]GTP, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm DTT) for 10 min at 30 °C. The preloading was stopped by adding MgCl2 to 5 mm. For the measurement of the intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA, 1 μm RhoA was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in the solution containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm GTP, and 1 mg/ml BSA. A part of the sample was taken at each time point into 1 ml of dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2), which was immediately filtered through 25-mm BA85 nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) washed with 5 ml of the dilution buffer. The radioactivity of the membrane filter was determined by the scintillation counter. For the measurement of the GAP activity of myosin IXb, the tail domain or full-length myosin IXb was added to the reaction mixture containing 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP-bound RhoA with or without BIG1 at indicated concentrations. IC50 for the inhibition of the GAP activity of myosin IXb by BIG1 was determined by the non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. The GAP activity of myosin IXb for Arf1 was measured as described above except that 2.4 mg/ml of asolectin (Sigma, catalog number 11145), which was sonicated in the preloading buffer for 20 s, was added to Arf1 for GTP preloading. GEF Assay—To measure the exchange of GTP/GDP on Arf1, the filter binding assay was carried out based on the protocol described previously (13Togawa A. Morinaga N. Ogasawara M. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12308-12315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Arf1 (1 μm) was incubated with or without BIG1 (20 nm) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mg/ml asolectin. Asolectin was sonicated in the same buffer for 20 s until the solution became clear. 4 μm [35S]GTPγS was added to the reaction mixture at time 0 and incubated at 25 °C for various times indicated in Fig. 9. 50 μl of the reaction mixture was diluted into 1 ml of dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2), which was immediately filtered through the nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was washed with 5 ml of the dilution buffer, and the radioactivity was measured by the scintillation counter. To find a new binding partner for myosin IXb, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screening. Because the N-terminal domain serves a motor function, it has been thought that the C-terminal tail domain serves as a targeting protein binding site. Using the C-terminal region that includes the zinc finger motif and the GAP domain as bait (Fig. 1), approximately three million independent clones were screened from the rat lung cDNA library. The positive clones grown on the nutrient selection plates were picked and were subjected to β-gal assay to further eliminate false positives using LacZ, a GAL4-responsive gene encoding β-galactosidase. Five clones that encoded the C-terminal domain of BIG1 (amino acids 1305–1849) were obtained as positive clones. To confirm the interaction of BIG1 with bait, an additional yeast two-hybrid assay was performed in which the DNA binding domain and the gene activation domain were switched for BIG1 and the myosin IXb tail domain. The positive signal was observed, suggesting the interaction of the myosin IXb tail domain and the C-terminal portion of BIG1 in this assay system. The binding of BIG1 to myosin IXb was directly examined with the purified proteins. Based on the predicted nucleotide sequence of BIG1 from the human genome, the entire region of human BIG1 was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR using cDNA raised from the total RNA of HeLa cells. The FLAG sequence was introduced at the N-terminal end of BIG1 in aid of purification. FLAG-tagged BIG1 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified using anti-FLAG affinity chromatography. The SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified BIG1 showed an apparent molecular mass of ∼210 kDa, which is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of BIG1 (Fig. 2). The tail domain of human myosin IXb (M9b-tail) flanked by a hexahistidine tag at the N-terminal end of the molecule was also expressed in Sf9 and purified by using Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography. To examine the direct binding between the two proteins, the purified proteins were mixed and then applied to anti-FLAG affinity gel. The resin was washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE to analyze the bound proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A, His-tagged M9b-tail was bound together with FLAG-tagged BIG1. On the other hand, the binding of M9b-tail to the resin was not observed in the absence of FLAG-tagged BIG1, suggesting that there was no nonspecific binding of M9b-tail to the resin. The result indicates that BIG1 directly binds to myosin IXb. The amount of bound M9b-tail was determined as a function of the BIG1 concentration. The amount of BIG1-bound M9b-tail increased with the increasing concentration of M9b-tail that was added in the sample solution. The amount of BIG1-bound M9b-tail was plotted against the concentration of M9b-tail incubated with BIG1 (Fig. 2B). The non-linear curve fitting gave the calculated value of Bmax = 0.93 mol/mol and Kd = 0.37 μm, indicating that myosin IXb and BIG1 bind with the stoichiometry of 1 to 1 at the submicromolar binding affinity. To examine the binding that takes place between wild type myosin IXb and BIG1, full-length myosin IXb was added to the total cell extract of NRK cells, and the mixture was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, endogenous BIG1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged full-length myosin IXb. There was no BIG1 detected in the precipitate when myosin IXb was not added to the extract, suggesting that the binding was specific. Likewise, endogenous myosin IXb in the cell extract was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged BIG1 (Fig. 3B). The results suggest that BIG1 and myosin IXb bind to each other in vivo. The binding between endogenous myosin IXb and BIG1 was also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation using the anti-BIG1 antibody in the NRK extract (Fig. 3C). The results further support the idea that the binding of myosin IXb and BIG1 actually takes place in physiological conditions. It should be noted that the amount of myosin IXb co-immunoprecipitated with BIG1 was lower for the endogenous protein than that for the recombinant myosin IXb (Fig. 3B), but this should be caused by the difference in the myosin IXb concentration in the assay solution that affects the binding efficiency according to the Kd value of 0.37 μm. It is known that the myosin IX tail is composed of several domains including the RhoGAP domain and the zinc finger motif (6Reinhard J. Scheel A.A. Diekmann D. Hall A. Ruppert C. Bahler M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the tail domain, myosin IXb has a proline-rich region at the N-terminal end, a zinc finger to follow, then a RhoGAP domain, and the C-terminal acidic residue-rich region (Fig. 4). By the yeast two-hybrid assay, we determined the domain in myosin IXb responsible for the BIG1 binding. Five different constructs of the truncated M9b-tail were produced and tested for the BIG1 binding activity. One construct with both the zinc finger motif and the GAP domain yielded positive signal for both –His growth and β-gal assay (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the constructs containing only the GAP domain or the zinc finger region were negative in these assays. The result suggests that both the RhoGAP domain and the zinc finger motif of myosin IXb are needed for the binding to BIG1. As the BIG1 binding region overlaps with RhoA interacting domain, we examined whether BIG1 shows any functional effects on myosin IXb. The GAP activity of myosin IXb was measured by using a filter binding assay, and the effect of the BIG1 on the GAP activity of myosin IXb was determined. RhoA was preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP followed by incubation with or without M9b-tail and then filtered through the nitrocellulose membrane. The amount of [γ-32P]GTP remaining on RhoA showed a dramatic decrease with the addition of the increasing amount of M9b-tail. This was consistent with the previous reports (6Reinhard J. Scheel A.A. Diekmann D. Hall A. Ruppert C. Bahler M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Post P.L. Tyska M.J. O'Connell C.B. Johung K. Hayward A. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2039-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and showed that M9b-tail has the RhoAGAP activity. However the GAP activity of M9b-tail was significantly attenuated when 0.1 μm of BIG1 was added (Fig. 5A). A similar result was obtained using full-length myosin IXb (Fig. 5C). The inhibition of the RhoAGAP activity of myosin IXb by BIG1 was observed in a dose-dependent manner, and the IC50 was calculated to be 0.06 μm (Fig. 5B). Because the BIG1 binding region contains the RhoGAP domain, we examined whether the binding of RhoA on myosin IXb is affected by the addition of BIG1. The binding assay was performed with His-tagged M9b-tail and RhoA in the presence of various concentrations of BIG1. The effect of BIG1 on the amount of RhoA bound to M9b-tail was determined by Western blot. Interestingly, the binding of RhoA to myosin IXb was diminished by the addition of BIG1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas addition of BSA showed no change (Fig. 6). Likewise, when FLAG-tagged BIG1 was mixed with M9b-tail in the presence of various concentrations of RhoA, the bound M9b-tail to BIG1 decreased significantly as higher concentrations of RhoA was added (Fig. 7). These results suggest that the inhibition of the GAP activity by BIG1 is caused by BIG1 interfering with the binding of RhoA to myosin IXb.Fig. 7RhoA inhibits BIG1 binding to myosin IXb. FLAG-tagged BIG1 was incubated with M9b-tail and various concentrations of GTPγS-bound RhoA or BSA, as indicated. The samples were incubated with anti-FLAG affinity gel as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After the wash, proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE to detect the amount of M9b-tail. The amount of M9b-tail was quantified by densitometry. Bars represent the standard error from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As BIG1 is known as ArfGEF, we tested to see if myosin IXb is involved in the Arf1 signaling pathway by testing the GAP activity for Arf1. As shown in Fig. 8, no GAP activity for Arf1 was observed at the concentrations of M9b-tail tested, i.e. up to 1 μm, which was 1,000-fold the amount used for RhoGAP assay. We also tested to see if myosin IXb has an effect on the ArfGEF activity of BIG1. The GEF assay was performed to observe the effect of myosin IXb in the rate of [35S]GTPγS incorporation into Arf1 in the presence or absence of BIG1. The incorporation of [35S]GTPγS into Arf1 was significantly enhanced in the presence of BIG1, indicating the GEF activity of BIG1 (Fig. 9). However, the addition of M9b-tail up to 1 μm hardly changed the incorporation of [35S]GTPγS into Arf1. The result suggests that the binding of myosin IXb to BIG1 does not alter the ArfGEF activity of BIG1. Taken together, these results indicate that BIG1, as a new binding partner for myosin IXb, is a down-regulator for the RhoGAP activity of myosin IXb by interfering with the binding of the myosin IXb GAP domain to RhoA. It has been thought that the tail domain of myosin serves as myosin target protein binding sites. For myosin IX, it was previously shown that the tail domain contains a RhoGAP domain. This finding raised an idea that myosin IX is a signaling molecule having motor function. In the present study we demonstrated that BIG1, which has the GEF activity against Arf family GTPases, interacts with the tail domain of myosin IXb by using the yeast two-hybrid screening. Endogenous BIG1 and myosin IXb in cells were co-immunoprecipitated, supporting the idea that the interaction between the two proteins takes place in the cell. Furthermore, we found that the purified BIG1 binds to the purified myosin IXb tail indicating the direct binding between the two proteins. A critical finding is that the RhoGAP activity of myosin IXb is inhibited by BIG1. The IC50 for BIG1 in the inhibition of the GAP activity was similar to the dissociation constant for the binding of the two proteins, supporting the hypothesis that the inhibition of the RhoGAP activity that is induced by BIG1 is caused by the binding of BIG1 to myosin IXb. This is consistent with the finding that the domain in myosin IXb responsible for the binding to BIG1 is the region containing the zinc finger motif and the GAP domain. Because the BIG1 binding domain includes the GAP domain of myosin IXb, it is most likely that competition between BIG1 and Rho in binding to myosin IXb takes place. The present results support this notion that the BIG1 interferes with the binding of RhoA to the GAP domain of myosin IXb thus inhibiting the RhoGAP activity. It has become clear that the Golgi membranes associate with the actin network and the actin structure is important for the overall organization of the Golgi (17Allan V.J. Thompson H.M. McNiven M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E236-E242Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the Rho family plays a role in the modification of the Golgi structure and positioning presumably because of the change in the actin network. The localization of BIG1 at the Golgi has been observed in various culture cells (12Mansour S.J. Skaug J. Zhao X.H. Giordano J. Scherer S.W. Melancon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7968-7973Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Yamaji R. Adamik R. Takeda K. Togawa A. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Ferrans V.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2567-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, it was reported that myosin IXb is observed throughout the cytoplasm with some punctate patterns along with actin stress fibers and enrichment at the perinuclear region including the Golgi (16Muller R.T. Honnert U. Reinhard J. Bahler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2039-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These observations together with the present findings raise an idea that the RhoGAP activity of myosin IXb is spatially regulated by the localized concentration of BIG1. Recent studies have suggested that actin filaments extend from the Golgi membrane, and Rho and its associated proteins play a role in polymerization of actin from the Golgi membrane (19Camera P. da Silva J.S. Griffiths G. Giuffrida M.G. Ferrara L. Schubert V. Imarisio S. Silengo L. Dotti C.G. Di Cunto F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is anticipated that the RhoGAP activity of myosin IXb at the Golgi is inhibited by BIG1 thus preventing the inhibition of the RhoA activity by myosin IXb at the Golgi. It is known that there is a dynamic traffic system that delivers proper proteins and lipids to various intracellular organelles including the Golgi. The transport carriers include several coat proteins such as COPI, COPII, and clathrin, and it is thought that the Arf family of small GTPases play a major role in the recruitment of coat proteins on the Golgi (20Nie Z. Hirsch D.S. Randazzo P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The Arf activity is regulated by specific ArfGEFs. Among various ArfGEFs, BIG1 is classified in Sec7/BIG family containing the central sec7 domain catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP (11Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). BIG1 is localized in the cytosol and the Golgi, and it is anticipated that the localization of BIG1 is determined by unknown transportation mechanisms. The present study shed a light in the transportation of sec7/BIG family ArfGEF and thus the regulation of the Arf activity at the Golgi and the recruitment of coat proteins on the Golgi. It was shown previously that the truncation mutants of BIG1 lacking the C-terminal domain can localize to the Golgi (12Mansour S.J. Skaug J. Zhao X.H. Giordano J. Scherer S.W. Melancon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7968-7973Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the C-terminal domain of BIG1 contains the myosin IXb binding region. Therefore, it is possible that myosin IXb moves BIG1 away from the Golgi rather than moves into the Golgi. There are some recent findings that support this notion. One study have revealed that RhoA assembles on the Golgi membrane along with other effector proteins, suggesting that actin filaments elongate from the Golgi with minus ends pointing outward (19Camera P. da Silva J.S. Griffiths G. Giuffrida M.G. Ferrara L. Schubert V. Imarisio S. Silengo L. Dotti C.G. Di Cunto F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Also, our recent study revealed unique motor characteristics of myosin IXb. It was shown that myosin IXb moves processively toward the minus end of the actin filament (10Inoue A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, myosin IXb is a suitable motor that carries BIG1 away from the Golgi on actin filaments for a long distance without dissociating from actin filaments. Because the RhoGAP activity of myosin IXb would be controlled by the local concentration of BIG1 and RhoA, it is anticipated that the RhoGAP activity of myosin IXb is resumed at the destination where BIG1 dissociates from myosin IXb by unknown mechanisms. Recent studies have suggested that the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway is involved in the function of BIG1. It is known that BIG1 forms a heterodimer with BIG2 (13Togawa A. Morinaga N. Ogasawara M. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12308-12315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Morinaga N. Tsai S.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12856-12860Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently it was reported that BIG2 harbors protein kinase A binding sites, suggesting that protein kinase A is a component of the BIG1/BIG2 complex (22Li H. Adamik R. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It has been reported that BIG1 changes its localization within the cell by the stimulation of cAMP signaling; BIG1 changes its localization from the cytosol to membrane/cytoskeletal components (22Li H. Adamik R. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistently, it was also reported that the activation of protein kinase A enhances the binding of Arf1 to the Golgi membrane (23Martin M.E. Hidalgo J. Rosa J.L. Crottet P. Velasco A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19050-19059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and this may be caused by the accumulation of BIG1 at the Golgi membrane. At present, we do not know whether myosin IXb is involved in this regulatory process, but because recent studies have suggested the cross-talk between cAMP and Rho signaling (24Howe A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) it is possible that myosin IXb, having the actin-based motor, the RhoGAP, and the BIG1 binding activities, plays a role in the Arf-related membrane trafficking process."
https://openalex.org/W1995776728,"We previously demonstrated that low K intake stimulated the expression of c-Src and that stimulation of protein tyrosine kinase inhibited ROMK channel activity (Wei, Y., Bloom, P., Lin, D. H., Gu, R. M., and Wang, W. H. (2001) Am. J. Physiol. 281, F206-F212). Decreases in dietary K content significantly increased O2·¯ levels and the phosphorylation of c-Jun, a transcription factor, in renal cortex and outer medulla. The role of O2·¯ and related products such as H2O2 in stimulating the expression of protein tyrosine kinase is suggested by the observation that addition of 50-200 μm H2O2 increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and the expression of c-Src in M1 cells, a mouse collecting duct principal cell line. The effect of H2O2 on c-Src expression was completely abolished with cyclohexamide or actinomycin D. The treatment of animals on a K-deficient (KD) diet with tempol for 7 days significantly decreased the production of O2·¯, c-Jun phosphorylation, and c-Src expression. Moreover, low K intake decreased the activity of ROMK-like small conductance channels from 1.37 (control K diet) to 0.5 in the cortical collecting duct and increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK in the renal cortex and outer medulla. In contrast, the tempol treatment not only increased channel activity to 1.1 in the cortical collecting duct but also decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK from rats on a KD diet. Finally, suppressing O2·¯ production with tempol significantly increased renal K excretion measured with metabolic cage and lowered the plasma K concentration in comparison with those on a KD diet alone without tempol. We conclude that O2·¯ and related products play a role in mediating the effect of low K intake on c-Src expression and in suppressing ROMK channel activity and renal K secretion. We previously demonstrated that low K intake stimulated the expression of c-Src and that stimulation of protein tyrosine kinase inhibited ROMK channel activity (Wei, Y., Bloom, P., Lin, D. H., Gu, R. M., and Wang, W. H. (2001) Am. J. Physiol. 281, F206-F212). Decreases in dietary K content significantly increased O2·¯ levels and the phosphorylation of c-Jun, a transcription factor, in renal cortex and outer medulla. The role of O2·¯ and related products such as H2O2 in stimulating the expression of protein tyrosine kinase is suggested by the observation that addition of 50-200 μm H2O2 increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and the expression of c-Src in M1 cells, a mouse collecting duct principal cell line. The effect of H2O2 on c-Src expression was completely abolished with cyclohexamide or actinomycin D. The treatment of animals on a K-deficient (KD) diet with tempol for 7 days significantly decreased the production of O2·¯, c-Jun phosphorylation, and c-Src expression. Moreover, low K intake decreased the activity of ROMK-like small conductance channels from 1.37 (control K diet) to 0.5 in the cortical collecting duct and increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK in the renal cortex and outer medulla. In contrast, the tempol treatment not only increased channel activity to 1.1 in the cortical collecting duct but also decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK from rats on a KD diet. Finally, suppressing O2·¯ production with tempol significantly increased renal K excretion measured with metabolic cage and lowered the plasma K concentration in comparison with those on a KD diet alone without tempol. We conclude that O2·¯ and related products play a role in mediating the effect of low K intake on c-Src expression and in suppressing ROMK channel activity and renal K secretion. It is well known that K restriction suppresses renal K excretion (2Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is achieved, at least in part, by decreasing the apical K conductance in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) 1The abbreviations used are: CCD, cortical collecting duct; PTK, protein tyrosine kinase; KD, K-deficient; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropane-sulfonic acid; SK, small conductance. and by stimulating K absorption in the outer medullary collecting duct (3Wingo C.S. Cain B.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 323-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4Wang W.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 547-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which low K intake suppresses the apical K channels is not completely understood. We previously demonstrated that low K intake increased the expression of Src family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) such as c-Src and c-Yes (1Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that inhibition of PTK increased the apical ROMK-like small conductance (SK) channels (1Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that PTK is involved in mediating the effect of low K intake on the apical K channels and that increases in PTK activity and expression are important for suppression of renal K secretion during K depletion. Low K intake has been reported to increase the production of O2·¯ anion in rabbit carotid arteries (5Yang B.C. Li D.Y. Weng Y.F. Lynch J. Wingo C.S. Wehta J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1955-H1961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that H2O2 stimulates the phosphorylation of c-Jun in endothelial cells, an indication of activation of transcription factor (6Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keany Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that increases in O2·¯ or related products induced by low K intake may be an upstream signal responsible for mediating the effect of low K intake on PTK expression and K secretion in the kidney. This hypothesis was tested in the present study by examining whether O2·¯ and related products such as H2O2 can mimic the effect of low K intake and stimulate the expression of PTK in the CCD. We also examined whether decreases in O2·¯ and related products with tempol could attenuate the effect of low K intake on c-Src expression, ROMK channel activity, and renal K excretion. Animals—Sprague-Dawley rats (6–8 weeks, either sex) were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). Rats were housed in metabolic cages for 7 days to study urinary K excretion. After 3 days of training in the cage, rats were divided into three groups: 1) control group in which animals were kept on a normal K (1.1%) diet and had a daily intraperitoneal injection of saline for 1 week; 2) the low K group in which rats were maintained on a K-deficient (KD) diet and received a daily intraperitoneal injection of saline for 7 days; and 3) the tempol-treated group in which rats were also fed with KD diet and had a daily intraperitoneal injection of tempol (15 mg/kg) for 1 week. Data regarding the 24-h food intake, body weight, and urine output were recorded. Urinary Na and K concentrations were measured by a flame photometer, and daily Na and K excretion were calculated as mEq/24 h. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg), and blood samples were drawn from the heart to measure the plasma K and Na concentrations. Rats were then killed, and the abdomens were opened to remove the kidneys. Tissue Preparation—The renal cortex and the outer medulla were separated under a dissecting microscope and suspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer solution (1:8 ratio, w/v) containing 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS. 10 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mg/ml stock solution in isopropanol). 10 μl of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) were added per ml of buffer at the time of lysis. The samples were homogenized on ice for 15 min with a mortar and pestle. The suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in the presence of DNase (5 μg/ml) followed by centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 10 min. The resultant supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were measured in duplicate using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Preparation of M1 Cells—M1 cells, a mouse CCD line, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Mannasas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Before H2O2 treatment, the cells were cultured in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 16 h, followed by incubation for an additional 30 min in a solution containing 22 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.16 mm HPO4, 0.4 mm H2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3. 5.6 mm H2O2 (50-200 μm final concentration) was directly added to the cells in HEPES buffer for 30-120 min. The viability of M1 cells treated with H2O2 as determined by the Trypan Blue dye exclusion method was ∼90% of the corresponding control cells. After treatment with H2O2, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and incubated for 30 min in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—The corresponding antibody was added to the protein samples (500 μg) harvested from kidneys at a ratio of 5 μl/ml solution. The mixture was gently rotated at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with 25 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The tube containing the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μl/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μl of protease inhibitor mixture/ml. The agarose pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 4% SDS, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% bromphenol blue. After boiling the sample for 5 min, proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immuno-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated overnight with the primary antibody at 4 °C. The membrane was washed 3× 15 min with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 followed by incubation for 30 min with respective secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate. ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect the protein bands; the intensity of the bands of interest was determined using Alpha DigiDoc 1000 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Measurement of Superoxide Anion—The method for measurement of O2·¯ has been previously described (7Mohazzab H.M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L815-L822PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, renal cortex and outer medulla were isolated from rats on a normal or KD diet for 7-10 days. The tissue (100 mg) was cut into small pieces with a sharp blade and suspended in air-equilibrated MOPS-sucrose buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 μm lucigenin. The chemiluminescence elicited in the presence of lucigenin was measured in a liquid scintillation counter with a single active photomultiplier tube positioned in out-of-coincidence mode. Blanks were substracted from the average level of chemiluminescence signal. Preparation of CCDs for Patch Clamping—Single CCDs were isolated, placed on a 5 × 5-mm coverglass coated with polylysin and transferred to a chamber (1000 μl) mounted on an inverted Nikon microscope. The CCDs were superfused with HEPES-buffered NaCl solution containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.8 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). The pipette solution was composed of (in mm) 140 KCl, 1.8 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). The temperature of the chamber was maintained at 37 ± 1 °C by circulating warm water around the chamber. The CCD was cut open with a sharpened micropipette to expose the apical membrane. Patch Clamp Technique—We followed the methods described previously to dissect the CCD from rats on a normal K and KD diet and on tempol-treated rats on a KD diet (1Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An Axon200A patch clamp amplifier was used to record channel current. The current was low-pass filtered at 1 kHz by an 8-pole Bessel filter (902LPF; Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) and digitized with Axon interface (Digidata 1200). Data were analyzed using the pClamp software system 6.04 (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Channel activity was defined as NPo, which was calculated from data samples of 60-s duration in the steady state as follows, NPo = Σ(t1 + t2 +......ti), where ti is the fractional open time spent at each of the observed current levels. The slope conductance of the channel was calculated by measurement of K+ current at several cell membrane potentials. Experimental Materials and Statistics—Antibodies to c-Src and β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-tyrosine-phosphorylation antibody (4G10) and ROMK antibody were obtained from Upstate USA (Charlottesville, VA) and Alomone (Jerusalem, Israel), respectively. Antibodies to phospho-c-Jun (serine 73) and c-Jun were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Actinomycin D and cyclohexamide were purchased from Sigma. Data are shown as mean ± S.E., and paired or unpaired Student's t test was used to determine the significance between the two groups. Statistical significance was taken as p <0.05. Low K intake has been shown to increase the generation of O2·¯ anions in rabbit arteries (5Yang B.C. Li D.Y. Weng Y.F. Lynch J. Wingo C.S. Wehta J.L. Am. J.

We used the lucigenin enhanced chemiluminescence method described elsewhere (7Mohazzab H.M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L815-L822PubMed Google Scholar, 8Münzel T. Afanas'ev I.G.

Fig. 1 summarizes results from seven measurements demonstrating that concentrations of O2·¯ in the renal cortex and outer medulla increased by ∼110 ± 5% in the rats on a KD diet in comparison with those on a normal chow. Because O2·¯ anion and related products such as H2O2 have been demonstrated to activate c-Jun, a transcription factor, in endothelial cells (6Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keany Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we speculated that high O2·¯ concentrations induced by low K intake may be responsible for increased expression of c-Src in the kidney through activation of c-Jun. Therefore, we used the antibody recognizing the phosphorylated c-Jun on serine residue 73, an indication of c-Jun activation (9Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2258) Google Scholar), to determine the effect of low K intake on c-Jun phosphorylation. Fig. 2 is a Western blot showing that phosphorylation of c-Jun on serine residue 73 is 95 ± 5 and 110 ± 5% (n = 7 rats) higher in the renal cortex and outer medulla from rats on a KD diet than those from animals on a normal K diet, respectively. To further determine the role of O2·¯ in stimulating c-Jun phosphorylation, we investigated the effect of H2O2 on c-Jun phosphorylation in M1 cells, a mouse CCD cell line (10Korbmacher C. Segal A.S.

M1 cells were incubated in 200 μm H2O2-containing medium for 30, 60, and 120 min, and c-Jun phosphorylation was examined with Western blot. Fig. 3 is a Western blot demonstrating that incubation of M1 cells in 200 μm H2O2-containing medium for 60 and 120 min significantly increased phospho-c-Jun by 45 ± 5 and 110 ± 20% (n = 5) in comparison to the control value, respectively. We also studied the dose response curve of c-Jun phosphorylation to the stimulation of H2O2. Fig. 4A is a Western blot showing the effect of H2O2 on c-Jun phosphorylation on serine residue 73. Data summarized in Fig. 4B demonstrate that 100 and 200 μm H2O2 significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of c-Jun by 90 ± 10 (n = 4) and 120 ± 10%, respectively. Thus, we used 200 μm H2O2 in the following experiments.Fig. 4A, dose-dependent response of c-Jun phosphorylation to H2O2.

Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). M1 cells were incubated in 200 μm H2O2-containing medium for 30, 60, and 120 min, followed by incubation in the control medium for an additional 3 h. Fig. 5A is a Western blot demonstrating that incubation of M1 cells in H2O2-containing medium for 120 min significantly increased c-Src by 190 ± 20% (n = 7) in comparison to the control value. Moreover, the effect of H2O2 on c-Src was completely blocked by actinomycin D (5 ng/ml) and cyclohexamide (20 ng/ml) (Fig. 5B). In addition, in the presence of actinomycin D, the c-Src expression level decreased progressively. The decrease was most likely because of the degradation of c-Src. To further examine the role of O2·¯ and related products in mediating the effect of low K intake on PTK expression, we employed tempol, an agent that has been used to decrease O2·¯ formation (14Krishna M.C. Grahame D.A. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We measured O2·¯ levels in rats on a normal K (1.1%) diet, KD diet, and KD diet plus tempol treatment. Data summarized in Fig. 6 demonstrate that tempol treatment significantly decreased O2·¯ levels by 70 ± 10% (n = 5) in the renal cortex and outer medulla in comparison with that without tempol treatment, whereas low K intake significantly increased O2·¯ production by 150 ± 20% (n = 5). We also examined the effect of low K intake on c-Jun phosphorylation in the tempol-treated and untreated rats. Fig. 7 is a Western blot showing that low K intake increased c-Jun phosphorylation by 90 ± 10% (n = 4). In contrast, the c-Jun phosphorylation in rats on KD diet plus tempol was not significantly different from the control value. Thus, suppression of O2·¯ production abolished the effect of low K intake on c-Jun activation.Fig. 7Effect of low K intake on c-Jun phosphorylation in the renal cortex and outer medulla in rats with or without tempol treatment. The top panel shows the phosphorylated c-Jun on serine residue 73 (p-c-Jun), whereas the bottom panel demonstrates the total c-Jun.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that low K intake increased the expression of Src family PTK (1Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If O2·¯ is responsible for mediating the effect of low K on PTK expression, decreases in O2·¯ production are expected to suppress the low K intake-induced increases in Src family PTK. Thus, we examined whether tempol treatment inhibits the effect of low K intake on the expression of c-Src as a representative member of Src family PTK. Fig. 8 is a Western blot showing that low K intake significantly increased the expression of c-Src by 220 ± 15% (n = 4) in comparison with the control. In contrast, tempol treatment abolished the stimulatory effect of low K intake on c-Src expression because c-Src expression in rats on KD diet plus tempol was not significantly different from those on the control K diet. After showing that tempol treatment suppressed the effect of low K intake on O2·¯ levels, c-Jun phosphorylation, and c-Src expression, we examined the effect of tempol on ROMK tyrosine phosphorylation. We confirmed the previous finding that low K intake stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK (15Lin D.H. Sterling H. Lerea K.M. Welling P. Jin L. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F671-F677Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the stimulatory effect of low K intake on tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK was almost absent in tempol-treated rats (Fig. 9A). Data summarized in Fig. 9B show that low K intake stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK by 150 ± 10% (n = 6), whereas the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK in rats on KD diet plus tempol was not significantly different from the control value. Because stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 has been shown to decrease ROMK channel activity in the CCD (16Sterling H. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Dong K. Hebert S.C. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4317-4323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), tempol treatment-induced inhibition of ROMK tyrosine phosphorylation is expected to increase ROMK channel activity in the CCD. Thus, we used the patch clamp technique to examine the ROMK-like SK channels in the CCD from rats on a control (1.1%) or a KD (<0.001%) diet and in rats on KD diet plus tempol. Data summarized in Fig. 10A show that SK channel activity in the CCD from rats on KD diet (NPo = 0.5 ± 0.1, n = 11) was significantly lower than that (NPo = 1.37 ± 0.2, n = 10) in the CCD from rats on a control K diet. However, SK channel activity in the CCD from rats on a KD diet plus tempol was significantly higher than those (NPo = 1.1 ± 0.1, n = 10) in rats on KD diet. This value is not significantly different from the control value. Because ROMK-like SK channels are responsible for K secretion, increases in channel activity were expected to stimulate K secretion. We measured renal K excretion in rats on KD diet plus tempol for 7 days with metabolic cage. Results summarized in Fig. 10B show that renal K excretion decreased from 3.5 ± 0.3 mEq/day in rats on a control K diet (n = 7) to 0.03 ± 0.01 mEq in rats on a KD diet (n = 7). Tempol treatment significantly increased renal K excretion to 0.5 ± 0.1 mEq (n = 7). This increase in K excretion leads to a severe hypokalemia in rats on KD diet plus tempol treatment. Plasma K concentration decreased from 3.8 ± 0.3 mm in animals on the control K diet to 2.8 ± 0.2 mm in rats on a KD diet. However, tempol treatment further lowered plasma K (to 2.2 ± 0.1 mm) in rats on KD diet. The main findings of the present study are that low K intake increases O2·¯ levels in the kidney and that O2·¯ and the related products mediate the inhibitory effect of low K intake on ROMK channel activity in the CCD. The notion that O2·¯ may play a role in suppressing renal K excretion induced by low K intake is supported by several lines of evidence. First, low K intake significantly increased O2·¯ production in the kidney. Second, application of H2O2 mimicked the effect of low K intake on c-Jun phosphorylation and the expression of c-Src in M1 cells. Third, decreasing O2·¯ levels induced by tempol significantly suppressed c-Jun phosphorylation, expression of c-Src, and tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK. Finally, tempol treatment abolished the inhibitory effect of low K intake on the ROMK-like SK channel activity and increased renal K excretion. Therefore, increases in renal O2·¯ production from K-restricted rats play an important role in mediating the effect of low K intake on ROMK channel activity and renal K excretion. It is well established that a low K intake suppresses renal K excretion (2Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is achieved by both inhibition of renal K secretion in the connecting tubule and the CCD and stimulation of K absorption through K-H-ATPase in the outer medullary collecting duct (3Wingo C.S. Cain B.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 323-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The inhibition of K secretion in the CCD induced by low K intake is at least in part the result of decreases in the apical K conductance. Two types of K channels are present in the apical membrane of the CCD (17Wang W.H. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar): Ca2+-dependent maxi K and ROMK-like SK channel. Although maxi K channels may be involved in K secretion in the CCD when tubule flow rate is high (18Woda C.B. Leite Jr., M. Rohatgi R. Satlin L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F437-F446Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Woda C.B. Bragin A. Kleyman T. Satlin L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F786-F793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ROMK-like SK channels play an important role in mediating K secretion during normal tubule flow. Thus, alterations in ROMK channel activity in the CCD could affect renal K secretion in the CCD. We previously demonstrated that low K intake significantly increased the expression of Src family PTK such as c-Src and c-Yes (1Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that ROMK1 was a substrate of PTK and that tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK increased during K depletion and decreased by high K intake (15Lin D.H. Sterling H. Lerea K.M. Welling P. Jin L. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F671-F677Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The role of PTK in regulating ROMK channel activity in the CCD is further established by the observation that inhibition of PTK increases (1Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase decreases (20Wei Y. Bloom P. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20502-20507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), ROMK channel activity. The inhibitory effect of PTK on ROMK1 is the result of stimulation of the ROMK internalization. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the ROMK channel activity was significantly lower in the CCD from rats on KD diet than those on a control K diet. However, we observed previously that the SK channel activity was not significantly different in the CCD of rats on a normal K diet (0.7%) from that on KD diet (1Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discrepancy may be because a 0.7% K-containing rat chow was used as a control K diet in previous experiments and the content of K was 1.1% in the present experiment. Thus, it is conceivable that a physiological variation of dietary K intake could have an effect on ROMK channel activity in the CCD. Although tempol treatment increased ROMK channel activity in the CCD from rats on a KD diet to a similar extent observed in the CCD from the control animal, renal K excretion in tempol-treated rats was still significantly lower than that of control animals. It is possible that stimulation of K absorption in the outer medullary collecting duct during K restriction plays an important role in preserving K (3Wingo C.S. Cain B.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 323-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the observation that suppressing O2·¯ production with tempol significantly increased renal K excretion in comparison with rats on a KD diet alone strongly indicates the role of O2·¯ in mediating the effect of low K on renal K secretion. We hypothesized that low K intake stimulates O2·¯ production, which stimulates transcription factors such as c-Jun and increases PTK expression. As a consequence, tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK increased and channel activity decreased. The notion that O2·¯ and the related products are involved in mediating the effect of low K intake on tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK is supported by the observation that suppressing O2·¯ production by tempol significantly attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK in rats on a KD diet in comparison with those without tempol treatment. There are at least two possibilities by which O2·¯ and related products can stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK: 1) O2·¯ stimulates the expression of Src family PTK, which in turn increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK; 2) O2·¯ and the related products facilitate the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK by directly modulating the activity of PTK and protein tyrosine phosphatase. O2·¯ and H2O2 have been demonstrated to modulate the activity of a variety of protein kinases and phosphatases (21Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) and activate several members of Src family PTK, such as Lck and Fyn (25Brumell J.H. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3133-3139PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that O2·¯ can stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK channels by increasing PTK expression and activity. O2·¯ generation increases by activation of enzymes such as NAD(P)H oxidases and xanthine oxidase (28Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7605) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutases convert O2·¯ to H2O2, which is then metabolized to water by catalase. Thus, increases in O2·¯ are expected to raise H2O2 concentrations. O2·¯ and H2O2 have initially been identified to be involved in the regulation of immuno response and programmed cell death. However, a large body of evidence has supported the notion that O2·¯ and H2O2 may play an important role in mediating a variety of cell functions (28Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7605) Google Scholar). O2·¯ has been shown to mediate the effect of nerve growth factor (NGF) in neuronal cells (29Suzukawa K. Miura K. Mitsushita J. Resau J. Hirose K. Crystal R. Kamata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13175-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in human epidermoid carcinoma cells (30Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Stimulation of NGF and EGF receptors results in transient increases in O2·¯ and H2O2 concentrations. Moreover, elimination of H2O2 by catalase has been demonstrated to inhibit EGF and NGF receptors. Stimulation of insulin receptors has been shown to augment the formation of O2·¯ (31Mahadev K. Wu X. Zilbering A. Zhu L. Lawrence J.T.R. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48662-48669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and low concentrations of H2O2 can potentiate the insulin effect in insulin-responsive tissues (32Schmid E. Hotz-Wagenblatt A. Hack V. Droege W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, high concentrations of H2O2 can induce insulin-like effects in the absence of insulin via stimulation of the insulin-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (33Hayes G.R. Lockwood D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). H2O2 mediates the stimulatory effect of angiotensin II on nitric oxide production in endothelial cells (34Cai H. Li Z. Dikalov S. Holland S.M. Hwang J. Jo H. Dudley Jr., S.C. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48311-48317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, H2O2 stimulates cGMP generation and causes the transient relaxation of calf coronary arteries (35Mohazzab H.K.M. Kaminski P.M. Fayngersh R.P. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1044-H1053PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that O2·¯ and the related products play a physiological role in the regulation of renal K secretion. The mechanism by which low K intake increases O2·¯ production is not known. Several hormones such as growth factor and angiotensin II have been shown to stimulate NAD(P)H and increase O2·¯ production (29Suzukawa K. Miura K. Mitsushita J. Resau J. Hirose K. Crystal R. Kamata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13175-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 30Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 48311-48317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). K depletion has been shown to increase the concentration of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor (36Hsu F.W. Tsao T. Rabkin R. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 363-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37Evan E.P. Henry D.P. Connors B.A. Summerlin P. Lee W.H. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1517-1529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that growth factors and angiotensin II may be involved in O2·¯ generation during low K intake. Further experiments are required to test these speculations. We conclude that low K intake increases O2·¯ and the related products, which in turn stimulate the expression of PTK, and that increases in PTK activity stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK channels and inhibit ROMK channel activity."

The possible thrombin regulation of geranylgeranylation, a lipid modification, of unprocessed RhoA and the significance of the geranylgeranylation in RhoA activation in endothelial cells (ECs) are not well understood. The amounts of the unprocessed and geranylgeranylated forms of RhoA in non-stimulated cultured human aortic ECs were 31 ± 8 and 69 ± 8% total cellular RhoA, respectively (n = 6, p < 0.0001), as determined by the Triton X-114 partition method. Thrombin-induced rapid conversion of most of the unprocessed RhoA into the geranylgeranylated form within 1 min through stimulating geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) activity. Thrombin-induced rapid geranylgeranylation was inhibited by acute short term (3 min) pretreatment with atorvastatin as well as by an inhibitor of GGTase I (GGTI-286). Thrombin also rapidly stimulated GTP loading of RhoA, which was blocked by acute pretreatment with either atorvastatin or GGTI-286. These observations indicate the dependence of thrombin stimulation of RhoA on the rapid geranylgeranylation of unprocessed RhoA. Importantly, the addition of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate to ECs pretreated with atorvastatin quickly reversed the atorvastatin inhibition of thrombin stimulation of RhoA. These results suggest that geranylgeranylation of unprocessed RhoA may limit thrombin-induced full activation of RhoA in ECs. Cytoskeleton analysis demonstrated that atorvastatin and GGTI-286 inhibited thrombin-induced stress fiber formation. We provide the evidence that, in thrombin-stimulated ECs, the unprocessed form of RhoA is rapidly geranylgeranylated to become the mature form, which then is converted into GTP-bound active RhoA.

Previously, we demonstrated the unusually acute effect of a statin, namely the rapid inhibition of lysophosphatidylcholine-induced RhoA activation in ECs by a statin (22Yokoyama K. Ishibashi T.

The effect of statin was mediated through its action on GGPP metabolism, because it was reversed by the addition of GGPP. However, little is known regarding how rapidly geranylgeranylation of RhoA is regulated and how important geranylgeranylation is in the regulation of RhoA activity. In this study, we investigated the rapid effect of thrombin on geranylgeranylation of RhoA, the role of geranylgeranylation in thrombin-induced RhoA activation, and the effects of a statin and a GGTase I inhibitor on geranylgeranylation and RhoA activation in ECs. Materials—The sources of most of the conventional reagents were described previously (22Yokoyama K. Ishibashi T. Ohkawara H. Kimura J. Matsuoka I. Sakamoto T. Nagata K. Sugimoto K. Sakurada S.

Atorvastatin was kindly provided by Pfizer (New York, NY). GGPP was purchased from Sigma, and GGTase I inhibitor GGTI-286 was from Calbiochem. Endothelial Cell Culture—Human aortic ECs were cultured according to the supplier's instructions (Clonetics, Inc., Walkersville, MD, and Sanko Junyaku Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (22Yokoyama K. Ishibashi T. Ohkawara H. Kimura J. Matsuoka I. Sakamoto T. Nagata K. Sugimoto K. Sakurada S. Maruyama Y.

Separation of Unprocessed and Geranylgeranylated RhoA Protein— Unprocessed RhoA and geranylgeranylated RhoA were separated by the Triton X-114 partition method as described previously (25Bordier C.

Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 200 μmol/liter GDP, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/liter Pefabloc, 20 μmol/liter each of leupeptin, aprotonin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor and then sonicated. Triton X-114 (11% (w/v)) was added to the lysates to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). The lysates were mixed for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was warmed at 37 °C for 2 min until it became cloudy and then centrifuged at 400 × g for 4 min at room temperature to separate the upper (unprocessed) phase from the lower (processed) phase. Both phases were adjusted to 1% (v/v) Triton X-114 on ice, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. The level of Rho protein in each phase was determined by Western blotting followed by densitometric analysis as described previously (22Yokoyama K. Ishibashi T. Ohkawara H. Kimura J. Matsuoka I.

A mouse monoclonal antibody to RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:500 was used for immunoblotting. The signals from immunoreactive bands were visualized with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). In addition, ECs were labeled with 5 μmol/liter [3H]GGPP (22 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) for 3 min and stimulated with or without thrombin for 1 min followed by Triton X-114 partition. The radiolabeled band was detected by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE, and using the same sample, Western blotting was performed simultaneously to determine whether the radiolabeled band was identical to RhoA.

ECs were washed with ice-cold PBS three times and lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.2, 500 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 μg/ml antipain, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, the extracts were incubated at 4 °C for 45 min with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads coupled with glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin fusion protein to determine RhoA activity. Bound RhoA proteins were quantitated by Western blotting as described above. GGTase I Activity Assay—The activity of GGTase I was determined as described previously (17Begum N. Sandu O.A. Duddy N. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2256-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Chappell J. Golovchenko I. Wall K. Stjernhoim R. Leitner J.W. Goalstone M. Draznin B. J. Biol.

ECs were treated with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 1 min in the presence or absence of GGTI-286 (3 μmol/liter) and then lysed in a buffer containing 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/liter sodium vanadate, 1 mmol/liter sodium phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 20 μmol/liter aprotonin, 20 μmol/liter leupeptin, and 50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.5. Lysates containing endogenous GGTase I from ECs treated with or without thrombin in the presence or absence of GGTI-286 were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 100 nmol/liter Ras-Cys-Val-Leu-Leu construct (Ras-CVLL) protein (Calbiochem) and 100 nmol/liter [3H]GGPP (22 mCi/mmol). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 1 mol/liter HCl in ethanol, and the mixture was filtered through a Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filter and air-dried. Labeled protein was quantified with a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). In addition, Western blotting of GGTase was performed using a polyclonal antibody to GGTase Iα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Determination of Actin Stress Fibers—The content of actin stress fibers was determined in confluent cells grown in a slide chamber (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) as described previously (31Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). ECs were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature in Triton X-100 (0.05% in PBS). The ECs then were stained for 30 min with 1 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-phalloidin in PBS. After two washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted using Dako Faramount mounting medium. Stained cells were stored in the dark until they were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Densitometric Analysis—After scanning blots into a computer (EPSON GT5500ART, Tokyo, Japan), the optical densities of individual bands in Western blots were analyzed using National Institutes of Health IMAGE program (Bethesda, MD). The area of each band analyzed was kept constant for each blot analyzed. Background density was subtracted from the densitometric data obtained for each band. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA with Scheffé's post hoc test if appropriate. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are expressed as the means ± S.D. Proportions of Unprocessed and Geranylgeranylated Forms of RhoA—Fig. 1 shows the proportions of the unprocessed and geranylgeranylated forms of RhoA in cultured human aortic ECs, as determined by the Triton X-114 partition method. The percentages of the unprocessed and the geranylgeranylated forms of RhoA in ECs were 31 ± 8 and 69 ± 8%, respectively (n = 6, p < 0.0001). Effects of Thrombin and Atorvastatin on Geranylgeranylation and GTP Loading of RhoA—Treatment with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 1 min stimulated the conversion of most of the unprocessed form of RhoA into its geranylgeranylated form (Fig. 2A, lane 2). This rapid geranylgeranylation was markedly suppressed by acute treatment with 10 μmol/liter atorvastatin for 3 min before adding thrombin (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Adding GGPP alone to ECs did not alter the levels of geranylgeranylated RhoA (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Autoradiography from the [3H]GGPP-labeling experiment showed the radiolabeled band of geranylgeranylated RhoA, which was identified by anti-RhoA antibody in Western blotting analysis, in the detergent phase in response to thrombin within 1 min (Fig. 2B). This is direct evidence that thrombin rapidly alters the level of RhoA prenylation in ECs. Pull-down analysis revealed that thrombin increased the levels of the GTP-bound form of RhoA (GTP-RhoA) within 1 min. Acute pretreatment with atorvastatin also decreased thrombin-stimulated GTP loading of RhoA by 46 ± 17% (Fig. 2C, n = 4, p < 0.005), suggesting that depletion of the geranylgeranylated form of RhoA inhibited thrombin-induced RhoA activation. Inhibition of thrombin-induced GTP loading of RhoA by atorvastatin (Fig. 2D, lane 2, n = 4, p < 0.005) was completely reversed by 5 μmol/liter GGPP (Fig. 2D, lane 3, n = 4, p < 0.005), indicating that this effect of atorvastatin was attributed to the depletion of GGPP. The GTP loading was not affected by the addition of GGPP alone (data not shown). The fact that the effect of atorvastatin on geranylgeranylation of RhoA was already evident after 3 min (Fig. 2A) suggests that the cellular GGPP pool was quite rapidly down-regulated by statin. Thus, taken together these results indicate that thrombin rapidly stimulated geranylgeranylation of the unprocessed form of RhoA as well as GDP/GTP exchange in RhoA and that the cellular level of the geranylgeranylated form of RhoA had a profound influence on thrombin-stimulated GTP loading of RhoA. In addition, atorvastatin antagonized thrombin stimulation of RhoA, at least by inhibiting its geranylgeranylation. Stimulation of GGTase I Activity in Response to Thrombin—We measured the activity of GGTase I, an enzyme responsible for geranylgeranylation of unprocessed Rho, in thrombin-stimulated ECs. Thrombin significantly increased the activity of GGTase I within 1 min, which persisted for at least 5 min (Fig. 3A, n = 5, p < 0.01). This increase in response to thrombin within 1 min was prevented by pretreatment with 3 μmol/liter GGTI-286 for 3 min (Fig. 3B, lane 3, n = 8, p < 0.005). However, atorvastatin did not significantly affect thrombin stimulation of GGTase I activity after 3 min or overnight (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 7, n = 8, p < 0.005, each). Effects of Thrombin and GGPP on Geranylgeranylation and GTP Loading in ECs Pretreated with Statin Overnight—To deplete cellular GGPP more completely, ECs were pretreated with 10 μmol/liter atorvastatin overnight. Fig. 4A shows that the percentages of the unprocessed and geranylgeranylated forms of RhoA in ECs pretreated with atorvastatin were 83 ± 12 and 17 ± 12%, respectively (n = 3, p < 0.005). Atorvastatin pretreatment overnight markedly increased the percentages of unprocessed RhoA compared with those of control cells (Figs. 1 and 4A, 83 ± 12 versus 31 ± 8%, p < 0.0001). Moreover, the thrombin-induced increase in the geranylgeranylated form of RhoA was markedly attenuated in ECs by pretreatment with atorvastatin compared with non-pretreated ECs. Namely, thrombin induced a small but significant increase in the geranylgeranylated form of RhoA from 17 ± 12% total RhoA to 36 ± 4% in statin overnight treatment (Fig. 4A, p < 0.005), although almost all of the unprocessed form of RhoA was converted into geranylgeranylated form in control ECs (Fig. 2A). Importantly, the addition of 5 μmol/liter GGPP to atorvastatin-pretreated ECs markedly increased thrombin-stimulated GTP loading within 1 min compared with thrombin stimulation, as determined by pull-down analysis (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4, n = 3, p < 0.005). Thus, these results provided further evidence that geranylgeranylation of unprocessed RhoA is required for thrombin-induced full activation of RhoA. Effect of GGTI-286 on Thrombin-induced RhoA Activation—Fig. 5A shows that pretreatment of ECs with 3 μmol/liter GGTI-286 for 3 min suppressed thrombin-induced geranylgeranylation of unprocessed RhoA, which was similar to the effect of atorvastatin (Fig. 5A). We examined the effect of GGTI-286 on thrombin-induced GTP loading of RhoA. Pull-down analysis demonstrated that pretreatment with 3 μmol/liter GGTI-286 for 3 min partially inhibited thrombin-induced RhoA activation (Fig. 5B). These observations, together with thrombin stimulation of GGTase I activity, indicate that thrombin-induced rapid geranylgeranylation of RhoA is mediated via stimulation of GGTase I and lend further support to the notion that thrombin-induced RhoA activation is dependent on rapid geranylgeranylation of RhoA. Effect of GGTI-286 and Statin on Thrombin-triggered Assembly of Actin Stress Fibers—As shown in Fig. 6, thrombin reorganized actin stress fibers in ECs within 1 min and this was suppressed by pretreatment with GGTI-286 for 3 min (Fig. 6, B and C). Atorvastatin also had a similar inhibitory effect as GGTI-286 (Fig. 6D). The addition of GGPP to ECs pretreated with atorvastatin overnight significantly increased the assembly of actin stress fibers in response to thrombin compared with thrombin stimulation alone (Fig. 6, G and H). This study provides evidence that, in response to thrombin, the unprocessed form of RhoA is rapidly geranylgeranylated to become the mature form, which is subsequently converted into GTP-bound RhoA in human aortic ECs. It has been reported that, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, and vascular smooth muscle cells, ∼35–45% total cellular RhoA is in the geranylgeranylated mature form (17Begum N.

However, little is known regarding the proportions of the unprocessed and geranylgeranylated forms of RhoA in ECs. Therefore, we first determined the amounts of the unprocessed and geranylgeranylated forms of RhoA in cultured human aortic ECs using the Triton X-114 partition method. The cellular geranylgeranylated form of RhoA includes both the inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms. Our results showed that there was twice as much of the geranylgeranylated form of RhoA (69 ± 8% total cellular RhoA) than the unprocessed form (Fig. 1, 31 ± 8%). Overnight treatment with atorvastatin induced an increase in the amount of the unprocessed form of RhoA from 31 ± 8to83 ± 12% (Fig. 4A). This finding is consistent with the report by Liu et al. (34Liu L. Moesner P. Kovach N.L. Bailey R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Harlan J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28793-28798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) showed that thrombin phosphorylated p115RhoGEF in human umbilical vein ECs within 1 min. However, they did not determine whether thrombin stimulated the geranylgeranylation of unprocessed RhoA. We examined the effect of thrombin on geranylgeranylation of the unprocessed form of RhoA as determined by the Triton X-114 partition with labeling ECs with [3H]GGPP and GGTase I assay. Thrombin rapidly stimulated geranylgeranylation of unprocessed RhoA with a concomitant rapid increase in cellular GGTase I activity, resulting in nearly total conversion of the unprocessed form into the geranylgeranylated form of RhoA within 1 min (Figs. 2, A and B, and 3). Thrombin also increased the level of the GTP-bound active form of RhoA within 1 min (Fig. 2C). Conversion of the unprocessed form into the mature geranylgeranylated form was necessary for thrombin-induced full activation of RhoA, because either depletion of GGPP by atorvastatin or inhibition of GGTase I with GGTI-286, both of which inhibited thrombin-induced generation of the geranylgeranylated form from the unprocessed form, substantially decreased thrombin-induced GTP loading of RhoA (Figs. 2, A and C, and 5). These results strongly suggest that the unprocessed form of RhoA (GDP-RhoA) is made available for the GDP/GTP exchange reaction through its geranylgeranylation in response to thrombin. This idea was supported by the observation that the replenishment of GGPP in atorvastatin-treated ECs in which cellular GGPP was depleted effectively reversed the response to thrombin with respect to RhoA activation (Fig. 2D). Of particular note, the addition of GGPP to ECs treated with atorvastatin overnight in which GGPP was depleted profoundly dramatically reversed the thrombin stimulation of GTP loading and actin stress fiber formation in a relatively short time (3 min) (Figs. 4B and 6). These observations clearly indicate that thrombin rapidly stimulates geranylgeranylation of the unprocessed immature form of RhoA, resulting in an increase in the amount of the geranylgeranylated form, which is efficiently converted into the GTP-bound active form by the stimulated activity of a GEF. This study provides information regarding the cellular pools of the unprocessed form of RhoA and GGPP in ECs. Acute treatment with thrombin induced a rapid conversion of almost all of the unprocessed form of RhoA into the geranylgeranylated form in ECs. Depletion of cellular GGPP by a statin and inhibition of GGTase I by GGTI-286 with treatments for short times (3 min) almost completely reversed the conversion. This finding suggests that the cellular pools of unprocessed RhoA and GGPP may be relatively small in ECs. Previously, we reported that, within 1 min, lysophosphatidylcholine rapidly increased GTP-bound RhoA in membrane fractions in cultured human aortic ECs. This was inhibited by a statin, and GGPP reversed the suppressive effect of a statin on RhoA activation induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (11Hall A.

Consistent with the rapid conversion of unprocessed RhoA into the geranylgeranylated form in response to thrombin, we observed that thrombin significantly increased the activity of GGTase I in ECs for up to 5 min (Fig. 3A). Overnight treatment with atorvastatin markedly increased the amount of the unprocessed form of RhoA by dramatically depleting GGPP (Fig. 4A). However, atorvastatin did not alter the activity of GGTase I with or without thrombin stimulation compared with control (Fig. 3B), suggesting a negligible effect of endogenous amount of GGPP on GGTase I activity. In addition, Western blotting showed that thrombin did not change the amounts of GGTase I within 5 min compared with control (data not shown). These results suggest that thrombin increased the specific activity of GGTase I, resulting in the alteration of prenylation in ECs. Our results also demonstrated distinct pathways of GGTI-286 and statin inhibition of geranylgeranylation (Fig. 3). Specifically, the statin depleted the isoprenoid essential for geranylgeranylation, whereas GGTI-286 inhibited the enzyme that catalyzes geranylgeranylation. Begum et al. (17Begum N. Sandu O.A. Duddy N. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2256-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that thrombin promoted GGTase I activity and increased the proportion of geranylgeranylated RhoA by ∼15% in smooth muscle cells. However, they did not show the profile of unprocessed and geranylgeranylated forms of RhoA in response to thrombin. In this study, thrombin increased the amount of the geranylgeranylated form of RhoA from 69 to almost 100% (Figs. 1 and 2, A and B). Pretreatment with GGTI-286 for 3 min almost totally prevented the rapid geranylgeranylation and partially inhibited thrombin-induced GTP loading of RhoA, similar to atorvastatin (Fig. 5, A and B). These observations strongly suggest that geranylgeranylation is a rate-limiting step in thrombin-induced activation of unprocessed GDP-RhoA in ECs. We also examined the time course of conversion of unprocessed RhoA into the geranylgeranylated form and GTP loading. After 60 min of thrombin stimulation, the mature geranylgeranylated RhoA remained at a high level, whereas the level of active GTP form of RhoA markedly fell compared with 1 min of stimulation (data not shown). Consistent with the result of the GGTase I assay, these findings suggest that thrombin-induced geranylgeranylation of RhoA is sustained and that the increase in prenylation level may act as a memory of thrombin action. The data also may suggest that there is no significant stimulation of de-prenylating activity, at least within 60 min in response to thrombin in ECs. However, the issue of de-prenylating activity needs to be resolved. Cytoskeleton analysis clearly demonstrated that acute treatment with thrombin induced the assembly of actin stress fibers and that this was partially reversed by the inhibition of geranylgeranylation with GGTI-286 or atorvastatin for 3 min (Fig. 6), suggesting that rapid activation of unprocessed RhoA may play an important role in the cytoskeletal reorganization, which contributes to endothelial activation. In conclusion, we provide evidence that unprocessed GDP-RhoA is rapidly activated in response to thrombin in ECs. We suggest that inhibition of this rapid activation may be a strategy for treating endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular disease."

Human ferric Mb binds ·NO to yield nitrosylheme and S-nitroso (S-NO) Mb (Witting, P. K., Douglas, D. J., and Mauk, A. G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3991–3998). Here we show that human ferrous oxy-myoglobin (oxyMb) oxidizes ·NO, with a second order rate constant k = 2.8 ± 0.1 × 107m–1·s–1 as determined by stopped-flow spectroscopy. Mixtures containing oxyMb and S-nitrosoglutathione or S-nitrosocysteine added at 1.5–2 moles of S-nitrosothiol/mol oxyMb yielded S-NO oxyMb through trans-nitrosation equilibria as confirmed with mass spectrometry. Rate constants for the equilibrium reactions were kforward = 110 ± 3 and kreverse = 16 ± 3 m–1·s–1 for S-nitrosoglutathione and kforward = 293 ± 5 and kreverse = 20 ± 2 m–1·s–1 for S-nitrosocysteine. Incubation of S-NO oxyMb with Cu2+ ions stimulated ·NO release as measured with a ·NO electrode. Similarly, Cu2+ released ·NO from Mb immunoprecipitated from cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that were pre-treated with diethylaminenonoate. No ·NO release was observed from VSMCs treated with vehicle alone or immunoprecipitates obtained from porcine aortic endothelial cells with and without diethylaminenonoate treatment. Importantly, pre-constricted aortic rings relaxed in the presence of S-NO oxyMb in a cyclic GMP-dependent process. These data indicate that human oxyMb rapidly oxidizes ·NO and that biologically relevant S-nitrosothiols can trans-(S)nitrosate human oxyMb. Furthermore, S-NO oxyMb can be isolated from cultured human VSMCs exposed to an exogenous ·NO donor at physiologic concentration. The potential biologic implications of S-NO oxyMb acting as a source of ·NO are discussed. Nitric oxide (·NO) regulates vascular function, and myoglobin (Mb) is a heme protein present in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, where it facilitates O2 transfer. Human ferric Mb binds ·NO to yield nitrosylheme and S-nitroso (S-NO) Mb (Witting, P. K., Douglas, D. J., and Mauk, A. G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3991–3998).

Furthermore, S-NO oxyMb can be isolated from cultured human VSMCs exposed to an exogenous ·NO donor at physiologic concentration. The potential biologic implications of S-NO oxyMb acting as a source of ·NO are discussed. Endothelium-derived ·NO, generated through the action of nitric-oxide synthase(s) on l-arginine, plays a vital role in blood vessel dilation and thereby in the regulation of peripheral vascular resistance and ultimately circulating blood pressure (1Furchgott R.F.

Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Synthesized cGMP activates a cascade of effector proteins that initiates VSMC relaxation and thereby promotes vessel dilation.The heme protein myoglobin (Mb) is present in cardiac, skeletal, and human smooth muscle (5Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 857-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 6Qiu Y. Sutton L. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23426-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle, the concentration of Mb ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 mm (5Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 857-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), whereas the precise concentration of Mb in smooth muscle is not known. The role of intracellular Mb is generally accepted as that of a passive di-oxygen storage protein that facilitates di-oxygen transfer from the extra- to intracellular space. However, in vitro studies have shown that oxygenated ferrous Mb (oxyMb) also rapidly reacts with dissolved ·NO gas (k = 107m–1·s–1) to yield higher order N-oxides such as nitrate (7Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1981; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In addition, both ferrous deoxy and ferric Mb form stable heme-NO complexes (Mb·NO) with dissolved ·NO gas (dissociation constant Kd = 10–5m) (8Kalyanaraman B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 168-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these chemical reactions have the potential to effectively eliminate ·NO within its expected lifetime in biological systems, suggesting that Mb could play an active role in maintaining ·NO homeostasis. Indeed, there is support for this notion. For example, Mb limits the extent of ·NO-induced inactivation of cytochrome c oxidase (9Brunori M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Also, conversion of ferrous to ferric Mb regulates the myocardial concentration of ·NO (10Flögel U. Merx M.W. Gödecke A. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), which is crucial for maintaining overall heart function, coronary blood flow, and contractility, processes that are more severely affected by ·NO in mice lacking Mb compared with wild-type animals (10Flögel U. Merx M.W. Gödecke A. Decking U.K. Schrader J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Thus, the focus for Mb has shifted from O2 transport to a central regulatory role in ·NO homeostasis (11Brunori M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 290-292Google Scholar).An intriguing feature of human Mb is that it possesses a reactive cysteine residue (Cys110) (12Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Lambright D.G. Boxer S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20391-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions, Cys110 reacts with ·NO to yield S-NO Mb (14Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3991-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), similar to S-NO Hb (15Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Unlike Hb, however, for which nitrosation is dependent on the allosteric (R-T) transition (16Patel R. Hogg N. Spencer N.Y. Kalyanaraman B. Matalon S. Darley-Usmar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15487-15492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the degree of Mb oxygen saturation does not affect accessibility of the Cys110 for S-nitrosation, as judged by comparable x-ray crystal structures of ferric and ferrous Mb bound to a diatomic ligand (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 17Yang F. Phillips G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).Under physiologic conditions, cytochrome b5 reductase maintains Mb in the reduced state for oxygenation to yield oxyMb (18Hagler L. Coppes R.I. Herman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6505-6514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear at present whether S-nitrosation of ferrous oxyMb is feasible under physiologic conditions, although one would expect oxyMb to rapidly oxidize ·NO based on the high rate constant for the reaction of oxyMb and dissolved ·NO gas (19Zhang Y. Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Herein we demonstrate that Cys110S-nitrosation of human ferrous oxyMb (the predominant physiologic form of the protein) occurs through trans-nitrosation equilibria reactions with low molecular mass S-nitrosothiols (RS-NO), that ·NO released from S-NO oxyMb can dilate pre-constricted vessels similar to authentic endothelium-derived relaxant factor, and that Mb immunoprecipitated from VSMCs pre-treated with an ·NO donor can release ·NO.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Trypsin, Triton X-100, phenylephrine, urea, EDTA, DTPA, tryptone, copper(II)sulfate, acrylamide, ammonium persulfate, sodium dodecylsulfate, reduced glutathione (GSH), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), cysteine, and yeast extract were obtained from Sigma. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was obtained from Fisher Scientific. Diethylaminenonoate (DeaNO; a chemical source of ·NO) and 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazole(4,3-a)-quinoxalin-1-one were obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI), and authentic ·NO gas was obtained from BOC Gases (Sydney, Australia). Buffers were prepared from Nanopure water and stored over Chelex-100® (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C to remove contaminating transition metals (20Buettner G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Except for isolated vessel studies, DTPA and EDTA (final concentrations, 100 μm) were added to all reaction mixtures to minimize the possibility of metal-mediated decay of RS-NO (21Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1478-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Solvents and all other chemicals employed were of the highest quality available.Animals—New Zealand White rabbits (2.5–3 kg) were obtained from a commercial farm (Wauchope, New South Wales, Australia) and housed individually for the entire study period. Rabbits received normal chow with feed and water provided ad libitum for an acclimation period of 2 weeks. Local ethics committee approval was obtained before commencing the study.Cell Culture—Cultured primary human VSMCs (American Type Culture Collection) and porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs; Cell Applications) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (JRH Biosciences) and M199 media, respectively. All media preparations were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2(g). Culture media for PAECs also contained 50 μg/ml heparin sulfate. For experiments, VSMCs and PAECs were cultured to 90–100% confluence and used between passage 5 and 8.Preparation of Recombinant Wild-type and C110A Variant Human Mb—DNA manipulations were performed as described previously (22Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 329-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the Mb sequence were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis before protein expression in bacteria. Once the sequence was confirmed, the BamHI-HindIII fragment from the amplified DNA, which also contained the mutant Mb coding, was ligated to the BamHI-HindIII fragment from the pMb3 vector to yield the expression vector (12Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Lambright D.G. Boxer S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that was later transformed to the appropriate cell line for protein expression as described previously (23Witting P.K. Mauk A.G. Lay P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11495-11503Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Preparations of purified wild-type and C110A variant of human Mb were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C before use. All preparations exhibited a A409/A280 ratio of peak absorbance of 5 (data not shown), indicative of the purity of the protein preparations.Preparation of S-NO oxyMb—Recombinant human oxyMb was prepared by chemical reduction of the recombinant human ferric Mb with a 2-fold excess of DTT and stirring under an atmosphere of air for 10 min. Residual DTT was removed from the preparation by three successive gel filtration columns (PD-10 pre-packed column; Amersham Biosciences). Formation of oxyMb was confirmed by electronic absorbance spectroscopy with characteristic absorptions at 543 and 580 nm. Samples of recombinant human oxyMb were then treated with either S-nitrosoglutathione (GS-NO) or S-nitrosocysteine (CYS-NO) (final concentration of added RS-NO < 2 mol/mol oxyMb) dispersed in phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7) and then left to equilibrate in the dark at 20 °C. Stock solutions of GS-NO or CYS-NO were prepared immediately before use as described previously (24Simon D.I. Mullins M.E. Jia L. Gaston B. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). After 60 min of equilibration, excess low molecular mass RS-NO was removed by repeated size exclusion chromatography. For samples designated for mass analyses, S-NO oxyMb was purified with simultaneous change of buffer to Nanopure water containing 100 μm DTPA (high salt concentrations yield protein adducts that affect mass determinations). Finally, S-nitrosation of oxyMb was confirmed by an increased absorbance at ∼A330 (ϵ333 nm = 3667 m–1·cm–1 (14Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3991-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) and verified unambiguously by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (see below). Samples of S-NO oxyMb were maintained in the dark and used within 5 min of purification.Stopped-flow Kinetic Measurements—Where required, saturated solutions of authentic ·NO gas were prepared, and the concentration of dissolved gas was standardized as described previously (14Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3991-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Kinetic determinations for the reaction of oxyMb with dissolved ·NO gas were performed with an Applied Photophysics SX-17 MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer as described previously (23Witting P.K. Mauk A.G. Lay P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11495-11503Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Typically, 250 time-dependent spectra (logarithmic time base; integration, 2.56 ms; dead time, ∼2 ms; λ = 350–750 nm; resolution, 1 nm) were collected at 25 °C. Kinetic data were processed using Pro-Kineticist global analysis software (Pro-Kineticist version 4.1; Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK), as described previously (25Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Apparent rate constants (kobs) were then determined by linear regression.Mass Analyses—Where required, molecular mass was measured routinely for native and modified Mb by ESI-MS as described in detail elsewhere (14Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3991-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, mass spectra were acquired using a hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples (∼10 pmol, 1 μl) were dissolved in water:acetonitrile (∼20:80) and loaded into nanospray needles (Proxeon), and the tip was positioned ∼10 mm from the orifice. Nitrogen was used as curtain gas, and a potential of +800 V was applied to the needle. Next, time-of-flight scan was acquired (m/z 50–2000, 1 s) and accumulated for ∼1 min into a single file. These conditions favor the detection of Mb apoprotein due to unfolding of the tertiary structure and loss of the heme prosthetic group (26Hunter C.L. Mauk A.G. Douglas D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mass accuracy of the system was tested routinely before use. Mass values were obtained by standard fitting analyses of the various m/z distributions.Measurement of ·NO from RS-NO—Release of ·NO from a range of low molecular mass or proteinaceous RS-NO was monitored by a ·NO-selective electrode (ISO-NO MII; World Precision Instruments Inc.) coupled with a DUO-18™ data recorder (v1.55; World Precision Instruments Inc.). Briefly, the electrode was pre-equilibrated in phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing 100 μm copper(II)sulfate (Cu2+) under an atmosphere of argon gas. Authentic RS-NO (or immunoprecipitate obtained from VSMCs or PAECs) was added to the solution, and the time-dependent increase in current was monitored until the current stabilized. Area under the peak response curve was estimated with integration software supplied with the data recording system. The amount of ·NO liberated from the various RS-NO was then compared with a standard curve generated using authentic GS-NO (solution concentration standardized with ϵ366 nm = 770 m–1·cm–1) prepared as described previously (24Simon D.I. Mullins M.E. Jia L. Gaston B. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Standard curves were generated before commencement of individual experiments to verify electrode function and to account for the day-to-day variation in electrode response factor.Assessment of Vessel Relaxation—Vessel bioassays were performed with a vessel myobath (WPI, Coherent, Australia) as described in detail elsewhere (27Keaney Jr., J.F. Gaziano J.M. Xu A. Frei B. Curran-Celentano J. Shwaery G.T. Loscalzo J. Vita J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 844-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbit aortic rings were suspended in organ chambers and incubated in Krebs buffer with constant degassing (Carbogen gas mixture, 5% CO2, 95% O2) for 30 min. After equilibration, rings were pre-constricted with an increasing dose of phenylephrine. Next, the rings were washed thoroughly to allow complete relaxation and then pre-constricted with a dose of phenylephrine to yield half the maximal constriction force value. Vessel relaxation was assayed in response to SNP (positive control), S-NO oxyMb (prepared by transnitrosation with CYS-NO), and the oxyC110A variant of human Mb pre-treated with CYS-NO in identical fashion to wild-type oxyMb (negative control), and dilation was expressed as a percentage of the preconstriction force value. In some studies, vessels were denuded of the endothelium by gently applying the blunt end of a surgical tweezer to the inner surface of the aortic ring. This procedure had no effect on constriction to phenylepherine, although it eliminated the vessel response to the endothelium-dependent agonist acetylcholine (data not shown).Preparation of Aortic Homogenates for cGMP Assessment—To determine tissue cGMP, aortic rings were first incubated at 37 °C in Krebs buffer supplemented with 200 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Next, the rings were exposed to the various vasoactive agents for 15 min, removed from the myobath and immediately cut into small pieces, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and finally pulverized into a powder with a mortar and pestle. The powdered tissue was then transferred to a glass tube and diluted with 2 ml of DPBS containing 5 μm butylated hydroxy-toluene, 2 mm EDTA, 200 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and Complete® protease inhibitors mixture added as per the manufacturer's instruction (Roche Applied Science). The tissue was then homogenized with a rotating piston and matching Teflon-lined tube as described previously (28Suarna C. Dean R.T. May J. Stocker R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1616-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Samples of homogenate (50 μl) were removed for protein determination (BCA assay; Sigma), and the remainder was employed for tissue cGMP determinations using a commercial kit (Cayman Chemical).Monitoring Accumulation of the Native Human Mb and Its Homodimer—Where required, reaction mixtures employed for ·NO evolution studies were subsequently analyzed for the accumulation of a Mb disulfide dimer (expected mass, 34,107 atomic mass units) by SDS-PAGE and after staining with Coomassie Blue as described previously (13Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20391-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Where required, selected samples were also pre-incubated with DTT to reduce disulfide cross-links.In some experiments, confluent cultured human VSMCs or PAECs (∼3–5 × 106 cells) were washed thoroughly with HPSS prepared as described previously (29Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), overlaid with HPSS, and treated without (vehicle alone, control) or with DeaNO administered at final concentration of 100 nm or 10 μm (corresponding to a rate of ·NO release of 0.6 or 60 nm·s–1, respectively, as determined from the half-life (t½) = 2 min at 37 °C indicated by the manufacturer). Control and ·NO-treated cells were harvested after a 5- or 60-min incubation, washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered (50 mm, pH 6.5) lysis solution containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, a Complete® mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and 100 μm DTPA. Next, cells were lysed by repeated (3×) freeze-thaw and centrifuged (15,000 rpm), and the supernatant was treated with monoclonal anti-human Mb antibody (final dilution, 1:500 (v/v); Sigma) followed by addition of G-protein-linked Sepharose (Sigma) to yield immunoprecipitates of cytosolic Mb. The presence of Mb in isolated immunoprecipitates was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and tested for stored ·NO using the ·NO-selective electrode in the presence of 100 μm Cu2+. Suitable controls included generation of immunoprecipitate samples with PAECs and G-protein-linked Sepharose in the presence and absence of Mb antibody.Kinetics of Human oxyMb Trans-nitrosation by Added RS-NO—The consumption of GS-NO or CYS-NO and concomitant accumulation of their corresponding reduced thiol forms were monitored time-dependently in the presence of human oxyMb using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously (30Jourd'heuil D. Hallen K. Feelisch M. Grisham M.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), with minor modification. Briefly, 25 μm oxyMb was treated with 2-fold molar excess of GS-NO or CYS-NO in the presence of 100 μm DTPA, and the reaction mixture was equilibrated in the dark at 20 °C. Reaction mixtures were sampled at regular intervals over 60 min as indicated in the figures. Samples were then treated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 4% (v/v)) to precipitate the protein and centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed using a LC-18 column (5 μm, 25 × 0.46 cm) eluted at 0.6 ml/min with a 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 50 μm DTPA and monitored at 214 nm for RS-NO and reduced thiols. Retention times for the various analytes were as follows: GSH, 5.1 min; GS-NO, 7.4 min; cysteine, 4.9 min; and CYS-NO, 5.8 min. The peak absorbance with retention time 7.8 min was present in all preparations of GS-NO and showed no increase in area in the presence of human oxyMb (data not shown). Reduced thiols were standardized using authentic commercial samples (GSH and cysteine), whereas corresponding RS-NO was generated and standardized as described previously (24Simon D.I. Mullins M.E. Jia L. Gaston B. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Where required, rate constants were determined by data fitting with a curve generated as described previously (31Hogg N. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and using Prism software version 3.0 (GraphPad Software).Electronic Absorption Spectra—Where required, steady-state concentrations of ferric Mb, oxyMb, and nitrosyl-Mb solutions prepared from recombinant human Mb in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were quantified using the appropriate extinction values (ϵ409 nm = 153 (32Ikeda-Saito M. Hori H. Andersson L.A. Prince R.C. Pickering I.J. George G.N. Sanders II, C.R. Lutz R.S. McKelvey E.J. Mattera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22843-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ϵ580 nm = 14.4, and ϵ576 nm = 10.5 mm–1 cm–1 (19Zhang Y. Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar), respectively). Quantitative absorbance spectroscopy was performed with a multi-well plate reader (Model 550; Bio-Rad) or with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-1601; Shimadzu).Statistical Analyses—Statistical differences in relaxation response obtained from the vessel studies were determined with one-way analysis of variance analyses. Student's t tests were performed to determine significant changes between data sets, with Welch's correction employed for unequal variances where appropriate. In all cases, statistical significance was accepted at the 95% confidence interval (p < 0.05).RESULTSThe second order rate constant for the reaction of oxyMb with dissolved ·NO gas has been determined for a various mammalian Mb, and ranges between ∼0.3 and 4.4 × 107m–1·s–1 (7Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1981; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 19Zhang Y. Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34Herold S. Exner M. Nauser T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3385-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, mixing recombinant human oxyMb with increasing concentrations of ·NO resulted in the rapid, dose-dependent conversion of ferrous oxyMb to ferric Mb (Fig. 1, A and B). Global simulation of the data afforded estimates for the observed rate constant of 2.8 ± 0.1 × 107m–1·s–1 with a linear fit of R2 = 0.98 (Fig. 1C). Parallel steady-state product analyses indicated a rapid and near stoichiometric conversion of oxyMb to ferric Mb with increasing dose of the chemical ·NO donor (DeaNO), as estimated by electronic absorbance spectroscopy (Fig. 2). Interestingly, ferric nitrosyl-Mb (Mb·NO) formed in relatively minor yields at ≥1 mol of the chemical ·NO donor per mole of oxyMb (Fig. 2). In contrast to this rapid conversion of oxyMb to ferric Mb by DeaNO, addition in the dark of GS-NO or CYS-NO (data not shown) to human oxyMb at <2 mol RS-NO/mol oxyMb did not promote significant oxyMb oxidation (Fig. 2). Notably, Mb·NO was not detected (limit of detection, ∼0.1 μm) over the dose range of RS-NO employed. Increasing the ratio of added RS-NO to >2 mol RS-NO/mol oxyMb significantly increased the extent of oxyMb oxidation, indicating that free ·NO was released from RS-NO despite the presence of the metal chelating agents EDTA and DTPA. Alternatively, RS-NO may be oxidized directly by ferrous deoxyMb, present in preparations of oxyMb, in analogy to the oxidation of GS-NO by ferrous deoxyhemoglobin (35Spencer N.Y. Zeng H. Patel R.P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36562-36567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, addition of the corresponding concentration of GSH or cysteine alone did not affect rates of oxyMb autoxidation (data not shown). Subsequently, all trans-nitrosation reactions were performed with RS-NO in low excess relative to oxyMb (∼1.5–2 mol RS-NO/mol oxyMb), to optimize the yield of S-NO oxyMb.Fig. 2Human oxyMb is oxidized in near stoichiometric fashion to ferric Mb by increasing dose of the ·NO-donor DeaNO but not added GS-NO. OxyMb (25 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7) was treated with DeaNO (filled symbols) or GS-NO (open symbols) at the ·NO/Mb molar rat"

This pathway is believed to use Ca2+-dependent local interactions among IP3 receptors (IP3R) and other Ca2+ channels leading to coordinated Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell and coupling Ca2+ entry and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake to Ca2+ release. To evaluate the role of IP3 in the local control mechanisms that support the propagation of [Ca2+]c waves, store-operated Ca2+ entry, and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, we used two IP3-binding proteins (IP3BP): 1) the PH domain of the phospholipase C-like protein, p130 (p130PH); and 2) the ligand-binding domain of the human type-I IP3R (IP3R224–605). As expected, p130PH-GFP and GFP-IP3R224–605 behave as effective mobile cytosolic IP3 buffers. In COS-7 cells, the expression of IP3BPs had no effect on store-operated Ca2+ entry. However, the IP3-linked [Ca2+]c signal appeared as a regenerative wave and IP3BPs slowed down the wave propagation. Most importantly, IP3BPs largely inhibited the mitochondrial [Ca2+] signal and decreased the relationship between the [Ca2+]c and mitochondrial [Ca2+] signals, indicating disconnection of the mitochondria from the [Ca2+]c signal. These data suggest that IP3 elevations are important to regulate the local interactions among IP3Rs during propagation of [Ca2+]c waves and that the IP3-dependent synchronization of Ca2+ release events is crucial for the coupling between Ca2+ release and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.

Appropriate exposure of the effectors to Ca2+ throughout the cell is supported by several mechanisms that include the propagation of Ca2+ release throughout the cell without attenuation, the recruitment of Ca2+ entry, and efficient delivery of the [Ca2+]c signal into organelles such as the nucleus and mitochondria (1.Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4064) Google Scholar). Spreading of the [Ca2+]c signal is facilitated by regenerative mechanisms of Ca2+ mobilization, which may derive from interactions between adjacent Ca2+ release sites. Non-metabolizable IP3 analogs have been found to evoke [Ca2+]c oscillations, providing support to the idea that at a constant [IP3] Ca2+ released through IP3Rs is sufficient to trigger regenerative Ca2+ release via binding to and activating IP3Rs and ryanodine receptors (RyR) (2.Wakui M. Potter B.V. Petersen O.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Based on IP3 microinjection and uncaging studies, the regenerative Ca2+ release during [Ca2+]c waves was also claimed to be largely independent of [IP3] (3.Lechleiter J.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 283-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 4.Callamaras N. Marchant J.S. Sun X.P. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 81-91Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Along this line, IP3R-mediated [Ca2+]c waves were observed in the absence of any stimulated IP3 formation (5.Rooney T.A. Renard D.C. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12272-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, released Ca2+ may also promote phospholipase C (PLC) activation and, in turn, increase IP3, providing a potential amplification mechanism for IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release waves (6.Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P. Paranjape S. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1991; 251: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 7.Young K.W. Nash M.S. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 20: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Ca2+ may activate the PLC coupled to the agonist receptor to stimulate cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the plasma membrane.

Lucocq J.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) in intracellular membranes has also been documented. IP3 formed at the plasma membrane may rapidly diffuse throughout the cytoplasm (12.Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar), but the presence of PIP2 and PLC in the vicinity of the IP3R could also provide for a local IP3 feedback. Thus, the role of IP3 fluctuations in Ca2+ wave propagation requires further investigation. Recharging of the ER Ca2+ stores during the agonist-induced [Ca2+]c signal involves Ca2+ entry mediated by so-called store-operated Ca2+-entry mechanisms that might be mediated by the canonical transient receptor potential channel family (13.Putney Jr., J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One of the proposed mechanisms for activation of Ca2+ entry during Ca2+ release is a conformational coupling between IP3Rs and store-operated Ca2+ channels (14.Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although store-operated Ca2+ entry is activated by agents that directly target the ER Ca2+ store (15.Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 547: 333-348Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16.Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), IP3 binding to the IP3R has been claimed to have a role in activation of Ca2+ entry (17.Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 18.Ma H.T. Venkatachalam K. Rys-Sikora K.E. He L.P. Zheng F. Gill D.L. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the question of whether an increase in [IP3] is required for the channel activation remains elusive. IP3-induced [Ca2+] spikes are also delivered to the mitochondria to control the activity of several enzymes that participate in ATP production as well as that of other proteins compartmentalized to the matrix space (19.Jouaville L.S. Pinton P. Bastianutto C. Rutter G.A. Rizzuto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13807-13812Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 20.Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B.

Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites display low affinity toward Ca2+ and appear to respond mostly to the large local [Ca2+]c transients that occur in the vicinity of the activated IP3Rs and RyRs (21.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 22.Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G.

Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar), but a rapid mode of Ca2+ uptake at relatively low [Ca2+] has also been documented (25.Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27510-27515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A local interaction between RyRs and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites may secure that even fundamental Ca2+ release events (Ca2+ sparks) induce a [Ca2+]m increase in the neighboring mitochondrion (Ca2+ mark) (26.Pacher P. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2380-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, a substantially larger [Ca2+]m rise occurs during a global [Ca2+]c signal, suggesting that numerous Ca2+ release events cooperate with each other to establish a [Ca2+]m signal in a mitochondrion. At the ER-mitochondrial interface, great quantities of IP3Rs have been visualized and enrichment in ER Ca2+ pumps and mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporters is probable (reviewed in Refs. 27.Rizzuto, R., Duchen, M. R., and Pozzan, T. (2004) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2004/53/re1Google Scholar and 28.Hajnoczky G. Csordas G. Madesh M. Pacher P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 69-81Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Morphology of the ER-mitochondrial associations and concentration of the Ca2+ transporters at the interface may play a role in controlling coordinated activation of the individual Ca2+ release events that give rise to the IP3-linked [Ca2+]m spikes. Thus, the role of IP3 in coordination of Ca2+ release events is of great interest in a variety of Ca2+ signaling mechanisms. We reasoned that mobile IP3 buffers should be useful to test the role of IP3 in [Ca2+]c wave propagation, activation of Ca2+ entry, and in IP3R-dependent activation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. An intensely investigated IP3-binding module is the IP3-binding domain of the IP3R. The N-terminal cytoplasmic region of the human type-I IP3R (residues 1–604) binds IP3 with comparable affinity to the full-length IP3R (29.Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Removal of residues 1–223 (suppressor region) further increases the affinity for IP3 (30.Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Expression of IP3R224–605 has been shown to attenuate the ATP-induced [Ca2+]c signal in human embryonic kidney 293 and in COS-7 cells (31.Varnai P. Lin X. Lee S.B. Tuymetova G. Bondeva T. Spat A.

Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8106-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Another structurally unrelated IP3-binding module is the PH domain of certain proteins. Some PH domains are known to bind IP3 and/or PIP2, for example, the PH domains of PLCδ1 and the PLC-like 130-kDa protein (p130). p130 was isolated from rat brain as an IP3BP (33.Kanematsu T. Takeya H. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Yoshida M. Koga T. Iwanaga S. Hirata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6518-6525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to be important in the signaling by GABAA receptors (34.Kanematsu T. Jang I.S. Yamaguchi T. Nagahama H.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). p130 shares 38.2% sequence homology to PLC-δ1 but lacks catalytic activity. The PH domain of p130 (residues 95–233) has also been shown to inhibit the [Ca2+]c signal evoked by IP3-linked agonists (31.Varnai P. Lin X. Lee S.B. Tuymetova G. Bondeva T. Spat A. Rhee S.G.

Our main objective was to evaluate the possible role of fluctuations of IP3 in the spatio-temporal organization of the calcium signal, utilizing IP3R224–605 and p130PH. Our results indicate that these two proteins are freely distributed in the cytosol, inhibit Ca2+ release induced by suboptimal IP3 but do not suppress Ca2+ release evoked by sensitization of the IP3R to IP3, and fail to attenuate non-IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release. Thus, IP3R224–605 and p130PH act as mobile cytosolic IP3 buffers. IP3R224–605 and p130PH were used next to explore the effects of IP3 buffering on the propagation of IP3-linked [Ca2+]c waves, store depletion-induced Ca2+ entry, and on [Ca2+]c signal propagation to the mitochondria. Our studies reveal that buffering of IP3 leads to a decrease in the velocity of [Ca2+]c waves and can effectively uncouple [Ca2+]m from the [Ca2+]c signal in the cell. DNA Constructs and Recombinant Proteins—The constructs encoding the fusion proteins of the PH domain of PLCδ1 or of the p130 protein and the (1,4,5)IP3-binding domain (residues 224–605) of the human type-I (1,4,5)IP3 receptor with cyan, green, or yellow fluorescent protein have been described previously (31.Varnai P. Lin X. Lee S.B. Tuymetova G. Bondeva T. Spat A. Rhee S.G. Hajnoczky G. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27412-27422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, the PH domain of p130 and the R134L mutant were also inserted into a plasmid encoding a monomeric red fluorescent protein (RFP-p130PH and RFP-p130PH-R134L) (36.Campbell R.E. Tour O.

Bacterial expression of the GFP-fused protein domains (p130PH-GFP, GFP-IP3R224–605, and GFP-PLCδ1PH R40L) was carried out as described previously (31.Varnai P. Lin X. Lee S.B. Tuymetova G. Bondeva T.

Cell Culture—COS-7 cells (obtained from ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in humidified air (5% CO2) at 37 °C. RBL-2H3 cells were cultured as described previously (22.Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). For imaging experiments, cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-treated glass coverslips at a density of 20,000–25,000/cm2 and were grown for 3–4 days. For cell suspension studies, cells were cultured for 4–6 days in 75-cm2 flasks. Transfection of Cells—Cells plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were transfected with plasmid DNA (1.5 μg/ml) for 6–12 h using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were observed 24–36 h after transfection. Measurement of [3H]IP3—COS-7 cells (5 × 104 cells/ml) were cultured on 12-well culture dishes for 1 day and transfected with either the RFP-p130PH or RFP-p130PH-R134L construct. After 24 h, cells were labeled in 0.75-ml inositol-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 0.1% BSA, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and myo-[3H]inositol (20 μCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) for 24 h. After two washes, cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C before stimulation with 50 μm ATP for the indicated times. Incubations were terminated by the addition of ice-cold perchloric acid (5% final). Inositol phosphates were extracted and separated on high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (38.Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The (1,4,5)IP3 and (1,3,4)IP3 values were combined. Fluorescence Imaging Measurements in Intact COS-7 Cells—Before use, the cells were preincubated in an extracellular medium (2% BSA/ECM) consisting of 121 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Na-HEPES, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 2% BSA, pH 7.4. To monitor [Ca2+]c and to measure Mn2+ entry (Mn2+ quench), cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM for 20–30 min in the presence of 200 μm sulfinpyrazone and 0.003% (w/v) pluronic acid at room temperature. Sulfinpyrazone was also present during the imaging measurements to minimize dye loss. To monitor [Ca2+]m, cells were loaded with 5 μm rhod2/AM for 50 min in the presence of 0.003% (w/v) pluronic acid at 35 °C. After loading, cells were washed and incubated in the same medium containing 0.25% BSA but no Ca2+ tracer was added. In some experiments, Ca2+ was not added to 0.25% BSA/ECM and the final [Ca2+]ECM was <1 μm. Coverslips were mounted at the thermostated stage (35 °C) of an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope fitted with a ×40 (UApo, NA 1.35) oil immersion objective. For simultaneous measurements of fura2, pericam, and RFP fluorescence, a Leica IRB2 inverted microscope equipped with a motorized turret under computer control and fitted with the above described objective was used. Fluorescence images were collected using a cooled CCD camera (PXL, Photometrics or, for fast-imaging, a frame-transfer device, Pluto, PixelVision) (22.Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 31.Varnai P. Lin X. Lee S.B. Tuymetova G. Bondeva T. Spat A. Rhee S.G. Hajnoczky G. Balla T. J. Biol.

The following multi-parameter imaging protocols were applied: fura2 and GFP (fura2, 340- and 380-nm excitations or 360 nm for Mn2+ quenching; enhanced GFP, 490-nm excitation, 510-nm longpass dichroic mirror, and a 520-nm longpass emission filter); CFP and YFP (CFP, 435-nm excitation, 480/40-nm emission; FRET, 435-nm excitation, 535/30-nm emission); and fura2, pericam, and RFP (fura2, 340- and 380-nm excitation; pericam, 414- and 495-nm excitation, 510-nm longpass dichroic mirror, and a 520-nm longpass emission filter; RFP, 545-nm excitation, 570-nm longpass dichroic mirror, and a 603/75-nm emission filter; CCD imaging system). In most of the experiments, a set of images was obtained every 3 s, whereas in recording of the waves 15 frames were obtained in each second, and in the measurements that involved a switch of the filter cube in each cycle, a set of images was obtained every 6 s. For evaluation of [Ca2+]c, fura2 fluorescence was calculated for the total area of individual cells and the background fluorescence obtained over cell-free regions of each image was subtracted prior to calculation of the fluorescence ratios. In the cells expressing high amounts of fluorescent proteins, detectable GFP/pericam fluorescence was obtained at the excitation wavelengths used for fura2 (40.Bolsover S. Ibrahim O. O'Luanaigh N. Williams H. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The GFP-related fluorescence was not affected by changes in [Ca2+]c. Although a comparison of the fura2 fluorescence between fluorescent protein-expressing cells and non-transfected cells was used to visualize the kinetics of the signal in each image sequence, to avoid underestimation of the fluorescence ratios reflecting the changes in [Ca2+]c, GFP-N versus p130PH-GFP or GFP-IP3R224–605 and RFP-N versus RFP-p130PH were also analyzed in all of the comparisons. For evaluation of [Ca2+]m, the pericam-mt signal was masked. Recordings obtained from all of the transfected cells on the field were averaged for comparison in each experiment. Experiments were carried out with at least four different cell preparations, and 20–60 cells were monitored in each experiment. Significance of differences from the relevant controls was calculated by Student's t test. Confocal Imaging of Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) Measurements in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were transfected with GFP-N, GFP-IP3R224–605, p130PH-GFP, mito-YFP, or PLCδ1PH-GFP. Experiments were performed in 0.25% BSA at 35 °C. A Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal laser-scanning system coupled to an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope with a ×40 (UApo, NA 1.35) oil immersion objective was used to record image series. The 488-nm line of a krypton/argon laser was used to excite the GFP. For the FRAP measurements, images were taken continuously at 512 × 512 resolution at a high digital zoom (0.1 μm/pixel) with a frame rate of 0.3 Hz. Two 64 μm2 (80 × 80 pixels) regions were selected for bleaching. Two images were recorded pre-bleach followed by five bleaching images with the selected regions illuminated at 16.7 (GFP-N) and 25 times (GFP-IP3R224–605, p130PH-GFP, and mito-YFP) the normal scanning intensity. The cell was scanned continuously for 5.5 min after bleaching. Measurement of [Ca2+c] in Suspension of Permeabilized COS-7 Cells—Cells harvested using 0.25% trypsin were washed in an ice-cold Ca2+-free extracellular buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4. Equal aliquots of cells (10–12 ×106 cells) were resuspended and permeabilized with 40 μg/ml digitonin in 1.4 ml of an intracellular medium (ICM) composed of 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, and 20 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.2, supplemented with 1 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. ICM was passed through a Chelex column prior to the addition of protease inhibitors to lower the ambient [Ca2+]. All of the measurements were carried out in the presence of 2 mm MgATP and 2 mm succinate. Cytosolic [Ca2+] was measured using fura2/FA (0.5 μm, excitation 340 and 380 nm; emission, 500 nm) added to the incubation medium. For GFP, 490-nm excitation and 535-nm emission were used. Fluorescence was monitored in a multi-wavelength-excitation dual wavelength-emission fluorimeter (Delta RAM, PTI). Incubations were carried out at 35 °C in a stirred thermostated cuvette. Calibration of fura2 signal was carried out at the end of each measurement by adding 1.5 mm CaCl2 and subsequently 10 mm EGTA-Tris, pH 8.5. [Ca2+]c was calculated using a Kd of 224 nm. Fluorometric Measurements of [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]m in Suspensions of Permeabilized RBL-2H3 Cells—Measurements were carried out as described before (22.Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 41.Csordas G. Hajnoczky G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). fura2FF-loaded cells (5.5 × 106 cells/ml) were permeabilized in ICM supplemented with 25–35 μg/ml digitonin for 5 min at 35 °C followed by washout of the released cytosolic fura2FF (125 × g for 4 min). Cell permeabilization was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion, and after a 5-min incubation, >95% cells were trypan blue-positive. Compartmentalized fura2FF has been shown to occur in the mitochondria of RBL-2H3 cells. Permeabilized cells were resuspended in ICM supplemented with succinate 2 mm and 0.25 μm rhod2/FA and maintained in a stirred thermostated cuvette at 35 °C. Rhod2/FA was added to monitor [Ca2+] in the intracellular medium that exchanges readily with the cytosolic space. Fluorescence was monitored in a multi-wavelength-excitation dual wavelength-emission fluorimeter using 340- and 380-nm excitation and 500-nm emission for fura2FF and 540-nm excitation and 580-nm emission for rhod2. In every experiment, five data triplets were obtained per second. Calibration of the Ca2+ signals was carried out at the end of each measurement as described previously (41.Csordas G. Hajnoczky G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cellular Localization of IP3- and Inositol Lipid-binding Domains Fused to GFP—We first visualized by confocal microscopy the subcellular localization of the IP3-binding domains, IP3R224–605 and p130PH, in COS-7 cells, which were expressed as GFP fusion proteins. GFP-N was used as a control for cytosolic distribution (Fig. 1A, i), whereas PLCδ1PH-GFP that binds to PIP2 through its PH domain was used as a reference for plasma membrane localization (Fig. 1A, iv). As indicated by the GFP fluorescence, GFP-IP3R224–605 and p130PH-GFP were found to be present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, ii and iii). The cells were stimulated next with ATP that induces PLC-mediated cleavage of PIP2 to enhance IP3 formation. In ATP-stimulated COS-7 cells, no change was observed in the distribution of GFP-N, GFP-IP3R224–605, and p130PH-GFP (Fig. 1A, v, vi, and vii). The ATP-induced hydrolysis of PIP2 was confirmed by the partial translocation of PLCδ1PH-GFP from the membrane to the cytosol, which appeared as a fluorescence decrease at the plasma membrane and an increase in the cytosol (Fig. 1A, viii). FRAP studies were used to assess the mobility of the IP3BPs in the cytosol (Fig. 1B). When a large area of a p130PH-GFP-expressing cell was illuminated, an essentially homogeneous decrease in fluorescence appeared throughout the cell within 3s (Fig. 1B, i versus v), suggesting fast cytosolic distribution of the fluorescent protein. Furthermore, when small regions of the GFP-IP3R224–605-and p130PH-GFP-expressing cells were photobleached, the post-bleach fluorescence in these regions was not different from the pre-bleach signal, indicating that the fluorescence was recovered completely within 3s (Fig. 1B, ii versus vi and iii versus vii). As a positive control, GFP targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, mito-GFP, which shows slower redistribution than the cytosolic GFP (42.Verkman A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 27-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), was also photobleached. In this case, the loss of fluorescence in the region of bleaching was apparent in the post-bleach image (Fig. 1B, iv versus viii; 29 ± 3%, n = 12). Although the rate of image acquisition was too low to determine the half-recovery time for GFP-IP3R224–605 and p130PH-GFP, it is likely to be in the subsecond range, similarly to the half-recovery time measured for a freely diffusible cytosolic PH domain-GFP construct (PLCδ1PH(R40L)-GFP, 0.2s) (43.van der Wal J."

In an attempt to identify novel proteins that interact with C/EBPβ, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with a preadipocyte cDNA library and identified a new co-regulator, delta-interacting protein A (DIPA). DIPA mRNA is expressed during adipocyte differentiation of clonal cell lines. DIPA interacts with C/EBPβ and -δ proteins in intact cells and inhibits their transcriptional activity but not that of C/EBPα. Stable overexpression of DIPA in preadipocytes partially inhibits adipocyte differentiation, whereas its gene silencing enhances this process. DIPA and C/EBPβ co-localize in the nucleus, and overexpression of DIPA in preadipocytes results in a partial inhibition of the mitotic clonal expansion which is critical for differentiation. Thus, DIPA is a novel partner of C/EBPβ that down-regulates early events of adipogenesis.

The increased adipose tissue mass associated with obesity results from an increase in the number and size of adipocytes. Adipocytes are highly specialized cells that play a critical role in energy homeostasis. A major role of adipocytes is to store large amounts of triglycerides during periods of energy excess and to mobilize these depots during periods of nutritional deprivation. An insight in the molecular mechanisms underlying adipogenesis may lead to the development of strategies for reducing the prevalence of obesity. In vitro experiments using established cell lines and primary cultures that mimic adipocyte differentiation in vivo have provided important information on adipose tissue development (1Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar). The 3T3-F442A (2Green H. Kehinde O.

A. 1978; 75: 6054-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) cell lines are well characterized models for the study of adipocyte differentiation at the molecular level. After growth arrest, confluent cells undergo adipocyte differentiation when maintained under appropriate culture conditions. Commitment and differentiation of adipocytes are governed by transcription factors that are under the control of the combinatorial effects of hormonal, cell-cell, and cell-matrix interactions (5Tong Q.

Cell. 1982; 29: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The adipocyte differentiation program is controlled by the sequential expression of various transcription factors, i.e. members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family, and the adipocyte determination and differentiation factor-1 (ADD1/SREBP1c) (9Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). These transcription factors interact with each other to execute adipocyte differentiation, including lipogenesis and adipocyte-specific gene expression, which are pivotal for metabolism in adipocytes. Although the late events of adipose conversion have been well documented, the molecular mechanisms regulating the early development of adipocytes remain poorly understood.Expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ occurs at a very early stage of adipocyte differentiation; overexpression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ promotes adipogenesis of fibroblasts (10Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 11Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and up-regulates expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ2. The generation by homologous recombination of mice lacking C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ has clearly established the essential role of these two C/EBPs for the differentiation of adipocytes both in vitro and in vivo (12Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar).The early expression of C/EBPβ and -δ in preadipocytes is mediated through activation of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)- and CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)/ATF-1-dependent pathways (13Belmonte N. Phillips B.W. Massiera F. Villageois P. Wdziekonski B. Saint-Marc P. Nichols J. Aubert J. Saeki K. Yuo A. Narumiya S. Ailhaud G. Dani C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2037-2049PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that C/EBPβ acquires DNA binding activity during the mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) of preadipocytes that follows induction of differentiation (14Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and that MCE is dependent on C/EBPβ (15Zhang J.W. Tang Q.Q. Vinson C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that C/EBPβ interacts with different factors and that its activity is modulated by post-transcriptional modifications such as site-specific phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinases (16Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (17Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro studies have identified several protein kinases A and C phosphorylation sites (18Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and site-specific glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylation (19Piwien-Pilipuk G. Van Mater D. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Another level of post-transcriptional regulation for C/EBPβ is provided by the expression of three C/EBPβ isoforms, LAP* (38 kDa), LAP (35 kDa), and LIP (20 kDa), through the use of alternative translational start sites in the C/EBPβ mRNA (20Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) or through proteolysis (21Welm A.L. Timchenko N.A. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell.

Recently, C/EBPβ activity has been reported to be modulated by sumoylation (23Kim J. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Pfarr C.M. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38037-38044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Eaton E.M. Sealy L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).The present study was conducted to identify C/EBPβ partners present in the early steps of adipose conversion in order to gain more insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in adipose tissue development. We have isolated delta-interacting protein A (DIPA) as a partner of C/EBPβ. Transient transfections show that DIPA inhibits the transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ and -δ but not C/EBPα. Moreover, overexpression of DIPA in preadipocytes partially inhibits adipocyte differentiation, whereas partial loss of its expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhances this process. We propose that the inhibitory effect of DIPA relates to a down-regulation of C/EBPβ- and δ-dependent transcriptional activity accompanied by a partial inhibition of mitotic clonal expansion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (standard medium). For adipocyte differentiation of Ob1771 and 3T3-F442A cell lines, cells were shifted to standard medium supplemented with 17 nm insulin and 2 nm triiodothyronine (differentiation medium). 2 days post-confluent 3T3-L1 cells were stimulated to differentiate by the addition of a hormonal mixture (0.5 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylmethyl-xanthine, and 170 nm insulin) to the standard medium for 2 days and maintained thereafter in standard medium with only 170 nm insulin. Typically, by day 6 more than 80% of the cells were fully differentiated into adipocytes. For 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling, cells were plated on coverslips. 18, 20, 22, and 24 h after induction of differentiation, cells were pulse-labeled for periods of 2 h with 30 μg/ml BrdUrd. On day 2, coverslips were fixed and processed for the analysis of BrdUrd incorporation and C/EBPβ localization as described previously (15Zhang J.W. Tang Q.Q. Vinson C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Two-hybrid Screening—A yeast two-hybrid library was generated using cDNA from reverse transcribed RNA from 2 days post-confluent Ob1771 cells in Hybri-Zap Vector (Stratagene). A bait plasmid, constructed by subcloning the open reading frame of C/EBPβ lacking the two activating domains (amino acids 83-297) as a GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein (pBD-GAL4-C/EBPβ), was used to screen 1.5 × 106 yeast clones as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). Background was reduced in the presence of 8 mm 3-aminotriazole. The colonies obtained were spotted onto synthetic dropout medium in the absence of three nutrients (His, Leu, and Trp) and scored for differential growth after 3-5 days. The results were confirmed by a lift assay testing for β-galactosidase activity in the yeast strain YRG-2.Transient Transfections—NIH3T3 cells were cultured in 24 multiwell plates and transfected in triplicate at 60% confluence using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were transfected with luciferase reporter vector (aP2 or PPARγ2), β-galactosidase expression vector for normalization, C/EBPs expression vector, and DIPA expression vector. pCMV tag 2B was used to equalize the total quantity of transfected DNA. Six hours after transfection, the medium was changed to standard medium. Cells were harvested after 48 h and lysed in Galacto-Light (Tropix) lysis buffer. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured in triplicate in microtiter plates in a Berthold TriLuxBeta luminometer. The luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity.Small Double-stranded RNA-mediated Interference (RNAi)—The RNA interference experiment was carried out by using retroviral vector expressing siRNA fragments (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Sequences for RNAi were selected from the DIPA cDNA coding region and analyzed by a BLAST search to ensure that they did not have significant sequence homology with other genes. Two pairs of oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed to construct the RNAi retroviral vector: DIPA-1, 5′-GATCCCCTCTGGCCCTTAAGGAGCTTTTCAAGAGAAAGCTCCTTAAGGGCCAGATTTTTGGAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAATCTGGCCCTTAAGGAGCTTTCTCTTGAAAAGCTCCTTAAGGGCCAGAGGG-3′ (reverse); DIPA-2, 5′-GATCCCCAAGGAGCTTTGCTTAGCACTTCAAGAGAGTGCTAAGCAAAGCTCCTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAAGGAGCTTTGCTTAGCACTCTCTTGAAGTGCTAAGCAAAGCTCCTTGGG-3′ (reverse). The annealed DIPA-1 and DIPA-2 double-stranded oligonucleotides were inserted into the BglII/HindIII site of pSUPER retrovirus vector (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). A scrambled sequence vector was used as a negative control. Stable cell lines were obtained after retroviral transduction and puromycin selection.Retrovirus Production and Transduction—BOSC23 cells were transfected with viral DNA at 50% confluence by the use of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer. Forty-eight hours after transfection, virus supernatant was harvested, centrifuged, and filtered. Forty percent confluent 3T3-L1 cells were transduced with virus supernatant diluted with one volume of fresh standard medium in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. On the following day, the cells were subjected to neomycin (600 μg/ml) or puromycin selection (2 μg/ml). Stable cell populations were obtained after 3-10 days of selection.Isolation and Analysis of RNA—Total RNA was extracted using a Tri-Reagent™ kit (Euromedex) according to manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by Northern blot as described previously (27Amri E.Z. Bertrand B. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1449-1456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were subjected to digital imaging (Fujix BAS 1000). The 36B4 cDNA probe, used as an internal standard, was kindly provided by Dr. B. Spiegelman. Reverse transcription and PCR reactions were carried out as described previously (28Abderrahim-Ferkoune A.

Reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions by using SYBR green PCR Master Mix. The expression of selected genes was in all cases normalized to the expression of TATA-binding protein (TBP). The oligonucleotides for each target of interest, designed using Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were (forward and reverse) the following: DIPA, 5′-CTGATGCAGGAGGTGAATCG-3′, 5′-CGAGTCCAGAAAGCAGCAGA-3′; aP2, 5′-CTGGGCGTGGAATTCGAT-3′, 5′-GCTCTTCACCTTCCTGTCGTCT-3′; TBP, 5′-ACCCTTCACCAATGACTCCTATG-3′, 5′-ATGATGACTGCAGCAAATCGC-3′.Plasmids—The murine PPARγ2(-615 to +67) and aP2 (-185 to +19) promoters were cloned by PCR from genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers based on published sequence (29Zhu Y.

The retroviral construct containing FLAG-tagged DIPA cDNA was derived from pCDNA3-DIPA and cloned into pAkvi-Bipe2 retroviral vector. Full-length C/EBPα, -β, and -δ were cloned into Myc tag containing pCMV-tag3B vector (Stratagene). The constructs were checked by DNA sequencing.Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotting, and enhanced chemiluminescence were performed as described previously (31Abderrahim-Ferkoune A. Bezy O. Chiellini C. Maffei M. Grimaldi P. Bonino F. Moustaid-Moussa N. Pasqualini F. Mantovani A. Ailhaud G. Amri E.Z. J.

Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-mouse C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-mouse aP2 (kindly provided by Dr. D.A. Bernlohr), mouse anti-c-Myc (Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-FLAG (Euromedex), and rabbit anti-TBP (Santa-Cruz). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Promega.In Vitro Transcription and Translation—FLAG-tagged full-length DIPA and TSC22 and Myc-tagged full-length murine PPARδ and C/EBPβ expression vectors were transcribed and translated using the TnT reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine.Co-immunoprecipitation—NIH3T3 cells were transiently co-transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation with C/EBPβ or PPARδ and DIPA or TSC-22 expression vectors. Two days later, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm Na3VO4, scraped in ice-cold gentle lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycero-phosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture), sonicated, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatants were recovered, and protein concentrations were determined. Antibodies (10 μg/ml) against the Myc tag were added to 1 mg of protein lysates in a final volume of 0.5 ml followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose beads were mixed with the immunoprecipitates for 1 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation at 2,500 × g and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2, rapidly neutralized and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. The same procedure was performed using in vitro translated proteins, and the gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to phosphorimaging screens.Immunofluorescence Staining—Differentiated cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked in 0.2% gelatin for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with C/EBPβ antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies and with anti-FLAG antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies. Preparations were mounted in DAPI mounting solution (Vector Laboratories). Oil Red O staining and GPDH activity measurement were performed as described previously (31Abderrahim-Ferkoune A. Bezy O.

Radioactive materials, random priming kit, and nylon membranes were from Amersham Biosciences.RESULTSIdentification of a Novel Protein That Interacts with C/EBPβ by Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—To identify proteins that interact with C/EBPβ, we screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library derived from Ob1771 preadipocytes, using mouse C/EBPβ lacking activating domains as bait. A total of 1.5 × 106 transformants were screened, yielding 69 positive yeast colonies in the presence of 8 mm 3-aminotriazole. A series of positive clones are shown in Fig. 1A. Retransformation experiments confirmed that C/ATF, UBC-9, and an unknown protein (similar to human DIPA) specifically interact with C/EBPβ (Fig. 1B) but not with unrelated bait proteins, compared with a negative control (pLamin C), a set of weak interaction partners (pBD-MUT/pAD-MUT), and a set of strong interaction partners (pBD-WT/pAD-WT) as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene).C/ATF has been shown previously to interact with C/EBPβ using a zipper-blot method (33Vallejo M. Ron D. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4679-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) indicating the existence of functional cross-talk between the C/EBP and C/ATF families for the integration of hormonal stimuli at the transcriptional level. Ubc9 is the conjugating enzyme involved in sumoylation (small ubiquitin-like modifier), a post-translational modification of proteins that can affect target protein function by altering the subcellular localization and/or antagonizing other modifications (34Muller S. Ledl A. Schmidt D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1998-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 35Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that an inhibitory domain is conserved in the C/EBP family that is a target for sumoylation, which controls the transcriptional activity, and that sumoylation of C/EBPβ-1 (LAP*) is likely to be important in the functional differences observed between C/EBPβ-1 and C/EBPβ-2 (LAP) (23Kim J. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Pfarr C.M. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38037-38044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Eaton E.M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33416-33421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations demonstrate the efficiency of our screen for C/EBPβ partners.Two plasmids encoded identical 441-nucleotide expressed sequence tags of Mus musculus Unknown (GenBank™ accession number NM_198616) similar to the human DIPA (NM_006848) (36Brazas R. Ganem D. Science. 1996; 274: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The DIPA sequence contains a basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA binding and dimerization domain, which shares similarities with the transcription factor FRA1 (36Brazas R. Ganem D. Science. 1996; 274: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Interaction of C/EBPβ with DIPA—Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to examine the direct interaction between DIPA and C/EBPβ. In vitro translated FLAG-tagged DIPA or FLAG-tagged TSC-22 and Myc-tagged C/EBPβ or Myc-tagged PPARδ (50 μl each) were mixed. Immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc antibodies was performed, and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2A). These experiments revealed that the DIPA-translated protein interacts with C/EBPβ protein but not with PPARδ used as a negative control. The interaction of DIPA with C/EBPβ is specific, as TSC-22, a leucine zipper-containing transcription factor, was not immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2A). To confirm further interaction between DIPA with C/EBPβ protein and other members of this family, we performed co-immunoprecipitation using lysates from transient transfections of NIH3T3 cells followed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitates using anti-Myc antibodies from cells transfected with empty vector, as well as with FLAG-tagged DIPA or with Myc-tagged PPARδ vectors, did not contain any FLAG-tagged DIPA protein. However lysates from cells co-transfected with FLAG-tagged DIPA and either Myc-tagged C/EBPβ or -δ vectors contained a clear band corresponding to the FLAG-tagged DIPA protein (Fig. 2B). There was no co-immunoprecipitation of DIPA when Myc-tagged C/EBPα was used (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate an interaction between DIPA and C/EBPβ and δ proteins in intact cells.Fig. 2Interaction and co-localization of DIPA with C/EBPβ. A, co-immunoprecipitation (IP)of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Myc-tagged C/EBPβ or Myc-tagged PPARδ in the presence of labeled FLAG-tagged DIPA or FLAG-tagged TSC22 using anti-Myc antibodies. Autoradiograph shows SDS-PAGE separation of immunoprecipitated proteins. B, NIH3T3 cells were transiently co-transfected with the indicated vectors. Empty pCDNA3 vector was used to maintain a constant amount of vector DNA. Lysates were collected and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc antibodies and immunoblotted (IB) using either anti-Myc (top) or anti-FLAG (bottom) antibodies. The results are representative of two independent experiments. C, DIPA co-localizes with C/EBPβ protein in 3T3-L1 cells. 3T3-L1-DIPA cells induced to differentiate were fixed on day 2 and were immunostained to detect FLAG DIPA and C/EBPβ. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. The yellow staining on the overlay (Merged) indicates that DIPA co-localizes with C/EBPβ protein. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine the subcellular localization of DIPA in 3T3-L1 cells that had been infected with pAkvi-FLAG-tagged DIPA. Nuclear staining of C/EBPβ protein was observed in cells (Fig. 2C) in agreement with reported data (37Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). A similar localization was observed for the FLAG-tagged DIPA (Fig. 2C). These patterns are consistent with a co-localization of C/EBPβ and DIPA in the nucleus as confirmed by the yellow staining of the merge micrograph (Fig. 2C).Differential Effect of DIPA on the Transcriptional Activity of C/EBPα, -β, and -δ on the aP2 and PPARγ2 Promoters—The transcriptional activity of C/EBPα, -β, and -δ on the mouse aP2 and PPARγ2 promoters linked to a luciferase reporter gene was determined by transient transfections in NIH3T3 cells. The aP2 promoter (-185 to + 19) and the PPARγ2 promoter (-615 to +67) have already been shown to contain C/EBP-responsive elements (38Herrera R. Ro H.S. Robinson G.S. Xanthopoulos K.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5331-5339Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 39Christy R.J. Yang V.W. Ntambi J.M. Geiman D.E. Landschulz W.H. Friedman A.D. Nakabeppu Y. Kelly T.J. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). C/EBPα, -β, and -δ transactivated the aP2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner from 2- to 6-fold (Fig. 3). Transient transfections of DIPA alone inhibited the basal promoter activity by 30-50%, whereas it completely abolished the activity of C/EBPβ, whatever the doses of DIPA expression vector (Fig. 3A), and moderately inhibited the activity of C/EBPδ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). There was no effect of DIPA on the transcriptional activity of C/EBPα (Fig. 3C). As C/EBPβ is unable to activate PPARγ2 promoter (40Elberg G. Gimble J.M. Tsai S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27815-27822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effects of C/EBPα and -δ on the PPARγ2 promoter in the absence or presence of the DIPA expression vector. The data show a negative effect of DIPA on C/EBPδ but not on C/EBPα transcriptional activity on the PPARγ2 promoter (Fig. 4A and B).Fig. 3DIPA inhibits the transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ and -δ, but not C/EBPα, on the aP2 minimal promoter. NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected in 24-well plates with expression vectors for C/EBPβ (A) C/EBPδ (B), and C/EBPα (C) and DIPA, using the indicated amounts, and with the luciferase reporter driven by"
https://openalex.org/W2070897164,"There is accumulating evidence that the p38 MAP kinase pathway plays important roles in Type I interferon (IFN) signaling, but the mechanisms regulating p38 activation during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor remain to be defined. We sought to identify the events that lead to activation of the p38 MAP kinase in response to Type I IFNs. Our data demonstrate that treatment of sensitive cell lines with IFNα results in activation of both MAP kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) and MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6). Such IFN-inducible activation of MKK3 and MKK6 is essential for downstream phosphorylation and activation of the p38 MAP kinase, as shown by studies using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with targeted disruption of the Mkk3 and Mkk6 genes (MKK3–/– MKK6–/–). Similarly, IFN-dependent activation of the downstream effectors of p38, MAPKAPK-2 and MAPKAPK-3, is not detectable in cells lacking Mkk3 and Mkk6, demonstrating that the function of these MAP kinase kinases is required for full activation of the p38 pathway. To define the functional relevance of MKK3/6 engagement in Type I IFN signaling, IFN-inducible gene transcription was evaluated in the MKK3/MKK6 double knock-out cells. IFNα- and IFNβ-dependent transcription via either interferon-stimulated response element or IFNγ activated site elements was defective in MKK3 –/–/MKK6 –/– MEFs in luciferase reporter assays. In addition, IFN-dependent induction of two genes known to be of importance in the generation of IFN responses, Isg15 and Irf-9, was diminished in the absence of Mkk3 and Mkk6. The effects of Mkk3 and Mkk6 on IFN-dependent transcription were unrelated to any effects on the phosphorylation and activation of STAT proteins, indicating the presence of a STAT-independent mechanism. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that MKK3 and MKK6 are rapidly activated during engagement of the Type I IFN receptor and play important roles in Type I IFN signaling and the generation of IFN responses.

The important biological properties of IFNs have also triggered extensive studies to define the mechanisms that mediate their cellular effects. Interferon receptors are widely expressed in a variety of mammalian cells and tissues, and essentially all types of cells express interferon receptors (1Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E.

It is now well established that generation of the effects of IFNα or IFNβ requires binding of these cytokines to the multisubunit Type I IFN receptor (1Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E.

Such binding results in activation of two kinases of the JAK family, Tyk-2 and Jak-1, which are constitutively associated with the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits of the Type I IFN receptor, respectively (4Stark G.R.

There is accumulating evidence indicating that MAP kinase signaling pathways play important roles in IFNα and IFNβ signaling (7Platanias L.C. Pharmacol.

Specifically, engagement of the p38 MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in the regulation of interferon-dependent gene transcription via ISRE and GAS elements (22Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J.

Koromilas A.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 5107-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Importantly, it has been directly demonstrated that activation of the p38 and its downstream effectors is essential for the generation of the suppressive effects of Type I IFNs on normal and leukemic progenitors (25Mayer I.A. Verma A. Grumbach I.M. Uddin S. Lekmine F. Ravandi F. Majchrzak B. Fujita S. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

Despite the significant advances in our understanding of the contribution of MAP kinase pathways in the generation of IFNα responses, the mechanisms by which different Type I IFNs regulate activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway are not known. There is some evidence that the small G-protein Rac1 is activated downstream of JAK kinases (24Uddin S. Lekmine F. Sharma N. Majchrzak B. Mayer I. Young P.R. Bokoch G.M. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J.

Lekmine F. Sharma N. Majchrzak B. Mayer I. Young P.R. Bokoch G.M. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27634-27640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the kinases that directly phosphorylate and activate p38 are not known. In the present study we provide evidence that IFNα or IFNβ treatment of sensitive cell lines results in activation of MAP kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) and MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6). Such activation is critical for activation of the p38 MAP kinase, as in cells with targeted disruption of both the Mkk3 and Mkk6 genes there is complete abrogation of the ability of Type I IFNs to induce p38 activation. Our data also establish that MKK3 and MKK6 are required for ISRE- and GAS-driven gene transcription in response to Type I interferons (IFNα and IFNβ). Type I IFN-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, STAT1 phosphorylation on serine 727, and formation of STAT DNA-binding complexes are normally formed in the absence of MKK3/MKK6, establishing that these kinases do not modulate activation of STATs directly or indirectly via p38 MAP kinase activation. On the other hand, IFN-inducible activation of MAPKapK-2 is MKK3/6-dependent and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression is defective in MAPKAPK-2–/– MEFs, indicating that this kinase acts as a downstream effector for the MKK3/6-p38 MAP kinase pathway, to mediate transcriptional regulation of ISGs.

Here we show that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), which induce oxidative stress in cells, up-regulate transcription of Gαi2 in K562 cells. Redox-sensing chemicals abrogated this transcriptional effect. A dominant negative I-κB double mutant (S32A/S36A) suppressed PMA-induced transcription by 54–62%, suggesting involvement of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that inhibits nuclear import of stress-responsive transcription factors (such as NF-κB), inhibited PMA- and tBHQ-induced transcription. Deletion of an NF-κB-binding motif that maps at +10/+19 in the promoter resulted in 55–60% suppression of PMA-induced transcription, and 81% suppression of tBHQ-induced transcription. Mutation of an antioxidant response element (ARE) that maps at –84/–76 in the promoter resulted in 51 and 86% decrease in PMA- and tBHQ-induced transcription, respectively. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, this element formed complexes with the transcription factors NF-E2p45 and Nrf2 that are prototypic for binding to the ARE, as well as with c-Fos, which can also interact with the ARE. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated recruitment of these transcription factors to the promoter. Exogenously transfected Nrf2 transactivated the Gαi2 gene promoter; the cytoskeleton-associated protein, Keap1, abrogated this effect. Taken together, the present studies reveal that transcription factors that bind NF-κB and/or antioxidant response elements play an activating role in the transcription of the human Gαi2 gene.

For example, in P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells that normally differentiate to endodermal phenotype in response to low levels of retinoic acid, stable transfection of constitutively active forms of Gα12 (Q229L) or Gα13 (Q226L) results in differentiation even in the absence of retinoic acid (9Jho E.-H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating a direct effect of these G-proteins on this process. Conversely, suppression of Gαi2 levels with anti-sense oligonucleotide inhibits butyrate-induced differentiation of K562 cells to erythroblasts, and treatment of these cells with pertussigen to inactivate Gαi2 prevents erythroblastic differentiation (11Davis M.G. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating an apparent requirement for Gαi2 in the differentiation of these cells to erythroblasts. In contrast, retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 embryonal teratocarcinoma cells to the primitive endoderm is inhibited by expression of Gαi2 (7Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of Gαi2 may be cell-type or cell differentiation inducer specific. Gαi2 has also been shown to play a role in oncogenesis (12Kinane T.B. Finder J.D. Kawashima A. Brown D. Abbate M. Shang C. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Ercolani L. J. Biol.

The discovery that Gαi (sub-species undefined) can direct asymmetric cell division in neuroblasts as well as in sensory organ precursor cells in Drosophila in a receptor-independent manner during embryonic development (15Schaefer M.

We showed previously that the human Gαi2 gene promoter is strongly activated when erythroblastic differentiation is triggered in K562 cells by the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors; the activation is associated with increased Gαi2 mRNA as well as Gαi2 protein levels, and is mediated by Sp1-binding sites in the promoter (18Yang J.

Because the generation of oxidative radicals is a hallmark of PMA treatment of various cell types, including K562 cells (25Schreck R. Meier B. Männel D.N. Dröge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 26Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Krönke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A.

Our data demonstrate the potential regulatory role of transcription factors that bind to ARE and/or NF-κB response element(s), in the expression of Gαi2. Cell Cultures and Transfection Studies—K562 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), were maintained in culture as described previously (11Davis M.G. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection studies, 1 × 105 cells in 1 ml of medium/well (24-well plates) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 units of penicillin and 50 μg of streptomycin per milliliter) at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h before transfection. The cells were then transfected with plasmid DNA containing the Gαi2 promoter construct or mutant (0.5 μg, unless otherwise stated) and 1.5 μl of FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) for 1 h, followed by addition of PMA or tBHQ. When used, antioxidants (i.e. CAPE, PDTC, and N-acetylcysteine) were added 30 min or 1 h prior to the addition of inducer (PMA or tBHQ). In co-transfection experiments with dominant negative IκB expression plasmid, PMA was added 2 h after transfection. In all cases, the cells were harvested 24 h after the addition of inducers (unless otherwise stated) by centrifuging (12,000 × g, 45 s) in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and washed once with 1 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The cell pellets were then lysed with 150 μlof1× Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). After 15 min at room temperature, the lysed material was centrifuged for 2 min (12,000 × g) to remove cell debris, and the luciferase activity and protein content (Bradford protein assay method (Bio-Rad)) of the extracts were measured. For luciferase activity, 5 μl of the extract was used to measure the integrated light units over 10 s, using the luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany), as recommended by the manufacturers. In collateral experiments using the dual luciferase assay protocol, we noted that PMA robustly induced the luciferase gene in conventional luc-reporter constructs (e.g. Promega's pRL-TK-luc and pRL-CMV-luc reporter vectors) usually used for normalization in transfection experiments, making it impractical to use such plasmids for this purpose. This problem was not encountered with promoter-less constructs (e.g. phRG-B Renilla luciferase reporter vector from Promega). With such constructs, the dual luciferase assay resulted in -fold activation of transcription that was comparable to that obtained by normalizing to the protein content of the samples. Therefore, luciferase activity was normalized to the protein content of each sample, after correcting for basal activity of GL3-basic, and is expressed as -fold stimulation over cells that were not treated with inducers. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The desired nucleotides in the Gαi2 gene promoter were mutated or deleted by using QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). DNA sequencing performed by the Molecular Biology Core Facility at Meharry Medical College confirmed the mutations. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (18Yang J. Kawai Y. Hanson R.W. Arinze I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25742-25752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), except that (a) MG-132 (10 μm) was added to all solutions used, and (b) the initial crude nuclear pellet was re-suspended in buffer A, and lysis with Nonidet P-40 was repeated. For EMSA, annealed 5′-overhang oligonucleotide sequence, containing NF-κB- or ARE-binding motifs, was radiolabeled and purified as described previously (18Yang J. Kawai Y. Hanson R.W. Arinze I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25742-25752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The labeled probe was used for the EMSA reaction as described in the legends to Figs. 6 and 9. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and then exposed to Kodak XAR5 film at –80 °C. The radiolabeled bands were detected by autoradiography.Fig. 9Binding of nuclear extract proteins to DNA probe containing ARE element. EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from control, PMA-, and tBHQ-treated K562 cells, using the protocol described in detail elsewhere (18Yang J. Kawai Y. Hanson R.W. Arinze I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25742-25752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells incubated with or without 5 nm PMA or 20 μm tBHQ. The EMSA reactions were carried out with 2 μg of nuclear extract protein for each lane. In A, stimulus-induced protein-DNA complexes (see arrow) were measured in nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with tBHQ or PMA for up to 120 min. In B, competition experiments were carried out with 50-fold excess of the following oligonucleotides: unlabeled oligonucleotide identical (in sequence) to the labeled oligonucleotide probe (lanes 3 and 9), mutated oligonucleotide (lanes 4 and 10), NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (lanes 5 and 11), and Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (lanes 6 and 12). The EMSA was performed with a labeled double-stranded DNA probe 5′-GCCCGCCCCGGCCCAGTCACAGGCTTGGTTC-3′, which contains the canonical ARE (underlined) that maps at –84/–76 in the Gαi2 gene promoter. The sequence of the mutated oligonucleotide was 5′-GCCCGCCCCGGCCCATGTCCAGGCTTGGTTC-3′ (mutated bases are in bold and italic). Consensus NF-κB and Sp1 oligonucleotides were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. In C, the nuclear extract was incubated with the labeled probe for 20 min at 25 °C prior to addition of 1–2 μg of each antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and then incubated for additional 30 min, followed by electrophoresis. Lane 1 contained no nuclear extract. EMSA results shown are representative of two experiments. NE, nuclear extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western Immunoblotting—Gαi2 protein levels in whole cell lysates and transcription factors in nuclear extracts were measured by Western immunoblotting, using protocols described previously (18Yang J. Kawai Y. Hanson R.W. Arinze I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25742-25752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To monitor potential artifacts in loading and transfer among samples in different lanes, the blots for whole cell lysates were stripped and reprobed with antibodies to total ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); the blots for nuclear extracts were stripped and reprobed with antibodies to C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP was performed, in principle, according to the protocols recommended by Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and by the Farnham Laboratory (www.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/farnham/). Specifically, K562 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with or without PMA (5 or 10 nm) or tBHQ (20 μm) for 2 h or more after transfection with the Gαi2 promoter construct. The cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, neutralized with glycine (125 mm), and washed twice with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A per milliliter). To isolate crude nuclei (18Yang J. Kawai Y. Hanson R.W. Arinze I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25742-25752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the cell pellet was suspended in buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) per milliliter), incubated on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 8,500 × g (5 min) at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and protease inhibitor mixture (10 μl/ml) (Sigma). After 10 min on ice, the lysate was sonicated to shear the DNA to 200–1,000 bp and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. A small aliquot (10 μl) was saved as “input DNA” for PCR analysis later. Other aliquots of the supernatant solution equivalent to about 1 × 106 cells (usually 100 μl) were diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A per milliliter)), and pre-cleared by mild agitation for 1 h at 4 °C, using 40 μl of protein-A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 4 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The agarose beads were pelleted (1,000 × g, 2 min), and the supernatant solution was used for the immunoprecipitation step. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C by mild agitation with 4 μg of various antibodies (see legends to Fig. 10); for negative control, the supernatant solution was incubated with 4 μg of normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were collected by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with 40 μl of protein-A/G PLUS-agarose and 4 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 2 min. The agarose beads were then subjected to the five-step washing protocol described in the Upstate Biotechnology ChIP assay kit. The immune complexes were eluted from the beads with a two-step elution protocol, each time using 100 μl of the elution solution (1% SDS, 0.1 mm NaHCO3) for 20 min and mild agitation at room temperature. The eluates were combined, mixed with 8 μl of 5 m NaCl, and incubated at 65 °C overnight, to reverse the protein-DNA cross-links. The saved chromatin input fraction was also processed in the same manner. The samples were then digested with 20 μg of proteinase K (Promega, catalog #V3021) at 45 °C for 1 h. After digestion, 20 μg of glycogen (Type III, Sigma) was added to the mixture, and the pH was adjusted to <7.0 with 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) to facilitate adsorption of DNA to the QIAquick columns. The DNA from the samples was purified by using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and eluted from the columns with 50 μl of nuclease-free water. The DNA samples were stored at –20 °C until used for PCR analysis. PCR Analysis—To analyze the target region (containing the ARE-binding site at –84/–76 and the NF-κB-binding site at +10/+19 in the Gαi2 gene promoter), the DNA samples were amplified by PCR, using two sets of primers (see legend to Fig. 10) that generated 170- and 288-bp PCR products, respectively. The former bracketed the ARE site; the latter bracketed both the ARE site and the NF-κB-binding site at +10/+19. As negative controls, primers (forward; 5′-CCCAAGGAGGCTCTATGTTTTC-3′; reverse: 5′-TCAGAGGCTACATCCCAGG-3′) that generated a 249-bp PCR product were designed to bracket a non-target region in intron 1 of the Gαi2 gene. All primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA. The PCR cycles were 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 90 s. Following amplification, the PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, using 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA at pH 8.0) buffer, containing ethidium bromide. PMA Induces Expression of Gαi2—To determine the effect of PMA on the levels of Gαi2 in K562 cells, Western blotting analysis was used to assess Gαi2 protein levels in cells incubated with different concentrations of PMA. In cells cultured in the absence of PMA, Gαi2 is barely detectable in Western blots (11Davis M.G. Kawai Y. Arinze I.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yang J. Kawai Y.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17785-17791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), PMA caused a pronounced induction of Gαi2 protein expression within 48 h. Pre-treatment of the cells with actinomycin D blocked this induction (Fig. 1C), suggesting transcriptional up-regulation. The treatment with PMA induced robust transcriptional activity of the Gαi2 gene promoter, as assessed by luciferase reporter gene assay; the effect was maximal at 5 nm PMA (Fig. 1D). Transcription from the Gαi2 Gene Promoter Is Inhibited by Antioxidants—To explore potential transcription factors involved in the observed induction of promoter activity, we considered the fact that generation of oxidative radicals is a hall-mark of PMA treatment of various cell types, including K562 cells (25Schreck R.

Several antioxidants can block PMA-induced effects in cells (29Epinat J.-C. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6896-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar); among these are PDTC and CAPE (25Schreck R. Meier B. Männel D.N. Dröge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp.

Because no previous data exist to suggest that redox-sensitive transcription factors might mediate transcriptional up-regulation of Gαi2, we tested whether tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), an electrophile that activates genes for certain host-defense enzymes, through the antioxidant response element (ARE) (for review, see Ref. 33Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), could induce up-regulation of Gαi2 gene promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, Western blotting analysis indicated that Gαi2 expression was increased in K562 cells treated with tBHQ, although the increase was not as robust as noted with PMA. Reporter gene assays showed that tBHQ also activated transcription from the Gαi2 gene promoter (Fig. 3B). This activation was inhibited by PDTC, N-acetylcysteine, and CAPE (Fig. 3B), three well documented scavengers of reactive oxygen species (28Datta R. Yoshinaga K. Kaneki M. Pandey P. Kufe D. J. Biol.

The blot shown is representative of three experiments. B, PDTC, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and CAPE inhibit tBHQ-induced transcription from the Gαi2 gene promoter. PDTC (10 μm), NAC (0.5 mm), or CAPE (1 μm) was added to the cell cultures 1 h after transfection, followed by the addition of tBHQ (10 or 20 μm) 1 h later. The inhibitors were tested only in cultures to which tBHQ was added at 10 μm. The cells were harvested 24 h after the addition of tBHQ and processed for luciferase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values shown are means ± S.E. for duplicate assays from four to five different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because treatment with phenolic antioxidants and electrophilic compounds can lead to activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors (33Nguyen T.

https://openalex.org/W1998164234,"The ability of two loss-of-function mutants, L31A and L31C, of phospholamban (PLB) to bind to and inhibit the Ca2+ pump of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) was investigated using a molecular cross-linking approach. Leu31 of PLB, located at the cytoplasmic membrane boundary, is a critical amino acid shown previously to be essential for Ca2+-ATPase inhibition. We observed that L31A or L31C mutations of PLB prevented the inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity and disabled the cross-linking of N27C and N30C of PLB to Lys328 and Cys318 of SERCA2a. Although L31C-PLB failed to cross-link to any Cys or Lys residue of wild-type SERCA2a, L31C did cross-link with high efficiency to T317C of SERCA2a with use of the homobifunctional sulfhydryl cross-linking reagent, 1,6-bismaleimidohexane. This places Leu31 of PLB within 10 Å of Thr317 of SERCA2a in the M4 helix. Thus, contrary to previous suggestions, PLB with loss-of-function mutations at Leu31 retains the ability to bind to SERCA2a, despite losing inhibitory activity. Cross-linking of L31C-PLB to T317C-SERCA2a occurred only in the absence of Ca2+ and in the presence of nucleotide and was prevented by thapsigargin and by anti-PLB antibody, demonstrating for a fourth cross-linking pair that PLB interacts near M4 only when the Ca2+ pump is in the Ca2+-free, nucleotide-bound E2 conformation, but not in the E2 state inhibited by thapsigargin. L31I-PLB retained full functional and cross-linking activity, suggesting that a bulky hydrophobic residue at position 31 of PLB is essential for productive interaction with SERCA2a. A model for the three-dimensional structure of the interaction site is proposed. The ability of two loss-of-function mutants, L31A and L31C, of phospholamban (PLB) to bind to and inhibit the Ca2+ pump of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) was investigated using a molecular cross-linking approach. Leu31 of PLB, located at the cytoplasmic membrane boundary, is a critical amino acid shown previously to be essential for Ca2+-ATPase inhibition. We observed that L31A or L31C mutations of PLB prevented the inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity and disabled the cross-linking of N27C and N30C of PLB to Lys328 and Cys318 of SERCA2a. Although L31C-PLB failed to cross-link to any Cys or Lys residue of wild-type SERCA2a, L31C did cross-link with high efficiency to T317C of SERCA2a with use of the homobifunctional sulfhydryl cross-linking reagent, 1,6-bismaleimidohexane. This places Leu31 of PLB within 10 Å of Thr317 of SERCA2a in the M4 helix. Thus, contrary to previous suggestions, PLB with loss-of-function mutations at Leu31 retains the ability to bind to SERCA2a, despite losing inhibitory activity. Cross-linking of L31C-PLB to T317C-SERCA2a occurred only in the absence of Ca2+ and in the presence of nucleotide and was prevented by thapsigargin and by anti-PLB antibody, demonstrating for a fourth cross-linking pair that PLB interacts near M4 only when the Ca2+ pump is in the Ca2+-free, nucleotide-bound E2 conformation, but not in the E2 state inhibited by thapsigargin. L31I-PLB retained full functional and cross-linking activity, suggesting that a bulky hydrophobic residue at position 31 of PLB is essential for productive interaction with SERCA2a. A model for the three-dimensional structure of the interaction site is proposed.

Dephosphorylated PLB binds to and inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a isoform) by decreasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+ and slowing the E2 to E1 transition of the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport (4Cantilina T.

The N-terminal domain IA (residues 1–20) extends into the cytoplasm and is highly charged and mostly α-helical. Phosphorylation of either Ser16 or Thr17 within this domain reverses the inhibitory effect of PLB on Ca2+ transport. The C-terminal domain II (residues 32–52) is a hydrophobic transmembrane helix that contains a Leu/Ile zipper responsible for stabilizing the homopentameric arrangement of PLB in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (9Simmerman H.K.

Although the PLB pentamer comprises a reservoir form of inactive PLB protomers, it is in dynamic equilibrium with a pool of monomeric PLB (10Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D.

In particular, mutation to alanine of Asn27 or Asn30 of PLB enhanced inhibition of SERCA2a by further decreasing the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the enzyme (8Kimura Y. Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14238-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation to alanine of Leu31 of PLB totally eliminated inhibitory function (14Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recently, we developed a chemical cross-linking approach to identify and examine the structural and functional interactions between PLB and SERCA2a, with initial studies suggesting that domain IB of PLB interacts with M4 of SERCA2a (11Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48348-48356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In particular, we found that mutation of Asn27 of PLB to cysteine (N27C-PLB) allows strong cross-linking to Lys328 of SERCA2a using the heterobifunctional, 10 Å-long cross-linking agent, EMCS (12Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48348-48356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutation of Asn30 of PLB to cysteine (N30C-PLB) gave strong cross-linking to both Cys318 (11Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and Lys328 (12Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

The specificity of PLB to SERCA2a cross-linking was further demonstrated by the absolute requirement for the Ca2+-free, E2 conformation of SERCA2a, as well as by the consistent effects of the anti-PLB monoclonal antibody, 2D12, and the SERCA2a inhibitor, thapsigargin, in preventing cross-linking (11Jones L.R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48348-48356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Leu31 is another critically important residue in domain IB of PLB that is required for PLB function. Changing Leu31 of PLB to Ala (L31A-PLB) abolishes its inhibitory capacity (14Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Kimura et al. (14Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

In the case of Leu31, however, other evidence is consistent with localizing this residue at the cytoplasmic membrane interface within domain IB (6Simmerman H.K. Lovelace D.E. Jones L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Tatulian S.A. Jones L.R. Reddy L.G. Stokes D.L. Tamm L.K.

A subsequent structural model by Toyoshima et al. (18Toyoshima C. Asahi M. Sugita Y. Khanna R. Tsuda T. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) suggests that Leu31 of PLB interacts directly with Thr805 and Phe809 in M6 of SERCA1a. However, this model is inconsistent with the fact that L31C of PLB failed to cross-link either to L802C or to F809C of SERCA1a in M6 (15Asahi M. Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J.

Here we report on our cross-linking approach to assess the physical and functional interactions between SERCA2a and Leu31 of PLB in domain IB. Especially, we tested the hypothesis that loss-of-function by PLB with small side chain substitutions at Leu31 is due to its inability to bind to SERCA2a (14Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 15Asahi M. Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

In fact, our data contradict this hypothesis by showing efficient cross-linking of the loss-of-function mutant, L31C-PLB, to T317C of SERCA2a. Moreover, this cross-linking also requires the nucleotide-bound E2 conformation of the cardiac Ca2+ pump, consistent with our previous results on cross-linking of N27C-PLB and N30C-PLB to WT-SERCA2a (11Jones L.R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48348-48356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Like the other two domain IB residues, Asn27 and Asn30, Leu31 of PLB appears to interact with M4 on SERCA2a, not M6 as recently proposed by Toyoshima et al. (18Toyoshima C. Asahi M. Sugita Y. Khanna R. Tsuda T. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Possible mechanisms for the important role of Leu31 in domain IB of PLB are discussed. Materials—The homobifunctional sulfhydryl cross-linking agent, BMH, and the heterobifunctional amine-sulfhydryl cross-linking agents, EMCS and KMUS, were obtained from Pierce. Thapsigargin was purchased from Sigma. Iodogen was from Pierce. Mutagenesis and Baculovirus Production—Mutagenesis of canine SERCA2a and PLB cDNAs was conducted as recently described (11Jones L.R.

Cross-linking—Cross-linking between Cys-substituted residues of PLB and residues of SERCA2a in insect cell microsomes was conducted at room temperature as described recently, using a final concentration of cross-linking reagent of 0.1 mm (11Jones L.R.

Reactions were started by adding 0.75 μl of concentrated cross-linking reagent in dimethyl sulfoxide to 11 μg of microsomal protein in 12 μl of buffer A, which consisted of 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 3.2 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, and 1 mm EGTA. Reactions were terminated by adding 7.5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer containing 15% SDS and 100 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. When the heterobifunctional (Cys to Lys) cross-linking reagents, EMCS and KMUS, were used, reactions were generally conducted for 10 min at room temperature. With use of the homobifunctional (Cys to Cys) cross-linker, BMH, reactions were conducted for 30–60 min at room temperature (except in Fig. 6). To assess Ca2+ effects on cross-linking, ionized Ca2+ was varied by adding CaCl2 to buffer A (11Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol.

L31A Mutation Prevents PLB Cross-linking to WT-SERCA2a—Using thiol- and amine-selective cross-linking agents, we previously demonstrated that residues 27 and 30 in domain IB of PLB cross-link with high specificity to Lys328 and Cys318 of SERCA2a at the cytoplasmic extension of M4 (11Jones L.R.

In addition, N30C-PLB cross-linked to Cys318 of WT-SERCA2a with the homobifunctional cross-linking agent, BMH, with a length of 10 Å (Fig. 1C, left panel) (11Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Like WT-PLB (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), N27C-PLB and N30C-PLB both inhibit the Ca2+-ATPase activity of WT-SERCA2a by shifting the Ca2+ activation curve to the right, giving KCa values of 0.22 and 0.27 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, B and D, open squares). Addition of the anti-PLB monoclonal antibody, 2D12, which mimics the effect of PLB phosphorylation (4Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reverses this inhibition, giving KCa values of 0.12 and 0.15 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, B and D, closed squares). Directly adjacent to Asn30 of PLB, Leu31 is at the cytoplasmic boundary of the membrane (6Simmerman H.K. Lovelace D.E. Jones L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and appears to be essential for PLB function (14Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 15Asahi M. Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32855-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of Leu31 of PLB, we first confirmed the original observation of Kimura et al. (14Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) that replacement with the smaller residue alanine (i.e. L31A) abolishes PLB inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity and Ca2+ transport (data not shown). To explain this result, Kimura et al. hypothesized that L31A-PLB exhibits a decreased binding affinity for SERCA2a (14Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), an idea that was supported in a subsequent co-immunoprecipitation study (15Asahi M. Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32855-32862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To further test this hypothesis, we co-expressed two double mutants of PLB, namely, N27C,L31A-PLB and N30C,L31A-PLB, with WT-SERCA2a and checked for loss of cross-linking function. As predicted, when the L31A mutation was introduced into PLB, neither N27C nor N30C of PLB retained the ability to cross-link to Lys328 of WT-SERCA2a, using EMCS and KMUS, respectively (Fig. 1, A and C). Likewise, the L31A mutation prevented the cross-linking of N30C of PLB to Cys318 of WT-SERCA2a by BMH (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, neither of the two PLB double mutants, N27C,L31A-PLB nor N30C,L31A-PLB, was able to inhibit the Ca2+-ATPase activity of WT-SERCA2a (Fig. 1, B and D, open and closed circles). These results appear to confirm the idea that the L31A mutation impairs the binding of PLB to WT-SERCA2a and thus the ability of PLB to inhibit Ca2+ pump activity. Failure of L31C-PLB to Cross-link to WT-SERCA2a—To investigate further whether Leu31 of PLB is essential for physical association with WT-SERCA2a and thereby inhibition of its ATPase activity, we made the L31C-PLB mutant and tested for chemical cross-linking to WT-SERCA2a. Fig. 2A shows that L31C-PLB did not cross-link to any endogenous Cys or Lys residue of WT-SERCA2a using the cross-linking agents BMH, EMCS, and KMUS, whereas formation of PLB homodimers (11Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48348-48356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was readily apparent, especially with use of the homobifunctional thiol cross-linking agent, BMH (Fig. 2A, PLB2). Further testing of a series of homobifunctional Cys to Cys cross-linking agents and heterobifunctional Cys to Lys cross-linking agents spanning distances between 5 and 15 Å also failed to reveal any cross-linking between L31C-PLB and WT-SERCA2a (data not shown). Cross-linking of N27C and N30C of PLB to WT-SERCA2a was also completely prevented in the corresponding double mutants, N27C,L31C-PLB and N30C,L31C-PLB (Fig. 2, B and C). Consistent with these results, L31C-PLB was incapable of inhibiting WT-SERCA2a activity, and the L31C mutation, like L31A, also abolished inhibition of SERCA2a by the corresponding double mutants N27C,L31C-PLB and N30C,L31C-PLB (Fig. 2D). Efficient Cross-linking of L31C-PLB to T317C-SERCA2a— The failure to obtain cross-linking between Leu31 mutants of PLB and WT-SERCA2a appears to support the hypothesis that L31C (or A)-PLB is incapable of binding to SERCA2a. However, the possibility remained that these PLB mutants could still bind to the Ca2+ pump but that residue 31 is sterically hindered from efficiently cross-linking to endogenous Cys or Lys residues of WT-SERCA2a. Indeed, of the cross-linked residues of SERCA2a identified in this region (11Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Chen Z. Stokes D.L. Rice W.J. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48348-48356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), Cys318 appears to be buried on the wrong side of the M4 helix in x-ray crystallographic structures of SERCA (21Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 22Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), and Lys328 is over 15 Å away from PLB residue 31 at the upper end of M4 (see Fig. 8). We reasoned that Leu31 of PLB might be considerably closer to Thr317 of SERCA2a, which is located one residue below Cys318 and on the outside face of the M4 helix. To further test for a potential interaction between Leu31 on PLB and M4 on SERCA2a, we made the T317C mutant and checked for cross-linking of T317C-SERCA2a to L31C-PLB. Indeed, strong cross-linking of L31C-PLB to T317C-SERCA2a was observed using the 10 Å-long, homobifunctional thiol-reactive cross-linking agent, BMH (Fig. 3A). At the same time, L31C-PLB failed to cross-link to Lys328 of T317C-SERCA2a using the heterobifunctional cross-linking agents, EMCS and KMUS (Fig. 3A), confirming results obtained with WT-SERCA2a (Fig. 2) and supporting the notion of spatial constraints as an explanation for the lack of cross-linking between Leu31 of PLB and Lys328 (or Cys318) of SERCA2a. Despite the implication of strong binding between L31C-PLB and T317C-SERCA2a as indicated by the strong PLB cross-linking signal at 110 kDa obtained with BMH (Fig. 3A),"
https://openalex.org/W2063052712,"Isoprostanes, produced in vivo by non-enzymatic free-radical-induced lipid peroxidation, are markers of oxidative stress. Elevated serum and urine levels of 8-iso-PGF2α have been reported in a variety of diseases, many of which are characterized by early perivascular inflammatory infiltrates. It has been suggested that, in addition to being markers of oxidative stress, isoprostanes may have pathogenic functions. In this study, we investigated the potential role of 8-iso-PGF2α in inflammation, focusing on its effects on adhesion of monocytes to microvascular endothelial cells, an early event in the inflammatory response. In monocyte adhesion assays, 8-iso-PGF2α (>10−8M) suppressed both basal and TNF-α-induced monocyte adhesion to quiescent or proliferating human dermal (HMEC) and rat renal microvascular endothelial cells. In contrast, 8-iso-PGF2α stimulated monocyte adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as also reported by others. 8-Iso-PGF2α had no effect on the viability (Trypan Blue exclusion) of U937 monocytes or HMEC. 8-Iso-PGF2α also had no effect on HMEC surface expression of ICAM-1 or VCAM-1. Exposure of HMEC to 8-iso-PGF2α for 1–2 h was sufficient to reduce monocyte adhesion to the cell surface, and this effect was independent of de novo protein synthesis by HMEC. The effect of 8-iso-PGF2α was mimicked by a thromboxane receptor (TP) agonist (U46619) and blocked by a TP antagonist (SQ29548), indicating a TP-mediated process. Signal transduction pathway inhibitors (SB203580, curcumin, and PD98059) implicated p38 and JNK, but not ERK, in 8-iso-PGF2α-induced suppression of monocyte adhesion. In addition to a direct effect, conditioned medium (CM) transfer experiments suggest that 8-iso-PGF2α induces a secondary mediator, which also suppresses monocyte adhesion but via an alternative mechanism initiated between 3–4 h, which is TP-independent, requires new protein synthesis, and is primarily dependent on activation of p38. The data show that 8-iso-PGF2α can suppress the attachment of monocytes to HMECs via two independent pathways, indicating a potential anti-inflammatory effect of 8-iso-PGF2α in the microvasculature."
https://openalex.org/W2066559210,"Bub3p is a protein that mediates the spindle checkpoint, a signaling pathway that ensures correct chromosome segregation in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. It is known to function by co-localizing at least two other proteins, Mad3p and the protein kinase Bub1p, to the kinetochore of chromosomes that are not properly attached to mitotic spindles, ultimately resulting in cell cycle arrest. Prior sequence analysis suggested that Bub3p was composed of three or four WD repeats (also known as WD40 and β-transducin repeats), short sequence motifs appearing in clusters of 4–16 found in many hundreds of eukaryotic proteins that fold into four-stranded blade-like sheets. We have determined the crystal structure of Bub3p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 1.1 Å and a crystallographic R-factor of 15.3%, revealing seven authentic repeats. In light of this, it appears that many of these repeats therefore remain hidden in sequences of other proteins. Analysis of random and site-directed mutants identifies the surface of Bub3p involved in checkpoint function through binding of Bub1p and Mad3p. Sequence alignments indicate that these surfaces are mostly conserved across Bub3 proteins from diverse species. A structural comparison with other proteins containing WD repeats suggests that these folds may bind partner proteins using similar surface areas on the top and sides of the propeller. The sequences composing these regions are the most divergent within the repeat across all WD repeat proteins and could potentially be modulated to provide specificity in partner protein binding without perturbation of the core structure. Bub3p is a protein that mediates the spindle checkpoint, a signaling pathway that ensures correct chromosome segregation in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals.

The sequences composing these regions are the most divergent within the repeat across all WD repeat proteins and could potentially be modulated to provide specificity in partner protein binding without perturbation of the core structure. The spindle checkpoint is a signal transduction pathway that blocks the progress of the cell cycle through mitosis in response to kinetochores that are not attached to the spindles responsible for chromosomal segregation (1.Hardwick K.G. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A thorough functional understanding of the proteins that mediate this signal transduction mechanism is key in elucidating the mechanism by which cells maintain the proper number of chromosomes after cell division. Errors in the segregation of chromosomes have been shown to result in aneuploidy and have also been associated with tumorigenesis (2.Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3390) Google Scholar). Defects in the spindle checkpoint provide one plausible explanation for this. Indeed, mutations have been found in at least one spindle checkpoint protein (Bub1 1The abbreviations used are: Bub, budding uninhibited by benomyl; HA, hemagglutinin; r.m.s., root mean square. , budding uninhibited by benomyl) in human cancers (3.Cahill D.P. Lengauer C. Yu J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K.V. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression levels of these proteins have been found to be altered in cancer tissue and cell lines (4.Grabsch H. Takeno S. Parsons W.J. Pomjanski N. Boecking A. Gabbert H.E. Mueller W. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Other cancers associated with checkpoint defects have also been discussed previously (5.Musacchio A. Hardwick K.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Bub3p is a 38-kDa WD repeat-containing protein and is conserved in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Bub3p was initially discovered in a screen, searching for proteins involved in arresting the cell cycle in response to microtubule damage in budding yeast caused by the microtubule inhibitor benomyl (6.Hoyt M.A. Totis L. Roberts B.T. Cell. 1991; 66: 507-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). It functions in concert with several other proteins in yeast including Bub1p, Mad1p, Mad2p, and Mad3p, as well as Mps1p to mediate this pathway (7.Li R. Murray A.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 519-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The function of the protein is to bind to kinetochores that are not attached to opposing microtubules, thereby activating a cascade of incompletely understood biochemical events. The end effect of this pathway is the inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which is a ubiquitin ligase complex responsible for the degradation of protein, maintaining the cell in metaphase (8.Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). WD repeats, also known as β-transducin repeats and WD40 repeats, occur in tandem clusters, contain ∼40 amino acids, and are widely distributed in many hundreds of eukaryotic proteins comprising a significant percentage of the genome. Approximately 2% of the proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain them, and it appears that similar values are likely in other organisms with sequenced genomes that are not as well annotated. The name is derived from a loosely conserved Trp-Asp dipeptide found at the C-terminal end of the consensus sequence. In general, these proteins function by specifically binding to one or more partner proteins. This is often done to present a protein substrate molecule to an enzyme such as a kinase or ubiquitin ligase. They also function as scaffolding proteins to aid in forming large complexes involved in processes such as mRNA splicing and translation initiation. Other roles for WD repeat proteins have been found in mediating signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, transcriptional regulation, vesicular trafficking, developmental regulation, mRNA processing, and numerous other physiologically relevant processes involving protein-protein interactions (9.Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 10.van Nocker S. Ludwig P. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 50Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The WD repeats in Bub3p have been shown to bind at least two other checkpoint proteins, Mad3p (11.Hardwick K.G. Johnston R.C. Smith D.L. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and Bub1p, a serine/threonine kinase (12.Roberts R.T. Farr K.A. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8282-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In order to understand how Bub3p binds its partners to activate the checkpoint and to increase our general understanding of WD proteins, we have determined the crystal structure of the protein from S. cerevisiae at 1.1-Å resolution using multiple isomorphous replacement. Identification and analysis of site-directed and random mutants that fail to rescue BUB3-null mutants have allowed us to map residues on the surface of the protein that are responsible for checkpoint function. Cloning, Purification, and Crystallization—The gene encoding Bub3p was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA using the primers 5′-CCATATGCAGATAGTACAAATTGAG and 5′-CCCCGGGGTTCTCATAGTCAAATATTAT, which include extra sequences that enable cleavage by NdeI for the 5′-primer and SmaI for the 3′-primer (underlined). The resulting insert was ligated into the NdeI/SmaI site in the vector pTYB2 (New England Biolabs). The resulting construct was sequenced and used to transform the expression strain ER2566. Overexpressed protein was purified using a chitin affinity column. Secondary purification was carried out using an HQ anion exchange column mounted on a Perseptive Biosystems Perfusion Chromatography System at pH 6.0 using a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. Monodisperse protein was concentrated to 13 mg/ml, and the buffer was changed to 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3. Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Drops containing 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of well solution were suspended over a well containing 14% polyethylene glycol 8000, 200 mm calcium acetate, 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.5. Irregularly shaped crystals appeared in several days and were harvested into 25% (v/v) glycerol, 75% (v/v) well solution, and flash-cooled in a 100 K nitrogen stream for data collection. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Native data were collected at beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source to 1.1-Å resolution. Derivative data were collected on an R-AXIS IV mounted on a rotating anode (Table I). In both cases, the data were reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (13.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). The space group was determined to be P212121 based on the unit cell parameters (a = 52.27 Å, b = 74.09 Å, c = 94.09 Å, α = β = γ = 90°) and extinctions of axial reflections. Heavy atom refinement, density modification, and phasing calculations were performed using the CCP4 package (14.Collaborative Computational Crystallography Project, NActa Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar). Figures of merit before and after solvent flattening were 0.66 and 0.78, respectively. Isomorphous and anomalous differences were used to construct phase maps, which were interpreted using O (15.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and CHAIN (16.Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 224Crossref Google Scholar). This structure was initially refined at 1.37-Å resolution using CNS, which reduced Rcryst and Rfree to 21.8% and 24.1%, respectively. Subsequent refinement employed SHELX (17.Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 277. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 319-343Google Scholar) using 1.1-Å data and anisotropic temperature factors.

Plasmids containing the random mutants were transformed using the lithium acetate method. Yeast media, growth conditions, stock solutions, and molecular techniques were as previously described (18.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-933PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Hardwick K.G. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To construct the bub1::bub1-(HA)3::HIS3, bub3-Δ::kan,ura3-, can1-100,ade2-1,trp1-1,leu2-3,-112, his3-11, -15, ura3-1 strain used for rescue experiments, three HA tags were introduced at the endogenous locus of the Bub1 gene as an in-frame C-terminal fusion protein with the coding sequence as described (20.Puig O. Rutz B. Luukkonen B.G. Kandels-Lewis S. Bragado-Nilsson E. Seraphin B. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Disruption of the BUB3 gene was performed as described (20.Puig O. Rutz B. Luukkonen B.G. Kandels-Lewis S. Bragado-Nilsson E. Seraphin B. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Correct modifications were confirmed by PCR and Western blot analysis. The BUB3 construct containing the promoter and termination sequence used in rescue experiments was made using the primers 5′-ATCTAGAGGCAGACACCCCTTTGCATAATATGTCATC and 5′-AGTCGACGTGAGGAATTTGGGAGCAGACTTTTGGC. These primers amplified approximately 200 base pairs flanking the BUB3 open reading frame from the CRY1 strain and allowed cloning of this product into a yeast single copy plasmid, the Escherichia coli/yeast vector YCplac33 (21.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). PCR modification of the nucleotides directly upstream and downstream of the BUB3 open reading frame were used to remove the BUB3 coding region and replaced with an EcoRI and SmaI restriction sites and also incorporated thirteen copies of the Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLN) to yield pDC, the empty plasmid used in rescue experiments. The BUB3 gene was amplified and inserted into pDC to make the wild-type Myc-tagged expression construct (pBUB3) for immunoprecipitation. The pBUB3 was tested for its ability to rescue the ΔBUB3 strain phenotype and then sequenced. Generation of Random and Site-directed Mutants—Random mutants were generated using the Diversify PCR random mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Primers 5′-CTATCTGATATCTGCAACACGAAAACACAACAG and 5′-GGAGGAGAAGCGAAGAGAGAGCGATGAATCTG were used to amplify the BUB3 open reading frame in pBUB3. The arginine to glutamate and serine/threonine to alanine site-directed mutants were generated using the mega primer PCR method (22.Colosimo A. Xu Z. Novelli G. Dallapiccola B. Gruenert D.C. BioTechniques. 1999; 5: 870-873Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The primer sequences were designed to frame the mutation site upstream and downstream by 20 bp to yield an in-frame codon mutation. In all cases, the mutated inserts were placed into the vector pDC. These plasmids were used to transform a ΔBUB3 strain of CRY1 (Bub1-HA3::HIS3, bub3Δ::kan, can1-100, ade2–1, trp1-1, leu2-3, -112, his3-11, -15,ura3-1). Transformants were plated on yeast synthetic drop out medium without uracil at 30 °C. Colonies were replica plated on to media supplemented with either 7.5 or 10 μg/ml of benzimidazole. After 2 days at 30 °C, colonies with inhibited growth were taken from the original plates and grown overnight in liquid medium. The plasmid associated with each colony was frozen for further use. Plasmids were analyzed by PCR for the BUB3 open reading frame. Positive clones were serially diluted onto plates with 7.5 or 10 μg/ml of benzimidazole. After 2 days, clones that again failed to grow were identified and sequenced. Immunoprecipitations—For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, extracts from yeast cells were grown at 30 °C to a density of 0.8 OD600 nm. Whole cell extracts were prepared by centrifugation of the culture, washing with water, and another centrifugation. The pellet was then weighed and resuspended in the same weight of lysis buffer 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, Triton X-100 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease complete mixture (Roche Applied Science). The suspension was then dripped in a 50-ml Falcon tube filled with liquid nitrogen. The frozen pellets were ground in a porcelain mortar and pestle cooled in liquid nitrogen. Cell rupture was monitored by phase contrast microscopy. The powder was then thawed on ice and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. A total of 2 mg of yeast extract in a volume of 1 ml in lysis buffer was incubated overnight with 20 μl of a 50/50 agarose-conjugated anti-Myc antibodies equilibrated in lysis buffer (sc-40; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and then transferred to new tubes and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaHPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.2). Beads were then incubated in SDS sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C (80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.0015% bromphenol blue, and working concentration of complete protease mixture). Standard methods were used for SDS-PAGE, protein transfer to nitrocellulose, and Western analysis (23.Harlow E. Lane D. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Anti-Myc and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were used at 1.0 μg/ml and 0.1 μg/ml respectively (9E10,12CA5; Roche Applied Science). Affinity-purified anti-Mad3p rabbit antibodies were used at 0.5 μg/ml. All antibodies were diluted in 4% Blotto (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 4% nonfat powdered milk). The anti-Mad3p antibody was kindly provided by Kevin Hardwick, University of Edinburgh, UK. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse, at 1:5000 (NA 931, Amersham Biosciences) and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit at a 1:2000 dilution in Blotto (sc-2004; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). After the final wash, blots were incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm, for 5 min and then developed with the Santa Cruz Biotechnology Western blotting luminol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Overall Structure—Bub3p is a member of a large superfamily of proteins that contains tandem sequence repeats termed WD repeats after the Trp-Asp dipeptide that is sometimes found at the C-terminal end of the repeat. Crystal structures of WD repeat proteins such as the transducin β-subunit (24.Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 25.Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), budding yeast Tup1p (26.Sprague E.R. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Wolberger C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the p40 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex (27.Robinson R.C. Turbedsky K. Kaiser D.A. Marchand J.-B. Higgs H.N. Choe S. Pollard T.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and others have shown that the WD repeat effectively yields a four-stranded β-sheet. In almost all cases, these blade-like secondary structural modules pack into a seven-bladed propeller-like structure. By convention, these strands are labeled A through D starting with the innermost strand. Rather than forming a single blade, each repeat consists of the outside (D) strand of one blade then crosses over to create the inner three strands (A–C) of the next blade. The D strand from the first repeat is the outside strand for the last blade, creating an interlocking structure. Based on sequence analysis, Bub3 was believed to have three or four WD repeats (28.Fraschini R. Beretta A. Sironi L. Musacchio A. Lucchini G. Piatti S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6648-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 29.Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Despite this, threading techniques have suggested the existence of a seven-bladed propeller (28.Fraschini R. Beretta A. Sironi L. Musacchio A. Lucchini G. Piatti S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6648-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The refined model contains all Bub3p residues (1–341) and a C-terminal proline, which was appended from cloning. The high resolution structure clearly reveals that Bub3p possesses seven structural repeats (Fig. 1). These are arranged in a circular manner as seen in other WD repeat proteins with a completely hydrated central core. Using the conventional definition of the “top” of the protein as the side containing the loops connecting the D and A strands (the DA loop) and the loops connecting the B and C strands (the BC loops), the protein measures ∼45 Å from top to bottom and 45 Å across the diameter. The top of the protein is characterized by the alternate stacking of DA and BC loops as opposed to the bottom, which has the AB and CD loops positioned roughly adjacent along the radius. There are no major structural excursions from the central core structure although somewhat elongated DA loops are found between blades 3 and 4 and blades 5 and 6. An elongated BC loop is also found in blade 7 (Fig. 1A). In addition to 512 water molecules, four calcium ions were fit to regions of strong density with close (<2.5 Å) contacts to electronegative protein atoms or ordered water molecules. Because 100–150 mm calcium acetate was necessary for crystallization, these sites probably reflect the high concentration of calcium in the crystallization medium rather than any physiological role of calcium. The nature of the binding sites also suggests that they are low affinity. Each ion has only one, two, or three protein ligands. One of these is typically a carboxylate from a glutamate or aspartate. Two of these are present on the top of the protein, one associated with repeat 6 and the other facilitating a crystal packing contact near repeat 7. Another forms a packing contact on repeat 4, and the fourth is found in the central pore (Fig. 1). Interestingly, non-WD repeat β-propeller enzymes have been shown to bind cofactors, including calcium, in the central tunnel (30.Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 960-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Bub3p Function—Various experiments have demonstrated that Bub1p and Mad3p bind directly to Bub3p during checkpoint function (11.Hardwick K.G. Johnston R.C. Smith D.L. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 12.Roberts R.T. Farr K.A. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8282-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 31.Seeley T.W. Wang L. Zhen J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments have shown that both of these proteins have two homologous segments dubbed region I and region II (11.Hardwick K.G. Johnston R.C. Smith D.L. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In both proteins, region I has been shown to be involved in the interaction with Cdc20p, an activator of the anaphase promoting complex. Likewise, region II is responsible for Mad3p binding (11.Hardwick K.G. Johnston R.C. Smith D.L. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and Bub1p binding to Bub3p (29.Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison between Bub1p and Mad3p show that 21 of 42 of the residues composing region II in Bub1p are identical, including many charged side chains (29.Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This high level of sequence conservation in the Bub3p binding domain would strongly suggest that they bind to the same surface of Bub3p. To determine the location of surface residues interacting with partner proteins in Bub3p, the location of previously known mutations was examined. A deletion of residues 218–221 has been reported that corresponds to the removal of a major portion of strand C in WD repeat number 5 (29.Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Because these are internal residues, their deletion would severely destabilize or hamper the folding of the protein rather than specifically affect binding. Two surface mutants have also been constructed (W31G and W120G) yielding a protein that fails to bind to a complex of the checkpoint proteins Mad2p, Mad3p, and Cdc20p, possibly by disrupting a direct interaction with Mad3p (28.Fraschini R. Beretta A. Sironi L. Musacchio A. Lucchini G. Piatti S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6648-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These are found at the C-terminal end of the B strands of repeats 1 and 3 which composes a part of the top of the propeller, a region implicated in partner protein binding in other WD repeat proteins (Fig. 2A). To further define the protein binding surface of Bub3p, we have used error-prone PCR to produce mutant proteins that fail to rescue a BUB3-null strain when plated on selective media containing benomyl (Fig. 3). Several hundred colonies that gave reproducible phenotypes were further characterized. After identifying and discarding those with empty vectors, multiple mutations, frameshifts, and stop codons, there remained eight clones with single point mutations at positions 2, 188, 191, 192, 193, 226, 276, and 278. Mapping of these mutants to the protein structure revealed that most occur on the top and side of the propeller (Fig. 2A), regions which have been implicated in protein binding in other WD proteins (Fig. 4) (24.Lambright D.G.

The Q2L mutation may cause the formation of an unstable N terminus of Bub3p. The hydrophobic properties of leucine could affect the stability in the solvent-exposed surface of the D strand. This mutation is at the site of the “molecular velcro” of Bub3p where the N terminus forms the first D strand of the last blade, thereby securing the head to the tail end of the protein (Fig. 1A). This is a region that has been noted by others as important for protein stability. Despite this, the mutant appears to be stable within the cell as shown by Western blots (Fig. 5A). The mutant E188V removes the hydrogen bond of Glu-188 to the Trp-174 side chain, putatively perturbing its interactions with Arg-176, located 4 Å away. This arginine is solvent-exposed, and its mutation to a glutamate destroys Bub3p checkpoint function (described below). The surface mutations G191R, L192E, and K193T also appear on the top side of the propeller and are also located within proximity of arginine at position 217. The mutation of this arginine to a glutamate also destroys checkpoint function. Residues Glu-188, Gly-191, Leu-192, and Lys-193 are found between the N terminus and the middle of the D strand of repeat 5. The Q226L mutant is located at the top of strand C and D of repeat 6. S"
https://openalex.org/W2031543574,"The modulation of ion channel activity by extracellular ions plays a central role in the control of heart function. Here, we show that the sinoatrial pacemaker current If is strongly affected by the extracellular Cl– concentration. We investigated the molecular basis of the Cl– dependence in heterologously expressed hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels that represent the molecular correlate of If. Currents carried by the two cardiac HCN channel isoforms (HCN2 and HCN4) showed the same strong Cl– dependence as the sinoatrial If and decreased to about 10% in the absence of external Cl–. In contrast, the neuronal HCN1 current was reduced to only 50% under the same conditions. Depletion of Cl– did not affect the voltage dependence of activation or the ion selectivity of the channels, indicating that the reduction of If was caused by a decrease of channel conductance. A series of chimeras between HCN1 and HCN2 was constructed to identify the structural determinants underlying the different Cl– dependence of HCN1 and HCN2. Exchange of the ion-conducting pore region was sufficient to switch the Cl– dependence from HCN1- to HCN2-type and vice versa. Replacement of a single alanine residue in the pore of HCN1 (Ala-352) by an arginine residue present in HCN2 at equivalent position (Arg-405) induced HCN2-type chloride sensitivity in HCN1. Our data indicate that Arg-405 is a key component of a domain that allosterically couples Cl– binding with channel activation.

The slow diastolic depolarization in sinoatrial node (SAN) 1The abbreviations used are: SAN, sinoatrial node; Chi, chimera. 1The abbreviations used are: SAN, sinoatrial node; Chi, chimera. cells is the motor of cellular automaticity that drives the spontaneous beating of the heart (1.Biel M. Schneider A. Wahl C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2.Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev.

In addition, the slow diastolic depolarization is in the center of the autonomous control of heart rate because its kinetics is speeded up or slowed down by the release of norepinephrine and acetylcholine from sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve terminals, respectively. Several ionic currents have been proposed to control the time course and slope of slow diastolic depolarizations (e.g. T-type and L-type Ca2+ currents and the sustained inward current Ist), some of which are directly regulated by the autonomous nervous system (4.Schram G. Pourrier M. Melnyk P. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 939-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Among these currents, the hyperpolarization-activated (“pacemaker”) current If plays an outstanding role. As the only current in SAN node, If is dually gated by both hyperpolarized voltages and binding of cAMP, a second messenger, the concentration of which is directly controlled by the activity of β-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. Owing to its dual gating behavior, If contributes both to basal heart rate and to the autonomous regulation of rhythmicity. If is carried by a family of four hyperpolarization activated- and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN1–4) (1.Biel M. Schneider A. Wahl C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 5.Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).

In contrast, HCN2 is not involved in autonomous heart rate control but probably provides a safety mechanism in SAN cells that prevents the diastolic membrane potential from becoming too negative in the presence of excessive hyperpolarizations (e.g. by increased K+-channel activity) (9.Ludwig A. Budde T. Stieber J. Moosmang S. Wahl C. Holthoff K. Langebartels A. Wotjak C. Munsch T. Zong X. Feil S. Feil R. Lancel M. Chien K.R. Konnerth A. Pape H.C. Biel M. Hofmann F.

Given their key role for cardiac pacemaking and heart pathology, it is important to understand how the fine-tuning of HCN channels is achieved.

In the clinical setting, modulation of If by serum electrolytes could be pivotal for cardiac pacemaker function. Indeed, there is experimental evidence that If activity is sensitive to changes of extracellular Cl– concentration (30.Pape H.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 299-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). It has been convincingly demonstrated that If is a purely cationic current and that Cl– does not pass HCN channels (5.Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 30.Pape H.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 299-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Frace et al. (31.Frace A.M. Maruoka F. Noma A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 453: 307-318Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed that the amplitude of rabbit sinoatrial If decreased when extracellular Cl– was replaced by larger anions such as aspartate (31.Frace A.M. Maruoka F. Noma A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 453: 307-318Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This finding could have considerable clinical relevance since in hypochloremia, plasma Cl– concentration can drop to values as low as 60 mm (32.Peco-Antic A. Dimitrijevic N. Jovanovic O. Marsenic O. Kostic M. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2000; 15: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 33.Mingin G.C. Stock J.A. Hanna M.K. J.

The inhibition of If at low Cl– may well lead to the impairment of pacemaker function and, hence, to the induction of dysrhythmia.In the last couple of years, genetic mouse models have opened novel perspectives to investigate the (patho)physiological role of ion channels in heart. Since it was not known so far whether or not murine If is regulated by Cl–, we set out in this study to characterize in mouse SAN the modulatory effect of this anion. We then determined structural determinants underlying the Cl– dependence of If in cloned cardiac HCN channels. To this end, we made use of our finding that HCN2 and HCN4 channels profoundly differ from the HCN1 isoform in terms of their sensitivity to Cl–. This diversity allowed us to use chimeras constructed between HCN1 and HCN2 to pinpoint individual amino acid residues underlying the Cl– effect.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology—mHCN1/mHCN2 chimeric channel mutants and site-directed mutations were constructed in the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen).

Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) was replaced by DNA fragments generated in several overlapping PCR steps, which contained the desired sequence and mutations. All constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. In Chi1, amino acids Ile-326–Leu-419 of mHCN2 were replaced by Ile-273–Leu-366 of mHCN1. In Chi2, amino acids Asn-376–Ser-410 of HCN2 were replaced by Asn-323–Ser-357 of HCN1. In Chi3, amino acids Ile-273–Ser-388 of HCN1 were replaced by Ile-326–Ser-441 of mHCN2. In Chi4, amino acids Asn-323–Ser-357 of HCN1 were replaced by Asn-376–Ser-411 of HCN2. All other chimera and mutant HCN1/HCN2 channels were as indicated in Fig. 5.Cell Culture and Heterologous Expression—HEK293 cells (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C with 10% CO2. For microscopy and electrophysiological analysis, glass coverslips were coated in 24-well dishes with poly-l-lysine (Sigma), and 30,000 HEK293 cells/well were seeded. After 24 h, the cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids using FuGENE 6® transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics).Electrophysiology—Currents were measured at room temperature 2–3 days after transfection using whole cell patch clamp technique. The following extracellular solutions were used. The standard extracellular solution was composed of (in mm): 110 NaCl; 0.5 MgCl2; 1.8 CaCl2; 5 HEPES; 30 KCl; pH = 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. 145 iodide-solution was composed of (in mm): 110 NaI; 0.5 magnesium gluconate; 1.8 calcium gluconate; 5 HEPES; 30 KI; pH = 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. 0 chloride/aspartate-solution was composed of (in mm): 110 sodium aspartate; 0.5 magnesium gluconate; 1.8 calcium gluconate; 5 HEPES; 30 potassium aspartate, pH = 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. 0 chloride/gluconate-solution was composed of (in mm): 110 sodium gluconate; 0.5 magnesium gluconate; 1.8 calcium gluconate; 5 HEPES; 30 potassium gluconate, pH = 7.4. The intracellular solution contained (in mm): 130 KCl; 10 NaCl; 3 MgATP; 0.5 MgCl2; 1 EGTA; 5 HEPES; pH = 7.4, adjusted with KOH. The extracellular solutions were exchanged by a local solution exchanger. The different solutions reached the cell membrane within less than 100 ms. All recordings were obtained at room temperature. Data were acquired at 10 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 8 (Axon Instruments). Voltage clamp data were stored on the computer hard disk and analyzed off-line by using Clamp-fit 8 (Axon Instruments). Current amplitudes were measured as the difference between the instantaneous current at the beginning of a 2.5-(HCN1 and HCN2) or 4-s (sinoatrial node cells and HCN4) hyperpolarizing step from a holding potential of –40 mV to –140 mV and the steady-state current at the end of the hyperpolarizing step. The effect of extracellular Cl– concentration [Cl–]e was quantified by calculating the remaining (Cl–-insensitive) component of If at –140 mV in %, Irem = I0m [Cl–]e/I145 mm [Cl–]e * 100 with I145 mm [Cl–]e and I0 mm [Cl–]e, defined as the current amplitudes in the presence of extracellular solutions containing 145 mm Cl– or 0 mm Cl–, respectively. For HCN1 and HCN2 channels, a dose-response relation was determined on the basis of 10 different [Cl–]e. For a given [Cl–]e, the Cl–-sensitive component of the If was determined at –140 mV in % as follows: Isens = ((Ixmm [Cl–]e – I0mm [Cl–]e)/(I145 mm [Cl–]e – I0mm [Cl–]e)) * 100 where Ixm m [Cl–]e represents the current amplitude in a solution containing a given [Cl–]e. The data were then fitted to the Hill equation, 100 × (1/(1+(Kd/[Cl–]e))ν) in which ν is the Hill coefficient and Kd is the apparent dissociation constant.For determination of half-maximum activation voltage (V0.5), steady-state activation curves were determined by hyperpolarizing voltages (–140 to –30 mV) from a holding potential of –40 mV for 2.25 s followed by a step to –140 mV. Tail currents immediately after the final step to –140 mV were normalized to maximal current at –140 mV (Imax) and plotted as a function of the preceding membrane potential. The data points were fitted with the Boltzmann function: (I – Imin)/(Imax – Imin) = [1 – exp([Vm – V0.5]/k)], where Imin is an offset caused by a non-zero holding current, Vm is the test potential, V0.5 is the membrane potential for half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. Time constants of channel activation (τact) of HCN1 and HCN2 channels were determined by monoexponential function fitting the current evoked during hyperpolarizing voltage pulses to –140 mV. As has been described earlier, the initial lag in the activation of HCN channel currents was excluded from the fitting procedure (36.Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). For reversal potentials (Erev), tail currents were recorded immediately after stepping to a family of test voltages ranging from –70 to 0 mV preceded by a 2.5-s prepulse to either –140 or –20 mV. The difference of tail currents resulting from the two prepulse potentials was plotted against the test potentials, and Erev was determined from the intersection of the I/V curve with the voltage axis (35.Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Changes of liquid junction potentials were either calculated using the JPCalc software (Dr. P. Barry, University of South Wales, Sydney, Australia (37.Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar)) or directly measured by a free-flowing KCl electrode. Liquid junction potentials were –7.4 mV for solution containing 130 mm aspartate, 3.1 mV for solution containing 145 mm Cl–, and 2.9 mV for solution containing 140 mm I–. These values were used for a a posteriori correction (38.Neher E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). For all experiments, agar bridges were used as reference electrode to minimize electrode offsets.Isolation of Murine Sinoatrial Node Cells—Isolated SAN cells were prepared from adult C57BL6/J mice of either sex, aged 8–12 weeks as described (9.Ludwig A. Budde T. Stieber J. Moosmang S. Wahl C. Holthoff K. Langebartels A. Wotjak C. Munsch T. Zong X. Feil S. Feil R. Lancel M. Chien K.R. Konnerth A. Pape H.C. Biel M. Hofmann F.

The animals were treated in accordance to German legislation on the protection of animals. Single SAN cells were plated onto glass coverslips. For whole cell patch clamp recordings, 5 mm BaCl2 was added to the recording solution; in experiments with 0 mm Cl–, 1 mm BaOH was added. Higher BaOH concentrations were not compatible with a pH of 7.4.Statistics—All values are given as mean ± S.E. n = number of experiments. An unpaired student's t test was performed for the comparison between two groups. Significance was also tested by analysis of variance if multiple comparisons were made. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSIf of Murine SAN Cells Is Highly Sensitive to Changes in Extracellular Cl– Concentration—Spindle-shaped pacemaker cells were isolated from the SAN node region of adult mouse hearts and were analyzed using the whole cell patch clamp method (Fig. 1A). In extracellular solution containing a physiological concentration of Cl– (105 mm), nearly every cell investigated showed a prominent If upon hyperpolarizing steps to –140 mV (Fig. 1B). The current was non-inactivating and reached steady-state values within 3 s. Increasing extracellular Cl– to 125 mm did not significantly affect the maximal current (Imax), whereas reduction to 85, 65, and 5 mm decreased Imax by 9.9 ± 1.9% (n = 23), 21 ± 3.8%., (n = 4), and 54 ± 4.2% (n = 6), respectively (Fig. 1C). On complete substitution of extracellular Cl– by aspartate, the remaining current (Irem) was only 12.6 ± 2.1% (n = 14) of the current evoked at 105 mm extracellular Cl– (Fig. 1, B and C).Fig. 1Effects of varying [Cl–]e on If from murine SAN cells. A, spindle-shaped pacemaker cell isolated from mouse SAN. B, whole cell current traces obtained in extracellular solutions containing 105 mm Cl– (closed circle) and 0 mm Cl– (open circle). If was maximally activated by stepping for 4 s from a holding potential of –40 mV to –140 mV. C, percental changes of If amplitudes measured at the indicated [Cl–]e as compared with the amplitude obtained at 105 mm Cl–. Values are calculated as mean ± S.E. from 10, 15, 25, 23, 4, 6, and 14 SAN cells (left to right). Aspartate was used for partial and total replacement of extracellular Cl–.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HCN2- and HCN4-mediated Currents Are More Affected by Changes in Extracellular Cl– than HCN1 Currents—To investigate whether or not sensitivity to extracellular Cl– was also a feature of cloned HCN channels, we expressed the two cardiac HCN channel isoforms, HCN2 and HCN4, as well as the neuronal HCN1, in HEK293 cells. Fig. 2A shows representative current traces of the three channels obtained in 145 mm Cl– and in the absence of Cl–. Like the native cardiac If, HCN2 and HCN4 currents were almost completely abolished (about 90% reduction) when Cl– was replaced by aspartate. In contrast, the maximal HCN1 current was suppressed by only about 50% in the complete absence of Cl–. Replacement of intracellular Cl– by aspartate or gluconate in inside-out patch measurements had no influence on HCN channel currents (data not shown). To exclude that the inhibition of Imax was caused by a block induced by aspartate rather than reflecting a true Cl– depletion effect, HCN1 and HCN2 currents were also measured in the presence of gluconate, an anion that has a comparable size as aspartate but is structurally unrelated to it. The reduction of Imax measured under these ionic conditions was virtually identical to that seen in aspartate solution. (HCN1, Irem = 48.6 ± 1.5%, n = 7; HCN2, Irem = 8.3 ± 1.9%, n = 4). There was no difference between the absolute magnitude of HCN1 and HCN2 currents recorded in either gluconate or aspartate solution (not shown). Taken together, these data indicated that If is indeed controlled by extracellular Cl–.Fig. 2Dependence of HCN currents on [Cl–]e. A, whole cell current traces at 145 mm [Cl–]e (filled circle) and 0 mm [Cl–e] (closed circle) evoked by 2.5-s voltage steps (4 s for HCN4) to –140 mV in HEK293 cells expressing HCN1, HCN2, or HCN4. The remaining component of If (Irem) in 0 mm [Cl–]e was 47.3 ± 1.4% (n = 23) for HCN1, n 6.5 ± 1.7% (= 10) for HCN2, and 10.2 ± 2.8% (n = 7) for HCN4. B, dose-response relationship for procental activation of Cl–-sensitive component of maximal HCN current (Isens) versus [Cl]e. For calculation of Isens, see “Experimental Procedures.” The continuous lines represent fits to the Hill equation. Data points were obtained from n = 8–25 cells for HCN1 (closed circles) and from n = 10–27 cells for HCN2 (open circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The failure of the large anions aspartate and gluconate to compensate for the lack of the smaller Cl– suggested that the effectiveness of If activation was determined by the molecular size of an anion. Indeed, the activity of HCN1 and HCN2 was fully maintained if Cl– was replaced by I–, an anion that is only slightly bigger than Cl–. Interestingly, currents in 145 mm I– were even somewhat bigger than in the presence of equimolar extracellular Cl– (increase of 8.4 ± 1.2% (n = 18) and 11.1 ± 3.3% (n = 10) for Imax of HCN1 and HCN2, respectively (p < 0.05)).Characterization of the Cl– Dependence of HCN1 and HCN2—In the following, we set out to determine the structural determinants conferring the differences in the Cl– dependence between HCN1 and HCN2. We first determined the dose-response relationship of the Cl–-sensitive fraction of Imax versus the extracellular Cl– concentration (Fig. 2B). Fitting the data to the Hill equation yielded apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of 45.6 and 32.7 mm for HCN1 and HCN2, respectively. The corresponding Hill coefficients were νHCN1 = 1.28 and νHCN2 = 1.39.We next investigated to which extent the decrease of extracellular Cl– influenced the biophysical properties of HCN1 and HCN2 currents. Reduction of Cl– concentration resulted in a slight but significant deceleration of opening kinetics in both HCN1 and HCN2 (Fig. 3, A and B, and Table I). By contrast, the extracellular Cl– concentration had no influence on the voltage dependence of HCN1 and HCN2 activation (Fig. 3, C and D, and Table I). Similarly, decreasing the Cl– concentration or replacing Cl– by I– did not alter the reversal potential Erev of the I/V curves for fully activated HCN1 and HCN2 channels (Fig. 3, E and F, and Table I). However, reducing the Cl– concentration decreased the slope conductance of the fully activated I/V curves (Fig. 3, E and F), whereas replacement of Cl– by I– increased it (not shown).Fig. 3Effects of [Cl–]e on biophysical properties of HCN1 and HCN2 currents.

We assumed that the amino acid residues conferring Cl– dependence were localized in the outer pore region of the channel, where they were involved in the control of ion permeation. To test for this hypothesis, we constructed four chimeric channels in which the region spanning from transmembrane domain S5 to S6 (including the pore) or only the pore region was exchanged between HCN1 and HCN2 (Fig. 4). Chimera (Chi) 1 and Chi2 containing the S5-S6 region or only the pore of HCN2 inserted into the backbone of HCN1, respectively, showed virtually the same sensitivity to depletion of Cl– as HCN2. The remaining current fraction in the absence of external Cl– was 7.8 ± 1.5% (n = 11) and 6.4 ± 1.4% (n = 8), which is not significantly different from the value of 6.5% determined for HCN2 (Fig. 2). Similarly, HCN2 acquired a HCN1-like Cl– sensitivity when its S5-S6 sequence (Chi3, Irem 46.6 ± 1.7 (n = 16)) or pore (Chi4 Irem of 39.2 ± 1.7 (n = 11)) was exchanged by the corresponding portions of HCN1.Fig. 4The pore loop determines the sensitivity for [Cl–]e in HCN1 and HCN2.

The corresponding current traces evoked at –140 mV in 145 and 0 mm [Cl–]e (closed and open circles, respectively) are shown below the channels. Transmembrane regions are labeled 1–6. Chi2 contains the backbone of HCN1 and the pore loop of HCN2, and Chi4 has the backbone of HCN2 and the pore loop of HCN1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

The origin of the very low midpoint potential of the quinone is investigated by introducing anthraquinone (AQ) into PS I in the presence and absence of the iron-sulfur clusters. Solvent extraction and reincubation is used to obtain PS I particles containing AQ and the iron-sulfur clusters, whereas incubation of the menB rubA double mutant yields PS I with AQ in the PhQ site but no iron-sulfur clusters. Transient electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to investigate the orientation of AQ in the binding site and the ET kinetics. The low temperature spectra suggest that the orientation of AQ in all samples is the same as that of PhQ in native PS I. In PS I containing the iron sulfur clusters, (i) the rate of forward electron transfer from the AQ·– to FX is found to be faster than from PhQ·– to FX, and (ii) the spin polarization patterns provide indirect evidence that the preceding ET step from A0·− to quinone is slower than in the native system. The changes in the kinetics are in accordance with the more negative reduction midpoint potential of AQ. Moreover, a comparison of the spectra in the presence and absence of the iron-sulfur clusters suggests that the midpoint potential of AQ is more negative in the presence of FX. The electron transfer from the AQ– to FX is found to be thermally activated with a lower apparent activation energy than for PhQ in native PS I. The spin polarization patterns show that the triplet character in the initial state of P700·+AQ·− increases with temperature. This behavior is rationalized in terms of a model involving a distribution of lifetimes/redox potentials for A0 and related competition between charge recombination and forward electron transfer from the radical pair P700·+A0·−.

Both photosystems use light to drive the transfer of an electron from a chlorophyll dimer as donor on the luminal side of the complex via an intermediate acceptor to a quinone on the stromal side. In PS I, the chlorophyll dimer is referred to as P700, the intermediate is a chlorophyll monomer, called A0, and the quinone, A1 is phylloquinone (PhQ). In PS II, the chlorophyll dimer is P680, the intermediate is pheophytin, and the quinone, QA is plastoquinone-9. The x-ray structures of the two complexes (1.Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar, 2.Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P.

Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar) show that the structural arrangement of these co-factors is very similar with two nearly symmetric branches of acceptors extending across the membrane from the chlorophyll dimer. The structures also reveal an accessory chlorophyll monomer located between P680 and pheophytin in PS II and between P700 and A0 in PS I. The function of these accessory chlorophylls is uncertain at present, but it is likely that they are involved in the initial charge separation acting as either primary acceptor or primary donor. Despite these similarities, the redox potentials of the radical ions generated by the electron transfer are very different in the two systems (see Ref. 5.Blankenship R.E. Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis. Blackwell Science Inc., Oxford, UK2002: 95-124Crossref Google Scholar for a comparison). On the luminal side, the redox couple P680/P680·+ in PS II has a midpoint potential, which is about half a volt more positive than that of P700/P700·+ in PS I. On the stromal side, the redox potential of A1/A1·− in PS I is more negative than that of QA/QA·− again by at least half a volt. Thus, oxygenic photosynthetic organisms appear to have evolved two versions of essentially the same complex with PS II being optimized to produce the strong oxidizing potential required to split water in the lumen, whereas PS I has been optimized to produce a very negative reduction potential in the stroma. In this respect, phylloquinone, which is a bound intermediate and acts as a strong reductant in the electron transfer chain, is unusual. Quinones more typically function as mobile electron and proton carriers, and in the thylakoid membrane they act primarily as a sink (quinone pool) for the electrons transferred through PS II (6.Cramer W.A. Knaff D.B. Energy Transduction in Biological Membranes. Springer, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the origin of the large difference in the single reduction midpoint potentials of phylloquinone as A1 in PS I and plastoquinone as QA in PS II. Experiments in which the same quinone is incorporated into both photosystems show that the difference is induced almost completely by the respective protein environment. This is demonstrated most clearly by the fact that when plastoquinone is incorporated into the A1 site in PS I, its reduction midpoint potential is several hundred mV more negative than when it is in the QA binding site in PS II (7.Semenov A.Y. Vassiliev I.R. van der Est A. Mamedov M.D. Zybailov B. Shen G.Z. Stehlik D. Diner B.A. Chitnis P.R. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23429-23438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). By comparison, the difference in midpoint potentials of PhQ and PQ (less than 100 mV) is much smaller. Although the redox potential of the quinone in a given reaction center is largely determined by the respective protein environments, the molecular structure of the quinone itself is of some importance. Introducing a series of structurally related quinones allows the redox potential of the electron transfer co-factor to be varied systematically so that its influence on the kinetics can be studied. Extensive investigations of this type have been carried out on purple bacterial reaction centers (bRCs) (8.Gunner M.R. Dutton P.L. J. Am. Chem.

They estimated ΔG0 for the electron transfer (ET) from A0 to A1 in each case, and using the ET rates measured by absorbance difference spectroscopy, they constructed a Marcus plot for the reaction. From the plot, it was concluded that the native PhQ gives the optimal ET rate (14.Iwaki M. Kumazaki S. Yoshihara K. Erabi T. Itoh S. J. Phys.

However, a reliable relationship between ΔG0 and the rate of this reaction has not been established. In nearly all cases studied so far, the midpoint potential of the nonnative quinones has been more positive than PhQ, and the rate of forward electron transfer from A1 to FX was slower than in native PS I or even blocked. In contrast, the effect of pushing the quinone midpoint potential to values more negative than in the native system has not been investigated yet.In this work, we use transient EPR to investigate the effect on the electron transfer kinetics of introducing anthraquinone (AQ) into the A1 site. This will allow us to study the correlated effect on the rate of electron transfer from A0 to A1 and from A1 to FX, when the midpoint potential of the acceptor in the A1 is more negative than that of PhQ. We will show that the electron transfer rate from AQ to FX is faster than in native PS I, and to the best of our knowledge this is the only example of a nonnative acceptor that demonstrates faster electron transfer than the native one in a photosynthetic reaction center. On the other hand, the more negative redox potential of AQ is also expected to slow the preceding electron transfer step from A0 to A1. If the lifetime of the primary radical pair becomes long enough, singlet-triplet mixing will occur and will influence the spin polarization of all subsequent radical pairs (22.Pedersen J.B.

Here, we will demonstrate that with AQ in the A1 site, the transient EPR spectra show clear evidence for singlet-triplet mixing in the primary radical pair.MATERIALS AND METHODSQuinones—Quinones and the reagents for the preparation of buffers were purchased from Aldrich. Commercial anthraquinone was purified by column chromatography on aluminum.Preparation of Photosystem I Samples—PS I isolated from Synechocystis PCC 6803 was prepared by the method of Biggins and Mathis (16.Biggins J. Mathis P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1494-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The isolated PS I was lyophilized, and the native phylloquinone was removed by solvent extraction using hexane (99%; Aldrich) containing 0.3% methanol (Caledon) as also described in Ref. 17.Sieckman I. van der Est A. Bottin H. Sétif P. Stehlik D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. The extraction of the phylloquinone was monitored using a modified Bruker ESP 200 X-band spectrometer (described below) by measuring the disappearance of the spin polarized EPR signal due to P700·+A1·− and the accompanying appearance of the characteristic polarization pattern of 3P700 formed by recombination from P700·+A0·−. The loss of other pigments was monitored using the visible absorption spectrum of the supernatant recorded with a Unicam UV-visible spectrometer. Samples for EPR analysis were prepared by suspending 15 mg of extracted PS I in 150 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tricine, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% Triton X-100. A homogenizer was used to ensure complete resuspension. Anthraquinone was introduced into the A1 binding site by adding ∼5 μl of a ∼150 mm solution of AQ in Me2SO to the resuspended PS I sample and in the dark at 4 °C for several hours. The incorporation of quinone into the A1 site was monitored by observing the appearance of a spin polarized EPR spectrum due to P700·+AQ·− accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of the 3P700 spectrum. A control experiment using a blank of the solvent containing no quinone was also performed, and no change in the transient EPR spectra was observed. For the EPR experiments, 1 mm sodium ascorbate and 50 μm phenazine methosulfate were added as external redox agents, and the samples were frozen in the dark.Transient EPR Spectroscopy—Control experiments and monitoring of the extraction and reconstitution of the quinone were carried out at X-band using a modified Bruker ESP 200 spectrometer equipped with a home-built, broad band amplifier (bandwidth >500 MHz). A rectangular resonator and a liquid nitrogen temperature control unit were used, and the samples were illuminated using a Q-switched, frequency-doubled Continuum Surelite Nd-YAG laser at 532 nm with a repetition rate of 10 Hz.All other X-band transient EPR experiments were carried out using a Bruker ER046 XK-T microwave bridge equipped with a Flexline dielectric resonator (34.van der Est A. Bock C. Golbeck J. Brettel K. Sétif P. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11789-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and an Oxford liquid helium gas flow cryostat. The loaded Q value for this dielectric ring resonator was about Q = 3000, equivalent to a rise time of τr = Q/(2π * νmw) ≈ 50 ns. Q-band (35-GHz) transient EPR spectra of the samples were also measured with the same set-up except that a Bruker ER 056 QMV microwave bridge equipped with a home-built cylindrical resonator with access for light irradiation was used. The samples were illuminated using a Spectra Physics Nd-YAG/MOPO laser system operating at 10 Hz at either the second harmonic 532 nm or near the long wavelength absorption edge of PS I at ∼700 nm.RESULTSEfficiency of Incorporation of AQ into the A1 Binding Site— When native PhQ is extracted from PS I, the spin polarization pattern of the 3P700 state, formed by recombination of the primary radical pair state P700·+A0·−, is observed. The relative amplitudes of the spectra of 3P700versus P700·+A1·− provide a convenient measure of the remaining occupancy of the A1 site, which was used to monitor the quinone extraction (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 35.Pushkar Y.N. Zech S.G. Stehlik D. Brown S. van der Est A. Zimmermann H. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 12052-12058Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The incorporation of AQ into the A1 site during quinone reconstitution can also be monitored in this way. However, as we will discuss below, the spin polarization patterns suggest that the electron transfer from A0 to AQ is inefficient and that some charge recombination to 3P700 probably occurs even when the A1 site is occupied. Thus, only the functional occupancy of the A1 site can be estimated from the amplitude ratio of the 3P700 and P700·+AQ·− spectra. As shown in the accompanying paper (36.Sakuragi Y. Zybailov B. Shen G. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. Diner B.A. Karygina I. Pushkar Y. Stehlik D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 12371-12381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar), AQ has a lower affinity for the A1 site compared with other quinones. Consistent with this, the 3P700 spectrum is not lost completely when extracted PS I is incubated with AQ. Nonetheless, the transient EPR spectra of P700·+AQ·− can be recorded with a good signal/noise ratio for detailed analysis.Low Temperature Transient EPR Spectra of P700·+AQ·−—Fig. 1 shows a comparison of X-band (top) and Q-band (bottom) spectra of P700·+PhQ·− in native PS I and P700·+AQ·− in solvent-extracted PS I reconstituted with AQ. Simulations of the spectra (dashed curves) are also shown. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the transient EPR spectra of both samples exhibit the same overall polarization pattern (i.e. E/A/E (where E represents emission and A is absorption) at X-band and E/A/A/E/A at Q-band). Note that the total spectral width is lower for P700·+AQ·−. This is consistent with the smaller g-tensor anisotropy of AQ and the absence of the partially resolved methyl hyperfine coupling (hfc), which represents a major contribution to the spectral width of the X-band spectrum of P700·+PhQ·− in native PS I (37.van der Est A.

B. 2000; 104: 9728-9739Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The methyl hfc is strongest along the C–CH3 bond, which is close to the principal y axis of the PhQ·–g-tensor. When the magnetic field is along this axis, the methyl hfc is partially resolved as seen on the central absorptive feature of the P700·+PhQ·− spectrum. The methyl hfc is most noticeable as a shoulder on the central absorption at X-band and as a series of small peaks in the Q-band spectrum. AQ has no methyl substituent, and the hfcs of the outer ring protons are expected to be small. Correspondingly, the P700·+AQ·− spectrum shows a much narrower absorptive feature in the center of the spectrum.The hfcs for quinones in the A1 site in PS I are different from those observed in polar solution or reaction centers of purple bacteria. These differences provide a sensitive indicator for the asymmetry of the spin density distribution in the different environments, and from this observed asymmetry the asymmetry of hydrogen bonding can be deduced (20.Johnson T.W. Zybailov B. Jones A.D. Bittl R. Zech S. Stehlik D. Golbeck J.H. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39512-39521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41.Pushkar Y.N.

B. 2004; 108: 9439-9448Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A dominant hydrogen bond to the carbonyl group ortho to the phytyl tail and meta to the methyl group leads to an increased hfc constant for the methyl protons (35.Pushkar Y.N. Zech S.G. Stehlik D. Brown S. van der Est A. Zimmermann H. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 12052-12058Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39.Kamlowski A. Altenberg-Greulich B. van der Est A. Zech S.G. Bittl R. Fromme P.

B. 2000; 104: 9728-9739Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the A1 site, AQ is expected to bind with the same highly asymmetric bond scheme as PhQ. As a consequence, high spin density is predicted at the outer ring carbon position, which is two carbon atoms away from the hydrogen-bonded carbonyl group. The protons at these two positions have their bond axes along the molecular x direction. The dominant hyperfine axis of an aromatic C–H fragment is expected to be in-plane and perpendicular to the C–H bond (43.Carrington A. McLachlan A.D. Introduction to Magnetic Resonance with Applications to Chemistry and Chemical Physics. Harper and Row, New York1967Google Scholar); thus, the largest coupling would be expected along the molecular y axis. However, the hyperfine couplings for AQ are small and cannot be resolved directly in the EPR spectrum. Pulsed ENDOR spectroscopy will be used to confirm the same asymmetric hydrogen bonding scheme for AQ in the A1 site as established for native PhQ.Quinone-protein interactions are also reflected in differences of the observed quinone g-tensor components in different environments (e.g. solution, native A1 site, A1 sites modified by mutation) (44.Burghaus O.

Unfortunately, both hydrogen bond formation and π stacking lead to quite small and generally opposite (i.e. compensating) shifts in the g-tensor anisotropy (38.Kamlowski A. Zech S.G. Fromme P.

Paschenko S.V. Gast P. Hoff A.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 6815-6823Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Table I) shows a larger g-tensor anisotropy in PS I. The same has been found for other quinones in PS I versus bRC (45.van der Est A. Sieckmann I. Lubitz W. Stehlik D. Chem. Phys. 1995; 194: 349-359Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 49.Lubitz W.

The analogous qualitative changes in all of these cases provide additional evidence that AQ in PS I experiences very similar protein cofactor interactions (hydrogen bond formation and π stacking) as phylloquinone in the wild type.Table ISummary of magnetic and geometric parameters used in the simulations shown in Figs. 1 and 5g-TensorLine widthsaGaussian half-width.

https://openalex.org/W2020388070,"Proteins from the endocytic pathway in bloodstream forms of Trypanosome brucei are modified by the addition of linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine side chains, which permits their isolation by tomato lectin affinity chromatography. Antibodies against this tomato lectin binding fraction were employed to screen a cDNA expression library from bloodstream forms of T. brucei. Two cDNAs were prominent among those selected. These cDNAs coded for two putative protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) that respectively contained one and two double-cysteine redox-active sites and corresponded to a single domain PDI and a class 1 PDI. Assays of the purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that both proteins possess isomerase activity, but only the single domain PDI had a reducing activity. These PDIs possess a number of unusual features that distinguish them from previously characterized PDIs. The expression of both is developmentally regulated, they both co-localize with markers of the endocytic pathway, and both are modified by N-glycosylation. The larger PDI possesses N-glycans containing poly-N-acetyllactosamine, a modification that is indicative of processing in the Golgi and suggests the presence of a novel trafficking pathway for PDIs in trypanosomes. Although generally PDIs are considered essential, neither activity appeared to be essential for the growth of trypanosomes, at least in vitro."

The insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; ACN, acetonitrile; M6PR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; ACN, acetonitrile; M6PR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. are important regulators of growth, differentiation, and survival. Both their mitogenic and metabolic effects are for the most part mediated through binding and activation of the IGF-I receptor (1LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). The interaction of IGFs with the IGF-I receptor is controlled by a family of six high affinity IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6) exhibiting strong sequence homology. The cysteine-rich N- and C-terminal domains are conserved across all IGFBPs, and both domains appear to be involved in IGF binding (2Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). In the circulation, the majority of the IGFs are sequestered into ternary 150-kDa complexes with either IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-5 and the 85-kDa acid-labile subunit, prolonging the half-life of IGFs, controlling their transcapillary transport to the target tissues, and functioning as a circulating reservoir of IGFs (4Baxter R.C.

Metab. 2002; 87: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The IGFBPs can also form binary complexes with IGFs. Limited proteolysis of IGFBPs appears to be the major mechanism for the release of IGFs from binary and ternary IGFBP complexes, resulting in the generation of IGFBP fragments with reduced affinities for IGFs (7Maile L.A.

Several cation- and serine-dependent serum proteases, such as a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 12S, matrix metalloprotease-3, α-kallikrein, plasmin, thrombin, and the pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), have been reported to cleave IGFBPs (9Campbell P.G.

Recent studies have shown that IGFBP-3, IGFBP-5, and their IGF-I·IGFBP complexes interact also with other serum proteins. Thus, plasminogen (16Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar), fibrinogen, fibrin (17Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Hayes J.D. Suwanichkul A. Powell D.R. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were found to interact with IGFBP-5. Additionally, vitronectin has been reported to interact with IGFBP-2, -3, -4, and -5 (21Kricker J.A. Towne C.L. Firth S.M. Herington A.C. Upton Z. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2807-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is likely that the IGFBP interactions with proteins involved in wound healing processes are required to sequester IGFs at wound sites (17Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Hayes J.D. Suwanichkul A. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30215-30221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IGFBP-3 has been demonstrated to bind to transferrin (22Weinzimer S.A. Gibson T.B. Collett-Solberg P.F. Khare A. Liu B. Cohen P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Storch S. Kübler B. Höning S. Ackmann M. Zapf J. Blum W. Braulke T.

Kübler B. Roth W. Scharf J.-G. Saftig P. Peters C. Braulke T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) via transferrin receptors. In the present study, we have identified and characterized several serum proteins co-purified with IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 from an IGF-II affinity matrix. Analysis of their IGF-II and IGFBP-3 binding properties as well as size exclusion chromatography suggest the formation of high molecular mass protein complexes in the circulation that also contain IGFBP-3 proteolytic activity. Materials—IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 were kindly provided by Dr. J. Zapf (University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland). Nonglycosylated recombinant human IGFBP-3 was a kind gift from Dr. A. Sommer (Celtrix, Santa Clara, CA). Recombinant human IGFBP-2 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and IGF-I and biotinylated IGF-II were from GroPep (Adelaide, Australia). IGF-I and IGF-II were iodinated by the chloramine-T method (25Zapf J. Walter H. Froesch E.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1981; 68: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Transferrin, plasminogen, and antithrombin III were purchased from Sigma and α2 antiplasmin from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Prekallikrein was kindly provided by Dr. W. Müller-Esterl (Institute for Biochemistry II, Frankfurt, Germany). Proteins were labeled with Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) using IODO-GEN (Pierce) as described (26Parker K.C. Strominger J.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The hydroxamic acid based-metalloprotease inhibitor tumor necrosis factor α-activating protein inhibitor (TAPI) was prepared at Immunex Corporation (Seattle, WA) (27Möhler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. Alderson M. Kerwar S.S. Torrance D.S. Otten-Evans C. Greenstreet T. Weerawarna K. Kronheim S.R. Petersen M. Gerhart M. Kozlosky C.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift from Dr. S. Rose-John (University of Kiel, Germany). All chromatography media were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Purification of Serum Proteins Eluted from IGF-II Affinity Columns—Cohn fraction IV of human plasma was fractionated as described previously (28Blum W.F. Ranke M.B. Kietzmann K. Gauggel E. Zeisel H.J. Bierich J.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 70: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In brief, Cohn fraction IV was resuspended in 2 m acetic acid, pH 3.0, containing 0.075 m NaCl and mixed with SP-Sephadex C-25 in a batch procedure to remove IGF-I and IGF-II. After adjustment to neutral pH the supernatant was passed over an IGF-II-Sepharose 4B affinity column (1 × 17 cm). The column was washed in retrograde direction with 200 ml of phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (0.05 m sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide), and with 100 ml of water before bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m triethylammonium phosphate, pH 2.8. The elution of IGFBP-3 was monitored by a competitive binding protein assay as described previously (28Blum W.F. Ranke M.B. Kietzmann K. Gauggel E. Zeisel H.J. Bierich J.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 70: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the fractions containing the bulk of eluted IGFBP-3 were applied to reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC, C18 column, 1 × 50 cm, Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) in 0.1 m triethylammonium phosphate. Bound polypeptides were eluted with a gradient from 0 to 44% acetonitrile (ACN). Fractions of 4 ml were collected and assayed for IGF-binding capacity using a competitive binding protein assay with [125I]IGF-I as tracer and for IGFBP-1, -2, and -3 using specific radioimmunosorbent assays (28Blum W.F. Ranke M.B. Kietzmann K. Gauggel E. Zeisel H.J. Bierich J.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 70: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Fifty microliters of the eluate fraction of the IGF-II affinity chromatography column were loaded on a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30-size exclusion column equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, on a SMART HPLC system (both from Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted with a flow rate of 40 μl/min, detected by UV absorption at 280 nm, and collected in fractions of 100 μl. Of each fraction 25 or 20 μl was analyzed for Western blotting or IGFBP-3 protease assay (see below), respectively. IGFBP Protease Assay, IGFBP Zymography, and Western and Ligand Blots—To examine fractions for IGFBP proteolytic activity, 10 μl of column fractions were incubated with [125I]IGFBP-2, -3, or -4 (20.000–25.000 cpm) for 16 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2. When indicated, protease inhibitors were included. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) under nonreducing conditions and visualized by autoradiography. Radiolabeled IGFBP-3 zymography and ligand blotting of RP-HPLC fractions (12 μl) using monobiotinylated IGF-II were carried out as described previously (12Kübler B. Cowell S. Zapf J. Braulke T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kübler B. Draeger C. John H. Andag U. Scharf J.-G. Forssmann W.-G. Braulke T. Ständker L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, the HPLC fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE (10 and 15% acrylamide, respectively) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal antibodies against transferrin (Dako, Hamburg, Germany, 1: 5,000), plasminogen (Dako, 1:100), antithrombin III (Dako, 1:1,000), and IGFBP-5 (R&D Systems Inc., 1:1,000) were used. The polyclonal antibody against prekallikrein, kindly provided by Dr. W. Müller-Esterl (30Renné T. Gailani D. Meijers J.C. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4892-4899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was diluted 1:250. The polyclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of the IGF-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF-II/M6PR) has been described previously (31Körner C. Nürnberg B. Uhde M. Braulke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 287-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (1:500). Anti-IGFBP-3 anti-serum (Upstate Biotechnology) was diluted 1:1,000. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Pierce). Surface Plasmon Resonance Interaction Analysis—Interaction measurements were carried out as described previously (32Ständker L. Braulke T. Mark S. Mostafavi H. Meyer M. Höning S. Gimenez-Gallego G. Forssmann W.-G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5082-5088Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using IGF-II- and IGFBP-3-coupled CM5 sensor chips in a BIAcore 3000 (Amersham Biosciences). Biosensor surfaces were coupled to final resonance value of ∼300 response units for IGF-II and ∼600 response units for IG-FBP-3. A flow rate of 10 μl/min with HBS-P (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Polysorbate 20, pH 7.4) as running buffer was used. For sensorgram analysis the 1:1 Langmuir binding model was used, and kinetic rate constants were calculated as described (33Höning S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19884-19890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mass Analysis—To identify eluted proteins, fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Protein bands were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion using a modified trypsin solution (Promega). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry of peptide digests was carried out commercially at the Protein Chemistry Unit, Biomedicum Helsinki, Finland, using a Bruker Daltonics Autoflex mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany). For peptide fingerprint searches, the NCBInr, Swiss Protein, and Mass Spectrometry Protein Sequence databases (MSDB) were used. Cross-linkage Analysis—Cross-linking of [125I]IGF-II to plasminogen was carried out as described previously (23Storch S. Kübler B. Höning S. Ackmann M. Zapf J. Blum W. Braulke T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Plasminogen (0.5 μg) was incubated with [125I]IGF-II (150,000 cpm) in the presence or absence of unlabeled IGF-I or IGF-II (3 μm) for 1 h at 4 °C. Disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce, 0.5 mm) was added, and the reaction mixture was further incubated for 15 min on ice. After the reaction was terminated, the samples were solubilized and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To analyze the formation of protein-transferrin complexes in vitro, transferrin (200 ng) was incubated with or without single or multiple recombinant proteins (each at 200 ng), identified in the eluate of the IGF-II affinity matrix, in phosphate-buffered saline in a total volume of 20 μl. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3, Pierce, 0.5 mm) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, for 15 min followed by transferrin immunoblotting. Multiple Non-IGFBP Plasma Proteins Bind IGF-II—Human plasma Cohn fraction IV was subjected to IGF-II affinity chromatography under neutral conditions, and bound proteins were desorbed with triethylammonium phosphate buffer. Analysis of the proteins of this fraction by SDS-PAGE and silver staining revealed five prominent bands of ∼100, 70, 64, 45, and 29/30 kDa (Fig. 1A). IGF-II ligand blotting demonstrated the presence of IGF-binding proteins of 70, 45, 43, and 30 kDa (Fig. 1B). To examine whether IGFBP proteases were co-purified with IGFBPs by IGF-II affinity chromatography, the eluted protein fraction was tested for [125I]IGFBP-3 protease activity using nonglycosylated recombinant [125I]IGFBP-3 as substrate. Incubation of [125I]IGFBP-3 with increasing concentrations of the eluate fraction (E1–E3) for 16 h at 37 °C resulted in the formation of 21-kDa, and most prominently 14-kDa, fragments, whereas the recombinant nonglycosylated [125I]IGFBP-3 remained intact as a single 30-kDa band in the presence of buffer only (Fig. 1C). The eluate fraction was subsequently separated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 2A). Bound polypeptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of ACN and tested for [125I]IGF-I binding capacity and IGFBP-3 immunoreactivity. Fractions 42–45 eluted by 22.5% ACN contained most of the immunoreactive IGFBP-3 (shown as shaded area in Fig. 2A). Analysis of the protein-containing fractions 36–57 by SDS-PAGE and silver staining revealed protein bands at ∼30 kDa in fractions 36/37 corresponding to an ACN concentration of 19.3% (Fig. 2B, protein 1). The 43/45-kDa doublet in fraction 46 (24% ACN, protein 2) was identified as IGFBP-3 by IGF-II ligand blotting (Fig. 2C) and immunoblotting (Fig. 3). In fractions 50–53 and 53–57 (eluting at 27 and 30% ACN, respectively), proteins of ∼92 and 70 kDa, respectively, were stained (Fig. 2B, proteins 4 and 3, respectively). When the same RP-HPLC fractions were tested by ligand blotting, prominent IGF-II-binding polypeptides of ∼30/33 kDa and of 34 and 43/45 kDa were observed in fractions 36/37 and 46 to 50, respectively (Fig. 2C). Under these ECL exposure time conditions, the 92- and 70-kDa proteins in fractions 50–57 showed no IGF-II binding. These data suggest that the eluted 92- and 70-kDa polypeptides either exhibited low IGF-II binding affinity or bound through interaction with IGFBPs to the IGF-II column.Fig. 3Western blot analysis of RP-HPLC fractions. Aliquots of fractions 36, 46, 53, and 56 were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting for IGFBP-5, IGFBP-3, transferrin, and plasminogen. Recombinant human IGFBP-5 (200 ng), transferrin (100 ng), and plasminogen (50 ng) were used as standards (st) in the respective blots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Silver-stained proteins were further analyzed by mass spectrometry. Protein 1 (Fig. 2B) could be identified as IGFBP-5, protein 2 as IGFBP-3, and protein 3 as transferrin (Table I). The mass analysis of the 92-kDa protein could not be assigned to a specific protein.Table IMass analysis of proteinsProtein no.Measured massPeptide sequenceAmino acidsMatched peptideDa1915.542IISAPEMR177-184IGFBP-5928.425ASPRMVPR205-212931.545IISAPEMR177-1841089.497QESEQGPCR185-1931106.580AVYLPNCDR213-2211104.599HMEASLQKLK195-2041200.600HMEASLQKLK195-2041254.695FVGGAENTAHPR165-1761356.720RHMEASLQHLK194-2041641.937QDEEKPLHALHGR84-972864.569FHPLHSK65-71IGFBP-3944.616FLNVLSPR225-2321010.465ETEYGPCR207-2141038.520GVHIPNCDK234-2421070.472GFCWCVDK260-2671166.577GVHIPNCDKK234-2431166.577RETEYGPCR206-2141166.577ETEYGPCRR207-2151223.633YGQPLPGYTTK268-27831322.792DSAHGFLKVPPR316-327Transferrin1628.902EDPQTFYYAVAVVK108-1211880.922ADRDQYELLCLDNTR237-2512170.042SAGWNIPIGLLYCDLPEPR144-162 Open table in a new tab To confirm these results, Western blotting experiments were performed as shown in Fig. 3. The 32-kDa protein in fraction 36 represents IGFBP-5, and the immunoreactive doublet in fraction 46 was confirmed as IGFBP-3. This fraction contained also small amounts of the 29-kDa IGFBP-3 fragment. The 70-kDa protein in fraction 56 was verified as transferrin. Because it has been reported that both IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 bind to plasminogen migrating at a molecular mass of ∼ 92/97 kDa (16Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar, 34Upton Z. Webb H. Hale K. Yandell C.A. McMurtry J.P. Francis G.L. Ballard F.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2928-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), fraction 53 was also tested for plasminogen immunoreactivity. This fraction contained 92-kDa plasminogen immunoreactive material with a slightly higher molecular mass than the purified standard (Fig. 3). Western blotting analysis of the protein fraction eluted from the IGF-II affinity column showed that additional non-IGFBP proteins such as antithrombin III, prekallikrein and the soluble IGF-II/M6PR bound to the matrix (Fig. 4). Transferrin Affects the Association of Plasminogen to IGF-II and IGFBP-3—We used surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy to measure the rate constants and modulatory effects of transferrin, plasminogen, and IGFBP-3 in solution on binding to IGF-II or IGFBP-3 immobilized on the sensor surface. When transferrin was passed over the IGF-II biosensor surface, a low affinity binding (KD = 976 nm) (23Storch S. Kübler B. Höning S. Ackmann M. Zapf J. Blum W. Braulke T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was determined (Table II). In contrast, under these conditions plasminogen showed a high affinity for IGF-II with a KD value of 5.0 nm, which is comparable with the binding of IGFBP-3 to the IGF-II surface (KD = 3.6 nm) (23Storch S. Kübler B. Höning S. Ackmann M. Zapf J. Blum W. Braulke T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The affinity of plasminogen in combination with transferrin was ∼7-fold lower for IGF-II (KD = 37 nm) than for plasminogen alone. This was mostly due to a reduction of the association rate. The inclusion of IGFBP-3 in the plasminogen/transferrin mixture did not further affect protein binding to the IGF-II surface.Table IIBinding of IGFBP-3, plasminogen, and transferrin to IGFs and IGFBP-3Immobilized ligandAnalytIGF-IIIGFBP-3aNonglycosylated human recombinant protein.KDkakdKDkakdnm×103 1/ms×10-3 1/snm×103 1/ms×10-3 1/sIGFBP-3aNonglycosylated human recombinant protein.3.8390 ± 481.5 ± 0.2PlasminogenbHuman recombinant protein.5.0220 ± 181.1 ± 0.31.3990 ± 2481.3 ± 0.2Plasminogen + IGFBP-35.6180 ± 231.0 ± 0.2TransferrinbHuman recombinant protein.976.02 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.470.046 ± 53.2 ± 0.1Plasminogen + transferrin37.088 ± 53.2 ± 0.51.02900 ± 5802.9 ± 0.6Plasminogen + transferrin + IGFBP-331.066 ± 102.0 ± 0.4a Nonglycosylated human recombinant protein.b Human recombinant protein. Open table in a new tab When IGFBP-3 was immobilized to the sensor, high affinity binding (KD = 1.3 nm) of plasminogen was measured, which was about 54-fold higher than the binding of transferrin to IGFBP-3 (Table II). The combination of plasminogen and transferrin resulted in an overall binding constant, which is comparable with the KD value of plasminogen alone (1.0 versus 1.3 nm); however, this is higher than the binding affinity of transferrin alone (1.0 versus 69.9 nm). The increase in the association constant of the protein mixture to IGFBP-3 indicates a modulatory effect of one component rather than a preferred binding of plasminogen to IGFBP-3. To verify the capability of plasminogen to bind IGF-II, ligand blot and [125I]IGF-II cross-linkage analysis were carried out. Plasminogen separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose retained its IGF-II binding properties (Fig. 5A). In solution, [125I]IGF-II can be chemically cross-linked with high efficiency to plasminogen (Fig. 5B). The binding of [125I]IGF-II is specific and can be replaced by unlabeled IGF-II and, less potently, by IGF-I. IGF-II Eluates Contain IGFBP Protease Activity—To determine which fractions contained IGFBP-3 protease activity, the RP-HPLC fractions were additionally tested in an [125I]IGFBP-3 protease assay. The highest proteolytic activity was detectable in fraction 53, generating fragments of 21, 17, and most prominently 14 kDa (Fig. 6, 3rd lane). The protease in fraction 53 also cleaved [125I]IGFBP-2 into eight fragments (mainly 21 and 14 kDa) but showed almost no catalytic activity when [125I]IGFBP-4 was used as substrate (not shown). To characterize the IGFBP-3 protease in fraction 53, the effects of protease inhibitors were tested. Serine and metalloprotease inhibitors were added to the protease assays. As shown in Fig. 7, the IGFBP-3 protease activity could be blocked almost completely (by 90% as measured as remaining intact [125I]IGFBP-3 by densitometric evaluation of the autoradiographs) by the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin (1.5 μm, lane 4), whereas benzamidine (1 mm, lane 3) showed only a weak inhibition (by 20%). Furthermore, the addition of the specific naturally serine protease inhibitor antithromin III (10 μg/ml, Fig. 7, lane 5) affected the IGFBP-3 proteolysis weakly (24% of nontreated controls), whereas another naturally circulating serine protease inhibitor, α2 antiplasmin, inhibited at low concentrations (5 μg/ml, lane 12) almost completely the cleavage of [125I]IGFBP-3. The metalloprotease inhibitors 1,10-phenanthroline (2 mm, Fig. 7, lane 8) or tumor necrosis factor α-activating protein inhibitor (TAPI, 0.5 mm, lane 9) showed no effects on [125I]IGFBP-3 proteolysis. In a different experimental approach, the RP-HPLC fractions were analyzed by [125I]IGFBP-3 zymography. The highest proteolytic activity was observed again in fraction 53 and was found to be associated with a polypeptide of ∼92 kDa (Fig. 8A). Fig. 8B shows an [125I]IGFBP-3 zymography in the absence and presence of low molecular weight protease inhibitors capable to penetrate the gel. This confirms that the protease activity can be inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin, whereas the mixture of the metalloprotease inhibitors 1,10-phenanthroline and EDTA had no effect on the degradation of [125I]IGFBP-3. Transferrin Co-fractionates with Plasminogen and the IGFBP-3 Protease by Size Exclusion Chromatography—To verify that transferrin forms complexes with plasminogen and the IGFBP-3 protease, size exclusion chromatography of IGF-II matrix eluates was performed under physiological conditions on a Superdex 200 column. The elution profiles and the distribution of transferrin, plasminogen, and the [125I]IGFBP-3 protease in the eluted fractions are shown in Fig. 9, demonstrating that transferrin and plasminogen eluted in three peak fractions (fractions 8, 12, and 14, respectively). Comparison with the separation of protein standards of known relative molecular mass indicates that these peaks display molecular masses of >440 kDa (fractions 8 and 12) and 440 kDa (fraction 14), respectively. The majority of the [125I]IGFBP-3 protease activity was found in fraction 14 in the 440-kDa protein complex. These data are consistent with the conclusion that transferrin, plasminogen, and the [125I]IGFBP-3 protease are present in the same high molecular mass complex. To confirm that the major protein components isolated by the IGF-II affinity chromatography can interact with transferrin, cross-linkage experiments were carried out with transferrin, nonglycosylated IGFBP-3, plasminogen, and IGF-II in various combinations (Fig. 10). Whereas IGFBP-3 or plasminogen alone appear to be unable to form complexes with transferrin in solution that can be cross-linked, the simultaneous presence of all of the components resulted at least in the formation of a transferrin-containing complex of ∼180–200 kDa. In the present study we report on the identification of several plasma proteins eluted from an IGF-II affinity matrix. In addition to IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5, comprising the majority of well known proteins able to bind directly to the immobilized ligand, a serine-dependent 92-kDa IGFBP-3 protease and IGFBP-3-associated proteins with only IGF-II binding properties, or none at all, including prekallikrein (13Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Herington A.C. Powell D.R. Campbell P.G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and transferrin (22Weinzimer S.A. Gibson T.B. Collett-Solberg P.F. Khare A. Liu B. Cohen P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Storch S. Kübler B. Höning S. Ackmann M. Zapf J. Blum W. Braulke T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), respectively, were co-purified from human plasma. Plasminogen, another IGFBP-3-interacting protein (16Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar), was shown here to bind IGF-II with high affinity. In addition to the well characterized binary and ternary complexes, gel filtration analysis has provided evidence that the interaction between IGF, IGF-binding proteins, and non-IGF-binding proteins/IGFBP-associated proteins leads to the formation of different higher molecular mass complexes (≥440 kDa). These circulating complexes may function not only to protect IGFBPs from proteolysis and prevent the loss of IGFs by glomerular filtration but may also support the targeting of IGFs and/or IGFBPs, e.g. to wound sites (17Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Hayes J.D. Suwanichkul A. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30215-30221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), or modulate the migration, proliferation, and apoptosis of extravascular cells (22Weinzimer S.A. Gibson T.B. Collett-Solberg P.F. Khare A. Liu B. Cohen P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Kricker J.A. Towne C.L. Firth S.M. Herington A.C. Upton Z. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2807-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance spectrometry demonstrated that immobilized IGFBP-3 binds the co-purified plasminogen with high affinity (KD = 1.3 nm) exactly confirming the data reported previously by Campbell et al. (16Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, plasminogen was also able to bind IGF-II with high affinity (KD = 5 nm) comparable with the binding affinities of IGFBP-3 for IGF-II (KD = 3.6 nm). The capability of plasminogen to bind IGF-II was confirmed by ligand blot analysis and [125I]IGF-II cross-linkage. Therefore, plasminogen may bind either directly to the IGF-II affinity matrix or indirectly in association with IGFBP-3. Plasminogen appears not to be unique in its ability to bind IGF-II and IGFBPs, because vitronectin, a multifunctional plasma and extracellular matrix protein, has been reported also to bind IGF-II and IGFBPs directly (34Upton Z. Webb H. Hale K. Yandell C.A. McMurtry J.P. Francis G.L. Ballard F.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2928-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have not tested whether the 70–75-kDa vitronectin is present in the eluate of the IGF-II affinity matrix. The biosensor measurements showed, additionally, that transferrin, a low affinity IGF-II-binding protein (KD = 831–976 nm; Ref. 23Storch S. Kübler B. Höning S. Ackmann M. Zapf J. Blum W. Braulke T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and Table II) associating with IGFBP-3 with a moderate binding constant (KD = 70 nm), reduced the overall binding constant KD of the plasminogen/transferrin mixture for IGF-II 7-fold, whereas the interaction between plasminogen and IGFBP-3 was not affected. As demonstrated previously, in the presence of transferrin the overall affinity of IGFBP-3 for IGF-II is improved ∼ 5-fold (23Storch S. Kübler B. Höning S. Ackmann M. Zapf J. Blum W. Braulke T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cross-linkage experiments with selected recombinant proteins provided evidence that at least the simultaneous presence of plasminogen, IGFBP-3, and IGF-II is required to reconstitute a 180–200-kDa transferrin-containing complex. In comparison with the gel filtration data, however, the IGF-II matrix eluate obviously contains other co-factors promoting the formation of high molecular mass transferrin-containing protein complexes. At present, however, the physiological significance of the intermolecular modulatory effects and factors regulating the interactions of IGFs, IGFBPs, and their associated proteins in the circulation are unclear and remain to be investigated. In this report, we have described for the first time the co-purification of an IGFBP-3 protease with IGFBP-3 from human plasma. This protease was shown to cleave also IGFBP-2 but not IGFBP-4. Inhibitor studies and IGFBP-3 zymography suggest that the 92-kDa serine-dependent protease, which can be blocked completely by α2-antiplasmin, might represent plasmin or a plasmin-like protease. Other findings, however, argue against 92-kDa IGFBP-3 protease being identical with plasmin. First, Western blot analysis of the most active proteolytic RP-HPLC fraction detected only the presence of the ∼97-kDa plasminogen form, representing presumably the proteolytic inactive Glu-plasminogen, but failed to visualize the 84-kDa Lys-plasminogen or the 60- and 25-kDa heavy and light chains of plasmin, which have been reported to co-purify with IGFBP-3 in equimolar amounts from human citrate plasma (16Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E321-E331PubMed Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude that low amounts of the active IGFBP-3 protease, not detectable by silver staining or immunoblotting, may be sufficient to cleave the [125I]IGFBP-3 tracer. Of note, the exact determination of molecular masses of purified proteins and the comparison with published data estimated e.g. in different gel systems (Tricine/SDS versus SDS) is rather difficult. Therefore, it is unknown whether the 100-kDa protein in the total eluate fraction (Fig. 1A) was partially processed during the RP-HPLC purification to the ∼92-kDa protein or whether the electrophoretic mobility of the same polypeptide varies after dilution in ACN. Second, the conversion of the inactive plasminogen to plasmin involved in the degradation of IGFBP-1, -3, and -5 and fibrin and in the activation of matrix metalloproteases (9Campbell P.G. Novak J.F. Yanosick T.B. McMaster J.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Booth B.A. Boes M. Bar R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E465-E470PubMed Google Scholar, 35Campbell P.G. Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E996-E1004PubMed Google Scholar, 36Collen D. Hematology. 2001; : 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is tightly regulated and requires the presence of fibrin at sites of tissue injury. Therefore, the secondary activation of plasmin from the inactive plasminogen precursor co-purified with IGFBP-3 appears to be unlikely. Note that plasminogen appears to be partially cleaved to the 84-kDa form during the gel filtration step (Fig. 9B). In the protein fraction eluted from the IGF-II matrix, only small amounts of immunoreactive IGFBP-3 fragments could be detected. Therefore, it can be speculated that either inhibitors of the IGFBP-3 protease were also co-purified or that the IGFBP-3 was protected from degradation. The former assumption is supported by the detection of the nonrelated protease inhibitor antithrombin III in the eluate, which might contain other natural serine protease inhibitors. On the other hand, Holly and collaborators (37Maile L.A. Xu S. Cwyfan-Hughes S.C. Fernihough J.K. Pell J.M. Holly J.M.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4772-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38Maile L.A. Whellams E.J. Holly J.M.P. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2000; 10: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) have provided evidence for the presence of components protecting IGFBP-3 in normal serum from proteolysis. Their data suggest that the accessibility of the C-terminal basic heparin-binding domain of IGFBP-3 is necessary for proteolysis or for binding of an inhibitor. Plasminogen, prekallikrein, or transferrin, all co-purified with IGFBP-3, might be candidates to bind to the C-terminal basic domain (13Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Herington A.C. Powell D.R. Campbell P.G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Campbell P.G. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Hayes J.D. Powell D.R. Am. J.

Metab. 2001; 86: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and protect IGFBP-3 from proteolysis. It is not known whether the IGFBP protease binds to the IGF-II affinity matrix through its interaction with IGFBP-3, IGFBP-associating proteins, or inhibitor complexes. In summary, this study has provided further evidence for the complexity of components modulating the IGF/IGFBP system in the circulation. In addition to the classical IGFBPs, plasminogen, as shown in this study, and the soluble IGF-II/M6PR (39Kiess W. Greenstein L.A. White R.M. Lee L. Rechler M.M. Nissley S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7720-7724Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 40Xu Y. Papageorgiou A. Polychronakos C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 437-442PubMed Google Scholar) belong to the family of high affinity binding proteins for IGF-II. Whereas plasminogen interacts also with a high affinity constant with IGFBP-3, other IGFBP-3-associated proteins such as transferrin might be important to facilitate the formation of high molecular weight IGFBP-3 complexes with altered IGF binding properties. Second, an active 92-kDa serine-dependent IGFBP-3 protease has been co-purified with IGFBP-3- and IGFBP-3-associated proteins and appears to be a component in a 440-kDa high molecular mass complex. It has been reported that in serum the complexed IGFBP-3 protease shows a strong aprotinin and α2-antiplasmin sensitivity (37Maile L.A. Xu S. Cwyfan-Hughes S.C. Fernihough J.K. Pell J.M. Holly J.M.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4772-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The identity of the IGFBP-3 protease in the IGF-II matrix eluate and the inhibitors involved in IGFBP-3 proteolysis and in regulation of the susceptibility of IGFBP-3 to proteolysis in serum remain to be elucidated.

There is great interest in assessing the in vivo functional significance of these phosphoinositides, and we have used Listeria monocytogenes to explore the contribution of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 to its actin-based motility. In Listeria-infected PtK2 cells Akt-pleckstrin homology (PH)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and phospholipase Cδ (PLCδ)-PH-GFP both first concentrate at the front of motile Listeria, subsequently surrounding the bacterium and then concentrating in the actin filament tail. Surprisingly, Listeria ActA mutant strains lacking the putative phosphoinositide binding site are also able to concentrate these probes. Reduction of available PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by expression of Akt-PH-GFP and available PtdIns(4,5)P2 by expression of PLCδ-PH-GFP both significantly slow Listeria actin-based movement. Treatment of cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, dissociates Akt-PH but not PLCδ-PH, from the bacterial surface and cell membranes, and results in near complete inhibition of Listeria actin-based motility and filopod formation. Removal of LY294002 results in rapid and full recovery of Akt-PH localization, Listeria actin-based motility, and filopod formation. These findings suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is concentrated at the surface of Listeria and serves as the substrate for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production, indicating a central role for PI 3-kinases in Listeria intracellular actin-based motility and filopod formation.

The onset of actin-based cell motility in nonmuscle cells is signaled by the increased turnover of phosphoinositides, and phosphoinositides are known to interact with and regulate multiple actin-binding proteins, kinases, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (1Czech M.P.

The accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at these sites is associated with the formation of new actin filaments (3Postma M. Bosgraaf L. Loovers H.M. Van Haastert P.J. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which these lipid products induce actin assembly are under active investigation and include the uncapping of actin filaments and stimulation of actin nucleation (2Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The shape changes associated with chemotaxis, cell spreading, and phagocytosis are complex and make analysis of rates and directionality of actin assembly difficult. Furthermore, these events involve several steps of receptor-mediated signal transduction. Listeria intracellular infection and movement is a particularly useful model for examining the parameters of in vivo actin assembly, allowing discrete temporal and spatial resolution of actin filament formation. Intracellular Listeria infection of tissue culture cells is accomplished by simply over-laying the bacteria on the surface of host cells. Internalins found on the surface of the bacterium bind to host cell receptors that induce phagocytosis (4Pizarro-Cerda J. Sousa S. Cossart P. C. R. Biol. 2004; 327: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Once ingested, the bacterium escapes from the phagolysosome by lysing the confining membrane (5Portnoy D.A. Jacks P.S. Hinrichs D.J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and then rapidly multiplies within the cytoplasm. Within 2-3 h, the bacterium induces actin assembly at one pole, forming a discrete polymerization zone where new actin monomers are added to the growing filaments (6Dabiri G.A. Sanger J.M. Portnoy D.A. Southwick F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6068-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 7Sanger J.M. Sanger J.W. Southwick F.S. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3609-3619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Actin filament assembly provides directional force that drives the bacterium through the cytoplasm to the peripheral membrane of the cell. Here the bacterium pushes the membrane outward forming a discrete filopod that can be ingested by an adjacent cell, and the cycle is repeated. The bacterial surface protein ActA directly stimulates actin assembly, bypassing the receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways that induce actin filament formation during phagocytosis and chemotaxis (8Cossart P. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Curiously, ActA has a phosphoinositide binding site in the amino-terminal region that is located within amino acids 184-202 (9Cicchetti G. Maurer P. Wagener P. Kocks C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33616-33626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Steffen P. Schafer D.A. David V. Gouin E. Cooper J.A. Cossart P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 causes a conformational change in the amino terminus of ActA. However, in vivo phosphoinositide localization studies have not been performed, and the physiological significance of the inositide binding site has not been examined. In the present study we used green fluorescent protein chimeras linked to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of phospholipase C (PLCδ) (11Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and of Akt (protein kinase B) (12Skoble J. Portnoy D.A. Welch M.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which bind PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns(3,4)P2, respectively, to investigate the involvement of these phosphoinositides in Listeria motility. We show that both wild type Listeria and Listeria strains expressing an ActA mutant lacking the putative phosphoinositide binding site are capable of concentrating both of these probes on their surface and in the actin tails. Additionally, we have found that treatments that lower PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production or availability significantly inhibited Listeria-induced actin assembly. Most exciting was the finding that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, blocked the translocation of Akt-PH-GFP to the bacteria and profoundly inhibited Listeria actin-based motility and filopod formation. These effects were completely reversed by removal of the inhibitor. These experiments, for the first time, point to a central role for PI 3-kinase(s) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in Listeria actin-based motility. Tissue Culture Methods and Infection Procedures—The PtK2 cells (derived from the kidney epithelium of the kangaroo rat Potorous tri-dactylis) or MDCK cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per coverslip in 35-mm culture dishes in 3 ml of culture media (minimum Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin) and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were infected as described previously (6Dabiri G.A. Sanger J.M. Portnoy D.A. Southwick F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6068-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly Listeria monocytogenes strain was inoculated into brain heart infusion (Difco) and grown overnight at 37 °C, washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then resuspended in minimum Eagle's medium without antibiotics to give a final concentration of 1 × 107 or a ratio of 10 bacteria per host cell. Bacteria in 2 ml of culture media were added to each dish followed by centrifugation at 400 × g at room temperature for 10 min and then incubation for 45 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After incubation, extracellular bacteria were removed by washing three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution. The culture media containing gentamicin sulfate (10 μg/ml) was added back to prevent extracellular growth of bacteria. The monolayer was then incubated for 1-5 h, and during this time video microscopy was performed. Listeria strains used in our experiments included 10403S and DP-L3982 (12Skoble J. Portnoy D.A.

The later two strains were grown in the presence of chloramphenicol as described previously (10Steffen P. Schafer D.A. David V. Gouin E. Cooper J.A. Cossart P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PtK2 cells were also infected with Shigella flexneri wild-type strain 2457T as described previously (13Zeile W.L. Purich D.L. Southwick F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Transfection of Cells and Treatment with Inhibitors—Plasmids encoding the PH domains fused to the NH2 terminus of green fluorescent protein or the monomeric red fluorescent protein were constructed as described previously (14Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The plasmid constructs used included the PH domains of PLCδ-(1-170) or its mutant (R40L) and of the Akt protein kinase-(1-167) or its mutant (R25C). Plasmid DNAs (final concentration 2 μg/ml) were transfected into PtK2 or MDCK cells using the Lipofectamine reagent (10 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (14Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected 48 h prior to infection with Listeria. For kinase inhibition experiments, standard protocols were utilized for treatment with wortmannin (final concentration 100 nm), LY294002 (final concentration 50 μm), and quercetin (final concentration 50 μm) (all obtained from Sigma). These inhibitors were added to infected cells 1-3 h after the initiation of infection, and bacterial velocities were measured before and 30-180 min after addition. For rat brain extract experiments, extract was prepared as described previously (15May R.C. Hall M.E. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Chakraborty T. Wehland J. Machesky L.M. Sechi A.S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 759-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and LY294002 was added simultaneously with the Listeria strain LO28 ΔActA containing a wild type ActA plasmid (see above). To depolymerize actin filaments Latrunculin A (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (final concentration of 2 μm) was added to Listeria-infected PtK2 cells. Microscopy—A Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope was equipped with a charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu), and the microscope stage temperature was maintained at 25 or 37 °C with a MS-200D perfusion microincubation system (Narishige, Tokyo). Images were also obtained using a MRC-1024 ES confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) sectioning at 0.2-μm intervals. Digital images were obtained and processed using the Metamorph image analysis program (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Velocities of bacterial movement were determined by comparing the images at two time points and measuring the distance traveled by each bacterium using track points function (Metamorph program, Universal Imaging). Distances were calibrated using a Nikon micrometer. Differences in migration velocities were analyzed using the unpaired Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. In each experiment the velocity of each moving bacterium was measured over 2 min giving 3 velocity measurements/bacteria. In all experiments n indicates the number of velocity measurements. We have previously noted marked variations in the velocity of actin-based motility in different tissue culture cell preparations. These differences probably relate to the age of the cells, the duration of adherence to glass coverslips, and possibly the growth conditions of the Listeria. Therefore to control for these variables each comparison of the velocities between transfected and control cells were made on the same tissue culture dish. In our kinase inhibitor experiments, cell preparations were split at the same time, and the same overnight culture of Listeria was used to infect all tissue culture plates. Filamentous actin was stained using rhodamine-phalloidin as described previously (6Dabiri G.A. Sanger J.M. Portnoy D.A. Southwick F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6068-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The relative intensity of 6 × 6 pixel regions of Listeria actin filament tails were measured using the regions statistics tool (Metamorph, Universal Imaging). Intracellular bacteria as compared with extracellular bacteria could be readily differentiated on time-lapse phase microscopy using two criteria. The refractive index of intracellular bacteria was distinctly different from extracellular bacteria. To confirm this observation, simultaneous phase and rhodamine-phalloidin images were compared. In analysis of 100 bacteria from 10 different cells, phase imaging demonstrated a 95% concordance with phalloidin staining in control cells. Secondly, on time-lapse video extracellular bacteria attached to the cell surface tended to twist and abruptly move in response to fluid currents whereas intracellular bacteria remained stationary or moved with relatively linear trajectories and constant velocities. Localization of Akt-PH and PLCδ-PH in Listeria-infected Cells—Cells transfected with Akt-PH-GFP and PLCδ-PH-GFP took up bacteria and supported intracellular Listeria actin-based motility. During phagocytosis of the bacteria both GFP probes concentrated at the region of phagocytosis as observed previously in macrophages (16Botelho R.J. Scott C.C. Grinstein S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 282: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, Akt-PH-GFP concentrated around the ingested bacterium in the regions that were in direct contact with the plasma membrane. Once the bacteria were completely incorporated into the cell, the majority of intracellular bacteria was no longer associated with detectable fluorescence, the probe usually dissociating from the bacterial surface within 1-5 min. PLCδ-PH-GFP transfected cells demonstrated an identical pattern of localization during phagocytosis (Fig. 1C). Subsequently, 3-4 h after the initiation of infection, bacteria again began attracting the two PH fluorescent probes. Simultaneous phase and fluorescence images revealed that a significant percentage of Listeria moving within the cell attracted PLCδ-PH-GFP to their actin filament tails and to the surface of the bacteria (Fig. 2). Time-lapse video (Fig. 2 video supplement) demonstrated that PLCδ-PH-GFP was first attracted to the front of the moving bacteria (example, Fig. 2, A and B, arrowhead). As the bacterium moved forward, the probe concentrated along the entire surface of the bacterium, as well as in the actin-rich tail (Fig. 2, A and B, arrows). Analysis of a number of moving bacteria showed that bacteria with distinct phase dense actin filament tails were more likely to concentrate PLCδ-PH-GFP (examples shown by the arrows in Fig. 2 and Fig. 2 video supplement). The percentage of motile bacteria concentrating the probe varied from 10 to 60%. Three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal images of PLCδ-PH-GFP transfected PtK2 cells revealed that motile bacteria concentrating the probe were consistently found within 0.6 μm of cell membrane. Once the bacteria began pushing out the peripheral membrane and forming filopodia all bacteria were surrounded by the PLCδ-PH probe (Fig. 2C and Fig. 2 video supplement). Rarely stationary bacteria were also surrounded by fluorescence; however, the majority of stationary intracellular bacteria could not be seen by fluorescence microscopy, only being seen by phase contrast imaging (compare A and B in Fig. 2). Identical experiments were performed with cells transfected with Akt-PH-GFP, and this probe also localized to the bacterium and the actin-rich tails as Listeria moved through the cytoplasm by actin-based motility (Fig. 5, A and C). Mutant Akt- and PLCδ-PH-GFP probes that have low affinity for phosphoinositides in vitro (see “Experimental Procedures”) were distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm of the cell and failed to localize to the bacteria, indicating that our findings represented specific interactions (data not shown). To determine whether the two PH domain probes were localizing to the same sites in Listeria infected PtK2 cells, cells were simultaneously transfected with PLCδ-PH-GFP and Akt-PH-mRFP and then infected with Listeria. As shown in Fig. 3, after 4 h of infection, both probes localized to the surface of the bacteria and to the actin-rich tails. In multiple experiments no consistent difference between the localization of the two probes was detected. Our combination of phase and fluorescence images suggested that the two PH domains localized to both the bacteria and the actin tails. To compare the distribution of the Akt-PH domain and actin simultaneously, we transfected MDCK cells with both GFP-actin and Akt-PH-mRFP, followed by infection with Listeria. Four hours after initiation of infection, distinct differences in the localization of GFP-actin and Akt-PH-mRFP were observed. Although Akt-PH-mRFP concentrated along the surface of the bacterium and along the actin-rich tail, GFP-actin concentrated only at the back of the motile bacteria in tails, as observed previously (6Dabiri G.A. Sanger J.M. Portnoy D.A. Southwick F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6068-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Effects of Reducing Phosphoinositide Levels on Listeria Intracellular Movement and Filopod Formation—Akt-PH-GFP localization in Listeria-infected cells was next examined after treatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. At 4-6 h after the initiation of infection PtK2 cells containing motile bacteria-concentrating Akt-PH-GFP were treated with a final concentration of 50 μm LY294002. This concentration has been shown to specifically inhibit PI 3-kinase activity and to quickly block PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production in cells (17Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within 15 min of LY294002 exposure, Akt-PH-GFP completely dissociated from the bacteria and filament tails and homogeneously filled the cytoplasm (compare A and B in Fig. 5). When LY294002 was washed out by exchanging the media with buffer 3 times, Akt-PH-GFP re-concentrated around the bacteria and in the actin tails within 15 min (Fig. 5C). Treatment with wortmannin (100 nm final concentration) also dissociated Akt-PH-GFP from the bacterial surface and actin tails (data not shown). Addition of the same concentrations of LY294002 or wortmannin to tissue culture dishes of infected cells containing PLCδ-PH-GFP failed to dissociate this GFP construct from the bacteria or actin tails (data not shown). Addition of LY294002 at the time the bacteria were actively migrating through the cell by actin-based motility slowed their velocity by more than 60% (0.070 ± 0.002 μm/s pretreatment versus 0.024 ± 0.001 μm/s post-treatment, S.E., n = 98, p < 0.0001, Fig. 6A). The inhibition was reversible, and within 15-20 min of removing LY294002, bacterial velocities had returned to control values (0.065 ± 0.002 μm/s, n = 98). A slowing of bacterial actin-based motility was also observed after treatment with wortmannin (final concentration 100 nm) (pretreatment velocity 0.083 ± 0.002, S.E., n = 357 versus post-treatment 0.050 ± 0.002, S.E., n = 206, p < 0.001) (Fig. 6A). The effects of another, less specific PtdIns kinase inhibitor, quercetin, were also examined. This bioflavinoid inhibits PtdIns 4-kinase activity and also caused a significant slowing of Listeria intracellular speed (pretreatment mean velocity 0.072 ± 0.003 μm/s, S.E., n = 104 versus 0.030 ± 0.001, S.E., n = 196 post-treatment mean velocity, p < 0.0001). However, the degree of inhibition was no greater than that of LY294002 (Fig. 6A). These results prompted us to examine the effects of LY294002 on Listeria actin-based motility in a cell-free system, bovine brain extract. Unlike intact cells, the same final concentration of the inhibitor caused no slowing of Listeria motility as compared with controls. The velocities of both control and LY294002-treated extracts were approximately one-tenth of those observed in intact cells (controls: 0.0036 ± 0.0002 μm/s, S.E., n = 73 versus LY294002: 0.0048 ± 0.003 μm/s, n = 57) (Fig. 6A). To explore the effects of PI 3-kinase inhibition at earlier stages of Listeria-induced actin assembly, PtK2 cells were treated with LY294002 1-2 h after the initiation of infection. By this time bacteria have escaped into the cytoplasm and induced the symmetric formation of actin filaments on their surface (sometimes called halos) but have not begun to move or form polar actin filament tails (6Dabiri G.A. Sanger J.M. Portnoy D.A. Southwick F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6068-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Within 1 h of LY294002 treatment a marked reduction in the percentage of intracellular bacteria surrounded by actin filaments was observed. As assessed by simultaneous phase and rhodamine-phalloidin staining, 5% (20/383) of the bacteria in LY294002-treated cells formed halos, as compared with 68% (569/832) in control cells (p < 0.0001). At later time points, bacteria in control cells began to actively move in the cytoplasm. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, by 4 h after the initiation of infection 24% (40/167) of intracellular bacteria were actively moving through the cytoplasm and 27% (46/167) had already reached the peripheral membrane and formed filopodia. Therefore, the combined percentage of motile intracellular bacteria was 51% in control cells. At the same time point in LY294002-treated cells only 0.5% (1/211) of intracellular bacteria were moving, and only 7.5% had formed filopodia (16/211), resulting in a total percentage of motile bacteria of only 8%. These differences were highly significant (p < 0.0001). At 5 h similar differences were observed between bacteria in control and treated cells (Fig. 6, B and C). When LY294002 was washed out of the tissue culture dishes, a complete reversal of inhibition was observed. Within 25 min of removal of the LY294002, 33% of intracellular bacteria were migrating through the cytoplasm, and 27% had formed filopodia (total percentage of motile bacteria = 60%) (Fig. 6, B and C). A linear rise in the percentage of intracellular bacteria forming filopodia was observed over the first 50 min after washout (Fig. 6B). Rhodamine phalloidin staining showed that in the presence of LY294002, the F-actin content of bacterial actin tails was significantly lower than that observed in control cells, the mean relative fluorescence intensity of actin tails in treated cells (mean relative intensity 8.2 ± 1.0, n = 45) being less than one-third of mean intensity of actin tails in untreated cells (mean relative intensity 27.7 ± 1.2, n = 62, p < 0.0001). The effects of LY294002 were also examined on another intracellular pathogen known to move by actin-based motility within the cytoplasm of cells, S. flexneri. PtK2 cells were infected with Shigella and the inhibitor (final concentration of LY294002 = 50 μm) added at the time of infection or 1 h after the initiation of infection. Addition of LY294002 at either time point had no significant effect on the velocity of Shigella actin-based motility (Fig. 6D, left) (mean velocity of untreated cells, 0.048 ± 0.002 μm/s, S.E., n = 434 versus LY294002-treated cells, 0.049 ± 0.003 μm/s, n = 326), and this treatment failed to reduce the percentage of bacteria forming filopodia or forming actin-rich tails (Fig. 6D, right). Consistent with these findings, Shigella failed to attract Akt-PH-GFP or PLCδ-PH-GFP to its surface or to its actin tails in five separate experiments (data not shown). Because PLCδ-PH and Akt-PH bind specific phosphoinositides with relatively high affinity, these probes would be expected to reduce the availability of these phosphoinositides for the enhancement of Listeria actin-based motility. To assess the functional consequences of the sequestration of these lipids, we examined the percentage of intracellular bacteria that formed filopodia in transfected versus control cells at 4-5 h after Listeria infection. As shown in Fig. 6E, Akt-PH-GFP transfection significantly reduced filopod formation as compared with GFP alone, and PLCδ-PH-GFP showed no inhibitory effect on this parameter. However, analysis of the intracellular speeds of Listeria revealed an ∼50% reduction in both Akt-PH-GFP and PLCδ-PH-GFP transfected cells as compared with control or GFP transfected cells (Fig. 6F). Comparison of Wild-type to L. monocytogenes ActA Mutants Lacking the Phosphoinositide Binding Site—The surface protein ActA on wild-type Listeria contains a putative binding site for D3 and D4 phosphoinositides. Therefore, we explored the possibility that this binding site was responsible for the localization of the two GFP-PH domains to the bacterial surface and to actin tails of intracellular motile Listeria. Two Listeria mutants containing an ActA surface protein in which the phosphoinositide binding site had been deleted, Listeria ActA-Δ171-235 called DP-L3982 (12Skoble J. Portnoy D.A. Welch M.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and Listeria ActA-Δ158-231 called bacteria 1368 (10Steffen P. Schafer D.A. David V. Gouin E. Cooper J.A. Cossart P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), were tested. As shown in Fig. 7A, the DP-L3982 mutant strain was able to concentrate Akt-PH-GFP on its surface and in the actin tails, and the pattern and extent of localization was indistinguishable from that of wild-type bacteria (compare A and B of Fig. 7). Identical results were observed with Listeria mutant strain 1398 (data not shown). Similarly to wild-type Listeria, treatment with LY294002 (final concentration 50 μm) dissociated the probe from the mutant DP-L3982 (data not shown) and slowed intracellular actin-based motility (Fig. 7C). Both mutant bacteria were also able to attract PLCδ-PH-GFP and concentrate this probe in the identical regions observed for Akt-PH-GFP (Fig. 7D). Localization of GFP-Akt-PH following Latrunculin Treatment—To determine whether the localization of the PH domains was a consequence of actin polymerization, the effects of treating cells with the actin monomer sequestering agent latrunculin on Akt-PH-GFP localization were examined. As shown in Fig. 8, a concentration of latrunculin that depolymerized all phase-dense Listeria actin tails had minimal effects on localization of the probe around the bacterium. However latrunculin treatment did alter the morphology of the probe in the region of the actin filament tail. The Akt-PH-GFP localization to the tail region became irregular (Fig. 8, arrow, 10 min after initiation of latrunculin treatment), and eventually the tail collapsed (Fig. 8, arrow, 20-min image). There has been great interest in the localization of phosphoinositides during cell motility, and extensive evidence documents that the D3 and D4 phosphoinositides concentrate in areas where new actin structures are forming. However the exact functional roles of these phosphoinositides during actin-based motility remains to be determined. During phagocytosis, PtdIns(4,5)P2 accumulates in the early extending pseudopods and then quickly disappears whereas PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 concentrates at the base of the phagocytic cup (18Botelho R.J. Teruel M. Dierckman R. Anderson R. Wells A. York J.D. Meyer T. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1353-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with PtdIns(4,5)P2 serving as the substrate for the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)3 in response to a phagocytic stimulus. PtdIns(4,5)P2 also serves as a substrate for the PLC-mediated production of diacylglycerol which stimulates protein kinase C (19Dillon S.B. Murray J.J. Uhing R.J. Snyderman R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 35: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, which releases intracellular stores of Ca2+ (20Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4390) Google Scholar). In addition to serving as a substrate, PtdIns(4,5)P2 could directly affect the function of other proteins within the cell, and the functions of a number of proteins related to actin polymerization have been linked to phosphoinositides, including the uncapping of actin filaments, sequestration of profilin, and the stimulation of Arp2/3 nucleation of actin assembly via N-WASP or WASP (2Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). However, the role of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in actin-based motility is less well understood. It has been clearly linked to actin polymerization during chemotaxis (21Srinivasan S. Wang F. Glavas S. Ott A. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Kalman D. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and it may recruit myosin X to the site of phagocytosis (22Hilpela P. Vartiainen M.K. Lappalainen P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 282: 117-163PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of the inositides are probably also mediated through activation of small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family via recruitment of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (23Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Unlike phagocytosis and chemotaxis, which result in stimulation of the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42 (21Srinivasan S. Wang F. Glavas S. Ott A. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Kalman D. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), intracellular Listeria bypasses these signal transduction pathways. Its ActA protein directly stimulates Arp2/3 to nucleate actin assembly and is not believed to require activation of small GTP-binding proteins (24Moreau V. Way M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent work in our laboratory also indicates that changes in intracellular calcium do not affect the speed of intracellular Listeria (25Larson L. Arnaudeau S. Gibson B. Li W. Krause R. Hao B. Bamburg J.R. Lew D.P. Dermaurex N. Southwick F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Therefore, many of the classically proposed functions of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 do not apply to Listeria. In the simple reconstituted system consisting of Arp2/3 complex, ADF/cofilin, CapZ, and actin, phosphoinositides are not required for Listeria actin-based motility (26Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). However, the purified system is far more permissive and only supports velocities that are approximately one-tenth of those observed in the intact cell. Although this simplified system has proved very helpful in clarifying the minimal components required to initiate actin-based motility, such extracts do not fully recapitulate the events taking place in the cell. The viscosity of the cytoplasm, as well as the compartmentalization of many components, provide a far more challenging environment for the initiation and maintenance of actin-based motility. Also, the discovery of a putative phosphoinositide binding site on the Listeria surface protein ActA encouraged us to explore the possibility that Listeria might utilize these lipid products to stimulate actin filament assembly in the intact cell. First, as noted in macrophages during ingestion of IgG opsonized particles (16Botelho R.J. Scott C.C. Grinstein S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 282: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar, 18Botelho R.J. Teruel M. Dierckman R. Anderson R. Wells A. York J.D. Meyer T. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1353-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulated in the region where Listeria was being phagocytosed (Fig. 1). However, these lipids remained associated with the engulfed bacteria only for a short period of time (1-5 min), being followed by a period of 3-4 h during which the presence of phosphoinositides at the bacterial surface was not readily detected. When the bacteria began to move and form actin filament tails, both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 started to accumulate around the bacteria. We originally predicted that the phosphoinositides would be attracted to the back of the moving Listeria to uncap actin filaments in the polymerization zone and thereby stimulate polar actin filament assembly. However, we were surprised to find that both PLCδ-PH-GFP and Akt-PH-GFP first localize to the front of motile bacteria at regions of the bacterial surface that do not induce the formation of actin filaments (Fig. 2 and Fig. 2 video supplement). The PH domain probes subsequently concentrate along the side of the bacteria and in the actin filament tails. Furthermore, depolymerization of the actin tails by addition of latrunculin did not dissociate these probes from the surface of the bacteria, only from the actin filament tails (Fig. 8). These findings suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are likely to serve multiple roles in addition to modifying the functions of actin-binding proteins in the polymerization zone. PLCδ-PH-GFP and Akt-PH-GFP were concentrated around 10-60% of motile bacteria. Bacteria with the highest likelihood of concentrating the two PH-GFP probes were located near the peripheral membrane and produced phase-dense tails (caused by light refraction by actin filaments). This observation suggests that the bacteria might attract phosphoinositides from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. It is also possible that higher concentrations of phosphoinositides are required to move through this region of the cell where high concentrations of filamentous actin are commonly found. We frequently observed that within 1-2 min after becoming surrounded by the PH-GFP probes, the bacterium moved out of the cell forming a filopod. This observation may suggest that recruitment of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is required for efficient production of filopodia, and the production of these structures is required for efficient spread of Listeria from cell to cell. How does Listeria attract PtdIns(4,5)P2 and stimulate production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3? The finding of a phosphoinositide binding site at amino acids 184-202 on ActA suggested that this binding site could account for the ability of the bacterium to attract these phosphoinositides (9Cicchetti G. Maurer P. Wagener P. Kocks C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33616-33626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2 by ActA might serve to deliver this phosphoinositide to the actin polymerization zone of Listeria and uncap actin filaments. However, in vitro experiments subsequently demonstrated that sequestration of PtdIns(4,5)P2 by ActA actually inhibited the ability of the phosphoinositide to uncap actin filaments (10Steffen P. Schafer D.A. David V. Gouin E. Cooper J.A. Cossart P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of the inositide binding site was reported only to minimally affect intracellular actin-based motility and not to alter the ability of Listeria to spread from cell to cell (10Steffen P. Schafer D.A. David V. Gouin E. Cooper J.A. Cossart P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Skoble J. Portnoy D.A. Welch M.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we found that the loss of the putative inositide binding domain of ActA did not affect localization of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to the surface of intracellular Listeria and their actin tails (Fig. 7). The ActA-Δ171-235 and wild-type bacteria also demonstrated comparable sensitivities to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, further supporting this conclusion and suggesting that either another region of ActA or another bacterial surface protein may be responsible for concentrating these phosphoinositides. The finding that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 causes near complete inhibition of Listeria actin-based motility indicates that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 plays a critical role in Listeria actin-based motility within the cell. Addition of this inhibitor results in rapid dissociation of Akt-PH-GFP from the bacterial surface and in motile bacteria results in a slowing of bacterial intracellular speed. Reduction of available PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 also results in the slowing of bacterial speed, and the data together suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is recruited and converted to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 on the bacterial surface (Figs. 5 and 6). Maximum inhibition of LY294002 is achieved when the inhibitor is added 1-2 h after the initiation of infection, at the time when Listeria is growing in the cytoplasm and is inducing actin filaments that fully surround the bacterium. Our observation that Shigella actin-based motility is not impaired by LY294002, combined with our finding that Shigella does not attract Akt-PH-GFP to its surface, indicates that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is not required for all forms of intracellular bacterial actin-based motility. Shigella, unlike Listeria, requires N-WASP to activate the Arp2/3 complex and uses the surface protein IcsA, a protein that is structurally unrelated to ActA. The profound inhibition of Listeria-induced actin assembly caused by the blockade of PI 3-kinase activity indicates that continued production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is required for ActA (or another protein or proteins) to function in the host cell cytoplasm and raises the possibility that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 may be required for a post-translational modification of ActA or a partner protein responsible for the induction of actin filament formation. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 may target a kinase or other modifying enzyme to the bacterial surface to accomplish this task. It is also possible that this phosphoinositide directly modifies the activity of one or more actin-regulatory proteins to initiate actin filament formation. We are presently exploring these possibilities. In conclusion, the present data support a critical role for PI 3-kinase activity in Listeria actin-based motility and for the first time demonstrate that Listeria is capable of concentrating both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 on its surface in vivo. Binding of these phospholipids does not require the putative ActA lipid binding site. Our findings suggest that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and its precursor PtdIns(4,5)P2 are critical mediators of Listeria intracellular actin-based motility. Furthermore our results are most consistent with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 serving as a regulator of ActA activity in the intact cell. The simplicity of the Listeria model system has provided an excellent vehicle for clarifying the functional role of phosphoinositides in actin filament assembly, and this model system promises to allow further dissection of this important signal transduction pathway.

DnaA protein has high affinity for ATP and ADP, and in vitro lipid bilayers that are fluid and contain acidic phospholipids reactivate inert ADP-DnaA by promoting an exchange of ATP for ADP. Here, nucleotide and lipid interactions and replication activity of purified DnaA(L366K) were examined to gain insight into the mechanism of how it restores growth to cells lacking acidic phospholipids. DnaA(L366K) behaved like wild-type DnaA with respect to nucleotide binding affinities and hydrolysis properties, specificity of acidic phospholipids for nucleotide release, and origin binding. Yet, DnaA(L366K) was feeble at initiating replication from oriC unless augmented with a limiting quantity of wild-type DnaA, reflecting the in vivo requirement that both wild-type and a mutant form of DnaA must be expressed and act together to restore growth to acidic phospholipid deficient cells.

The cycle of chromosomal DNA replication in Escherichia coli is largely controlled at the initiation stage. A cluster of multiple DnaA protein molecules binds to DnaA recognition sites in the unique origin (oriC) (1Fuller R. Funnell B. Kornberg A.

Aided by architectural proteins HU and integration host factor (IHF), DnaA protein promotes strand opening of the AT-rich 13-mer repeats of oriC and mediates the delivery of DnaB helicase from DnaB·DnaC complexes onto the exposed single strands. The complementary strands are subsequently synthesized by replisomes that have been assembled at the two DNA forks (5Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar). The transition of the origin from duplex to melted DNA is influenced by the high affinity DnaA protein has for ATP and ADP; although both forms of DnaA protein are capable of producing very similar nucleoprotein complexes at oriC, only ATP-DnaA is active for promoting strand opening and subsequent replication steps (6Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Regulatory inactivation of DnaA (RIDA), 1The abbreviations used are: RIDA, regulatory inactivation of DnaA; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. one of the mechanisms to ensure that a round of chromosomal replication happens only once per cell cycle, stimulates the hydrolysis of DnaA-bound ATP, generating ADP-DnaA that is feeble at initiating replication (7Katayama T.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6642-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). RIDA activity is dependent on the β-subunit of DNA polymerase III loaded as a sliding clamp onto template DNA and Hda, a protein important for controlled replication of the E. coli chromosome and plasmid RK2 (10Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 11Kim D.K. Banack T. Lerman D.M. Tracy J.E. Camara J.E. Crooke E. Oliver D. Firshein W. J.

Acidic phospholipids in a fluid bilayer promote the release of bound nucleotide from DnaA in vitro (13Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Castuma C.E. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24665-24668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When ADP-DnaA is stabilized by being bound to oriC, acidic phospholipids facilitate an exchange of ATP for ADP and thus can restore initiation activity to DnaA protein (15Crooke E. Castuma C.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16779-16782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of functional DnaA proteolytic fragments identified a domain of DnaA protein that is necessary for membrane reactivation of the initiation activity of the protein (16Garner J. Crooke E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3477-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies that employed a radiolabeled, photoactivatable phospholipid analog revealed that this essential domain of DnaA protein inserts into the hydrophobic portion of the lipid bilayer during the nucleotide release process (17Garner J. Durrer P. Kitchen J. Brunner J. Crooke E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5167-5173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the DnaA protein suggests that this membrane-interacting segment of DnaA protein forms an amphiphatic helix (16Garner J. Crooke E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3477-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a structural motif that can act as a membrane surface-seeking domain for peripherally associated membrane proteins. Homology modeling of the E. coli DnaA sequence onto the recently solved crystal structure of a truncated version of Aquifex aeolicus DnaA supports this region of E. coli DnaA being such a structure (18Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In general, DnaA protein is composed of an amino-terminal domain I involved in helicase recruitment (19Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Weigel C. Schmidt A. Seitz H. Tungler D. Welzeck M. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and with specific residues needed for oligomerization at oriC (21Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a variable domain II, a core domain III that contains the nucleotide binding site, and a carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain (22Roth A. Messer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2106-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Blaesing F. Weigel C. Welzeck M. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Domain III and the helix-turn-helix motif of domain IV are connected by the membrane-binding long amphiphatic helix mentioned above. In vivo, a close link between DnaA protein function and the state of the cellular membrane is likely. When the synthesis of acidic phospholipids is impeded via repressed transcription of the gene for phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase, cells become arrested for growth after a few generations but remain viable (24Heacock P. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14972-14977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The growth arrest can be relieved by expression of certain plasmid-borne mutant forms of DnaA protein, including DnaA(L366K), with initiation of replication occurring at or near oriC (25Zheng W. Li Z. Skarstad K. Crooke E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In support of the idea that the arrested growth in acidic phospholipid-deficient cells is associated with impaired chromosomal replication from oriC, the growth arrest can also be alleviated if the cells are permitted to undergo constitutive stable DNA replication, a process that allows DnaA-independent initiation of replication at sites other than oriC (26Xia W. Dowhan W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mechanism of how DnaA(L366K) restores growth to acidic-phospholipid deficient cells has been speculated (25Zheng W. Li Z. Skarstad K. Crooke E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to be related to its altered nucleotide state or reactivation by membranes. Possibilities include: (i) the ability of ADP-DnaA(L366K) to be rejuvenated by neutral, zwitterionic membranes, (ii) DnaA(L366K) never being in its ADP form because it fails to bind ATP in the first place, thus negating the need for acidic membrane-mediated reactivation, (iii) DnaA(L366K) binds ATP but fails to hydrolyze it to produce ADP-DnaA or is inert to RIDA, therefore bypassing the necessity to be reactivated by acidic phospholipids, and (iv) ADP-DnaA(L366K) is active at initiating chromosomal replication. A biochemical study of these possibilities is presented here. The membrane reactivation characteristics of another mutant form of DnaA protein that possesses other amino acid substitutions in the membrane-binding region are also presented. Materials—Unless otherwise stated, reagent grade chemicals were from J. T. Baker, Sigma Chemicals, Fisher Scientific, or Roche Applied Science. Growth media components were from BD Biosciences. Phospholipids 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-[1-choline]], 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-[1-glycerol]], E. coli phosphatidylethanolamine, and bovine heart cardiolipin were from Avanti Polar Lipids. [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [2,8-3H]ADP (25–40 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]TTP (800 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Histidine-tagged wild-type and mutant DnaA proteins were expressed from pZL411 (27Li Z. Crooke E. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and its derivative plasmids in strain BLR(DE3)pLysS. Total E. coli lipids were extracted from exponentially growing W3110 cells that were harvested, resuspended in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and 10% sucrose to an optical density (A600 nm) of 300, and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nucleotide Binding and Membrane-mediated Release—ATP and ADP binding were assessed as described previously (6Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Briefly, polyhistidine-tagged DnaA proteins in buffer HD (50 mm PIPES·KOH (pH 6.8 at 1 m), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, 20% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) were mixed with 1 μm [α-32P]ATP or [2,8-3H]ADP in 25 μl of buffer pp60 (50 mm HEPES·KOH (pH 7.6 at 1 m), 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.007% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3 mm EDTA, and 7 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at 0 °C for 15 min. For samples subjected to membrane-mediated nucleotide release, phospholipids in the form of small unilamellar vesicles were added, and mixtures were incubated at 38 °C for 10 min. Samples were filtered through nitrocellulose filters (Type HA, Millipore) presoaked in buffer G (50 mm Tricine·KOH (pH 8.25 at 1 m), 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm ammonium sulfate, 17% (v/v) glycerol, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Filters were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer G, dried, and retained nucleotide was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Nucleotide Hydrolysis—Histidine-tagged wild-type or mutant DnaA proteins (2 pmol) were incubated (0 °C, 15 min) with 1 μm [α-32P]ATP in buffer pp60 (16 μl). The resulting ATP-DnaA was incubated (38 °C) with pBSoriC (0.1 μg) for various times. Samples were filtered through nitrocellulose membranes. DnaA-bound ATP and ADP were extracted from the filters with 1 m formic acid (100 μl). Nucleotide extracts (5 μl) were spotted onto thin layer PEI Cellulose plates (EM Science), ADP and ATP were separated using a solvent of 1 m HCOOH and 0.4 m LiCl, the plates were dried, and radioactivity was visualized and measured using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 imaging system. Internal ATP and ADP standards were visualized by UV absorption. RIDA Sensitivity—Histidine-tagged wild-type DnaA and DnaA(L366K) were incubated with a crude cell extract or bovine serum albumin in the presence of DNA and ATP. A portion of the mixture was then used as a source of DnaA for in vitro replication in a crude cell extract as described previously (7Katayama T. Crooke E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9265-9271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). oriC Binding—[3H]pBSoriC was prepared by in vitro methylation with HhaI methylase as described (28Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged wild-type and mutant DnaA proteins were incubated (25 °C, 10 min) with radiolabeled DNA in buffer DB (25 mm HEPES·KOH (pH 7.5 at 1 m), 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 17% (v/v) glycerol, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Samples were filtered through nitrocellulose filters (Type HA, Millipore) presoaked in buffer DB. Filters were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer DB, dried, and retained DNA was measured by liquid scintillation counting. DNA Replication in a Crude Cell-free Extract—In vitro replication of oriC-plasmid M13mpRE85 in a crude enzyme fraction (Fraction II) was performed basically as described (29Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 30Crooke E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, a crude protein fraction was prepared from WM433 (dnaA204(Ts)) by a freeze-thaw lysis, isolation of the soluble extract, and ammonium sulfate fractionation. DNA synthesis reactions (25 μl) contained: 40 mm HEPES·KOH (pH 7.6 at 1 m); 10 mm magnesium acetate; 40 mm phosphocreatine; 2.5 μg of creatine kinase; 7% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (average molecular weight 30,000–70,000); 2 mm ATP; 0.5 mm each GTP, CTP, and UTP; 0.1 mm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and [α-32P]TTP (∼250 mCi/mmol); 200 μg of the crude protein extract prepared from WM433; and 200 ng (600 pmol as nucleotide) of M13mpRE85 replicative form I DNA. Histidine-tagged wild-type or mutant DnaA protein was added to the reaction, and the preparation was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Nucleotides incorporated into acid-insoluble materials were retained on GF/C filters (Millipore) and measured by liquid scintillation counting. DNA Replication with Defined Components—In vitro replication of pBSoriC, dependent on eight purified replication proteins, was largely performed as described (30Crooke E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Reactions (25 μl) contained: 30 mm Tricine·KOH (pH 8.25); 7 mm magnesium acetate; 2 mm ATP; 0.5 mm each GTP, CTP, and UTP; 0.1 mm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and [α-32P]TTP (∼250 mCi/mmol); 200 ng (600 pmol as nucleotide) pBSoriC; 450 ng of single strand binding protein (SSB); 10 ng of HU; 400 ng of gyrase A subunit; 180 ng of gyrase B subunit; 150 ng of DnaB·DnaC complex; 12 ng of DnaG primase; 500 ng of DNA polymerase III*; 25 ng of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme β-subunit; and the indicated amounts of DnaA proteins. The mixtures were assembled at 0 °C and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Nucleotides incorporated into acid-insoluble materials were retained on GF/C filters (Millipore) and measured by liquid scintillation counting. Extraction of E. coli Phospholipids—A frozen suspension (5 g) of W3110 cells was thawed, mixed with a solution (20 ml) of 0.12 m sodium acetate (pH 4.8), and extracted with chloroform (25 ml) and methanol (55 ml). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (5 min, 7,000 × g, 20 °C), and the supernatant was made biphasic by the addition of chloroform and water to a final chloroform:methanol:water ratio of 2:2:1.8. The aqueous phase was removed, and the organic layer was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. The residue was dissolved in diethyl ether (0.5 ml), mixed with nitrogen gas-purged acetone (25 ml) that contained β-mercaptoethanol (1 mm), and stirred for 3 h. The insoluble lipids were collected by centrifugation, dried under nitrogen gas, and dissolved in a minimum volume of chloroform. The amount of phosphorous was determined (31Ames B.V. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the concentration of phospholipids calculated assuming an average molecular weight of 700. Preparation of Lipid Vesicles—To prepare small unilamellar vesicles, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or E. coli phospholipids in CHCl3 were dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and suspended in water by sonication (15 min, 0 °C) with 30% bursts with a microtip probe sonicator (Branson). Sonicated lipids were centrifuged (10 min, 140,000 × g, 4 °C) and the supernatants, which contained small unilamellar vesicles, were collected. Phospholipid concentrations were measured by a phosphomolybdate colorimetric assay (31Ames B.V. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other Methods—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye-binding method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Nucleotide Binding by DnaA(L366K) and Wild-type DnaA Is Similar—DnaA(L366K) possesses high affinities for ATP and ADP with dissociation constants of 135 and 58 nm, respectively (Table I), values similar to those observed for wild-type DnaA (Table I and Ref. 6Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In addition to similar binding affinities, the molar ratios of bound nucleotide to protein were indistinguishable between DnaA and DnaA(L366K), whether for the binding of ATP or ADP (Table I).Table INucleotide-binding properties of DnaA and DnaA(L366K)DnaADnaA(L366K)ATP bindingKD (μm)0.033 ± 0.0050.058 ± 0.013ATP/DnaA0.30 ± 0.090.36 ± 0.03ADP bindingKD (μm)0.095 ± 0.0230.135 ± 0.03ADP/DnaA0.43 ± 0.060.59 ± 0.32 Open table in a new tab DnaA(L366K) Retains Specificity of Acidic Phospholipids for Nucleotide Release—The leucine to lysine amino acid substitution in DnaA does not alter the requirement of the protein that phospholipid bilayers must contain anionic species to promote release of bound nucleotide from DnaA. DnaA and DnaA(L366K) respond identically in the release of bound ADP when treated with increasing amounts of phosphatidylglycerol vesicles (Fig. 1A). Likewise, both the wild-type and mutant forms of DnaA retain the bound nucleotide when exposed to lipid bilayers containing only phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 1B), a zwitterionic phospholipid previously shown to be as equally poor as phosphatidylethanolamine in promoting nucleotide release (14Castuma C.E. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24665-24668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, both forms of the protein responded equally well to phospholipids extracted from E. coli cells (Fig. 1C), which have a membrane phospholipid composition of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin at an approximate ratio of 70:22:8. Thus, DnaA(L366K) does not appear to facilitate growth in acidic phospholipid-deficient cells through a mechanism of protein rejuvenation by neutral membranes. DnaA(L366K) Has Intrinsic ATPase Activity—DnaA(L366K) retains the intrinsic ATPase activity of wild-type DnaA. Bound ATP is slowly hydrolyzed with half being consumed in ∼45 min (Fig. 2), kinetics comparable with what has previously been seen for purified DnaA under similar conditions (6Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 27Li Z. Crooke E. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). And as with the wild-type protein, the resulting ADP from ATP hydrolysis remains bound to DnaA(L366K) (Fig. 2). Therefore, the point mutation in DnaA(L366K) does not affect the protein conversion from the active ATP form to inactive ADP-DnaA. DnaA(L366K) Is Sensitive to RIDA—DnaA(L366K) treated with crude cell extracts showed diminished replication activity (data not shown), indicating that it is sensitive to RIDA. Furthermore, in vivo experiments have shown that deletion of the hda gene (12Camara J.E. Skarstad K. Crooke E. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3244-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), an essential component of RIDA (10Kato J. Katayama T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4253-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), failed to alleviate the growth arrest in cells lacking adequate levels of acidic phospholipids (data not shown). Both of these findings support the conclusion that the growth rescuing phenomenon of DnaA(L366K) is not caused by its resistance to Hda-mediated inactivation. DnaA(L366K) Is Feeble at Initiating Replication from oriC in Vitro—DnaA(L366K), although indistinguishable from the wild-type protein in its nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and requirement for acidic phospholipids to promote nucleotide release, is poor at directing replication from oriC in a system reconstituted with purified proteins (Fig. 3A). Wild-type DnaA produced maximal DNA synthesis when levels of protein that represent DnaA to oriC ratios of ∼10–12 DnaA molecules per oriC were used, similar to previous data. However, when DnaA(L366K) was used, even at a level of 18 mutant protein molecules per oriC, only a very low amount of DNA synthesis resulted (Fig. 3A). Moreover, DnaA(L366K) was poor at initiating replication in a crude cell extract that lacked DnaA activity because it was prepared from a dnaA temperature-sensitive strain. Again, maximal synthesis was seen when the reactions contained ∼10 wild-type DnaA molecules per oriC.In contrast, DnaA(L366K) was completely inactive despite being present at up to 20 protein molecules per oriC (Fig. 3B). oriC Binding Activity of DnaA(L366K) Is Comparable with That of DnaA—The inability of DnaA(L366K) to initiate replication is not due its failure to bind oriC. The wild-type and the mutant forms of DnaA were equally effective at binding to supercoiled oriC plasmids as determined by a filter-retention assay (Fig. 4). In agreement with the in vitro DNA replication results, DNA binding reached a plateau of about 130 fmol of template bound, corresponding to ∼15 DnaA or DnaA(L366K) molecules per origin. ATP-DnaA(L366K) Augments Limiting Levels of Wild-type DnaA in Initiating Replication from oriC in Vitro—The mutant form of the protein, although feeble at initiating replication, is able to participate in efficient replication when coupled with minimal levels of wild-type DnaA. Only 53 pmol of DNA synthesis occurred when ATP-DnaA was added at the level of 2 DnaA molecules per oriC (Fig. 5A). When that limiting level of DnaA was combined with either additional wild-type DnaA or DnaA(L366K) protein, robust DNA synthesis ensued with only slightly more DnaA(L366K) needed to obtain the same level of synthesis possible with wild-type DnaA (Fig. 5A). Like wild-type DnaA, DnaA(L366K) needs to be in its ATP form to actively initiate replication from oriC. As expected, the limiting amount of 2 ADP-DnaA molecules per oriC completely failed to initiate replication, being indistinguishable from reactions lacking any DnaA protein (Fig. 5B). However, when supplemented with ATP-DnaA(L366K), over 500 pmol of DNA synthesis was obtained with a total of 13 DnaA molecules per oriC (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, supplementing the ADP-DnaA with ADP-DnaA(L366K) resulted in poor DNA synthesis. Thus, the nucleotide requirements for DnaA(L366K) to initiate chromosomal replications are similar to those previously seen for the wild-type protein (6Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 15Crooke E. Castuma C.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16779-16782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DnaA(L366K) Must Act in Conjunction with DnaA in Vivo— Replacement of the chromosomal copy of dnaA with the gene for DnaA(L366K) by homologous recombination (32Slater S. Maurer R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4260-4262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) occurred efficiently when cells carried a low copy plasmid expressing dnaA under its own promoter. Specifically, following the second cross-over event, 18 of 20 candidates screened had replaced their chromosomal dnaA with the gene encoding the mutant protein. When cells arising from successful allelic replacement were cured of the expression plasmid harboring wild-type dnaA, 10 of 10 candidates examined had reverted to the wild-type gene at the dnaA locus. Thus, cells cannot tolerate dnaA(L366K) as the sole allele for dnaA. In agreement, in the absence of a plasmid-encoded dnaA, allelic replacement completely failed, with 0 of 100 candidates having exchanged wild-type dnaA for the mutant allele following the second cross-over event. Similar results were seen when cells were depleted of their acidic phospholipids prior to selecting for the second crossover event. Another DnaA with Membrane-binding Domain Mutations Behaves Like DnaA(L366K)—Mizushima and co-workers (33Hase M. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Ohba A. Guo L. Mima S. Makise M. Yamaguchi Y. Tsuchiya T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28651-28656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have also constructed DnaA proteins that contain alterations in the membrane-binding domain. Specifically, basic lysine and arginine residues, singularly or in tandem, were substituted with the acidic amino acid glutamate. The purified mutant proteins retained their capacity to bind adenine nucleotide, and it was reported that DnaA proteins that had the lysine at position 372 substituted with glutamate (K372E) had ∼4-fold decreased rates for the release of bound nucleotide when compared with wild-type DnaA (33Hase M. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Ohba A. Guo L. Mima S. Makise M. Yamaguchi Y. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28651-28656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These kinetic measurements were performed with a low molar ratio of cardiolipin to protein. Working with DnaA(R360E, R364E, K372E) (termed DnaA431 in Ref. 33Hase M. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Ohba A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28651-28656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that we purified, as well as some kindly provided by T. Mizushima, we obtained a similar 3- to 4-fold decreased rate in nucleotide release from DnaA431 compared with wild-type DnaA when examined at the same low cardiolipin to DnaA ratio (Fig. 6A, squares). However, when cardiolipin levels were increased just 2-fold, the difference seen between DnaA431 and wild-type decreased (Fig. 6A, triangles), and with the concentration of cardiolipin increased 4-fold, the rate of release of nucleotide from DnaA431 approached that for wild-type DnaA (Fig. 6A, circles). The similar behavior of DnaA and DnaA431 when exposed to acidic phospholipids is further illustrated by their comparable response to treatment with cardiolipin vesicles over a 10-fold concentration range (Fig. 6B). We further examined DnaA431 using vesicles composed of lipids other than 100% cardiolipin. When treated with acidic liposomes composed of 80% phosphatidylglycerol and 20% phosphatidylcholine nucleotide release from DnaA431 and wild-type DnaA were indistinguishable, and DnaA431, like wild-type DnaA, was inert to 100% phosphatidylcholine vesicles (Fig. 6C). Moreover, DnaA431 and wild-type DnaA bound equally well to the acidic and not neutral liposomes (100% phosphatidylcholine) as analyzed by isopynic centrifugation as previously described (34Kitchen J.L. Li Z. Crooke E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Furthermore, DnaA431 protein responded like wild-type DnaA when treated with vesicles composed of phospholipids extracted from E. coli cells (Fig. 6D). Thus, DnaA431 and wild-type DnaA behave in a largely similar manner when treated with acidic phospholipid-containing membranes other than the specific case of low levels of liposomes composed solely of cardiolipin. Like DnaA(L366K) (25Zheng W. Li Z. Skarstad K. Crooke E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), DnaA431 restored growth to acidic phospholipid-deficient cells but cannot be the sole source of cellular DnaA (data not shown). The biochemical properties of two different DnaA proteins that possess mutations in the membrane-binding region are similar, and both proteins permit growth in cells lacking acidic phospholipids, perhaps through a common mechanism. A genetic and mutational analysis provided the most direct evidence that there is an in vivo link between DnaA protein function and the lipid composition of the cellular membrane (25Zheng W. Li Z. Skarstad K. Crooke E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Specifically, cells that have depleted levels of acidic phospholipids, which normally would be arrested for growth, are able to keep growing when DnaA(L366K) is expressed. That a single amino acid substitution in the initiator of chromosomal replication, DnaA protein, can restore growth to cells that have stopped growing because of an altered membrane lipid composition argues for a physiologically relevant relationship between DnaA and the cell membrane. Previous biochemical studies suggest anionic lipids participate in the regulation of DnaA protein. Fluid bilayers possessing adequate levels of acidic phospholipids promote the release of ADP from DnaA, and when the protein is bound to DNA an exchange of ATP for ADP can occur, thereby rejuvenating inactive ADP-DnaA into active ATP-DnaA (13Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Castuma C.E. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24665-24668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Crooke E. Castuma C.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16779-16782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was observed that basic and neutral phospholipids block acidic phospholipids from promoting nucleotide release from Staphylococcus aureus DnaA (35Ichihashi N. Kurokawa K. Matsuo M. Kaito C. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28778-28786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In view of these biochemical findings, purified DnaA(L366K) was examined here to determine whether the molecular mechanism of how the mutant protein supports growth of cells lacking acidic phospholipids is based on the protein being altered in its adenine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties or its response to treatment with fluid lipid bilayers. For each of these aspects studied, DnaA(L366K) was largely similar to wild-type DnaA, thereby suggesting that the function of wild-type DnaA adversely affected in acidic phospholipid-deficient cells is something other than nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and exchange. Although DnaA(L366K) has origin binding activity, the mutant protein is unable to initiate replication from oriC in vitro (Fig. 3) or serve as the sole source of DnaA activity in vivo (25Zheng W. Li Z. Skarstad K. Crooke E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, based upon known initiation functions of DnaA protein, DnaA(L366K) acting on its own may not possess the ability to properly oligomerize at oriC and promote strand opening of the AT-rich 13-mers or to successfully recruit the replicative helicase, DnaB, to the opened origin DNA. Analogously, wild-type DnaA is no longer able to carry out all of its necessary chromosomal replication functions in cells lacking sufficient levels of acidic phospholipids (25Zheng W. Li Z. Skarstad K. Crooke E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The absence of acidic phospholipids does not appear to cause growth arrest simply by depleting the concentration of available DnaA because high level expression of additional wild-type DnaA failed to restore growth (25Zheng W. Li Z. Skarstad K. Crooke E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Instead, an essential DnaA function is most likely perturbed in acidic phospholipid-deficient cells, and growth only occurs when DnaA(L366K) provides this missing function. In such a case, the function of wild-type DnaA affected in acidic phospholipid-deficient cells must be distinct from the missing function of DnaA(L366K). Because both proteins have similar nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and exchange characteristics in vitro as shown here, none of these functions seem to be the DnaA function adversely affected by the absence of acidic phospholipids, as originally speculated (25Zheng W. Li Z. Skarstad K. Crooke E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The results from the in vitro studies presented here support the argument that DnaA(L366K) acts in conjunction with wild-type DnaA, with DnaA and DnaA(L366K) forming functional mixed oligomers at oriC. Specifically, DnaA(L366K) on its own is unable to support DNA replication (Fig. 3) as is an insufficient concentration of wild-type DnaA (Fig. 5). Yet, origins with limiting amounts of wild-type DnaA can be activated for replication when augmented with DnaA(L366K) (Fig. 5). With neither form of DnaA able to initiate replication from oriC on its own under these conditions (Figs. 3 and 5), the most likely possibility is that DnaA and DnaA(L366K) work together at oriC as a mixed oligomer, facilitating DNA replication (Fig. 5). In agreement with the in vivo and in vitro data that DnaA and DnaA(L366K) cooperatively initiate replication at oriC, Kaguni and co-workers (21Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that two inactive mutant DnaA proteins can complement each other for DNA replication from oriC in vivo even when one of the DnaA proteins is defective at DNA binding. In support, molecular modeling based on the crystal structure of a truncated form of A. aeolicus DnaA (18Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) suggests that productive DnaA protomer-protomer association can occur between domain III regions of neighboring DnaA molecules without participation of the DNA binding region. The domain III putative protomer-protomer interactions sites are distinct from residue 366 as well as residues 360, 364, and 372 (the amino acids substituted in DnaA431), all of which lie within a long amphipathic helix that connects domains III and IV (18Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). According to gel filtration and sedimentation data, purified DnaA exists as a monomer in solution (3Crooke E. Thresher R. Hwang D.S. Griffith J. Kornberg A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Li Z. Crooke E. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Hwang D.S. Crooke E.

A. 1983; 80: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), as does DnaA(L366K). Moreover, DnaA(L366K), which is isolated from cells that also express wild-type DnaA, emerges from gel filtration as a monomer during its purification, indicating that DnaA(L366K) and wild-type DnaA do not oligomerize in solution. In the presence of oriC, multiple copies of DnaA protein cluster on the origin, as detected by electron microscopy (1Fuller R. Funnell B. Kornberg A.

Microbiol. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The filter retention stoichiometry data presented here (Fig. 4) indicate that DnaA(L366K) oligomerizes at oriC, and the observed efficient DNA replication (Fig. 5) provides evidence that DnaA and DnaA(L366K) form functional mixed oligomers at oriC in vitro. Beyond permitting growth in cells lacking acidic phospholipids, DnaA(L366K) affects replication in cells with a normal membrane composition. Expression of plasmid-borne DnaA(L366K) in cells possessing chromosomally encoded wild-type dnaA and carrying out ordinary phospholipid synthesis results in reduced initiation events (25Zheng W. Li Z. Skarstad K. Crooke E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) consistent with the concept that the mutant and wild-type DnaA proteins affect the same origin, acting as a mixed oligomer. The results presented here suggest that the mechanism by which DnaA(L366K) supports growth in cells with low levels of acidic phospholipids is independent of the nucleotide binding and hydrolysis characteristics of the protein as well as how it responds to acidic versus neutral lipids with respect to nucleotide release. Supporting this argument, another DnaA protein with amino acid substitutions in the membrane-binding domain, DnaA431, also rescues acidic phospholipid-deficient cells in vivo and behaves like DnaA(L366K) when exposed to phospholipids in vitro. Defining what domains of DnaA(L366K) are essential versus dispensable for growth to occur in acidic phospholipid-deficient cells will likely give insight into the essential function of DnaA that is perturbed in acidic phospholipid-deficient cells and may reveal a novel acidic phospholipid-dependent function of DnaA in the chromosomal replication cycle."

Phosphate carrier (PiC) is an inner membrane protein with 6 transmembrane segments (TM1–TM6) and requires, after translocation across the outer membrane, the Tim9-Tim10 complex and the TIM22 complex to be inserted into the inner membrane.

Newly synthesized organellar and secretory proteins are translocated across or inserted into biological membranes before they become functional. Among several different eukaryotic organelles, mitochondria are unique in being bounded by two biological membranes, the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, rendering delivery of mitochondrial proteins to their destination suborganellar compartments highly complex. Mitochondria have translocators, membrane protein complexes that recognize targeting/sorting signals of mitochondrial proteins and facilitate their translocation across and/or insertion into the membranes. The outer membrane contains two TOM 1The abbreviations used are: TOM, translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane; DHFR, mouse dihydrofolate reductase; IMS, intermembrane space; PiC, phosphate carrier; PiC-DHFR, a fusion protein between a PiC segment and DHFR; PK, proteinase K; pSu9-DHFR, a fusion protein between the presequence of subunit 9 of F0-ATPase and DHFR; TIM, translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane; TM, transmembrane; WT, wild-type. (translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane) complexes as translocators, the TOM40 complex and TOB/SAM complex, and the inner membrane contains two TIM (translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane) complexes as translocators, the TIM23 complex and TIM22 complex (1Herrmann J.M.

The TOM40 complex mediates translocation across or insertion into the outer membrane for nearly all mitochondrial proteins. Most matrix proteins and some inner membrane proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as precursor proteins with an N-terminal cleavable presequence. After translocation through the TOM40 channel in the outer membrane, the proteins are passed onto the TIM23 complex and move through the TIM23 channel with the aid of MMC (mitochondrial Hsp70-associated motor and chaperone) proteins, i.e. mitochondrial Hsp70 and its partner proteins (4Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 5Rehling P. Brandner K. Pfanner N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Polytopic inner membrane proteins, including metabolic carrier proteins, are synthesized in the cytosol without a presequence. After crossing the outer membrane via the TOM40 complex, these proteins are bound by the 70-kDa Tim9-Tim10 complex in the intermembrane space (IMS), which likely functions as a chaperone to prevent aggregate formation of the hydrophobic substrate proteins in the aqueous IMS (6Koehler C.M. Merchant S. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 428-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Neupert W. Brunner M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Then the Tim9-Tim10 complex delivers the substrate proteins to the 300-kDa TIM22 complex consisting of the core complex (Tim22, Tim18, and Tim54) and the peripheral subunits (Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12), which facilitates insertion of substrate proteins into the inner membrane. The IMS contains many small and soluble proteins, including small Tim proteins that lack presequences. These small IMS proteins reach the IMS through the TOM40 channel with the aid of the inner membrane proteins Tim40/Mia40 (8Chacinska A. Pfannschmidt S. Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Szklarz L.K.S.

Although some single-membrane spanning outer membrane proteins are directly inserted into the outer membrane from the TOM40 complex, β-barrel outer membrane proteins first reach the IMS side of the outer membrane through the TOM40 complex and are then inserted into the outer membrane with the assistance of small Tim proteins in the IMS and the TOB/SAM complex in the outer membrane (11Pfanner N. Wiedemann N. Meisinger C. Lithgow T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biology. 2004; 11: 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The TOM40 complex is thus the entry point for mitochondrial protein import pathways, which subsequently diverge from the TOM40 complex into distinct pathways for different sub-mitochondrial destinations. Then a question may arise as to how proteins are sorted among different import pathways after translocation through the TOM40 channel. Although current evidence suggests that at the exit of the TOM40 channel both Tim50 and the Tim9-Tim10 complex are waiting for the incoming polypeptide and pass it onto one of the translocators, i.e. the TIM23, TIM22, and SAM/TOB complexes, it is still unclear what the sorting signals are and how they are sorted to different pathways. In the present study, we analyzed the import of fusion proteins containing various deletion mutants of phosphate carrier (PiC), which is a substrate for the TIM22 complex (12Sirrenberg C. Endres M.

Mitochondrial carrier proteins such as PiC and the ATP/ADP carrier are synthesized in the cytosol without an N-terminal cleavable presequence but consist of three structurally related modules (6Koehler C.M.

Each module contains a pair of hydrophobic transmembrane segments (TM1–TM6) connected by a loop that contains a conserved “carrier signature” motif and is exposed to the matrix in the final assembled form. We found here that some of the fusion proteins containing truncated PiC segments were unexpectedly localized to the matrix via the TIM23 pathway instead of the TIM22 pathway. Possible mechanisms for this switch of the sorting pathways will be discussed. Plasmids—PiC-DHFR fusion proteins consist of PiC segments fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The PiC segments are named PiC[TM1-TM6], PiC[TM3-TM6], PiC[TM4-TM6], PiC[TM5-TM6]L, PiC[TM5-TM6]S, PiC[TM1-TM2], and PiC[TM3-TM4] for residues 1–311, residues 84–311, residues 137–311, residues 183–311, residues 208–311, residues 1–115, and residues 84–212 of PiC, respectively.

Import reactions were stopped by addition of valinomycin to 10 μg/ml. The mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and radioimaging. Treatments of mitochondria with proteinase K (PK) and Na2CO3, and preparation of mitoplasts were performed as described previously (16Yamamoto H. Esaki M. Kanamori T. Tamura Y. Nishikawa S. Endo T.

Truncated PiC Segments Can Direct DHFR to the Matrix—To reveal the roles of internal segments of PiC in its import into mitochondria, we made DNA constructs for a series of PiC-DHFR fusion proteins between various PiC segments and DHFR (Fig. 1). We synthesized radiolabeled PiC-DHFR fusion proteins as well as PiC as a control with reticulocyte lysate and subjected them to in vitro import experiments with isolated yeast mitochondria. After incubation with mitochondria, PiC became resistant against PK added outside the mitochondria (Fig. 2, PiC, section labeled PiC, lane 2). When mitoplasts were generated from the mitochondria by rupturing the outer membrane and treating with PK, PiC was clipped and a protease-resistant fragment was generated, indicating its insertion into the inner membrane (Fig. 2, section labeled PiC, lane 4). This assembly process of PiC depends strictly on the membrane potential across the inner membrane (ΔΨ), which is essential for the function of the TIM22 complex. Like PiC, PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR (the full-length PiC fused to DHFR) was sequestered to the protease-protected compartment after incubation with mitochondria in the presence of ΔΨ (Fig. 2A, section labeled [TM1-TM6], lane 2). Because both the N terminus and the C terminus of PiC are exposed to the IMS (18Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we expected that if PiC-DHFR fusion proteins were correctly sorted to the inner membrane like PiC, the DHFR part would be exposed to the IMS. This membrane topology of the DHFR domain can be assessed by testing to determine whether protease added outside mitoplasts can cleave off the DHFR part and generate a protease-resistant PiC fragment in the inner membrane. Indeed, >70% of the imported fraction of PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR was degraded by PK added outside the mitoplasts to generate the protease-resistant 32-kDa PiC part (Fig. 2, A, section labeled [TM1-TM6], lane 4, white arrowhead, and B). PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR was thus imported into the IMS, and its PiC part was correctly inserted into the inner membrane, leaving the DHFR part exposed to the IMS.Fig. 2Import of PiC-DHFR fusion proteins into isolated mitochondria.A, radiolabeled PiC and PiC-DHFR fusion proteins were incubated with isolated mitochondria for 20 min at 25 °C in the presence (+) or absence (–) of ΔΨ. After the import, the samples were divided into halves, and one aliquot was subjected to osmotic swelling (SW) to generate mitoplasts. The mitochondria and mitoplasts were treated with 50 μg/ml PK for 30 min on ice.

These results show that, in contrast to PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR, PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR and PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR were mainly (65–75%) imported into the IMS but were not correctly inserted into the inner membrane. PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR (the PiC fragment starting from the hydrophilic segment preceding TM5 fused to DHFR) and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR (the PiC fragment starting from TM5 fused to DHFR) were also imported into mitochondria (Fig. 2A, sections labeled [TM5-TM6]L and [TM5-TM6]S, lanes 2), but most (75–80%) of the imported fractions were protease-resistant even in mitoplasts (Fig. 2A, sections labeled [TM5-TM6]L and [TM5-TM6]S, lane 4). Protease-resistant PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR in both mitochondria and mitoplasts were degraded after solubilization with Triton X-100 (data not shown). These results suggest that PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR containing only one-third of PiC were imported into mitochondria and that ≈80% of the imported fraction unexpectedly directed the DHFR part to the matrix. We next examined possible insertion of the imported PiC-DHFR fusion proteins into the inner membrane by alkaline extraction. Imported PiC and PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR were, like the integral membrane proteins Tim50, Tim17, Tim23, and endogenous PiC, recovered in the pellet fraction after Na2CO3 treatment and ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3), suggesting that they were correctly inserted into the inner membrane. On the other hand, imported PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR, PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR, PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR, and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR were, like the β subunit of F1-ATPase (a peripheral membrane protein) and the soluble proteins cytochrome b2 and mitochondrial Hsp60, recovered in the supernatant fraction after Na2CO3 treatment and ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3). Therefore these fusion proteins lacking at least the first module were not correctly inserted into the inner membrane. Nevertheless, PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR were translocated completely across the inner membrane, whereas PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR and PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR mainly stayed outside the inner membrane, as described above. The failure of PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR, PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR, PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR, and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR in the assembly into the inner membrane may perhaps be due to the lack of the first and/or second modules, which might contain a correct sorting signal to the inner membrane. Because PiC[TM1-TM2]-DHFR, a fusion protein between the first module of PiC and DHFR, could not be imported into mitochondria efficiently (Fig. 2, A and B, section/bars labeled [TM1-TM2]), we cannot test to determine whether the first module actually possesses a sorting signal for the TIM22 pathway. Nevertheless, PiC[TM3-TM4]-DHFR, a fusion protein between the second module of PiC and DHFR, was slightly imported into mitochondria but did not generate a protease-protected PiC part (Fig. 2, A and B, section/bars labeled [TM3-TM4]). This result shows that at least the second module does not contain a correct sorting signal for the TIM22 pathway. Fusion Proteins with Truncated PiC Can Use the TIM23 Complex for Their Import—By which pathway are the fusion proteins PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR delivered to the matrix, the TIM23 pathway or TIM22 pathway? To test the possible involvement of the TIM23 complex, we analyzed the in vitro import of PiC-DHFR fusion proteins into mitochondria isolated from Tim50-depleted (Tim50↓) cells (16Yamamoto H. Esaki M. Kanamori T. Tamura Y. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Cell. 2002; 111: 519-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Tim50 is a subunit of the TIM23 complex and is essential for protein translocation through the TIM23 channel. Mitochondria were isolated from GAL-TIM50 cells in which the TIM50 gene was under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL7 promoter after cultivation in a galactose-free medium at 23 °C for 13.5 h. Because the translocation of presequence-containing precursor proteins through the TIM23 channel requires Tim50, the in vitro import of pSu9-DHFR (a fusion protein between the presequence of subunit 9 of F0-ATPase and DHFR) into Tim50↓ mitochondria was impaired as compared with that into wild-type (WT) mitochondria (Fig. 4A). In contrast, PiC, which uses the TIM22 complex instead of the TIM23 complex for its insertion into the inner membrane, was imported into Tim50↓ mitochondria as efficiently as into WT mitochondria (Fig. 4B). Although PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR was imported into both Tim50↓ mitochondria and WT mitochondria with similar efficiency (Fig. 4C), the import of PiC-DHFR fusion proteins with truncated PiC into mitochondria were affected more or less by the depletion of Tim50. The effects of the Tim50 depletion on in vitro import of the PiC-DHFR fusion proteins were in the order of PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR < PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR ≈ PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR < PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR (Fig. 4, D–G). The import rate of PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR into Tim50↓ mitochondria was reduced to 45% of that into WT mitochondria. The involvement of Tim50, i.e. the TIM23 pathway for the import of the [PiC]-DHFR fusion proteins, can also be assessed by testing the effects of anti-Tim50 antibodies on their import into mitoplasts. In mitoplasts where the outer membrane was selectively ruptured, antibodies can get access to Tim50 so that an antibody binding to Tim50 can block protein import via the TIM23 complex (16Yamamoto H. Esaki M. Kanamori T. Tamura Y. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Cell. 2002; 111: 519-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although pSu9-DHFR was efficiently imported into mitoplasts, the import was significantly inhibited by the presence of anti-Tim50 antibodies (Fig. 5A) as shown previously (16Yamamoto H. Esaki M. Kanamori T. Tamura Y. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Cell. 2002; 111: 519-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In contrast, the import of Tim23, a substrate for the TIM22 pathway, into mitoplasts was not blocked by anti-Tim50 antibodies (Fig. 5B). Because PiC strictly requires small Tim proteins for its insertion into the inner membrane, PiC (data not shown) and PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR (Fig. 5C) were not virtually imported into mitoplasts where substantial fractions of soluble IMS proteins were lost (19Kübrich M. Rassow J. Voos W. Pfanner N. Hönliner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although small fractions of PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR and PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR were imported into mitoplasts, the residual import into mitoplasts was impaired by the presence of anti-Tim50 antibodies. PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR were imported into mitoplasts with an efficiency of ≈50% of that into mitochondria, suggesting that these fusion proteins do not strictly require small and soluble Tim proteins in the IMS for their import into mitoplasts. However, the import of PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR into mitoplasts was significantly blocked by anti-Tim50 antibodies. Taken together, we conclude that, whereas PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR is inserted into the inner membrane via the TIM22 pathway, PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR move across the inner membrane via the TIM23 pathway. The import of PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR and PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR apparently represents situations between PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR or PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR. We also confirmed that anti-Tim23 antibodies impaired the import of pSu9-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR into mitoplasts (data not shown). Import of Fusion Proteins with Fewer PiC TM Segments Are Less Dependent on Tim10 —Because different PiC-DHFR fusion proteins apparently require small Tim proteins differently, we analyzed the role of Tim10 in the import of PiC-DHFR fusion proteins. Mitochondria were isolated from GAL-TIM10 cells in which the TIM10 gene was under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL7 promoter after cultivation in galactose-free medium at 23 °C for 13 h. Although pSu9-DHFR was imported into both Tim10↓ mitochondria and WT mitochondria efficiently (Fig. 6A), the import of PiC and PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR into Tim10↓ mitochondria was significantly reduced to 15% of that into WT mitochondria (Figs. 6, B and C). This finding confirms that the import of PiC and PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR requires Tim10 in the IMS and is consistent with the fact that they are virtually not imported into mitoplasts without Tim10 (see above). On the other hand, the import rates of PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR, PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR, PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR, and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR into Tim10↓ mitochondria were decreased to 50% of that into WT mitochondria (Fig. 6, D–G). Therefore, PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR, PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR, PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR, and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR only partly require Tim10 for their import into mitochondria. In the present study, we revealed that PiC, which is inserted into the inner membrane via the TIM22 pathway, has a latent ability to guide a passenger protein, DHFR, to the matrix via the TIM23 pathway. When fused to DHFR, the full-length PiC behaves like an authentic PiC and uses the Tim9-Tim10 complex in the IMS and the TIM22 complex to get itself inserted into the inner membrane (Fig. 7). Import or at least translocation across the outer membrane of the truncated PiC segments fused to DHFR (PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR, PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR, PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR, and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR) requires the Tim9-Tim10 complex only partly (50% at most). After translocation across the outer membrane, PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR were efficiently translocated across the inner membrane and reached the matrix via the TIM23 pathway (Fig. 7). It is not clear if the TIM23 complex receives these fusion proteins only from the TOM40 complex or from the Tim9-Tim10 complex as well. PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR and PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR, which passed through the TOM40 channel, remained in the IMS but did not behave like integral membrane proteins. This means that, after translocation across the outer membrane, these fusion proteins cannot be inserted into the inner membrane with the aid of the TIM22 complex or cross the inner membrane through the TIM23 channel (Fig. 7). What controls the sorting between the TIM23 pathway and the TIM22 pathway for the PiC-DHFR fusion proteins? A trivial possibility is that the DHFR has a cryptic sorting signal to the TIM23 pathway, which is exposed by the unfolding of the DHFR part upon translocation through the TOM40 channel and that this sorting signal competes with the sorting signal for the TIM22 pathway carried by the TM segments in the PiC part. However, this possibility seems unlikely, because PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR, whose DHFR domains are folded on the basis of the protease digestion experiments (data not shown), could be imported into mitoplasts (Fig. 5), whereas folded DHFR alone could not (data not shown). Presumably, the six hydrophobic TM segments of PiC tend to aggregate and require chaperone functions of the Tim9-Tim10 complex to prevent aggregate formation (18Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 942-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because PiC and PiC[TM1-TM6]-DHFR have six TM segments, they are efficiently associated with the Tim9-Tim10 complex and passed on to the TIM22 complex. On the other hand, the fusion proteins with a truncated PiC segment have fewer TM segments so that the Tim9-Tim10 complex binds to them only partly. Apparently, even the fractions of these proteins bound to the Tim9-Tim10 complex are not productive transport intermediates and are not correctly transferred to the TIM22 complex. What happens to the fractions of these proteins that passed the outer membrane but are not associated with the Tim9-Tim10 complex? Although as much as 50% of PiC[TM5-TM6]L-DHFR and PiC[TM5-TM6]S-DHFR were transferred to the TIM23 complex, only 20% of PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR and PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR were received by the TIM23 complex (Fig. 5). This result is likely due to the possibility that PiC[TM3-TM6]-DHFR and PiC[TM4-TM6]-DHFR, which are not associated with the Tim9-Tim10 complex, may form an aggregate or stick nonspecifically to the membrane, thereby becoming transport-incompetent in the IMS. Therefore, PiC apparently has a latent sorting signal for the TIM23 pathway that is exposed if the PiC segment is not concealed by the Tim9-Tim10 complex but still remains import-competent. A precise determination of the PiC segments recognized by the Tim9-Tim10 complex and the TIM23 complex will help us to understand further the mechanism of sorting between the TIM22 and TIM23 pathways.

A direct role in K+ binding was postulated for Na,K-ATPase but was not found in a recent model for gastric H,K-ATPase (Koenderink, J. B., Swarts, H. G. P., Willems, P. H. G. M., Krieger, E., and De Pont, J. J. H. H. M. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 16417–16424). Therefore, its role in K+ binding and E1/E2 conformational equilibrium in gastric H,K-ATPase was studied by site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Sf9 cells. N792Q and N792A, but not N792D and N792E, had a markedly reduced K+ affinity in both the ATPase and dephosphorylation reactions. In addition, N792A shifted the conformational equilibrium to the E1 form. In double mutants, the effect of N792A on K+ sensitivity was overruled by either E820Q (K+-independent activity) or E343D (no dephosphorylation activity). Models were made for the mutants based on the E2 structure of Ca2+-ATPase. In the wild-type model the acid amide group of Asn792 has hydrogen bridges to Lys791, Ala339, and Val341. Comparison of the effects of the various mutants suggests that the hydrogen bridge between the carbonyl oxygen of Asn792 and the amino group of Lys791 is essential for the K+ sensitivity and the E2 preference of wild-type enzyme. Moreover, there was a high positive correlation (r = 0.98) between the in silico calculated energy difference of the E2 form (mutants versus wild type) and the experimentally measured IC50 values for vanadate, which reflects the direction of the E2↔E1 conformational equilibrium.

Negatively charged and other polar residues present in transmembrane helices in P-type ATPases have long been considered to be important for cation binding. Clarke et al. (1Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) had already shown in 1989 the role of a number of these residues in Ca2+ binding in sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase. This role was confirmed by the crystal structure of this enzyme in the Ca2+-bound E1 form (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Because of homology within the family of P-type ATPases, this structure is also helpful for other ATPases to elucidate the binding sites for those cations that are transported out of the cytoplasm.In P-type ATPases of the IIC class (3Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), such as Na,K-ATPase and gastric H,K-ATPase, Na+ and H+ are transported to the extracellular medium in exchange for K+ ions that are transported toward the cytosol. K+ ions are bound to the phosphorylated E2 form (E2P) of these enzymes and stimulate its dephosphorylation. Several mutagenesis studies have addressed the role of specific polar residues present within transmembrane helices in K+ binding. The most powerful assay in these studies was the measurement of K+-stimulated dephosphorylation. In gastric H,K-ATPase, strong evidence for a role for Glu343 (4Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B.

In the latter enzyme, direct binding studies with the K+ analogue, 204Tl+, supported these findings (10Nielsen J.M. Pedersen P.A. Karlish S.J.D. Jorgensen P.L.

In Ca2+-ATPase, K+ ions are absent but protons are present in this pocket, and the detailed structure of the pocket must therefore be rather different between various ATPases.

In agreement with the literature, they found two K+-binding sites that were localized side by side. Each K+ ion was surrounded by six oxygen atoms that are responsible for cation binding. Side chains Glu786 (M5) and Asp811 (M6) provided binding oxygens to both K+ ions in this model. 1For Na,K-ATPase, the numbering of Ogawa and Toyoshima (12Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The other oxygen atoms of K+-binding site I were donated by Ser782 (M5), Asp815 (M6), Gln930 (M8), and a water molecule. The four residual oxygen atoms of K+-binding site II were donated by three main chain residues present in the unwound part of M4 (Val329, Ala330, and Val332) and by Asn783 (M5). Jorgensen (13Jorgensen P.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) postulated a roughly similar structure for the K+-binding sites in Na,K-ATPase but suggested an additional role of Glu334 (M4) in K+-binding site II. The latter role was based on equilibrium binding studies with expressed Na,K-ATPase mutants showing that mutation of Glu334 in either an Asp or a Gln residue completely abolished the 204Tl+ occlusion (10Nielsen J.M. Pedersen P.A. Karlish S.J.D. Jorgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1961-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Koenderink et al. (14Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. Krieger E.

Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) to gastric H,K-ATPase but found in this enzyme only one K+-binding site that was comparable to the postulated K+-binding site II in Na,K-ATPase. K+-binding site I could not be found because of the presence of an E2-specific salt bridge between Lys791 (M5) and Glu820 (M6), which sterically prevented the existence of the second K+-binding site. The oxygen atoms that bound K+ in its single binding site in gastric H,K-ATPase originated from the side chains of Glu795 (M5) and Glu820 (M6) as well as from the main chain residues of Val338 and Val341 (M4). In addition, both oxygen atoms of Glu343 (M4), which is analogous to Glu334 in Na,K-ATPase, bound the K+ ion.Comparison between K+-binding site II in the models of Na,K-ATPase (12Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 13Jorgensen P.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and the single K+-binding site in the model for gastric H,K-ATPase (14Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. Krieger E.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16417-16424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) shows that there is no direct binding role for Asn792 (M5) in the gastric H,K-ATPase model, whereas such a role for the analogous residue Asn783 is postulated in both models of Na,K-ATPase.In this study, we examine the putative role of Asn792 in the K+-binding site of gastric H,K-ATPase by site-directed mutagenesis. Because of the postulated role of Glu343 and Glu820 in K+ binding (14Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. Krieger E. De Pont J.J.H. H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16417-16424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we also performed combined mutations of N792A with E820Q and/or E343D. The data obtained in this study make it likely that the carbonyl oxygen atom of Asn792 is not directly involved in K+ binding but that this amino acid residue participates in the hydrogen bond network around this pocket and thus keeps the structure of the K+-binding pocket intact.MATERIALS AND METHODSSite-directed Mutagenesis and Generation of Recombinant Viruses— The cDNAs of the rat gastric H,K-ATPase α- and β-subunits were cloned in the pFastbacdual vector (Invitrogen) (15Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwé G.L.J. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J. H. H.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis on Asn792 was performed, and the mutants were checked by sequence analysis. All DNA manipulations, transformation of the vector, transfection into Sf9 cells, and harvesting of viruses were carried out as described previously (16Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Preparation and Characterization of Sf9 Membranes—Growth of Sf9 cells, isolation of membranes, protein quantification, and immunoblotting were performed according to Swarts et al. (4Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7890-7895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and corrected for the activity of mock-infected cells. The ATP-dependent phosphorylation level was determined at 21 °C as described previously (4Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol.

The rate of dephosphorylation was determined by measuring the residual phosphorylation level at 3 s after a 10-fold dilution with non-radioactive ATP (4Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H.

D. Strader (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ). The antibody HKB was a gift of Dr. Michael Caplan (Yale University).Analysis of Data—All data are presented as mean values for three to eight individual preparations ± S. E. IC50 and K0.5 values were determined by analyzing the plots using the Non-Linear Curve Fitting program (Hill equation function) of Origin 6.1 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA).Molecular Modeling of Gastric H,K-ATPase Mutants—The in silico mutants were derived from the homology model of the wild-type protein described previously (7Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After changing the respective amino acid(s), all side chain rotamers around the K+-binding site were re-optimized. This was done by first extracting a sequence- and backbone-dependent (18Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 543-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) rotamer library from a non-redundant subset (19Wang G. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1589-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) of the Protein Data Bank (<30% sequence identity, <2.5-Å resolution), inserting a random rotamer, calculating the energy using the Yamber2 force field (20Krieger E. Darden T. Nabuurs S.B. Finkelstein A. Vriend G. Proteins. 2004; 57: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), and iterating the last two steps until the energy converged (i.e. no improvement found for 50 search steps). Finally, the active site including the K+ ion was energy-minimized by a short steepest descent and 500 steps of low temperature simulation annealing. This did not lead to any different rotamers, but it removed random conformational stress to arrive at comparable energies. From these final energies, the energy of the wild-type model was subtracted to obtain the ΔE values shown on the horizontal axis in Fig. 7. Ideally, stability predictions for mutant proteins in the E2 conformation would also consider the competing E1 form of the protein. However, the fact that the investigated residues are spread apart in the E1 conformation and interact with lots of other amino acids, several of which must be expected to contain errors typical for homology models, makes it very unlikely that more accurate results can be obtained this way. Only in the E2 conformation does the K+ ion provide an anchor point to reliably predict the conformations of the surrounding residues. Our experiments also indicate that the mutations do not cause big differences in the E1 conformation: all proteins can be phosphorylated easily.RESULTSSingle Mutants—The K+-activated ATPase activities were measured at 10 μm ATP (Fig. 1). At this low ATP concentration, the K+-stimulated ATPase activity of the wild-type enzyme is maximal at 1 mm K+ and decreases again at higher K+ concentrations (4Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36909-36916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whereas K+ stimulates with high affinity from the extracellular side, it inhibits with low affinity from the cytosolic side (17Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H. H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7890-7895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The latter inhibition is antagonized by the high ATP concentrations normally used in ATPase assays but is apparent at the low (10 μm) ATP concentration used in this study. The K+-activated ATPase activities of the single Asn792 mutants measured at 10 μm ATP (Fig. 1B) were rather low as compared with that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1A) and were only slightly higher than that of the mock-infected enzyme (Fig. 1C). The N792D and N792E mutants, like the wild-type enzyme, showed a slightly higher activity with 1 mm K+ than with 10 mm K+, whereas the opposite was found with the N792A and N792Q mutants. This suggests a lower K+ sensitivity for the latter two mutants. For comparison, the K+-independent activity of the E820Q mutant and the (absence of any) ATPase activity of the E343D and E343D/E820Q mutants (14Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. Krieger E. De Pont J.J.H. H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16417-16424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) are also shown in Fig. 1A.Fig. 1Effect of K+ on the ATPase activity of H,K-ATPase mutants. ATPase activity was measured at pH 7.0 and 10 μm ATP, in the absence and presence of 1 and 10 mm KCl. The activities were expressed as a percentage of the residual activity in the presence of 100 μm SCH 28080. Values represent the means ± S.E. for three to seven experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)All mutants, including those without or with a very minor ATPase activity, could be phosphorylated by ATP (Fig. 2). The steady-state phosphorylation levels of the N792D and N792E mutants were significantly lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas those of the N792Q and N792A mutants were approximately similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The phosphorylation levels of the E343D, E820Q, and E343D/E820Q mutants were not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme.Fig. 2Phosphorylation level of gastric H,K-ATPase mutants. The phosphorylation levels of the indicated mutants were determined after incubation with 0.1 μm ATP in the absence of K+ for 10 s at room temperature and corrected for the average value obtained with mock-infected cells (1.19 ± 0.09 pmol/mg protein). Values are the average from 3–14 experiments and are given as mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Fig. 3 the effect of K+ on the dephosphorylation process is presented. Therefore, the wild-type enzyme and the various mutants were first phosphorylated for 10 s at room temperature and then, after dilution, incubated for 3 s in the presence of various K+ concentrations. The residual level of phosphorylated intermediate was used as an estimate of the dephosphorylation rate. The wild-type enzyme was very K+-sensitive, as shown by the fact that K+ at 0.3 mm already decreased the phosphorylation level by 90%. The residual phosphorylation level of the E820Q mutant decreased by 80–90% independent of the presence of K+ (21Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J. H. H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The E343D and E343D/E820Q mutants were hardly dephosphorylated at any of the K+ concentrations used. Fig. 3B shows that the phosphorylated intermediate of the N792D mutant, like that of the wild-type enzyme, nearly completely disappeared after a 3-s incubation with 0.3 mm K+. The phosphorylated intermediate of the N792E mutant was slightly less K+-sensitive. The phosphorylation intermediate levels of both the N792Q and N792A mutants, however, were hardly reduced by 0.3 mm K+. For these mutants, 1–3 mm K+ was needed for 50% reduction of the phosphorylation level in 3 s. This finding is in agreement with the lower apparent K+ sensitivities as measured for the N792Q and N792A mutants in the ATPase activity assay (Fig. 1B).Fig. 3Effect of K+ on the dephosphorylation rate of the phosphorylated intermediate of H,K-ATPase mutants. The various mutants were phosphorylated for 10 s at room temperature as described in the Fig. 2 legend. The residual amount of phosphorylated intermediate obtained after a 3-s incubation with the indicated concentrations of KCl is expressed as a percentage of the amount at t = 0. This figure is the average of three to seven experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The phosphorylation level of all four single mutants, like that of the wild-type enzyme, could be decreased by SCH 28080 (Fig. 4, A and B). However, only the IC50 value for inhibition by SCH 28080 of the N792Q mutant was similar to that of the wild type. The three other single mutants were 10–100 times less sensitive toward this inhibitor. This reduction in affinity could be due to either a change in the binding site for SCH 28080 (22Vagin O. Denevich S. Munson K. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12755-12762Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or an equilibrium shift toward E1 because binding to SCH 28080 occurs with the E2 form of the enzyme (23Mendlein J. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5030-5036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of these four single mutants behaved like the E820Q and E343D/E820Q mutants, in which the phosphorylation level was either unaffected or increased by SCH 28080 (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Effect of SCH 28080 on the phosphorylation level of gastric H,K-ATPase mutants. The phosphorylation level was determined as described in the Fig. 2 legend, in the presence of the indicated concentration of SCH 28080. Values are the average from two to four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The phosphorylation level of the four single mutants was also decreased by the presence of vanadate (Fig. 5). The IC50 value for this decrease is a measure for the direction of the E1/E2 equilibrium (4Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36909-36916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The wild-type enzyme has an IC50 value of 21 ± 7 μm and has a strong preference for the E2 form. A similar low IC50 value was measured for the E343D mutant. The IC50 value of the N792Q mutant (14 ± 9 μm) was not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas those of the N792D (54 ± 20 μm) and N792E (59 ± 30 μm) mutants were approximately twice as high. The IC50 value of the N792A mutant (280 ± 80 μm), however, was 10 times as high as that of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the E1↔E2 equilibrium, like that of the E820Q and E343D/E820Q mutants, has been shifted considerably to the left. The N792A mutant showed the largest difference as compared with the wild-type enzyme with regard to both the K+ affinity and the direction of the E1/E2 equilibrium.Fig. 5IC50 values for the effect of vanadate on the phosphorylation level of gastric H,K-ATPase mutants. The phosphorylation level of the indicated mutants was determined after pre-incubation with different vanadate concentrations followed by incubation with 100 nm radioactive ATP for 10 s. The IC50 values ± S.E. were determined from the average of dose-inhibition curves obtained from three to eight experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Double and Triple Mutants—Previously, we found an interesting behavior for the combined E343D/E820Q mutant. This double mutant, like the E343D mutant, could not be dephosphorylated but, like the E820Q mutant, had a preference for the E1 form (4Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36909-36916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It was therefore interesting to study which effect the N792A mutation had if it was combined with either the E820Q or the E343D mutation. In addition, a triple mutant, N792A/E343D/E820Q, was prepared. The N792A/E343D double mutant and the N792A/E343D/E820Q triple mutant had ATPase activities that were similar to that of the mock-infected cells (Fig. 1C). The activity of these mutants was not affected by either 1 or 10 mm K+. Similar findings were made previously with all other mutants that contained the E343D mutation (4Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36909-36916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P.

However, the N792A/E820Q double mutant, like the E820Q mutant, clearly showed K+-independent ATPase activity, although the activity was lower than that of the E820Q mutant.Both the N792A/E343D double mutant and the N792A/E343D/E820Q triple mutant could be phosphorylated to a level of more than half of that of the N792A mutant (Fig. 2). The phosphorylation level of the N792A/E820Q mutant, however, was much lower than that of both parent single mutants.The N792A/E820Q double mutant, like the E820Q single mutant, dephosphorylated in the absence of K+ for ∼80%, indicating K+-independent dephosphorylation (Fig. 3C). The N792A/E343D and N792A/E343D/E820Q mutants, on the other hand, hardly dephosphorylated with or without K+ present. Thus, the results of the dephosphorylation experiments are in agreement with those of ATPase activity measurements.The steady-state phosphorylation level of the N792A/E343D double mutant decreased at relatively high SCH 28080 concentrations (Fig. 4C), as was also found for the N792A mutant (Fig. 4B). These SCH 28080 concentrations were much higher than those needed to lower the phosphorylation level of the E343D mutant. The relatively low phosphorylation level of the N792A/E820Q double mutant was increased about four times by 100 μm SCH 28080. This increase suggests a very strong preference of this double mutant for the E1 form, so that hardly any enzyme is in the E2 form and ATP phosphorylation is not prevented by SCH 28080. After ATP phosphorylation, the E2-P form produced is stabilized by SCH 28080 (24Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 541-547PubMed Google Scholar). This increase in the phosphorylation level of the N792A/E820Q mutant is even higher than that of the E820Q mutant (Fig. 4A). The phosphorylation level of the N792A/E343D/E820Q triple mutant was increased slightly by addition of SCH 28080, whereas that of the E343D/E820Q mutant neither increased nor decreased (Fig. 4A). These effects of SCH 28080 on these mutants contrast with those on the E343D or N792A single mutants, in which this drug lowered the phosphorylation level. Thus, in double or triple mutants containing the E820Q mutation, the final effect is dominated by the latter mutation.The three studied double and triple mutants all showed a low sensitivity for vanadate (Fig. 5), like the N792A and E820Q single mutants, but unlike the E343D mutant. This again shows that the latter mutation, which blocks K+-activated dephosphorylation, has hardly any effect on the E1/E2 equilibrium.Structure around the K+-binding Site—The construction of the homology model for the wild-type enzyme has been described previously (14Koenderink J.B.

In short, the gastric H,K-ATPase model was built using the E2 form of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (11Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) as a template. Next, K+ was introduced at two spots in the transmembrane region with weak valence-scanning signals (25Nayal M.
