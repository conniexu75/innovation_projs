https://openalex.org/W1967137553,"Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumor suppressor gene initiates colorectal neoplasia. One of the biochemical activities associated with the APC protein is down-regulation of transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin and T cell transcription factor 4 (Tcf-4). The protein products of mutant APC genes present in colorectal tumors were found to be defective in this activity. Furthermore, colorectal tumors with intact APC genes were found to contain activating mutations of β-catenin that altered functionally significant phosphorylation sites. These results indicate that regulation of β-catenin is critical to APC's tumor suppressive effect and that this regulation can be circumvented by mutations in either APC or β-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W2146167376,"The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein binds to β-catenin, a protein recently shown to interact with Tcf and Lef transcription factors. The gene encoding hTcf-4, a Tcf family member that is expressed in colonic epithelium, was cloned and characterized. hTcf-4 transactivates transcription only when associated with β-catenin. Nuclei of APC −/− colon carcinoma cells were found to contain a stable β-catenin-hTcf-4 complex that was constitutively active, as measured by transcription of a Tcf reporter gene. Reintroduction of APC removed β-catenin from hTcf-4 and abrogated the transcriptional transactivation. Constitutive transcription of Tcf target genes, caused by loss of APC function, may be a crucial event in the early transformation of colonic epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2034030391,"Signal transduction by β-catenin involves its posttranslational stabilization and downstream coupling to the Lef and Tcf transcription factors. Abnormally high amounts of β-catenin were detected in 7 of 26 human melanoma cell lines. Unusual messenger RNA splicing and missense mutations in the β-catenin gene ( CTNNB1 ) that result in stabilization of the protein were identified in six of the lines, and the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein (APC) was altered or missing in two others. In the APC-deficient cells, ectopic expression of wild-type APC eliminated the excess β-catenin. Cells with stabilized β-catenin contained a constitutive β-catenin-Lef-1 complex. Thus, genetic defects that result in up-regulation of β-catenin may play a role in melanoma progression."

These interactions include a short-range repulsion and a long-range dipolar attraction, and they lead to the formation of anisotropic chainlike structures by the colloidal particles. The repulsive interaction can lead to novel mechanisms for colloid stabilization."

https://openalex.org/W2032092394,"Involvement of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in inflammatory diseases has been implicated by detection of 3-nitrotyrosine, an allegedly characteristic protein oxidation product, in various inflamed tissues. We show here that nitrite (NO2-), the primary metabolic end product of nitric oxide (NO·), can be oxidized by the heme peroxidases horseradish peroxidase, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and lactoperoxidase (LPO), in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), to most likely form NO·2, which can also contribute to tyrosine nitration during inflammatory processes. Phenolic nitration by MPO-catalyzed NO2- oxidation is only partially inhibited by chloride (Cl-), the presumed major physiological substrate for MPO. In fact, low concentrations of NO2- (2-10 μM) catalyze MPO-mediated oxidation of Cl-, indicated by increased chlorination of monochlorodimedon or 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, most likely via reduction of MPO compound II. Peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of NO2-, as indicated by phenolic nitration, was also observed in the presence of thiocyanate (SCN-), an alternative physiological substrate for mammalian peroxidases. Collectively, our results suggest that NO2-, at physiological or pathological levels, is a substrate for the mammalian peroxidases MPO and lactoperoxidase and that formation of NO2· via peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of NO2- may provide an additional pathway contributing to cytotoxicity or host defense associated with increased NO· production.

Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5742) Google Scholar). Induction of NO· synthesis during inflammatory processes represents a defense mechanism against invading microorganisms, but excessive formation of NO· has also been implicated in host tissue injury (2Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5742) Google Scholar, 3Änggård E. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1199-1206Abstract PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 4Beckman J.S.

Although NO· is a free radical, it has selective reactivity and reacts predominantly with other paramagnetic species, including ferrous or ferric iron in heme proteins or iron-sulfur centers, and other radical species such as molecular oxygen (O2), superoxide anion (O2·¯), and lipid or protein radicals (5Stamler J.S.

Fukuto J.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Byrns R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8103-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), although at physiological concentrations of NO· and O2, this reaction may be too slow to be of major importance in vivo (4Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kharitonov V.G. Sundquist A.R. Sharma V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5881-5883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the vascular system, NO· is rapidly oxidized by reaction with oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), resulting in formation of methemoglobin (Hb3+) and nitrate (NO3-) (11Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg. Chem. 1981; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). NO· also reacts with Hb3+ to form a complex (Hb-NO), which can hydrolyze to Hb2+ and NO2- (reviewed in 12Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). NO· also reacts at a near diffusion-limited rate with O2·¯ to yield peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a powerful oxidizing species, and many of the cytotoxic properties of NO· have in fact been attributed to the formation of ONOO- (4Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction of ONOO- or its conjugate acid, ONOOH, with a wide variety of biomolecules also results in concomitant production of NO2- (7Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L699-L722PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, irrespective of the mechanisms involved, NO2- is a major oxidation product derived from NO·, and increased NO2- levels can often be detected in situations where NO· production is elevated. nitric oxide superoxide anion oxyhemoglobin 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetic acid 4-hydroxy-3-chlorophenylacetic acid 3,3′-bis(4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid horseradish peroxidase monochlorodimedon polymorphonuclear neutrophils high performance liquid chromatography myeloperoxidase lactoperoxidase eosinophil peroxidase 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid. In healthy human subjects, NO2- can be detected at levels of 0.5-3.6 μM in plasma (13Leone A.M. Francis P.L. Rhodes P. Moncada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10828) Google Scholar). Oral NO2- levels are increased dramatically to near millimolar levels after ingestion of nitrate (NO3-) because of NO3- reduction by the oral microflora (17Tannenbaum S.R. Weisman M. Fett D. Fd. Cosmet. Toxicol. 1976; 14: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Extracellular NO2- levels are also markedly increased during inflammatory processes, reflecting increased NO· production. For instance, increased NO2- levels have been detected in synovial fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (18Farrell A.J. Blake D.R. Palmer R.M.J. Maoncada S. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1992; 51: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), and serum NO2- levels of 36 μM have been reported in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with interstitial pneumonia (19Torre D. Ferrario G. Speranza F. Orani A. Fiori G.P. Zeroli C. J. Clin. Pathol. (Lond.). 1996; 49: 574-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), dramatically higher than normal serum NO2- levels. Moreover, increased NO2- levels have been detected in condensed exhalates from patients with asthma compared with those of healthy subjects (20Hunt J. Byrns R.E. Ignarro L.J. Gaston B. Lancet. 1995; 346: 1235-1236Abstract PubMed Google Scholar), which is in accordance with increases in expired NO· by asthmatics compared with healthy control subjects (21Kharitonov S.A. Chung K.F. Evans D. O'Connor B.J. Barnes P.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 153: 1773-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Although NO2- is a major end product of NO· metabolism, it does not accumulate in vivo but is rapidly oxidized to NO3- (22Parks N.J. Krohn K.A. Mathis C.A. Chasko J.H. Geiger K.R. Gregor M.E. Peek N.F. Science. 1981; 212: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NO2- can be oxidized by HbO2 or oxymyoglobin to form methemoglobin or metmyoglobin and NO3- (23Martin H. Huisman T.H.J. Nature. 1963; 200: 898-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Doyle M.P. Herman J.G. Dykstra R.L. J. Free Radicals Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and catalase has also been demonstrated to contribute to NO2- oxidation (25Heppel L.A. Porterfield V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 178: 549-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cohen G. Martinez M. Hochstein P. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 901-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, NO2- can also be oxidized by inflammatory oxidants such as hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (27Huie R.E. Toxicology. 1994; 89: 193-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Klebanoff S.J. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1993; 14: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and we have recently discovered that oxidation of NO2- by HOCl results in the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates (29Eiserich J.P. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Halliwell B. Van der Vliet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19199-19208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NO2- can also be oxidized by heme peroxidases in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (30Haas P. Lee B. Biochem. J. 1924; 18: 614-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1952; 41: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 32Shibata H. Kono Y. Yamashita S. Sawa Y. Ochiai H. Tanaka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 45-50Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that reactive nitrogen intermediates are produced during such processes (32Shibata H. Kono Y. Yamashita S. Sawa Y. Ochiai H. Tanaka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 45-50Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Oxidation of NO2- by such mechanisms could be of importance at loci of inflammatory immune processes, when NO· and NO2- levels are enhanced and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and/or eosinophil peroxidase are secreted from activated granulocytes. The purpose of the present study was to investigate NO2- oxidation by heme peroxidases and to assess its potential physiological importance. The results indicate that MPO and other peroxidases can catalyze oxidation of NO2-, to most likely form NO2· as an intermediate product. At physiological or pathological levels, NO2- can act as a substrate for MPO and lactoperoxidase (LPO), even in the presence of chloride (Cl-) and thiocyanate (SCN-), the proposed major physiological substrates for these peroxidases. Hence, formation of reactive nitrogen intermediates via peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of NO2- could represent an important contributing mechanism to NO·-mediated toxicity. Sodium nitrite (NaNO2), DL-tyrosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPA), 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetic acid (3-NO2-HPA), 4-hydroxy-3-chlorophenylacetic acid (3-Cl-HPA), 4-methoxybenzoic acid, 4-methoxy-3-nitrobenzoic acid, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), monochlorodimedon, hydrogen peroxide (30%), bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid-free), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), D-glucose, glucose oxidase (type V-S), catalase (from bovine liver; 25,000 units/mg protein), horseradish peroxidase, and lactoperoxidase (from bovine milk; 120 units/mg protein) were purchased from Sigma. Myeloperoxidase (from human leukocytes; 250-300 units/mg protein) was obtained from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). All peroxidases were used without further purification. 3,3′-Dityrosine and 3,3′-bis(4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (3, 3′-diHPA) were synthesized by reaction of DL-tyrosine or HPA with horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (33Amado R. Aeschbach R. Neukom H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Initial studies were performed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). DL-Tyrosine (1 mM) was dissolved in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 μM DTPA, 1 μM HRP, and various concentrations of NaNO2. DTPA was included in the reaction mixture to avoid interfering reactions with contaminating free metal ions. Reactions were initiated by addition of 1 mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and allowed to proceed at 37°C for various periods of time. Reactions were terminated at various time points by addition of 10 nM catalase, and tyrosine oxidation products were analyzed by HPLC. Similar experiments were performed in which H2O2 was generated in situ, using D-glucose and glucose oxidase, instead of adding reagent H2O2. Hereto, 10-50 milliunits of glucose oxidase was added to a solution containing 100 μMDL-tyrosine, 1 μM horseradish peroxidase (HRP), 280 μMD-glucose in the absence or presence of NO2- in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 μM DTPA, and reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C. Reactions were terminated by centrifugation (15,000 rpm) on Microcon-3 concentrators (3,000 molecular weight cutoff) (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) to remove proteins. Tyrosine and its oxidation products in the filtrates were analyzed by HPLC using a 5-μm Spherisorb ODS-2 RP-18 column and 93% 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 3.0), 7% methanol as mobile phase at 1 ml/min, and UV detection at 274 nm and fluorescence detection (excitation, 284 nm and emission, 410 nm). Identification and quantitation of tyrosine oxidation products were performed using external standards and by spectral matching using photodiode array detection (34Van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Similar experiments were performed using the mammalian peroxidases myeloperoxidase (MPO) or lactoperoxidase (LPO), in the absence or presence of various concentrations of chloride (Cl-) and/or thiocyanate (SCN-). In these experiments, HPA (1 mM) was used as a substrate instead of tyrosine, to avoid interfering reactions of intermediate oxidants with the amino group in tyrosine. Incubations were terminated by filtration to remove proteins, and the filtrates were analyzed by HPLC. HPA and its oxidation products were separated on a 5-μm Spherisorb ODS-2 RP-18 column using 65% 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 3.0), 35% methanol as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and analyzed by UV (274 nm) or fluorescence (excitation, 284 nm and emission, 410 nm) detection. To study the potential formation of hydroxylating species during peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of NO2-, phenylalanine (5 mM in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)) was used as a trap for aromatic hydroxylation and incubated for 60 min with 10 nM MPO, 700 μM glucose, and 25 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase (resulting in H2O2 production at 10 μM/min) in the absence or presence of 1 mM NO2-. After filtration to remove proteins, the filtrates were analyzed by HPLC for hydroxylation products, using a Spherisorb ODS-2 RP-18 column, 0.1% sodium chloride in 1% (v/v) acetonitrile in water adjusted to pH 3.0 with acetic acid as mobile phase at 1 ml/min, and fluorescence detection (excitation, 275 nm and emission, 305 nm) (35Hoskins J.A. Davis L.J. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 426: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Using this procedure, the detection limit for p-, m-, and o-tyrosine was approximately 20 nM. Bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was incubated with 10 nM MPO, 10 nM LPO, or 1 μM HRP in the presence of D-glucose/glucose oxidase and varying concentrations of NO2-. After incubation, 100-μl aliquots were mixed with 20 μl of sample loading buffer (20% glycerol, 10%β-mercaptoethanol, 6% SDS in 125 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)), heated (5 min, 95°C), and loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Sigma) and immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against 3-nitrotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The antibody was detected using an anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (Sigma) and stained using H2O2 and diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). 5-Thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) was prepared by reduction of 1 mM DTNB in 100 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 4 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (36Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). MPO or LPO (10 nM) was added to 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 40 μM TNB in the absence or presence of various concentrations of NO2-, Cl-, or SCN-. Reactions were initiated by addition of 30 μM H2O2 and allowed to proceed at 20°C. Oxidation of TNB to DTNB was followed spectrophotometrically at 412 nm (ϵ412 = 27,200 M-1 cm-1; 36Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Monochlorodimedon (MCD) is a substrate often used to study peroxidase-catalyzed chlorination (37Hager L.P. Morris D.R. Brown F.S. Eberwein H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1769-1777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chlorination of MCD to dichlorodimedon results in a decrease in absorbance at 290 nm. MCD (40 μM) was dissolved in 50 mM phosphate buffer containing 150 mM Cl- and mixed with 100 μM H2O2 in the absence or presence of NO2- (2-100 μM). Reactions were initiated by addition of 10 nM MPO, and the decrease in A290 was followed spectrophotometrically. Reactions were performed at pH ranging from 6.0 to 7.5, at 20°C. Control experiments were performed in the absence of Cl- to study MCD oxidation in the presence of NO2- alone. Production of H2O2 by glucose/glucose oxidase was quantitated by oxidation of Fe(II) and formation of a Fe(III)-thiocyanate complex. Aliquots of 800 μl of the reaction mixture were mixed with 100 μl of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and proteins were precipitated by addition of 100 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid, after which 800 μl of the supernatants were mixed with 200 μl of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and 100 μl of 2.5 mM KSCN. Formation of the Fe(III)-thiocyanate complex was measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm within 10 min. Linear standard curves were obtained with 1-50 μM H2O2 solutions treated in a similar manner. MPO activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 470 nm, using guaiacol oxidation (38Klebanoff S.J. Waltersdorph A.M. Rosen H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). One unit of MPO activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that utilizes 1.0 μmol of H2O2/min in the oxidation of guaiacol at 25°C and pH 7.0. NO2- was determined spectrophotometrically at 543 nm, using Griess reagent (1% sulfanylamide, 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine, and 2.5% H3PO4) (28Klebanoff S.J. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1993; 14: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the presence of H2O2, peroxidases such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) are known to catalyze oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine to form tyrosyl radicals, as indicated by the production of the dimerization product 3,3′-dityrosine (34Van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In the presence of NO2-, 3-nitrotyrosine is formed as an additional product, suggesting that HRP/H2O2 can oxidize both tyrosine and NO2- (32Shibata H. Kono Y. Yamashita S. Sawa Y. Ochiai H. Tanaka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 45-50Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The identity of 3-nitrotyrosine was confirmed by photodiode array detection and spectral matching compared with authentic 3-nitrotyrosine. Although dityrosine levels reached a maximum after 15-30 min incubation of 1 mM tyrosine with 1 μM HRP, 1 mM H2O2 and varying concentrations of NO2-, formation of 3-nitrotyrosine was found to increase linearly over time during the incubation (Fig. 1A), the rate of tyrosine nitration being proportional to the concentration of NO2- (Fig. 1B). No detectable tyrosine oxidation or nitration was observed in the absence of HRP or H2O2. Qualitatively similar results were obtained using D-glucose/glucose oxidase to continuously generate H2O2 in situ Tyrosine (100 μM), incubated with 1 μM HRP, 280 μMD-glucose, and 10 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase (generating H2O2 at 1.0 μM/min), was oxidized at a rate comparable with the rate of H2O2 production (Fig. 2). Dityrosine accumulated and eventually it became a substrate for HRP/H2O2 and was oxidized further to trityrosine or other polymeric products (39Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. J. Biol.

In the presence of NO2-, the yield of dityrosine was decreased, and 3-nitrotyrosine was found to accumulate during the incubation (Fig. 2), suggesting that NO2- competes with tyrosine for oxidation by HRP/H2O2.Fig. 2Time-dependent tyrosine oxidation by HRP/H2O2 and NO2-. Tyrosine (100 μM in 50 mM phosphate buffer containing 100 μM DTPA (pH 7.4)) was incubated in the presence of 1 μM HRP, 280 μMD-glucose, and 10 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase (generating 1.0 μM/min H2O2) in the absence (A) or presence (B) of 1 mM NO2-. At various time points aliquots were taken, filtered on Microcon-3 filters, and the supernatants analyzed by HPLC for tyrosine (▪), dityrosine (⧫), or 3-nitrotyrosine (•). Data are represented as mean values from two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mammalian peroxidases myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoperoxidase (LPO) are also able to oxidize tyrosine in the presence of H2O2, to form dityrosine, and are reported to do so more efficiently than HRP (39Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30434-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the presence of NO2-, these peroxidases also generate 3-nitrotyrosine as an additional product. Using 1 mM tyrosine, 100 μM NO2-, and 4.0 μM/min H2O2, the yield of both oxidation products increased with the concentration of MPO or LPO and was maximal at enzyme concentrations between 10 and 20 nM. At higher enzyme concentrations the yield of dityrosine did not increase further, and production of 3-nitrotyrosine was found to decrease (not shown). For this reason, further studies were performed using 10 nM of MPO or LPO. Both tyrosine oxidation products accumulated rapidly during the first 30 min, and the rate of product formation declined dramatically thereafter, possibly because of enzyme inactivation or due to depletion of dissolved molecular oxygen necessary for H2O2 generation. Hence, in further experiments using glucose/glucose oxidase, reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min. As demonstrated in Table I, the extent of tyrosine nitration by MPO or LPO was dependent on the initial NO2- concentration, although the production of dityrosine was not dramatically affected. The yield of both products was markedly lower when LPO was used instead of MPO, consistent with the notion that MPO more efficiently catalyzes oxidation of tyrosine (39Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30434-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and perhaps NO2-. However, the results indicate that both peroxidases are capable of oxidizing NO2- in the presence of H2O2 to form a reactive intermediate that is capable of nitrating tyrosine.Table ITyrosine oxidation by MPO and LPO in the presence of NO2-NO2-MyeloperoxidaseLactoperoxidaseDiTyrNO2-TyrDiTyrNO2-TyrmMμMμMμMμM033.2 ± 1.715.7 ± 3.20.0133.0 ± 1.20.27 ± 0.0712.9 ± 1.30.09 ± 0.010.130.7 ± 1.62.21 ± 0.3920.0 ± 1.40.63 ± 0.111.034.0 ± 1.88.60 ± 0.1914.8 ± 1.61.34 ± 0.15 Open table in a new tab In the presence of NO2-, MPO/H2O2 was also found capable of nitrating tyrosine residues in proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, reaction of 10 nM MPO with 1 mg/ml albumin in the presence of 0.5 or 1.0 mM NO2- and 10 μM/min H2O2 resulted in nitration of tyrosine residues, as detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against 3-nitrotyrosine. Protein nitration was also observed when LPO or HRP were used instead of MPO (not shown). Peroxidases commonly oxidize aromatic substrates by a one-electron oxidation mechanism, although oxidation of halides by mammalian peroxidases has been generally thought to occur via two-electron oxidation (39Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30434-30440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 40Jacob J.S. Cistola D.P. Hsu F.F. Muzaffar S. Mueller D.M. Hazen S.L.

Peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of NO2- therefore results in formation of either NO2· or an NO2+-like intermediate. Oxidation of NO2- by MPO/H2O2 did not result in aromatic hydroxylation of the amino acid phenylalanine, indicating that a hydroxylating species such as ONOOH (43Van der Vliet A. O'Neill C.A. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. Kaur H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) is not formed during MPO-catalyzed NO2- oxidation. Addition of 1 mM NO2+ (as the nitryl salt NO2BF4) to a solution of 1 mM tyrosine at pH 7.4 resulted in formation of 2 ± 1 μM 3-nitrotyrosine (mean ± S.D.; n = 3), which is markedly less than the extent of nitration by MPO/H2O2 in the presence of 1 mM NO2- (Table I). Although NO2+ is capable of nitrating aromatic rings by electrophilic aromatic substitution, up to 2 mM NO2BF4 did not induce detectable nitration of the aromatic substrate 4-methoxybenzoic acid (a substrate incapable of forming phenolic radicals) in aqueous solution, possibly because of rapid hydrolysis of NO2+. Hence, it is unlikely that phenolic nitration via peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of NO2- is due to formation of NO2+. The presumed major physiological substrate for MPO is chloride (Cl-), although other anions such as bromide (Br-) or thiocyanate (SCN-) are sufficiently abundant in biological fluids to act as alternative physiological substrates (44Thomas E.L. Fishman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9694-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Thomas E.L. Bozeman P.M. Jefferson M.M. King C.C. J. Biol.

Similarly, SCN- and Br- have been proposed as a physiological substrates for eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) or LPO (46Weiss S.J. Test S.T. Eckmann C.M. Roos D. Regiani S.

https://openalex.org/W2117509237,"To provide information about dynamic sensory stimuli, the pattern of action potentials in spiking neurons must be variable. To ensure reliability these variations must be related, reproducibly, to the stimulus. For H1, a motion-sensitive neuron in the fly's visual system, constant-velocity motion produces irregular spike firing patterns, and spike counts typically have a variance comparable to the mean, for cells in the mammalian cortex. But more natural, time-dependent input signals yield patterns of spikes that are much more reproducible, both in terms of timing and of counting precision. Variability and reproducibility are quantified with ideas from information theory, and measured spike sequences in H1 carry more than twice the amount of information they would if they followed the variance-mean relation seen with constant inputs. Thus, models that may accurately account for the neural response to static stimuli can significantly underestimate the reliability of signal transfer under more natural conditions."

Tunneling spectra obtained near magnetic adsorbates reveal the presence of excitations within the superconductor's energy gap that can be detected over a few atomic diameters around the impurity at the surface. These excitations are locally asymmetric with respect to tunneling of electrons and holes. A model calculation based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations can be used to understand the details of the local tunneling spectra.

The Afc1 protein is a zinc protease that participates in the processing of yeast a-factor mating pheromone. The Rce1 protein contributes to the processing of both Ras protein and a-factor. Deletion of both AFC1 and RCE1 resulted in the loss of proteolytic processing of prenylated proteins.

The kinetics of activation were not affected by removal of the hemopexin-like C-terminal domain. The specific activities of both collagenase-3 and Δ249-451 collagenase-3 were found to be similar using two quenched fluorescent substrates, but Δ249-451 collagenase-3 failed to cleave native triple helical collagens (types I and II) into characteristic one- and three-quarter fragments. It was noted, however, that the β1,2(I) chains of type I collagen were susceptible to Δ249-451 collagenase-3, which indicates that the catalytic domain displays telopeptidase activity, thereby generating α1,2(I) chains that are slightly shorter than those in native type I collagen. It can be concluded that the C-terminal domain is only essential for the triple helicase activity of collagenase-3. Binding of procollagenase-3 and active collagenase-3 to type I collagen is mediated by the C-terminal domain. Both collagenase-3 and Δ249-451 collagenase-3 hydrolyzed the large tenascin C isoform, fibronectin, recombinant fibronectin fragments, and type IV, IX, X, and XIV collagens; thus, these events were independent from C-terminal domain interactions. In contrast, the minor cartilage type XI collagen was resistant to cleavage. Kinetic analysis of the mechanism of inhibition of wild-type and Δ249-451 collagenase-3 by wild-type and mutant tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs) revealed that the association rates for complex formation were influenced by both N- and C-terminal domain interactions. The C-terminal domain of wild-type collagenase-3 promoted increased association rates with the full-length inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 and the hybrid N.TIMP-2/C.TIMP-1 by a factor of up to 33.

https://openalex.org/W2082080415,Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) catalyzes the carboxyl-terminal lipidation of Ras and several other cellular signal transduction proteins. The essential nature of this modification for proper function of these proteins has led to the emergence of FTase as a target for the development of new anticancer therapy. Inhibition of this enzyme suppresses the transformed phenotype in cultured cells and causes tumor regression in animal models. The crystal structure of heterodimeric mammalian FTase was determined at 2.25 angstrom resolution. The structure shows a combination of two unusual domains: a crescent-shaped seven-helical hairpin domain and an α-α barrel domain. The active site is formed by two clefts that intersect at a bound zinc ion. One cleft contains a nine-residue peptide that may mimic the binding of the Ras substrate; the other cleft is lined with highly conserved aromatic residues appropriate for binding the farnesyl isoprenoid with required specificity.

In the budding yeast, PKC1 functions to activate the SLT2(MPK1) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, which is required for the maintenance of cell integrity during asymmetric cell growth. Genetic studies, coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and analysis of protein phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro indicate that the SBF transcription factor (composed of Swi4p and Swi6p), an important regulator of gene expression at the G 1 to S phase cell cycle transition, is a target of the Slt2p(Mpk1p) MAP kinase.

Nature. 1982; 295: 154-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In permeabilized cells CaM stimulates triggering of regulated exocytosis (6Okabe T. Sugimoto N. Matsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7Chamberlain L.H. Roth D. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Moreover, recently it has been shown that injection of CaM into adrenal chromaffin cells (by patch-clamp) increases exocytosis (8Kibble A.V. Burgoyne R.D. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 464-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although CaM has long been associated with calcium-regulated exocytosis, its precise site of action has not yet been identified. There have been few reports of the involvement of CaM in regulating membrane trafficking events along the endocytic pathway, in some cases, with controversial results. CaM has been implicated in phagocytosis (9Horwitz S.B. Chia G.H. Harracksingh C. Orlow S. Pifko-Hirst Schneck J. Sorbara L. Speaker M. Wilk E.W. Rosen O.M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), receptor recycling, and transcytosis (10Grasso J.A. Bruno M. Yates A.A. Wei L. Epstein P.M. Biochem.

Thus, CaM may play a general role in regulating membrane traffic. However, the putative direct or indirect targets of CaM and the mechanism by which CaM regulates specific transport events are largely unknown. To examine the role of calmodulin in endocytic transport we have studied the effect of CaM inhibitors in intact cells. We found that colocalization of sequentially internalized endocytic markers is inhibited by CaM antagonists, suggesting that fusion among endosomes might be regulated by CaM. To conclusively establish a role for CaM in endosome fusion, we studied the effect of CaM antagonists in an in vitro assay that reconstitutes fusion among endosomes. In this report we present evidence that a CaM activity regulates endosome fusion, suggesting that CaM plays a more general role in vesicular traffic than previously thought. J774 E-clone (mannose receptor-positive), a macrophage cell line, was grown to confluence in minimum essential medium containing Earle's salts and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HDP-1, a mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for dinitrophenol (DNP), was isolated as described previously (14Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Colombo M.I. Lenhard J.M. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). β-Glucuronidase was isolated from rat preputial glands and derivatized with DNP using dinitrofluorobenzene (14Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosol from the J774 cells was the high-speed supernatant of a cell homogenate obtained as described (14Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at −80°C. Cytosol samples (200 μl) were gel-filtered through 1-ml Sephadex G-25 spin columns just before use in the fusion assay. Protein concentration after filtration was 3-5 mg/ml. KN-93 and the calmodulin kinase II peptide 281-291 (calmodulin kinase II substrate) were obtained from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Early endosomes were loaded with either aggregated anti-DNP IgG or DNP-β-glucuronidase by a 5-min uptake at 37°C as described previously (14Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Colombo M.I. Lenhard J.M. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After ligand uptake, the macrophages (1 × 108 cells) were washed sequentially with 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and with 250 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.0; homogenization buffer) and homogenized in the latter buffer (2 ml) using a cell homogenizer (15Colombo M.I. Lenhard J.M. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min to eliminate nuclei and intact cells. Postnuclear supernatants were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Postnuclear fractions were quickly thawed, diluted with homogenization buffer, and then pelleted for 1 min at 37,000 × g in a Beckman L 100 centrifuge. The supernatants were centrifuged for an additional 5 min at 50,000 × g The pellets of this second centrifugation were enriched with 5-min endosomes. Endosomal fractions containing each probe were mixed with fusion buffer [250 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EGTA, 20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM ATP, 8 mM creatine phosphate, 31 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 0.25 mg/ml DNP-bovine serum albumin] supplemented with gel-filtered cytosol. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 45 min, and the reaction was stopped by cooling on ice. To measure the immune complexes formed, the vesicles were solubilized by adding 50 μl of solubilization buffer [1% Triton X-100, 0.2% methylbenzethonium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.15 M NaCl, and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)] containing 50 μg/ml DNP-bovine serum albumin. For immunoprecipitation the samples were transferred to multiwell plates coated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG. After 30-45 min of incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed three times with 300 μl of solubilization buffer, and β-glucuronidase activity was measured using 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucuronide as substrate in a Microplate fluorometer 7600 (Cambridge Technology, Inc; 15Colombo M.I. Lenhard J.M. Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fusion was expressed in arbitrary fluorescence units. In a standard assay, DNP-β-glucuronidase was bound to J774 macrophages suspended at 4°C for 30 min in uptake media (16Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Koval M. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 223-232PubMed Google Scholar, 17Colombo M.I. Lenhard J. Mayorga L. Beron W. Hall H. Stahl P.D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at 37°C for 3 min to allow ligand internalization and then washed twice with PBS-EDTA (5 mM) containing 50 mM mannose to remove ligand bound to cell surface mannose receptors. Internalized DNP-β-glucuronidase was chased along the endocytic pathway by a 10-min incubation at 37°C. During this incubation 1 mg/ml mannan was added to avoid the reinternalization of DNP-β-glucuronidase recycled to the extracellular media. After cooling to 4°C, cells were washed twice with PBS-EDTA-mannose and once with uptake media (Hanks' balanced saline and 10% bovine serum albumin). The cells were allowed to bind rabbit anti-mouse IgG/anti-DNP complexes (aggregated anti-DNP IgG) to cell surface Fc receptors at 4°C for 30 min. After an incubation at 17°C for 5 min (at this temperature ligand is internalized, but fusion is blocked), cells were incubated at 37°C for different periods of time in the presence or the absence of the calmodulin antagonists. The cells were then transferred to 4°C and resuspended in solubilization buffer to measure the immunocomplexes formed as described (see above). CaM is a highly conserved intracellular protein expressed in all cell types. CaM acts by interacting with its target proteins through two hydrophobic patches that are exposed after the binding of Ca2+. These regions were shown to be involved in the binding of CaM to protein receptor molecules. Naphtalenesulfonamide derivatives such as W7, W12, and W13 are CaM antagonists that bind to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (18Hidaka H. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that CaM is required for transcytosis and recycling of endocytosed transferrin receptors (12Apodaca G. Enrich C. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19005-19013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29003-29009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and low density lipoprotein receptors (19Wang L.-H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 132: 1107-1117Crossref Scopus (923) Google Scholar). To assess whether CaM is involved in other steps in the endocytic pathway we studied the colocalization of endocytic markers in vivo This approach takes advantage of the observation that sequentially internalized ligands, when appropriately timed, catch up to each other within the endosomal pathway. Catch-up is a reflection of the competency of the pathway and the fusion events that govern it (16Diaz R. Colombo M.I. Koval M. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 223-232PubMed Google Scholar, 17Colombo M.I. Lenhard J. Mayorga L. Beron W. Hall H. Stahl P.D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with DNP-β-glucuronidase as the first ligand for 3 min at 37°C, washed, and then further incubated at 37°C for 10 min (chase). The second ligand, aggregated anti-DNP IgG, was bound to the cell surface at 4°C for 30 min and then internalized by incubating the cells for 5 min at 17°C. At this temperature ligand is endocytosed, but fusion is blocked. Cells were then washed and incubated at 37°C in the presence of the potent calmodulin antagonist N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphtalenesulfonamide (W13) for additional periods of time. As a control, we used W12 (N-4-aminobutyl-naphtalenesulfonamide), a compound that is structurally related to W13 but significantly less potent at inhibiting calmodulin activity. Therefore, W12 was used to distinguish calmodulin-specific inhibitory effects from nonspecific drug effects (12Apodaca G. Enrich C. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19005-19013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chafouleas J.G. Bolton W.E. Hidaka H. Boyd III, A.E. Means A.R. Cell. 1982; 28: 41-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). After solubilization, the amount of immune complex formed as a result of delivery of both ligands to the same intracellular compartment was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” In control cells (Fig. 1A), there was a time-dependent increase in immune complex formation (open squares), indicating catch-up. W13 substantially reduced the amount of immune complex formed (closed circles); essentially no effect was observed with W12 (open circles), indicating the specificity of the W13 effect. Similar inhibitory effects were observed with other calmodulin antagonists such as calmidazolium (compound R24571) and chlorpromazine (data not shown). Cell viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, was not affected by any of the drugs at the concentrations tested (data not shown). The results clearly indicate that the CaM antagonists reduce the efficiency of mixing of endocytic compartments and suggest that CaM may be altering multiple steps in this pathway. Perhaps one of these steps is fusion among endocytic vesicles. To study the possibility that W13 affects endosome fusion we have used an in vitro assay that reconstitutes fusion among endosomes (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of increasing concentrations of W13 completely blocked endosomal fusion (closed circles). Similar to the results obtained in vivo, little effect was observed with W12 at the concentrations indicated (open circles). However, at higher concentrations W12 completely inhibited endosome fusion (data not shown). This is in agreement with the reduced potency of this analog. Similar inhibitory effects were observed with other calmodulin inhibitors such as chlorpromazine and calmidazolium (data not shown). As mentioned above, naphtalenesulfonamide derivatives such as W12 and W13 bind to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner through hydrophobic interactions. These compounds block the stimulation of calmodulin-dependent enzymes in a competitive fashion with CaM (18Hidaka H. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to examine whether the addition of purified CaM would reverse the inhibition caused by the CaM antagonists. Fig. 3 shows that CaM can reverse the inhibitory effect of the CaM antagonist W13. Similar results were obtained when other CaM inhibitors were used (data not shown). These results confirm that the process is CaM-specific and rule out the possibility that the inhibition seen represents CaM antagonist interaction with other proteins. Interestingly, we found that the addition of Ca2+ (500 nM free Ca2+) stimulates endosome fusion, even in the absence of cytosol (Fig. 4). This stimulatory effect was inhibited by adding the CaM antagonist W13, implicating CaM in the Ca2+-stimulated fusion observed in the absence of cytosol. However, it is possible that other Ca2+-binding proteins may be involved in the process because fusion was not completely abrogated by W13. The further addition of CaM to the assay stimulated fusion beyond that produced by Ca2+ alone (Fig. 5A), but CaM at higher concentrations seems inhibitory, indicating that a strict ratio among factors is critical for endosome fusion. This stimulatory effect was inhibited by W13 (data not shown). Fig. 5B shows the stimulation of endosome fusion by CaM at different cytosol concentrations. It is interesting to note that the stimulatory effect of CaM is mainly observed at limiting cytosol concentrations.Fig. 5CaM regulates in vitro endosome fusion. A, endosomes containing fusion probes were mixed in fusion buffer containing 500 nM free Ca2+. Increasing concentrations of purified bovine brain CaM were added to the fusion mixture. B, endosomes were mixed in fusion buffer containing increasing concentrations of cytosol in the presence (•) or absence (○; control) of 0.8 μM CaM. The samples were incubated for 45 min at 37°C to allow fusion to occur. Fusion was assessed as described in Fig. 2. Values are expressed in relative fluorescence units. Data represent one of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The hydrophobic domains that are exposed after the binding of Ca2+ were shown to be involved in the binding of CaM to protein receptor molecules. CaM modulates the function of the target proteins by exposing sites that either are substrates for catalytic modifications or result in displacement of autoinhibitory domains from catalytic sites (21Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This mechanism allows the activation of enzymes such as CaM kinase II, a ubiquitous and multifunctional enzyme that phosphorylates numerous proteins. To study the possibility that CaM kinase II might be involved in fusion among endosomes, we have tested the effect of peptides known to interfere with the mechanism of CaM action. Fig. 6A shows the inhibitory effect of a peptide corresponding to the CaM-binding domain of CaM-dependent kinase II (290-309), a peptide expected to sequester CaM and render it incapable of interacting not only with CaM kinase II but also with other proteins. Therefore, this peptide is considered a strong CaM antagonist. We also tested another peptide from calmodulin-dependent kinase II corresponding to amino acids 281-291. This peptide antagonizes the kinase activity of CaM kinase II by acting as a pseudosubstrate but has very weak anti-CaM activity and consequently does not block the interaction between CaM and other proteins. The inhibitory effect obtained with both peptides suggests that, in our endosome fusion assay, one of the molecules regulated by CaM is CaM-dependent kinase II. Although caution must be exercised when using peptides, we have found that a variety of other peptides have no effect on the in vitro fusion assay (data not shown). Moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility that other kinases or other proteins may also be modulated by CaM. We next tested a nonpeptide inhibitor, KN-93, which is a specific inhibitor of CaM-dependent kinase II (22Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar). Because this inhibitor is insoluble in water but soluble in Me2SO, we carried out a control experiment by the addition of Me2SO alone. As shown in Fig. 6B, the Ca2+-mediated stimulation of endosome fusion was to some extent inhibited by KN-93, indicating that CaM kinase II activity is likely to be involved in regulating in vitro endosome fusion. Ca2+ is an important player in exocytosis of both secretory granules and synaptic vesicles, a process that involves the fusion of these vesicles with the plasma membrane. The role of Ca2+ in this special transport event has been extensively studied in intact and permeabilized cell preparations (for a review, see 23Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar and 24Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 893-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is also involved in other transport events such as the transfer of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi (25Beckers C. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 26Baker D. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. Botstein D. Segev N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the fusion of nuclear membrane vesicles after mitosis (28Sullivan K.M. Buss W.B. Wilson K.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1411-1422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the fusion of transcytotic vesicles (29Barroso M.R. Bernd K.K. De Witt N.D. Chang A. Mills K. Sztul E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10183-10187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that recycling from the endocytic compartment to the plasma membrane can be up-regulated by elevating the Ca2+ concentration (30Morimoto T. Popov S. Buckley K.M. Poo M.-M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 689-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that Ca2+ may be required for intracellular transport as it is required for neurotransmitter release at the nerve terminals. It is well documented that Ca2+ exerts its effect through one or more Ca2+-binding proteins that undergo a conformational change upon interaction with the ion. Annexins, a family of Ca2+-binding proteins, have been reported to mediate membrane-membrane interactions leading to secretory vesicle fusion (31Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). It has been shown that annexin II is a major component of fusogenic endosomal vesicles (32Emans N. Gorvel J.-P. Walter C. Gerke V. Kellner R. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for annexins in intracellular transport. In fact, we have previously shown that annexin II participates in endosome fusion (33Mayorga L.S. Beron W. Sarrouf M.N. Colombo M.I. Creutz C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30927-30934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In polarized cells, a role for annexin XIII in transport to the apical membrane has been proposed (34Fiedler K. Lafont F. Parton R.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In a very recent report, a novel Ca2+-binding protein, p22, has been implicated in the fusion of transcytotic vesicles (29Barroso M.R. Bernd K.K. De Witt N.D. Chang A. Mills K. Sztul E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10183-10187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the role of Ca2+ in vesicular transport is a complex matter involving multiple Ca2+-binding proteins. Evidence for a role of the Ca2+-binding protein CaM in various intracellular transport events has been presented. CaM inhibitors were found to have marked effects on phagocytosis, transcytosis, receptor recycling, and lysosomal transport (9Horwitz S.B. Chia G.H. Harracksingh C. Orlow S. Pifko-Hirst Schneck J. Sorbara L. Speaker M. Wilk E.W. Rosen O.M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Grasso J.A. Bruno M. Yates A.A. Wei L. Epstein P.M. Biochem.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29003-29009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that CaM is essential for assembling the links necessary for exocytotic membrane fusion in Paramecium (35Kerboeuf D. Le Berre A. Dedieu J.-C. Cohen J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3385-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CaM antagonists are potent inhibitors of endosome tubulation (36Kübler E. Schimmöller F. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5539-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a process that may be involved in the recycling of receptors back to the plasma membrane. In addition, it has been shown that CaM is required for both endocytosis in yeast (37de Figueiredo P. Brown W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 871-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and rapid endocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells (38Artalejo C.R. Elhamdani A. Palfrey H.C. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the specific events regulated by CaM are largely unknown. In this report we present evidence that CaM regulates endosome fusion both in vivo and in vitro We found that several CaM antagonists inhibit fusion among endosomes, an inhibitory effect that was reversed by purified bovine brain CaM. Furthermore, we observed that Ca2+ stimulates in vitro endosome fusion and that the further addition of CaM stimulates fusion above that produced by Ca2+ alone, strongly implicating CaM in the regulation of endocytic transport. These observations are in agreement with recent findings that CaM enhances the fusion of isolated parotid secretion granules with plasma membrane vesicles (39Cooperstein S.J. Watkins D.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our data are also consistent with the stimulatory role for CaM in triggering exocytosis (6Okabe T. Sugimoto N. Matsuda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7Chamberlain L.H. Roth D. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J.

Kelly P.T. Neuron. 1995; 15: 443-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), suggesting that CaM is a common regulatory molecule governing multiple fusion events. CaM might act directly in membrane trafficking or act indirectly by modulating an essential component of the vesicular transport machinery. The putative downstream effectors for CaM in endosome fusion remain to be identified. However, several CaM-binding proteins have been identified on endosomes (41Enrich C. Bachs O. Evans W.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). EEA1 is an early endosome-associated protein that has a calmodulin-binding domain (42Mu F.-T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.-P. Tock E.P.C. Toh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Although the function of EEA1 remains to be determined, a role in membrane trafficking has been proposed (42Mu F.-T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.-P. Tock E.P.C. Toh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The current consensus in the field of intracellular trafficking is that cells use essentially the same or similar machinery in both intracellular transport and neurotransmitter exocytosis (24Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 893-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 43Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 44Mayorga L.S. Stahl P.D. J. NIH Research. 1995; 7: 57-58Google Scholar). Therefore, other putative effectors for CaM arise from the role of this protein in neurotransmitter release. Phosphorylation of synapsin, a synaptic vesicle protein, by CaM-dependent protein kinase II promotes dissociation of synapsin from vesicles, facilitating synaptic vesicle fusion (45Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 46Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Rubenstein J.L. Gorelick F.S. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Perhaps a similar mechanism is involved in endosome fusion. Indeed, our results suggest that a CaM-dependent kinase activity seems to be involved in endosome fusion. Our assay was sensitive to KN-93, a CaM kinase II antagonist (22Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar), and to a peptide from CaM kinase II amino acids 281-291 that antagonizes the kinase activity by acting as a pseudosubstrate (47Smith M.K.

Moreover, we have found that CaM is one of the Ca2+-binding proteins that regulates the association of factors involved in vesicular transport. 2M. I. Colombo, W. Beron, and P. D.

Further understanding of the role of CaM and other Ca2+-binding proteins in membrane fusion events awaits the identification of key interacting molecules and the specific steps in which these proteins are involved. Further investigation is needed to determine the mechanism by which CaM regulates endosome fusion and other fusion events. However, the results presented in this manuscript suggest a more general role for CaM in vesicular traffic than previously thought. We thank Drs. Carmen Alvarez, Chun Zhi Yang, and Mary K.

We have developed an <i>in vitro</i> model system that consists of purified human excision repair factors and a DNA substrate analogous to a transcription bubble terminating at a cyclobutane thymine dimer. In this system the thymine dimer was excised independent of XPC. Furthermore, the thymine dimer in the bubble-containing substrate was removed approximately 3-fold faster by the excision repair nuclease reconstituted with or without XPC, compared with the removal of thymine dimer from a base paired duplex by the entire set of excision nuclease factors.

The sites necessary for Ca2+ inhibition are not present within the I domain or the adjacent region containing the three EF hand sites. INTRODUCTIONThe integrins are heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules that mediate cell-cell adhesion and adhesion between cells and the extracellular matrix. They are widely expressed and function throughout development and adulthood in a variety of normal and pathologic processes (for review, see 1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). The α2β1 integrin is expressed on several different cell types, including endothelial and epithelial cells, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and platelets (2Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The ligand specificity of α2β1 varies with cell type. While it serves as a collagen receptor on platelets and fibroblasts, it can serve as both a collagen and as a laminin receptor on endothelial and epithelial cells (3Elices M.J. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9906-9910Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 4Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).Cell adhesion to collagen mediated by the α2β1 integrin is dependent upon the presence of divalent cations (5Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Mg2+, for example, supported the adhesion. Ca2+ could not substitute for Mg2+ and inhibited the Mg2+-dependent adhesion. The adhesion of liposomes containing purified α2β1 integrin to collagen was also found to depend on the presence of Mg2+ and to be inhibited by Ca2+ (6Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The inhibition of Mg2+-dependent adhesion to collagen of liposomes containing the α2β1 integrin occurred via a simple linear noncompetitive mechanism suggesting that Mg2+ and Ca2+ exert their effects by binding to distinct sites on the α2β1 integrin. Further evidence that Mg2+ and Ca2+ bind to distinct sites was obtained when limited proteolytic digestion of α2β1 gave different cleavage patterns depending on which divalent cation was present (7Staatz W.D. Peters K.J. Santoro S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Several potential divalent cation binding sites present in the α2 integrin subunit may mediate the distinct effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+. Within the extracellular domain of α2 are three EF hand motifs. These structures were originally described as Ca2+ binding sites in regulatory proteins (8Szebenyi D.M.E. Obendorf S.K. Moffat K. Nature. 1981; 294: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Watterson D.M. Sharief F. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 962-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but have since been shown to be capable of binding other divalent cations. The α2 subunit is a member of a subset of integrin α subunits that contain an approximately 200 amino acid domain located near the amino terminus often referred to as the I (or inserted) domain. Many I domains, including the αM integrin subunit I domain, contain an additional recently described cation binding site, the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) 1The abbreviations used are: MIDASmetal ion-dependent adhesion siteGSTglutathione S-transferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTBSTris-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. motif (10Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The α2 I domain also appears to contain a MIDAS motif since all five of the amino acids that contribute to divalent cation coordination in the αM MIDAS motif are conserved in the α2 integrin I domain.I domains share homology with the collagen-binding A domains of von Willebrand factor and cartilage matrix proteins suggesting that integrin I domains may be important determinants in ligand binding. The α1 subunit has been shown to be involved with the binding of α1β1 to its ligands, collagen, and laminin (11Kern A. Briesewitz R. Bank I. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22811-22816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the αM I domain is required for the interaction of the αMβ2 integrin with its ligands, ICAM-1, iC3b, and fibrinogen (10Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 12Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The αL I domain also appears to be important in the binding of the integrin αLβ2 with its ligands, ICAM-1, and ICAM-3 (13Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Landis R.C. McDowall A. Holness C.L.L. Littler A.J. Simmons D.L. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similarly, several lines of evidence implicate the involvement of the α2 I domain in ligand binding activity of the α2β1 integrin. First, a polyclonal antiserum directed against a bacterially expressed α2 I domain fusion protein was shown to block the attachment of endothelial cells to gelatin, type I collagen, and laminin (15Bahou W.F. Potter C.L. Mirza H. Blood. 1994; 84: 3734-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a series of human/bovine α2 integrin chimeras was generated and used to map the epitopes recognized by anti-human α2 integrin monoclonal antibodies that were capable of inhibiting the ligand binding activity of the human α2β1 integrin. All of these antibodies mapped to regions within the α2 I domain, revealing the significance of the I domain with regard to collagen recognition (16Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, several mutagenesis studies have demonstrated the importance of amino acids within the α2 integrin I domain for ligand binding (16Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, recombinant α2 integrin I domain expressed in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein has been shown to bind specifically to collagen. However, two reports (17Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have presented conflicting data as to whether the I domain, like the intact integrin, binds collagen in a divalent cation-dependent manner.To elucidate the roles of the various divalent cation binding sites present within the α2 subunit with regard to the metal ion-dependent function of the intact α2β1 integrin, we have expressed a series of α2 integrin I domain-containing proteins with either none, one, two, or all three of the EF hand sites. Our results indicate an essential role for the I domain and a heretofore unrecognized role for the first EF hand motif in divalent cation-dependent collagen binding activity.RESULTSAs an approach to assess the contributions of distinct classes of divalent cation binding sites present within the α2 integrin subunit to the collagen binding activity of the α2β1 integrin, the domains were expressed as recombinant GST fusion proteins containing the α2 integrin I domain alone or in combination with one, two, or all three of the EF hand-like motifs (I, I + 1, I + 12, I + 123). In addition, the I domain was modified by deleting 35 amino acids from its amino terminus in two constructs (ΔI and ΔI + 1). The EF hand motif of I + 1 was modified by incorporating two D→A point mutations to render the EF hand motif incapable of metal binding (I + 1*). The recombinant proteins examined in this investigation are presented schematically in Fig. 1.After purification by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose, the proteins were subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The recombinant proteins were further analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. This analysis confirmed the purity of the proteins in agreement with the SDS-PAGE analysis and revealed the lack of protein aggregation with less than 2.6% of the protein running with an apparent size larger than that predicted for the monomeric species. Quantitative analysis of I domain and I + 1 proteins revealed that 95 and 96%, respectively, of the protein applied to the column eluted in the monomer peaks. Representative profiles for the I, I + 1, ΔI + 1 and I + 1* proteins are shown in Fig. 3. Similar chromatographic profiles were obtained for each of the other proteins used in this study (data not shown).The proteins were then tested for collagen binding activity. To assess the divalent cation specificity, if any, collagen binding assays were conducted in the presence of 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM Ca2+ or 2 mM Mg2+. The ability of Ca2+ to inhibit any Mg2+-dependent collagen binding was assessed by carrying out the binding assay in the presence of 2 mM of both Ca2+ and Mg2+. The results are shown in Fig. 4. GST alone did not bind specifically to collagen under any of the divalent cation conditions. As previously observed with the intact α2β1 integrin, all four of the proteins containing an intact I domain bound collagen in a Mg2+-dependent manner. As also observed with the intact integrin, Ca2+ did not support the collagen binding activity of any of the I domain-containing proteins. However, unlike the intact α2β1 integrin, Mg2+-dependent collagen binding activity of the I domain-containing proteins was not inhibited by Ca2+. Addition of the first EF hand motif onto the I domain appeared to markedly enhance Mg2+-dependent collagen binding activity as revealed by an increased extent of binding. This was most apparent in the I + 1 and I + 12 proteins.The necessity of an intact I domain for the collagen binding activity of the constructs was examined with two fusion proteins containing truncated I domains in which the amino-terminal 35 residues were deleted (ΔI and ΔI + 1). The deleted region contained the DXSXS sequence, a region thought to be critical for the structural integrity of the MIDAS motif (10Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). As expected and as shown in Fig. 5, both the I and I + 1 constructs bound collagen in a Mg2+-dependent manner. However, neither of the truncated constructs (ΔI and ΔI + 1) bound collagen. Thus an intact MIDAS motif is required for Mg2+-dependent collagen binding activity.Fig. 5Binding of I and I + 1 proteins to collagen. I, ΔI, I + 1, ΔI + 1, and I + 1* were tested for binding to collagen in the presence of 1 mM EDTA or 2 mM Mg2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The contribution of the putative metal binding sequences present within the first EF hand motif to the enhanced collagen binding activity of the I + 1 protein relative to the I domain was examined by mutating two aspartate residues essential for metal binding activity of the motif (Asp-272 and Asp-274) to alanines to create the I + 1* protein. Unlike the wild-type EF hand motif, the mutated EF hand conferred no enhanced collagen binding activity upon the I domain (Fig. 5). The collagen binding activity of I + 1* was comparable with that of I domain alone. Thus, sequences within the EF hand motif that confer metal binding properties upon the motif, are essential for the enhancement of collagen binding activity.The enhanced collagen binding activity of the I + 1 construct relative to that of the I domain alone was examined in greater detail and over a range of concentrations (Fig. 6). Both the I and I + 1 proteins bound to collagen in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner. Whereas half-maximal binding of the I domain protein to collagen occurred at 820 nM, the half-maximal binding of the I + 1 construct was observed at 87 nM.Fig. 6Saturable binding of I and I + 1 to collagen. Various concentrations of I and I + 1 were tested for binding to collagen in the presence of 2 mM Mg2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mg2+ concentrations required for half-maximal collagen binding were determined for I domain, I + 1, I + 12, and I + 123 proteins and found to be 0.54, 0.31, 0.61, and 1.17 mM, respectively (Fig. 7). Mn2+ was also shown to support collagen binding of each of these constructs (Fig. 8). Approximately 0.5 mM Mn2+ was required for half-maximal collagen binding.Fig. 7Mg2+-dependence of binding of I domain constructs to collagen.

The results are shown in Fig. 9A All of the proteins were recognized by the anti-GST antiserum to similar extents, indicating that comparable quantities of the proteins were coated onto the microtiter wells. Monoclonal antibodies 6F1 and 12F1 both bound equivalently to the I and I + 1 proteins that contained intact I domains. Neither bound to the ΔI and ΔI + 1 proteins containing truncated I domains. Both of the antibodies also effectively recognized the I + 1*, I + 12, and I + 123 proteins (data not shown). The same patterns of reactivity were observed in the presence of either 2 mM Mg2+ or 2 mM EDTA (data not shown). Thus, the two distinct complex, conformation-dependent epitopes recognized by the 6F1 and 12F1 antibodies (26Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H.

The effects of the 6F1 and 12F1 antibodies on collagen binding activity of the I + 1 protein are shown in Fig. 9BFig. 9Antibody recognition and blocking.

I + 1 (100 nM) was preincubated with either antibody (300 nM) for 1 h and then tested in the collagen binding assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since the I and I + 1 proteins exhibited rather different collagen binding activities, we next examined the binding of the two proteins to laminin, a second ligand for the α2β1 integrin. When examined in either Mg2+ or Mn2+-containing buffers, the I and I + 1 proteins bound laminin to comparable extents (Fig. 10). Unlike binding to collagen, however, binding to laminin was markedly enhanced in the presence of Mn2+. Both I and I + 1 proteins were similarly affected.Fig. 10Binding of I and I + 1 proteins to laminin. Binding of GST, I, and I + 1 proteins to laminin was determined in the presence of 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM Mg2+, or 2 mM Mn2+.

Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is incapable of supporting α2β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to collagen and inhibits the Mg2+-dependent adhesion. Liposomes containing purified α2β1 integrin demonstrated identical metal ion dependence (6Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Recently, the I domains of several integrins have been shown to be important determinants of ligand binding (10Lee J.-O.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Evidence of the involvement of the α2 I domain in collagen recognition includes: (a) an anti-α2 antiserum blocks endothelial cell attachment to collagen (15Bahou W.F. Potter C.L. Mirza H. Blood. 1994; 84: 3734-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (b) several α2β1 integrin function blocking antibodies map to the I domain (16Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (c) purified recombinant α2 I domain binds specifically to collagen (17Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the I domain of the related αM integrin subunit has been solved and found to contain a single novel Mg2+ binding site that involves residues that are widely separated in the primary sequence (10Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). In addition to the Mg2+ binding MIDAS motif within the I domain, the α2 integrin subunit contains three EF hand-like metal binding sites in close proximity to the I domain. In the present study, we have prepared a series of α2 I domain-containing GST fusion proteins with various numbers of EF hand sites for the purpose of establishing the contributions of the divalent cation binding sites present within the I and EF hand domains of the α2 integrin subunit to the metal and ligand binding properties of the integrin.Like the intact integrin, each of the I domain-containing proteins bound collagen in a Mg2+-dependent manner. As also observed with the intact integrin, Ca2+ could not substitute for Mg2+. Unlike the intact integrin, however, Ca2+ did not inhibit the Mg2+-dependent binding to collagen of any of the I domain-containing proteins. These data suggest that the sites responsible for Ca2+ inhibition of Mg2+-dependent collagen binding activity are either not present within the I domain or the region containing the three EF hand structures or that their inhibitory effects are not manifested outside of the context of the intact integrin. The finding that isolated I domain binds collagen in a Mg2+-dependent manner is in agreement with the recent work of Tuckwell, et al. (18Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but contrasts with results from Kamata and Takada (17Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who found that independently expressed I domain bound collagen in a divalent cation-independent manner. The reason for the discrepancy is not apparent but may represent an adverse consequence of the iodination of the recombinant I domain protein. We have previously observed deleterious effects on α2β1 integrin structure and ligand binding activity as a result of iodination (7Staatz W.D. Peters K.J. Santoro S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The results of our binding studies using the ΔI and ΔI + 1 proteins strongly support the conclusion that the MIDAS site present within the I domain is critical for the collagen binding activity of the α2 I domain.A marked enhancement of collagen binding activity was consistently observed upon the addition of the first EF hand motif to the I domain. To determine if the increased binding was contingent upon the divalent cation binding activity of the EF hand, an I + 1 protein with a mutated EF hand was prepared. To ensure complete inactivation the EF hand site in I + 1, aspartates at positions 3 and 5 were mutated to alanines. Mutation of the EF hand site to an inactive form completely abrogated the increase in collagen binding observed for I + 1, reducing its collagen binding activity to that of the I domain. This finding indicates that the enhancement was likely a direct result of Mg2+ binding to the EF hand rather than to divalent cation-independent interactions of other regions of the added sequence.Mg2+ concentrations required for half-maximal binding to collagen of I domain, I + 1, I + 12, and I + 123 proteins ranged from 0.3 to 1.2 mM. These values are similar to those observed for half-maximal α2β1 integrin-mediated adhesion of platelets and of other cells to collagen (5Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 29Kassner P.D. Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19859-19867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mn2+ has been shown to support the adhesion of cells to collagen at significantly lower concentrations than Mg2+ (10-30 μM) (29Kassner P.D. Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19859-19867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16279-16285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the I domain fusion proteins required approximately 0.5 mM Mn2+ for half-maximal collagen binding. This concentration is similar to that of Mg2+ rather than the ten-fold lower concentration observed with the intact integrin. These data suggest that for the I domain-containing proteins, Mn2+ is substituting for Mg2+.Recently, the I domain from the αM integrin subunit has been crystallized in the presence of a limiting concentration of Mn2+ (31Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and the structure obtained from this analysis was compared with that obtained when the protein was crystallized in the presence of Mg2+ (10Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). A change in conformation as well as a change in the way the metal ion was coordinated was revealed when the protein was crystallized in the presence of Mn2+. The differing divalent cation-dependent structures may potentially reflect affinity modulation of the integrin. Our data indicate that the conformational changes observed in the I domain are themselves insufficient to confer significantly altered collagen binding activity on the I domain protein(s). In contrast, Mn2+ did markedly enhance binding of the I and I + 1 proteins to laminin. In this regard, it is noteworthy that only the most activated form of the α2β1 integrin is thought to exhibit laminin binding activity (32Chan B.M.C. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).The antibody binding experiments are significant in their own right. Both the 6F1 and 12F1 monoclonal antibodies bound to the proteins containing an intact α2 integrin I domain (I, I + 1, etc.) in the absence of the β1 integrin subunit indicating that the β1 subunit is not necessary for formation of the epitope recognized by these two antibodies. Deletion of the amino-terminal 35 amino acids of the I domain (residues 124-158 of the published α2 integrin sequence (19Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar)) to form the ΔI and ΔI + 1 proteins resulted in loss of reactivity with both the 6F1 and 12F1 antibodies. Since the deletion destroyed the integrity of the MIDAS motif, it was conceivable that critical divalent cation-dependent structures essential for reactivity with the antibodies may have also been destroyed. This seemed unlikely, however, since the same patterns of antibody reactivity were observed in both EDTA and Mg2+-containing buffers. These data, therefore, suggest that in addition to the region of residues 173-259 identified by Kamata, et al. (16Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in their study of human/bovine chimeric α2 integrin, an additional determinant present within residues 124-158 makes an important contribution to the apparently complex epitopes recognized by the 6F1 and 12F1 antibodies.In summary, the results of this investigation indicate, in agreement with other recent studies, that the α2 integrin subunit I domain is sufficient for collagen binding activity. The data obtained in this study indicate that, while there appears to be a Mg2+ binding site within the I domain that is critical for collagen binding, the sites responsible for Ca2+ inhibition are not present within the I domain or the region containing the three EF hand structures or that additional portions of the intact integrin are also required in conjunction with Ca2+ binding to observe the inhibitory effect. These results are consistent with our earlier observation that Mg2+ and Ca2+ exert their effects by binding to distinct sites on α2β1 (6Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 7Staatz W.D. Peters K.J. Santoro S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Finally, our studies reveal several differences between the binding of the I and I + 1 proteins to collagen and laminin. Unlike binding to collagen, which was equivalent in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, binding of both the I and I + 1 proteins to laminin was greatly enhanced in the presence of Mn2+. Furthermore, whereas binding to collagen was considerably enhanced by the addition of the first EF hand motif to the I domain, binding to laminin was essentially unaltered. The structural basis underlying these apparent mechanistic differences warrants further exploration. INTRODUCTIONThe integrins are heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules that mediate cell-cell adhesion and adhesion between cells and the extracellular matrix. They are widely expressed and function throughout development and adulthood in a variety of normal and pathologic processes (for review, see 1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). The α2β1 integrin is expressed on several different cell types, including endothelial and epithelial cells, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and platelets (2Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The ligand specificity of α2β1 varies with cell type. While it serves as a collagen receptor on platelets and fibroblasts, it can serve as both a collagen and as a laminin receptor on endothelial and epithelial cells (3Elices M.J. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9906-9910Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 4Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).Cell adhesion to collagen mediated by the α2β1 integrin is dependent upon the presence of divalent cations (5Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Mg2+, for example, supported the adhesion. Ca2+ could not substitute for Mg2+ and inhibited the Mg2+-dependent adhesion. The adhesion of liposomes containing purified α2β1 integrin to collagen was also found to depend on the presence of Mg2+ and to be inhibited by Ca2+ (6Staatz W.D. Rajpara S.M. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Santoro S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The inhibition of Mg2+-dependent adhesion to collagen of liposomes containing the α2β1 integrin occurred via a simple linear noncompetitive mechanism suggesting that Mg2+ and Ca2+ exert their effects by binding to distinct sites on the α2β1 integrin. Further evidence that Mg2+ and Ca2+ bind to distinct sites was obtained when limited proteolytic digestion of α2β1 gave different cleavage patterns depending on which divalent cation was present (7Staatz W.D. Peters K.J. Santoro S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Several potential divalent cation binding sites present in the α2 integrin subunit may mediate the distinct effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+. Within the extracellular domain of α2 are three EF hand motifs. These structures were originally described as Ca2+ binding sites in regulatory proteins (8Szebenyi D.M.E. Obendorf S.K. Moffat K. Nature. 1981; 294: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Watterson D.M. Sharief F. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 962-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but have since been shown to be capable of binding other divalent cations. The α2 subunit is a member of a subset of integrin α subunits that contain an approximately 200 amino acid domain located near the amino terminus often referred to as the I (or inserted) domain. Many I domains, including the αM integrin subunit I domain, contain an additional recently described cation binding site, the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) 1The abbreviations used are: MIDASmetal ion-dependent adhesion siteGSTglutathione S-transferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTBSTris-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. motif (10Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The α2 I domain also appears to contain a MIDAS motif since all five of the amino acids that contribute to divalent cation coordination in the αM MIDAS motif are conserved in the α2 integrin I domain.I domains share homology with the collagen-binding A domains of von Willebrand factor and cartilage matrix proteins suggesting that integrin I domains may be important determinants in ligand binding. The α1 subunit has been shown to be involved with the binding of α1β1 to its ligands, collagen, and laminin (11Kern A. Briesewitz R. Bank I. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22811-22816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the αM I domain is required for the interaction of the αMβ2 integrin with its ligands, ICAM-1, iC3b, and fibrinogen (10Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 12Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The αL I domain also appears to be important in the binding of the integrin αLβ2 with its ligands, ICAM-1, and ICAM-3 (13Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Landis R.C. McDowall A. Holness C.L.L. Littler A.J. Simmons D.L. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similarly, several lines of evidence implicate the involvement of the α2 I domain in ligand binding activity of the α2β1 integrin. First, a polyclonal antiserum directed against a bacterially expressed α2 I domain fusion protein was shown to block the attachment of endothelial cells to gelatin, type I collagen, and laminin (15Bahou W.F. Potter C.L. Mirza H. Blood. 1994; 84: 3734-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a series of human/bovine α2 integrin chimeras was generated and used to map the epitopes recognized by anti-human α2 integrin monoclonal antibodies that were capable of inhibiting the ligand binding activity of the human α2β1 integrin. All of these antibodies mapped to regions within the α2 I domain, revealing the significance of the I domain with regard to collagen recognition (16Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, several mutagenesis studies have demonstrated the importance of amino acids within the α2 integrin I domain for ligand binding (16Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, recombinant α2 integrin I domain expressed in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein has been shown to bind specifically to collagen. However, two reports (17Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have presented conflicting data as to whether the I domain, like the intact integrin, binds collagen in a divalent cation-dependent manner.To elucidate the roles of the various divalent cation binding sites present within the α2 subunit with regard to the metal ion-dependent function of the intact α2β1 integrin, we have expressed a series of α2 integrin I domain-containing proteins with either none, one, two, or all three of the EF hand sites. Our results indicate an essential role for the I domain and a heretofore unrecognized role for the first EF hand motif in divalent cation-dependent collagen binding activity."

D. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 6865-6869) were specific to these constructs or due to their oligomeric state. Sedimentation analysis indicated that DKH346, DKH357, and DKH365 are predominantly monomeric and that DKH381 and DKH405 are predominantly dimeric at 0.01-0.03 μM, the concentrations used for ATPase assays. In buffer with 25 mM KCl, all have high kcat values of 38-96 s−1 at saturating microtubule (MT) levels. Monomeric DKH346, DKH357, and DKH365 have K0.5(MT) values of 17, 9, and 1.4 μM, respectively, but the K0.5(MT) values for the dimeric species are significantly lower, with 0.02 and 0.14 μM for DKH381 and DKH405, respectively. The three new monomers release all of their ADP on association with microtubules, whereas the two new dimers retain approximately half of their ADP, consistent with the half-site reactivity observed previously with dimeric DKH392. Both the kbi(ATPase) (=kcat/K0.5(MT)) values for stimulation of ATPase by MTs and the kbi(ADP) for stimulation of ADP release by MTs were determined in buffer containing 120 mM potassium acetate. The ratio of these rate constants (kbi(ratio) = kbi(ATPase)/kbi(ADP)) is 60-100 for the dimers, indicating hydrolysis of many ATP molecules per productive encounter with a MT as observed previously for DKH392 (Hackney, D. D. (1995) Nature 377, 448-450). For the monomers, kbi(ratio) values of ∼4 indicate that they also may hydrolyze more than one ATP molecule per encounter with a MT and that the mechanism of hydrolysis is therefore fundamentally different from that of actomyosin. DKH340 is an exception to this pattern and may undergo uncoupled ATP hydrolysis.

The N-terminal 340 amino acids of kinesin are conserved among all superfamily members and contain the sites for ATP hydrolysis and interaction with MTs. The structure of this domain has recently been solved by x-ray crystallography (9Kull R.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The region between amino acids 340 and 400 is predicted to be α-helical and is likely to contain a region of coiled-coil (10Stewart R.J. Tahler J.P. Goldstein L.S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5209-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has established that DKH340 (containing amino acids 1-340) is monomeric, with an s20,w value of 3.3 S, whereas DKH392 (containing amino acids 1-392) is dimeric, with an s20,w value of 5.2 S (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led to a revised domain model of kinesin in which the two minimal motor domains are dimerized through interaction of the coiled-coil region in the neck without a highly flexible hinge at their point of attachment to the neck (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The poorly conserved region around position 400 is not predicted to readily form a coiled-coil structure, and it likely serves as a flexible hinge that attaches a functional dimer head unit to the rest of the coiled-coil stalk (12deCuevas M.

Subsequent determination of the oligomeric state of constructs of different lengths and from other species has confirmed this pattern and refined the region required for dimerization (7Berliner E.

A high degree of processive behavior likely requires the coordination of two head domains in a dimer as only dimeric constructs of kinesin can track in a linear path down a MT (7Berliner E. Young E.C. Anderson K. Mahtani H.K. Gelles J. Nature. 1995; 373: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The various head constructs of kinesin have a wide range of reported ATPase properties (7Berliner E. Young E.C. Anderson K. Mahtani H.K. Gelles J.

This reflects both the intrinsic differences between constructs due to their length, oligomeric state, and species of origin and differences in assay conditions, particularly the ionic strength and the concentration of heads. The work presented here is an examination of seven head constructs of Drosophila kinesin that differ in the amount of the neck domain that is included. This extensive series of constructs allows systematic evaluation of the influence of the length of the neck on the oligomeric state as well as evaluation of the influence of dimerization on kinetic properties under uniform assay conditions. These constructs exhibit a large range of properties, which suggests that caution must be exercised to prevent overinterpretation of results with a more limited series. Despite this variation, however, several characteristic differences between dimers and monomers have emerged. The plasmids pDKH346, pDKH357, pDKH365, pDKH381, and pDKH405 were obtained by polymerase chain reaction with the proofreading Pfu polymerase essentially as described for pDKH340 and pDKH392 (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the wide range of kinetic properties observed here with head constructs that all contain the same catalytic domain, it is reasonable to be concerned that differences may result from spurious mutations that were introduced in some constructs during cloning. All of the constructs used here were obtained by subcloning into the same pDKH392 plasmid, and thus, all have the same N-terminal region from amino acids 1 to 295. Only the very C-terminal part (from the PstI site corresponding to amino acid 295) was derived by polymerase chain reaction, and the DNA sequence of the polymerase chain reaction-derived region was determined and shown not to contain any errors. DNA sequences were obtained by the DNA Sequencing Facility of the University of Pittsburgh by the dye terminator method. As a further check for possible introduction of mutations into the N-terminal region during subcloning, the PstI tail fragment of the clone of pDKH357 that was used for most of the protein preparations was excised and religated into a pDKH392 backbone. DKH357 protein expressed by this new construct had the same high K0.5(MT) value as the original DKH357 clone, indicating that the difference in K0.5(MT) between DKH357 and DKH392 is not due to unintended changes in sequence in the catalytic region. Preparations of the head domain proteins used in this work (including new preparations of DKH392 and DKH340) were performed essentially as described previously for DKH340 and DKH392 (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the exposure to excess EDTA during lysis and sonification was eliminated. Final preparations were stored in 50% glycerol at −80°C. All reactions were performed at 25°C in A25 buffer as described previously (20Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was not routinely included. For ATPase reaction, A25 buffer was supplemented with 1 mM MgATP, 2 mM P-enolpyruvate, 0.3 mM NADH, and pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase at 3-5 μg/ml. Reactions were also supplemented with KCl or potassium acetate as indicated, and solutions containing MTs were supplemented with 3-10 μM Taxol. ATPase reactions were initiated by addition of a small volume of an intermediate stock of head domain at typically 0.5-2 μM in buffer supplemented with 0.1 mM ATP. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar) on this intermediate stock using the Coomassie Plus kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. ATPase rates are reported on a per site (head) basis whether the construct is monomeric or dimeric. kcat and K0.5(MT) values were determined in triplicate and are reported as ±S.E. The rate of ADP release from the head domain was determined using [α-32P]ADP and a cold chase with excess ATP as described (20Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first-order rate constants for ADP release were obtained by linear regression on a plot of ln([bound − ADP]) versus time for typically five points between 10 and 90% reaction. The standard error of the fit was ≤5%. kbi(ADP) values were determined from the increase in ADP release rate on addition of MTs and are reported as the average of at least two determinations at different MT concentrations. Tubulin was isolated by two cycles of polymerization and chromatography on phosphocellulose (21Williams Jr., R.C. Lee J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and polymerized with Taxol in A25 buffer with 25 mM KCl as described (20Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, the MTs were further concentrated, and unpolymerized tubulin was removed by centrifugation at 22°C (30 min at 150,000 × g) and gentle resuspension with a loose-fitting Teflon pestle at room temperature in A25 buffer with 25 mM KCl and 10 μM Taxol. Following resuspension, the MTs were centrifuged for 1.5 min at 16,000 × g to remove aggregated material. MT stock solutions were divided into small aliquots, frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. For use in experiments, a tube of polymerized MTs was rapidly thawed by incubation in a water bath at 25°C. One freeze-thaw cycle produced no detectable change in the ability of MTs to stimulate the ATPase of head constructs. MT concentrations are reported as the concentration of tubulin αβ-heterodimers. Hydrodynamic characterization was performed essentially as described previously (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sucrose gradient centrifugation was performed for 19 h at 4°C in A25 buffer with 25 mM KCl and 0.1 mM MgATP at 41,000 rpm in either an SW 41 (Beckman Instruments) or a TH641 (DuPont) rotor. In some cases, gradients also contained NaCl or 120 mM potassium acetate (without KCl) as indicated. Catalase, bovine serum albumin, and carbonic anhydrase at 0.1-0.2 mg/ml were routinely included as standards. Gradients were fractionated into 20 drop fractions (typically 14 full fractions) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with staining by Coomassie Blue. The s20,w value of the kinesin head was determined using the least-squares fit of the s20,w values of the standards versus their migration. Gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was conducted at ∼22°C in A25 buffer with 25 mM KCl, 0.1 mM MgATP, and bovine serum albumin as an internal marker as described (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions from centrifugation or chromatography were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with staining by Coomassie Blue. For experiments at very low concentration of head domain, the head domain was concentrated from the bulk of each gradient fraction by adsorption to phosphocellulose and elution with SDS sample buffer and then analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with detection by Western blot analysis using SUK4 (22Ingold A.L. Cohn S.A. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2659-2670Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar) as the primary antibody as described (23Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16508-16511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has established that DKH340 is monomeric, with an s20,w value of 3.3 S, whereas DKH392 is dimeric, with an s20,w value of 5.2 S, and further work (7Berliner E. Young E.C. Anderson K. Mahtani H.K. Gelles J. Nature. 1995; 373: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Vale R.D. Funatsu T. Pierce D.W. Romberg L. Harada Y. Yanagida T.

Biol. 1995; 249: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) has confirmed and extended this conclusion with other constructs of similar length. To better localize the regions required for dimerization and to determine the influence of dimerization itself, kinesin head domains terminating at a series of positions in the neck region were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified essentially as described previously (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The velocity of sedimentation during centrifugation in a sucrose gradient was determined over a range of head concentrations in A25 buffer with 25 mM KCl, and the s20,w values are summarized in Table I. At a concentration of ≤1 μM, DKH346, DKH357, and DKH365 have s20,w values of 3.5-3.6 S, which are similar to the values for DKH340, which was previously shown to be monomeric (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas DKH381 and DKH405 have s20,w values of 5.1-5.7 S, which are similar to the 5.2 S value for dimeric DKH392 (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel filtration experiments on Sephacryl S-300 (data not shown) indicate that DKH346, DKH357, and DKH365 elute at the same position as DKH340 and thus have similar diffusion coefficients, whereas DKH381 and DKH405 elute at the same position as DKH392. The similarity of both the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients of DKH346, DKH357, and DKH365 to monomeric DKH340 and of DKH381 and DKH405 to dimeric DKH392 indicates that these constructs are also predominantly monomeric and dimeric, respectively, under these conditions as summarized in Table II.Table I.Sedimentation coefficients of head domainsHead construct25 mM KCl120 mM K acetate, 20 μMaInitial head concentration.0.02 μMaInitial head concentration.0.3 μMaInitial head concentration.1.0 μMaInitial head concentration.20.0 μMaInitial head concentration.DKH340NDbND, not determined.3.5(3.3)cFrom Ref. 11 at ∼5 μM initial concentration.3.6NDDKH346ND bND, not determined.3.63.63.6NDDKH357ND bND, not determined.3.63.63.6NDDKH365ND bND, not determined.3.53.53.73.6DKH3815.15.25.78.05.7DKH392ND bND, not determined.5.1(5.2)cFrom Ref. 11 at ∼5 μM initial concentration.6.15.2DKH4055.15.15.46.35.2a Initial head concentration.b ND, not determined.c From 11Huang T.-G.

Open table in a new tab Sedimentation of DKH381-DKH405 at a higher initial head concentration of 20 μM results in increased s20,w values (Table I), indicating aggregation to species larger than the dimer. Aggregation is particularly severe for DKH381 and is highly dependent on the salt concentration as indicated in Fig. 1. When 100 or 300 mM NaCl was included, DKH381 sedimented with s20,w values of 5.1 and 5.0 S, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). An s20,w value of 5.0 S was also obtained with 1000 mM NaCl (data not shown). These s20,w values are consistent with no aggregation beyond the dimer at higher ionic strength. With no added NaCl and only 25 mM KCl, DKH381 migrates more rapidly at ∼8.0 S (Fig. 1C). There is little DKH381 remaining in the position expected for the dimer, and the peak is unsymmetrical, with streaking toward the dimer position. This behavior is consistent with an equilibrium between dimers and higher aggregates that favors aggregates at this high concentration, but is reversible on the time scale of sedimentation. In the complete absence of added salt, DKH381 is largely insoluble at 20 μM and has a visible turbidness that is cleared by brief centrifugation at 13,000 × g with removal of the most of the protein. DKH381 remaining in solution sediments at ∼9 S (Fig. 1D). Aggregation of DKH381 is also reduced by 120 mM potassium acetate (Fig. 1E), although the value of 5.7 S indicates that dissociation to dimers is not complete. The value of 5.2 S for DKH392 and DKH405 in 120 mM potassium acetate (Table I) indicates that these constructs are not aggregated even at an initial loading of 20 μM. A more detailed analysis of the oligomeric state during ATPase reactions is given below following description of the ATPase properties of the different constructs. The new head constructs contain tightly bound ADP that can be labeled by incubation with [α-32P]ATP as described previously for native kinesin (24Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), DKH340 (20Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and DKH392 (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monomeric DKH340 releases essentially all of its bound ADP on binding to MTs, while dimeric DKH392 releases only half of its ADP (25Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and this half-site reactivity of dimeric species is likely involved in generation of the high degree of processivity of kinesin. Analysis of the other head constructs (Table II) indicates that all of the monomeric constructs release ∼95% of their ADP on binding to MTs, while all of the dimeric constructs release ∼60% of their ADP after 3 s. This release is consistent with the time course reported for DKH340 and DKH392 (25Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and indicates that half-site reactivity is restricted to dimeric species. The rate of release of the bound [α-32P]ADP during a chase with excess unlabeled ATP in the absence of MTs (ko) equals the steady-state ATPase rate for both bovine kinesin (24Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Sadhu A. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11352-11359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated head domain constructs (20Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13233-13241Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For monomeric DKH340, ko had previously been shown to be 5-fold higher than the rate of ADP release from dimeric DKH392 (0.025 versus 0.005 s−1) (11Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Huang T.-G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 25 mM KCl. Analysis of the ADP release rates for all seven head constructs in 25 mM KCl (Table II) indicates that this difference is not due to dimerization because all the other heads, both monomers and dimers, have low ADP release rates of 0.005-0.010 s−1. The higher rate with DKH340 rather represents an abnormally high basal ADP release rate for DKH340. A similar pattern is observed in 120 mM potassium acetate (Table III), with all the rates ∼2-fold higher.Table III.Properties of kinesin head domains in A25 buffer with 120 mM potassium acetateHead constructko, −MTskcat, +MTsK0.5(MT)kbi(ATPase)kbi(ADP)kbi(ratio) (kbi(ATPase)/kbi(ADP))s−1s−1μMμM−1 s−1μM−1 s−1DKH3400.057NDaND, not determined.ND119.0 ± 5.64.3 ± 0.0127.7DKH3460.013ND aND, not determined.ND1.9 ± 0.090.58 ± 0.013.3DKH3570.015ND aND, not determined.ND2.9 ± 0.080.66 ± 0.044.4DKH3650.013ND aND, not determined.ND6.8 ± 0.52.1 ± 0.123.2DKH3810.01541.0 ± 1.70.054 ± 0.005761.0 ± 49.07.6 ± 0.24100.0DKH3920.01642.0 ± 2.80.19 ± 0.023224.0 ± 16.03.4 ± 0.2766.0DKH4050.01944.0 ± 4.10.39 ± 0.056115.0 ± 6.01.9 ± 0.0361.0a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The MT-stimulated ATPase kinetics of the heads in 25 mM KCl were determined as indicated in Table II. All of the heads have high kcat values, but monomers have higher values of 61-96 s−1 compared with dimers at ∼40 s−1. In contrast to the relatively similar kcat values, the K0.5(MT) values differ dramatically over almost a 1000-fold range (from 0.02 μM for dimeric DKH381 to 17 μM for monomeric DKH346). All three dimeric constructs have extremely low K0.5(MT) values of ≤0.14 μM when assayed at ∼0.01 μM head concentration, whereas the monomeric constructs have much higher K0.5(MT) values of 1.4-17 μM, with the exception of DKH340. The results of analysis in 120 mM potassium acetate are indicated in Table III, and the pattern is similar, but the K0.5(MT) values are higher due to the higher ionic strength. The K0.5(MT) values for the monomers were not determined because they would be too high to measure in most cases, but the bimolecular rate constant (kbi(ATPase)) was still determined from the MT dependence of the ATPase rate at low MT concentrations. The stimulation of the ATPase by MTs exhibits approximately hyperbolic saturation behavior under these conditions, and thus, kbi(ATPase) determined in this way is numerically equivalent to kcat/K0.5(MT). The kcat for dimeric DKH392 has been shown to be independent of the concentration of DKH392 in the assay over the range of 0.004-0.025 μM (23Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16508-16511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in A25 buffer with 25 mM KCl. This is the maximum range over which the coupled assay using pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase is readily applicable. This range was extended to 0.5 μM DKH392 in the absence of pyruvate kinase by determining the initial rate of Pi production using the malachite green method (29Penney C.L. Bolger G. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 89: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Over the range of 2.5-25 μM MTs, the ATPase rate with 0.5 μM DKH392 varied between 36 and 42 s−1, with an extrapolated kcat of 41 s−1. Thus, there is no significant change in the kcat when assayed at high concentrations of dimeric DKH392. The oligomeric state of the constructs during an ATPase assay is influenced by the way in which the assay is conducted. Typically, the assay is initiated by dilution of an intermediate stock of head domain at 0.5-2 μM into the reaction mixture with spectrophotometric determination of the initial rate over 30-60 s. Th"
https://openalex.org/W2016129682,"Integrin signaling is mediated by interaction of integrin cytoplasmic domains with intracellular signaling molecules. Recently, we identified a novel 111-amino acid polypeptide, termed β3-endonexin, which interacts selectively with the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain. In the present study we conducted a systematic mutational analysis of both the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain and β3-endonexin to map sites required for interaction. The interaction of the full-length β3 integrin subunit with β3-endonexin in vitro required the β3 cytoplasmic domain. In a yeast two-hybrid system, both membrane-proximal and membrane-distal residues of the β3 cytoplasmic domain were necessary for interaction with β3-endonexin. In particular, the membrane-distal NITY motif at β3 756-759 was critical for the interaction. Exchange of β3 residues 756-759 (NITY) for the corresponding residues in β1 (NPKY) endowed the β1 cytoplasmic domain with the ability to interact with β3-endonexin. Conversely, exchange of the NPKY motif at β1 772-775 for the NITY motif in β3 abolished interaction of this chimeric cytoplasmic domain with β3-endonexin. Because the NITY motif is present in the β3 but not the β1 cytoplasmic domain, these results explain the selective interaction of this cytoplasmic domain with β3-endonexin. In addition, deletional analysis suggested that a core 91-residue sequence of β3-endonexin is sufficient for specific binding to the β3 cytoplasmic domain. These studies have identified a cytoplasmic domain sequence motif that specifies an integrin-specific protein-protein interaction. Integrin signaling is mediated by interaction of integrin cytoplasmic domains with intracellular signaling molecules. Recently, we identified a novel 111-amino acid polypeptide, termed β3-endonexin, which interacts selectively with the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain. In the present study we conducted a systematic mutational analysis of both the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain and β3-endonexin to map sites required for interaction. The interaction of the full-length β3 integrin subunit with β3-endonexin in vitro required the β3 cytoplasmic domain. In a yeast two-hybrid system, both membrane-proximal and membrane-distal residues of the β3 cytoplasmic domain were necessary for interaction with β3-endonexin. In particular, the membrane-distal NITY motif at β3 756-759 was critical for the interaction.

To study interactions between LDL, decorin, and collagen type I, we used solid phase systems in which LDL was coupled to a Sepharose column, or in which LDL, decorin, or collagen type I was attached to microtiter wells. The interaction between LDL and decorin in the fluid phase was evaluated using a gel mobility shift assay. We found that LDL binds to decorin by ionic interactions. After treatment with chondroitinase ABC, decorin did not bind to LDL, showing that the glycosaminoglycan side chain of decorin is essential for LDL binding. Acetylated and cyclohexanedione-treated LDL did not bind to decorin, demonstrating that both lysine and arginine residues of apoB-100 are necessary for the interaction. When collagen type I was attached to the microtiter plates, only insignificant amounts of LDL bound to the collagen. However, if decorin was first allowed to bind to the collagen, binding of LDL to the decorin-collagen complexes was over 10-fold higher than to collagen alone. Thus, decorin can link LDL with collagen type I in vitro, which suggests a novel mechanism for retention of LDL in collagen-rich areas of atherosclerotic lesions.

https://openalex.org/W2031861066,"The 78-kDa protein kinase Mekk1 plays an important role in the stress response pathway that involves the activation of downstream kinases Sek1 and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Conserved serine and threonine residues located between the kinase subdomains VII and VIII of many protein kinases are phosphorylated for maximal kinase activation. Two threonine residues within this region in Mekk1 at positions 560 and 572, but not the serine at 557, were shown to be essential for catalytic activity in this study. When these threonine residues were replaced with alanine, there was a significant loss in phosphotransferase activity toward the primary substrate, Sek1, and a large decrease in autophosphorylation activity. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that these threonine residues cannot be replaced with either serine or glutamic acid for preservation of phosphotransferase activity. Further examination of the Mekk1 mutants isolated from 32P-labeled transfected COS cells showed that Thr-560 and Thr-572 were indeed phosphorylated after two-dimensional tryptic-chymotryptic phosphopeptide analysis. Additional determinants in the NH2-terminal domain of Mekk1 also play a role in the regulation of Mekk1 activity. Although Pak3 and PKC can activate Mekk1 in vivo, this interaction is indirect and independent, since there was no direct phosphorylation of Mekk1 by Pak3 or PKC or of Pak3 by PKC, respectively.

Modules of sequentially activating protein kinases are coupled to hormone receptors through both monomeric and heterotrimeric classes of G proteins. Genetic analysis of yeast mutants that are compromised in various signal transduction pathways has led to the identification of several related protein kinase modules, some of which transduce signals from G proteins (1Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). For example, budding yeast mating pheromones bind to serpentine seven-transmembrane domain-containing receptors that are coupled through the β- and Ɣ-subunits of a trimeric G protein to the activation of a module of protein kinases composed of Ste20, Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3 (2Errede B.

Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). However, the intervening steps following surface receptor binding of these agents are still obscure. There are at least three isoforms of Mekk (16Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Lange-Carter C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4925-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The original 78-kDa form of Mekk (Mekk1) was first identified as a Mek1 kinase (17Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) but is considered now to target Sek1 (14Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Dérijard B. Davis R. Johnson G.L. Karin M.

Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Recently, two additional Mekk clones, Mekk2 and Mekk3, which corresponded to proteins of 69.7 and 71 kDa, respectively, were isolated (19Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliot E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Mekk2 was reported to preferentially activate the downstream SAP kinase, whereas Mekk3 would activate p42-Erk2 (19Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliot E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Additionally, Lange-Carter and colleagues (20Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 21Russell M. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11757-11760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) have identified in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells two immunologically related Mekks of 82 and 98 kDa, where the 98-kDa form was shown to be activated in response to nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, phorbol ester, and oncogenic Ras (20Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 21Russell M. Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11757-11760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A larger form of Mekk1, with a predicted molecular mass of 161 kDa, has also been cloned (22Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Another isoform may correspond to the I-Mekk detected in preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells by Haystead et al. (23Haystead C.M.M. Gregory P. Shirazi A. Fadden P. Mosse C. Dent P. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12804-12808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 56-kDa kinase is distinct from Raf1 and is rapidly and transiently activated in rat adipocytes treated with insulin. I-Mekk was also not activated in response to phorbol ester and was immunologically distinct from the Mekk1 described by Lange-Carter et al. (17Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Another possible member of the Mekk family is the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase, which was also stimulated in response to bone morphogenetic protein (24Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-20111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). This kinase, however, has an extremely short amino terminus (22 residues), which appeared to be regulatory for enzyme function. Enzymological studies of the above mammalian protein kinases should provide further information about their roles in various G protein-dependent signaling pathways. In the present study, we have characterized two threonine residues, Thr-560 and Thr-572, in Mekk1 that are essential for its catalytic function. We have further determined that the NH2-terminal domain of Mekk1 has an additional regulatory role in the enzyme function. In the search for kinases that target Mekk1, in vivo experiments using Mekk1-transfected COS cells and Mekk1 baculovirus-infected insect cells demonstrated that Mekk1 activity can be stimulated by phorbol ester treatment. However, no direct phosphorylation of Mekk1 by PKC could be demonstrated. This implies that while regulation by PKC may be physiologically significant, PKC activation of Mekk1 is achieved indirectly. Co-expression studies with Pak3 baculovirus- and Mekk1 baculovirus-infected insect cells showed an activation of Mekk1. There was, however, no direct phosphorylation of Mekk1 by Pak3. Murine Mekk1 cDNA was kindly provided to us by Drs. Gary Johnson and Carol Lange-Carter of the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine in Colorado. The plasmids for GST-Cdc42Hs and murine Pak3 were generously donated by Drs. Subha Bagrodia and Richard Cerione (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The plasmids for murine Sek1 and Sek1(K129R/T387A/S390A) were gifts from Dr. Leonard I. Zon (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA). pGEX-Mek1 and pGEX-Mek2 plasmids encoding for the respective human proteins were kindly given by Dr. Kun-Liang Guan (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Baculovirus-expressing PKC βII isoform was a gift from Dr. Daniel E. Koshland (University of California, Berkeley). Purified rat brain protein kinase C (PKC), a mixture of α, β, and Ɣ isoforms, was generously provided by Dr. Michael Walsh (University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada). To express Mekk1 in COS cells, a 2205-base pair (bp) region of Mekk1 containing the entire coding sequence was amplified by PCR using the primers Mekk5-1 (5′-ATG GTT GGC AAG CTC TCT CG) and Mekk3-1 (5′-GTT GCA TAT CCT GTC TCC) with VENT DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's specifications supplemented with 5% Me2SO. Conditions for amplification of the 2.2-kilobase pair fragment were preincubation at 99°C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 99°C for 1 min, 53°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 2 min; and then a final extension at 72°C for 10 min in a Perkin-Elmer 480 thermocycler. The 2.2-kilobase pair PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and recovered from the agarose using Qiaex (Qiagen Inc.). The 2.2-kilobase pair Mekk1 fragment was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEF1 under the control of the human elongation factor-1αpromoter (25Uetsuki T. Naito A. Nagata S. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5791-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pEF1 vector has a simian virus 40 origin that ensures a high copy number of replication for the vector in COS cells. The junction between the Mekk1 PCR fragment and vector pEF1 was sequenced at both the 5′- and 3′-ends of the insert to confirm sequence and orientation. The resulting construct was designated pEF1-Mekk1. Mekk1 with a polyhistidine (His6) tag on the NH2 terminus or COOH terminus was created by PCR mutagenesis using primer Mekk5-H6 (5′-ATG CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT ATG GTT GGC AAG CTC TCT CG) with Mekk3-1 (5′-GTT GCA TAT CCT GTC TCC) or Mekk5-1 (5′-ATG GTT GGC AAG CTC TCT CG) with Mekk-CY (5′-GA GGA TCC CTA GTG ATG ATG GTG GTG GTG CCA CGT GGT ACG GAA GAC CGG), respectively. The truncated kinase was generated using primers Mekk-M353 (5′-ATG GCG ATG TCA GCG TCT CAG) with Mekk3-1. Mutants K432AMekk1, S557AMekk1, T560AMekk1, and T572AMekk1 were also generated by PCR mutagenesis. All mutants were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. COS-1 (ATCC number CRL 1650) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies Ltd.) at 37°C with 5% CO2. COS cells were transfected with vector, wild type Mekk1, or the various Mekk1 mutants (pEF1, pEF1-Mekk1, pEF1-Mekk1(NT-His6), pEF1-Mekk1(CT-His6), pEF1-K432AMekk1, or pEF1-S557AMekk1 or the threonine mutants, pEF1-T560AMekk1 or pEF1-T572AMekk1) by using DEAE-dextran with a 20% (v/v) glycerol shock for 2 min as described previously (26Hammarskjold M.L. Wang S.C. Klein G. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 43: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fifty-two hours after transfection, the cells were washed with DMEM and subsequently incubated in DMEM plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v). For phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation, the DMEM plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 nM PMA 18 h later. Unstimulated cells were used as controls. After incubation at 37°C for the specified period of time, the flask of cells was placed on ice and washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were harvested by scrapping in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5 mM EDTA. COS cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in homogenization buffer A (10 mM MES (pH 6.0), 50 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 100 μM sodium vanadate, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) (17Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with a Dounce homogenizer followed by sonication on ice in two 15-s bursts at 80% power output (Branson Sonic Power Company, model 130). A sample of homogenate was removed for kinase assays, and the lysate was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm (TLA45 rotor) for 1 h in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge. The supernatant or cytosolic fraction was collected, and the protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. For column fractionation, cytosolic protein (1-2 mg) was loaded onto a Mono Q column (1-ml bed volume) previously equilibrated with buffer B containing 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mMβ-glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 mM sodium vanadate. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with a 10-ml linear 0-0.8 M NaCl gradient in buffer B using a Pharmacia FPLC system, and 0.25-ml fractions were collected. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing Mekk1 or Pak3 were isolated using the BaculoGold kit from PharMingen Inc. (San Diego, CA). Virtually 100% of the recombinants were achieved, and one of the plaques was propagated as a recombinant virus stock. Trichoplusia ni cells were grown as monolayers and infected with Mekk1, Pak, and PKC, separately or in combination, as per the manufacturer's instructions at a multiplicity of infection of 10. At 50 h postinfection, cells were harvested as described above for the COS cells. To determine whether Mekk1 can be phosphorylated in vitro by PKC or Pak3, Mono-Q-fractionated Mekk1 (wild type and kinase-inactive version, K432AMekk1) was used. Mekk1 (1 μg) was incubated at 30°C in the presence or absence of PKC (16 ng), 4.5 mM CaCl2, 60 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 6 μg/ml diolein, and 10 mM MgCl2 in buffer C (12.5 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 12.5 mMβ-glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM sodium fluoride, and 250 μM dithiothreitol). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μM [Ɣ-32P]ATP (∼5000 cpm/pmol). After 60 min of incubation, the phosphorylation reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 × SDS sample buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 25% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). Subsequent to SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (pore size, 0.45 μm) as described by Towbin et al. (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar), followed by autoradiography. Pak3 was isolated with glutathione-agarose-immobilized GST-Cdc42Hs (see below) and was mixed with 0.3 μg of Mekk1 in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2 in buffer C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μM [Ɣ-32P]ATP (∼5000 cpm/pmol) and was incubated for 60 min at 30°C. An aliquot of the supernatant of the reaction mixture was removed after the reaction, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane followed by autoradiography. Phosphorylated Mekk1 was excised from the membrane, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Uninfected insect cell extract was used as control. Mekk1 phosphotransferase activity in COS cells was generally determined using GST-Sek1(K129R/T387A/S390A) as substrate. (Myelin basic protein and histone H1 were also found to be in vitro substrates for Mekk1.) An aliquot of the Mekk1-containing fractions eluted from the Mono Q column or cytosolic cell lysate was added to glutathione-agarose-immobilized GST-Sek1(K129R/T387A/S390A) (1 μg) in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μM [Ɣ-32P]ATP (∼3000 cpm/pmol). After 30 min of incubation at 30°C, the phosphorylation reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer C containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 150 mM NaCl. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 1 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed twice more with buffer C followed by the addition of an aliquot of 5 × SDS sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. GST-Sek1(K129R/T389A/S390A) bands were visualized by Ponceau S staining and autoradiography and then excised for liquid scintillation counting. Pak activity was measured using MBP as substrate. A 100-μl aliquot of cytosolic cell extract was incubated with 2 μg of glutathione agarose-immobilized GST-Cdc42Hs for 60 min at 30°C. The preincubation was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer C. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 1 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed once more with Buffer C followed by the addition of MBP (final concentration: 3 mg/ml) and 10 mM MgCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 70 μM [Ɣ-32P]ATP (∼700 cpm/pmol). After 30 min of incubation at 30°C, the phosphorylation reaction was terminated by the addition of an aliquot of 5 × SDS sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Bands corresponding to MBP were visualized by Ponceau S staining and autoradiography and then excised for liquid scintillation counting. The presence of Pak3 in the assay was confirmed by Western immunoblotting using the anti-Pak3-NT polyclonal antibody as described above. PKC assays were determined using PKC MBP (residues 4-14) substrate peptide, QKRPSQRSKYL (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) as substrate. COS cells were transfected with COOH terminus polyhistidine-tagged wild type Mekk1 and Mekk1 threonine mutants, T560AMekk1 and T572AMekk1, as described above and subsequently labeled with 0.1 mCi of 32Pi/ml of phosphate-free DMEM for 4 h at 37°C in the presence of CO2. At the end of the labeling period, the cells were harvested as described above. Cell pellets were lysed in 2 ml of 6 M guanidine HCl, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. This lysate was passed through a 24-gauge syringe needle four times prior to binding to 1 ml of ProBond (Invitrogen). The beads were washed, and polyhistidine-tagged Mekk1 was eluted under denaturing conditions as per the manufacturer's protocol. The eluate was concentrated, exchanged into 2% SDS using Centricon-30 (Amicon), and then boiled in SDS sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Mekk1 bands were visualized by autoradiography and excised for tryptic-chymotryptic two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (30Huttner W.B. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5402-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The 78-kDa protein kinase Mekk1 was originally identified as a Mek1 kinase (17Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), but recent expression studies in COS cells (14Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Dérijard B. Davis R. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) and NIH-3T3 cells (15Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) have instead pointed to Sek1 as its physiological target. Low levels of Mekk1 lead to increased activation of SAP kinases without stimulation of Erk1 or Erk2. We have found that recombinant Mekk1 expressed in COS cells (Fig. 1B) catalyzes the phosphorylation of a GST fusion protein of Sek1 only about 3 times better than GST-Mek1 and twice as well as GST-Mek2 in vitro (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, when phosphate incorporation caused by autophosphotransferase activity of the substrates was eliminated, their phosphorylation by Mekk1 was quite similar. This was accomplished by using kinase-inactive versions of GST-Sek1 (Sek1(K129R/T387A/S390A)) and GST-Mek1 (Mek1(K97A)) as substrates, resulting in Mekk1 activities of 1.9 and 1.8 pmol/min/ml, respectively. Mekk1 phosphorylation of GST-Sek1 has been demonstrated on Ser-220 and Thr-224 just upstream of the kinase subdomain VIII region (15Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Mek1 by Mekk1 has also been shown to occur at residues Ser-218 and Ser-222 in a homologous kinase subdomain to that of Sek1 (31Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P.

All of the following studies were conducted using the kinase-inactive version of Sek1, which also had its two potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites at Thr-387 and Ser-390 mutated to alanine. These MAP kinase sites can be phosphorylated in vitro by Erk2, but the functional effect of this is unclear (13Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain of Mekk1 has been suggested to play a regulatory role in its phosphotransferase activity (17Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when a polyhistidine sequence was tagged onto the NH2 terminus of Mekk1, the enzyme was inactive (Fig. 2). A bacterially expressed GST-Mekk1 (GST tagged at the NH2 terminus) fusion protein was also inactive (data not shown). However, when the polyhistidine was tagged onto the C terminus of Mekk1, it did not affect its phosphotransferase activity. A catalytically active Mekk1 was also generated when the NH2-terminal domain (residues 1-352) was deleted from the protein (Fig. 2). As reported by Minden et al. (14Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Dérijard B. Davis R. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), this truncated form of Mekk1 was expressed at much higher levels than all other forms of Mekk1. We next assessed whether the COOH-terminal catalytic kinase domain contains regulatory residues. Of particular interest was the loop 12 region between conserved kinase subdomains VII (DFG) and VIII (APE) (35Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), where activating serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues for many protein kinases have been reported (9Hibi M. Lin A.

Although previous measurements at atmospheric pressure suggest Fe 2+ -Fe 3+ hopping (small polaron) as the dominant conductivity mechanism, the present experiments show a change in charge transport mechanism with temperature. The lower temperature measurements are consistent with small polaron conduction, but at higher temperatures, which are more applicable to the lower mantle, a large polaron mechanism is suggested. Because these mechanisms have different temperature and compositional dependencies, this transition has important implications for extrapolation to mantle conditions."

In fact, a 30-min treatment of T67 cells with the combination of lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-Ɣ (MIX) strongly inhibits the cNOS activity, as determined by measuring [3H]citrulline production. In addition, the effect of MIX is also observed by measuring nitrite, the stable breakdown product of NO: a 30-min pretreatment of T67 cells with MIX is able to reduce significantly the N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced nitrite production.

Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). There are at least three distinct isoforms of NOS present in human cells. Two enzymes, the neuronal and the endothelial Ca2+-dependent isoforms (NOS-I and NOS-III, respectively), are constantly expressed and termed constitutive NOS (cNOS). The third enzyme is an inducible Ca2+-independent isoform (iNOS or NOS-II), which is expressed after stimulation with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or cytokines, such as interferon-Ɣ (IFNƔ), interleukin-1β, or tumor necrosis factor-α. The induction of human iNOS occurs at the transcriptional level (2de Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L. Morris Jr., S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

NO generated at low levels by a cNOS plays an important role in physiological processes, whereas uncontrolled and massive iNOS-induced NO production can be potentially detrimental to the tissue integrity (5Suzuki H. Menegazzi M. Carcereri de Prati A. Mariotto S. Armato U. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1995; 5: 379-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been observed recently that in the central nervous system NO released from activated microglia and/or astrocytes may be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (6Zielasek J. Hartung H.P. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 6: 191-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 7Chao C.C. Hu S. Sheng W.S. Bu D. Bukrinsky M.I. Peterson P.K. GLIA. 1996; 16: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, the suppression of an undesirable and potentially harmful iNOS-elicited NO production can be fundamental for neuronal survival. Recently, we have reported that in human ramified microglial cells, a nearly physiological level of exogenous NO suppresses the LPS/tumor necrosis factor-α-elicited NO production, by preventing induction of iNOS mRNA expression (8Colasanti M. Persichini T. Menegazzi M. Mariotto S. Giordano E. Caldarera C.M. Sogos V. Lauro G.M. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26731-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In addition, we have observed that the early presence of NO donors during induction is essential for inhibition of iNOS expression, the latter being due to a suppression of NF-κB activation (8Colasanti M. Persichini T. Menegazzi M. Mariotto S. Giordano E. Caldarera C.M. Sogos V. Lauro G.M. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26731-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data imply that induction of iNOS expression should be prevented by a pre-existing endogenous NO level, as produced by a cNOS enzyme. Therefore, in the cell types possessing both a Ca2+-dependent and a Ca2+-independent NOS isoforms, i.e. astroglial, epithelial, smooth muscle, or endothelial cells, iNOS gene expression may be reasonably assumed not to be induced after LPS/cytokines stimulation, unless the cNOS-generated NO level goes down below a threshold value in a short time. Here, we have used human astrocytoma cells (T67), as a model of astroglia for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the fine regulation of NOS expression. We hypothesize that LPS and IFNƔ, which are able to strongly induce iNOS in T67 cells as reported elsewhere (9Mollace V. Colasanti M. Rodinò P. Massoud R. Lauro G.M. Nisticò G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nω-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), E. coli LPS (Serotype 0127:B8), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), L-arginine (L-Arg) were obtained from Sigma (Milan, Italy). Human recombinant interferon-Ɣ (IFNƔ) was supplied by Biogen SA (Geneva, Switzerland; specific activity: 2 × 107 IU/mg protein) and L-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine by Amersham Corp. Human astrocytoma T67 cells were obtained from explant of III WHO gemistocytic astrocytoma and were characterized in our laboratory, as described previously (11Lauro G.M. Di Lorenzo N. Grossi M. Maleci A. Guidetti B. Acta Neurophatol. (Berl.). 1986; 69: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).

For Ca2+-dependent activity, after centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min at 4°C), an aliquot of the supernatant was added to a reaction mixture of a final volume of 100 μl containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 nM [3H]arginine, 1 μM arginine, 1 mM NADPH, 1 mM EDTA, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 μM FAD, 0.1 mM (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-biopterin, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. For Ca2+-independent activity, instead, 1.2 mM CaCl2 and 1 μg/ml calmodulin were omitted from, and 1 mM EGTA was added to the reaction mixture. The reactions were stopped by adding 0.4 ml of 1:1 slurry of Dowex AG50WX-8 (Bio-Rad, Na+ form) in 50 mM HEPES, pH 5.5, and after 15-min shaking, radioactivity in the supernatant was measured. Enzyme activity was expressed as picomoles of citrulline formed in 1 min by 1 mg of protein. Protein concentration in the samples was determined by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). 5 × 105 human astrocytoma cells (T67) were resuspended in Krebs' buffer and stirred for 10 min at 1000 rpm in a platelet aggregometer. The intact cells were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min and nitrite (NO2-) levels were determined in supernatants by the Griess reaction, as described elsewhere (9Mollace V. Colasanti M.

Briefly, aliquots of the cell supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride, 2.5% H3PO4). The absorbance was measured at 546 nm and NO2- concentration was determined using sodium nitrite as a standard. Results were expressed as nmol ml-1. Total cellular RNA was purified from 1 × 106 human astrocytoma T67 cells by the method Chomczynski and Sacchi (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Briefly, a single extraction with an acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform mixture was performed. Whole RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase using oligo(dT)12-18 as primers. PCR was carried out with Taq DNA polymerase in an automatic DNA thermal cycler (GeneAmp 2400, Perkin-Elmer). For NOS-I cDNA amplification, the gene-specific primers (BN-1, BN-2, and BN-3) were chosen according to Asano et al. (15Asano K. Chee C.B.E. Gaston B. Lilly C.M. Gerard C. Drazen J.M. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10089-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The cycle program was set as follow: 94°C for 30 s, 68°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s using BN-1 and BN-2 primers for 35 cycles followed by an extension step at 72°C for 7 min. Then, PCR products from BN-1 and BN-2 were reamplified using BN-2 and BN-3 primers for another 30 cycles under the same conditions. Ten μl of each final PCR product (NOS-I, 204 bp) were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel and then visualized after ethidium bromide staining. The bands so obtained were quantified with Sigma Scan/Image software (Jandel Corp.) after scanner recording from the gel photography. The mRNA for the constitutive glycerol-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was examined as the reference cellular transcript. GAPDH mRNA amplification products (195 bp) were present at equivalent levels in all cell lysates. The reaction was performed using specific primers as described elsewhere (16Genis P. Jett M. Bernton E.W. Boyle T. Gelbard H.A. Dzenko K. Keane R.W. Reswnick L. Mizrachi Y. Volsky D.J. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1703-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). As described previously, human cultured astrocytoma cells (T67) possess an inducible Ca2+-independent NO synthase (iNOS) which is stimulated time-dependently by treatments with LPS or cytokines, such as IFNƔ (9Mollace V. Colasanti M. Rodinò P. Massoud R. Lauro G.M. Nisticò G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Colasanti M. Mollace V. Cundari E. Massoud R. Nisticò G. Lauro G.M. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1993; 15: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated that the homogenates of unstimulated T67 cells also exhibit a basal NOS activity (0.68 ± 0.06 nmol mg protein-1 min-1), as determined by measuring [3H]citrulline production (Fig. 1). The elimination of free Ca2+ by EGTA (1 mM) from the mixture reaction almost totally abolished this activity (0.68 ± 0.06 to 0.012 ± 0.02 nmol mg protein-1 min-1), demonstrating that the isoform of the enzyme was a constitutive Ca2+-dependent NOS (cNOS) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, we found that a quick treatment of T67 cells with the combination of LPS (1 μg/ml) and IFNƔ (1000 units/ml) (MIX) for 30 min strongly inhibited the basal NOS activity (0.68 ± 0.06 to 0.015 ± 0.01 nmol mg protein-1 min-1), as determined in the absence of EGTA (Fig. 1). In MIX-treated T67 cells, NOS activity resulted very low also in the presence of EGTA, thus demonstrating that a 30-min MIX treatment of cells was too short to induce the Ca2+-independent NOS expression (Fig. 1). So, the inhibitory effect on cNOS activity elicited by MIX treatment might be triggered by the direct NOS modifications. The effect of LPS/IFNƔ on cNOS-dependent NO production was also confirmed by measuring nitrite, the stable breakdown product of NO (17Tracey W.R. Neuroprotocols. 1992; 1: 125-131Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in stirred T67 cells. In the supernatants of stirred unstimulated T67 cells, we have found a basal nitrite (NO2-) level (about 1.1 nmol ml-1). The latter was not abolished by NOS inhibitor L-NAME (500 μM) (data not shown), indicating that the basal level of NO2- was not due to L-arginine metabolism. Howeverthis NO2- basal level can somewhat hide the small amount of NO produced by the cNOS enzyme in untreated T67 cells. To enhance cNOS-dependent NO production, we have stimulated T67 cells with NMDA, a typical cNOS activator in the nervous system (18Garthwaite J. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 60-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar). When T67 cells were incubated with NMDA (500 μM) for 0.5, 1, and 2 h, a time-dependent increase of nitrite synthesis (above the background of ∼1.1 nmol ml-1) was observed (Fig. 2). The maximal peak was reached after 2 h of treatment (5.0 ± 0.26 nmol ml-1), and this effect was inhibited by L-NAME (500 μM) (5.0 ± 0.26 to 0.2 ± 0.1 nmol ml-1), thus demonstrating that the NMDA-increased nitrite generation was associated with the L-arginine-NO pathway (Fig. 2). As already observed, T67 cells possess a NMDA-activated NO pathway. In fact, the treatment of T67 cells with NMDA was able to increase both nerve growth factor mRNA and prostaglandin E2 levels, these effects being mediated by NO synthesis (19Persichini T. Colasanti M. Mollace V. Nisticò G. Ramacci M.T. Lauro G.M. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 2477-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 20Mollace V. Colasanti M. Rodinò P. Lauro G.M. Rotiroti D. Nisticò G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When T67 cells were preincubated with MIX for 30 min and then washed, the NMDA-induced nitrite production was significantly reduced (5.0 ± 0.26 to 1.0 ± 0.09 nmol ml-1; Fig. 2). As described previously, LPS or cytokines such as IFNƔ are able to induce a high-output NO in T67 cells (9Mollace V. Colasanti M. Rodinò P. Massoud R. Lauro G.M. Nisticò G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Colasanti M. Mollace V. Cundari E. Massoud R. Nisticò G. Lauro G.M. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1993; 15: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In fact, a 24-h stimulation of T67 cells with MIX enhanced iNOS-elicited nitrite production. On the contrary, a 30-min treatment of T67 cells with MIX alone did not affect nitrite synthesis (Fig. 2), thus demonstrating that a short MIX treatment of cells did not induce the iNOS enzyme, in agreement with the NOS activity results shown in Fig. 1. The swiftness of MIX-elicited inhibition of cNOS pathway would seem to exclude a possible involvement of cNOS mRNA transcript during the first 30 min. To verify this hypothesis, we have analyzed the effect of MIX on cNOS mRNA expression in T67 cells using the reverse transcriptase-PCR. Here, we have shown that human astrocytoma T67 cell cultures expressed constitutively mRNA coding for the neuronal NOS-I isoform (Fig. 3). As expected, the reverse transcriptase-PCR NOS-I product consisted of a 204-bp fragment amplified using brain NOS-specific primers (BN-1, BN-2, and BN-3), as described elsewhere (15Asano K. Chee C.B.E. Gaston B. Lilly C.M. Gerard C. Drazen J.M. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10089-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In agreement with those authors, the first PCR product from BN-1 and BN-2 primers was reamplified by using BN-2 and BN-3 primers. A higher specificity of NOS-I sequence amplification was derived from the use of the BN-3 primer, which was chosen inside the first fragment from BN-1 and BN-2 primers. Our finding is supported by the recent study of Kugler and Drenckhahn (21Kugler P. Drenckhahn D. Glia. 1996; 16: 165-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which provides immunocytochemical evidence of NOS-I in rat astrocytes, as well as in Bergmann glia. When 1 × 106 T67 cells were incubated with MIX for 30 min, no inhibition of NOS-I mRNA expression was observed (Fig. 3), thereby demonstrating that MIX-elicited inhibition of the Ca2+-dependent NO production was not due to modifications of cNOS mRNA transcription. These findings were confirmed by further experiments carried out using different decreasing template concentrations. In all experiments, untreated and MIX-treated T67 cells showed no significant differences (data not shown). Some mechanisms explaining the fast inhibitory effect on cNOS enzyme have already been described. As an example, phosphorylation of NOS-I and NOS-III by protein kinase C, which is activated by immunologically active substances including endotoxin, is associated with a reduction of the enzymatic activity (22Nakane M. Mitchell J. Forstermann U. Murad F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Bredt D.S. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hirata K. Kuroda R. Sakoda T. Katayama M. Inoue N. Suematsu M. Kawashima S. Yokoyama M. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 180-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, endotoxin directly inhibits agonist (bradikinin and ADP)-mediated NO production from endothelial cells by affecting cytosolic free Ca2+ mobilization mechanisms leading, in turn, to subsequent decreases in the activity of NOS-III (25Graier W.F. Myers P.R. Rubin L.J. Adams H.R. Parker J.L. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 659-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our results provide evidence that LPS and IFNƔ were able to inhibit NO production in a very short time, by affecting cNOS activity but not cNOS mRNA expression. On the other hand, LPS/cytokines also induce iNOS gene, by quick activation of the transcriptional factor NF-κB (8Colasanti M. Persichini T. Menegazzi M. Mariotto S. Giordano E. Caldarera C.M. Sogos V. Lauro G.M. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26731-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, the early presence of physiological concentrations of NO can keep the iNOS expression suppressed by preventing NF-κB activation (8Colasanti M. Persichini T. Menegazzi M. Mariotto S. Giordano E. Caldarera C.M. Sogos V. Lauro G.M. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26731-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, a very fast reduction of the cNOS-generated NO levels below a threshold value could explain how LPS/cytokines are able to provide the best conditions for NF-κB activation and subsequent iNOS induction. Note that inflammatory stimuli such as LPS/IFNƔ have already been reported to trigger endothelial cells to switch from constitutive to inducible NO synthase activity (26MacNaul K.L. Hutchinson N.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1330-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 27Walter R. Schaffner A. Schoedon G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 450-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In conclusion, a novel concept may be introduced that the presence of cNOS isoform in astrocytes, as well as in other cell types possessing both cNOS and iNOS, may have a functional implication as a controller of the iNOS induction, this being consistent with a protective role of physiological NO.

During viral assembly, these enzymes are synthesized as precursor proteins that undergo autoproteolytic processing. One of the natural substrates is the viral assembly protein, which in the case of HSV-1 is known as ICP35. ICP35 is critical for the construction of intermediate viral capsids within the infected cell nucleus, and it is processed by the viral protease prior to DNA entry into the capsids. The other natural substrate is the protease precursor protein. The HSV-1 protease catalytic domain is localized in the N terminus of the precursor, which encompasses the N-terminal 247 amino acids of the 635-amino acid precursor protein (9Gibson W. Roizman B. J.

The herpesvirus proteases have been classified as serine proteases based on chemical reactivity toward classical serine protease inhibitors and site-directed mutagenesis data (12DiIanni C.L. Drier D.A. Deckman I.C. McCann III, P.J. Liu F. Roizman B. Colonno R.J. Cordingley M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2048-2051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Welch A.R. McNally L.M.

In the case of the HSV-1 protease, antichaotropic cosolvents (also known as kosmotropes) increase the specific activity as much as 200-fold. Accompanying the activity changes are spectral changes of the protein indicating an altered conformation or aggregation state (15Yamanaka G. DiIanni C.L. O'Boyle II, D.R. Stevens J. Weinheimer S.P.

For the hCMV protease, marked activity increase is observed with the use of glycerol (5Burck P.J. Berg D.H. Luk T.P. Sassmannshausen L.M. Wakulchik M. Smith D.P. Hsiung H.M. Becker G.W. Gibson W. Villarreal E.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2937-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is now known that the hCMV protease is only active when in a dimeric state, that the dissociation constant is in the micromolar range, and that glycerol or high enzyme concentrations favor the dimer formation (17Darke P.L.

This report identifies the activation of HSV-1 protease as similar to that of the hCMV protease with the demonstration that the active form of the HSV-1 protease is a dimer and that the activating antichaotropes promote the dimeric state. The unification of HSV-1 and hCMV protease activation phenomena as dimerization suggest that it is a common mechanism for the proteases of the herpes family of viruses. Aggregation as a prerequisite of activity may be more common than previously appreciated for the serine proteases. The expression and purification of HSV-1 protease was performed as described previously (19Darke P.L. Chen E. Hall D.L. Sardana M.K. Veloski C.A. LaFemina R.L. Shafer J.A. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18708-18711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the purification protocol modifications as later described (16Hall D.L. Darke P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22697-22700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Assays were performed with the peptide substrate AGHTYLQASEKFKMWG, which HSV-1 protease cleaves between alanine and serine. The substrate was obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA) and was used at 158 μM in all assays. The product SEKFKMWG was quantified on HPLC using fluorescence detection of the tryptophan residue. The buffer common to all assays, preincubations, and chromatography consisted of 52 mM MES, 52 mM TAPSO, 100 mM diethanolamine, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. Sodium phosphate or sodium citrate were included in some assays as indicated in the text. Activity assays were reactions of 60 s and were quenched with urea to a final concentration of 3 M. For all solvent conditions used in specific activity measurements, the enzymic reaction progress curves were shown to be linear for at least 2 min. The dimer dissociation constants (Kd) derived from kinetic measurements were from fits of the equation vobs=vd⋅[E]t−[M][E]t to the data, where vd is the velocity for dimers, [E]t is the total concentration of enzyme (in monomer equivalents), and [M] is the concentration of monomers. The value of [M] is given by[M]=12−Kd2+Kd24+2Kd⋅[E]t0.5(Eq. 2) and is derived from the equilibrium condition Kd=2⋅[M]2[E]t−[M](Eq. 3) The adjustable parameters during curve-fitting were Kd and vd. Repeated measurements of the Kd were made at various times after dilution of the enzyme to ensure that equilibrium was achieved. In general, Kd measurements were unchanged after 3 h of equilibration under all conditions. A Pharmacia Superdex 75 column (300 × 10 mm) was used immersed in a controlled temperature water bath and connected to a manual injection valve immersed in the same bath with only the injection port exposed. Chromatography was at 5°C in pH 7.5 buffer containing 20% glycerol and 0.4 M sodium citrate, pH 7.5. Sample volumes injected were 100 μl. Detection of eluting HSV-1 protease was by monitoring of absorbance (280 nm) and fluorescence (excitation 280 nm, emission 350 nm). The peak shapes and sizes obtained were unchanged for samples preincubated at 15°C from 1 to 8 h. Column buffers were degassed with and maintained under helium. Proteins used for molecular mass standardization were bovine serum albumin (64 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). When eluting HSV-1 protease peaks were collected for assay, the column effluent was not directed through the spectral monitors in order to avoid warming of the samples. Fractions were manually collected in ice-chilled tubes according to predetermined elution times. A small volume of substrate was added to initiate the activity assay. After 30 min, the assay was quenched, and the accumulated product was quantified on HPLC. The dilution of enzyme that occurs during chromatography necessitated the use of a 30-min assay to achieve product levels at least 10-fold higher than background. Following a fractionation, the monitor was reconnected, and the original sample was injected again to confirm the constancy of the elution times. The specific activity of HSV-1 protease was dependent upon enzyme concentration, as shown in Fig. 1. The data shown are indicative of a protomer-oligomer equilibrium in which the oligomer was more active. To assess the rate at which this equilibrium was established, activity as a function of time after a large dilution was examined under a variety of solvent conditions and temperatures. As exemplified by the data shown in Fig. 2, HSV-1 protease activity declined following a dilution of the enzyme from 10 μM to 100 nM. At 5°C the activity was most stable, while at 15°C and 20°C, an approach to a new lower level of activity was apparent within minutes and was nearly complete at 2 h. These kinetic profiles of activity subsequent to dilution were consistent with the notion of a more active oligomer slowly dissociating to less active protomers.Fig. 2Stability of HSV-1 protease activity following dilution. A stock solution of HSV-1 protease at 10 μM was diluted to 100 nM, and the resulting solution, containing 20% glycerol and 0.4 M sodium citrate, was sampled periodically for assay. Temperatures employed were 5 (•), 15 (▴), and 20 (▪)°C. The assay time was 60 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Size-exclusion chromatography was employed to determine the aggregation states of HSV-1 protease that might contribute to the kinetic behavior described above. The choice of conditions for the chromatography was aided by the stability data shown in Fig. 2, which indicate that a low temperature such as 5°C was needed to minimize re-equilibration of enzyme forms during chromatography. Size-exclusion chromatography at 5°C of an HSV-1 protease sample that was pre-equilibrated for 3 h at 15°C revealed 2 different size species, as shown in Fig. 3. The elution volumes of the two peaks labeled b and a in Fig. 3A correspond to molecular weights of 21,000 and 55,000, respectively. Given the theoretical molecular weight of 27,065 for the 247-amino acid protein, these peaks correspond to monomer and dimer forms of the enzyme. We noted that resolution of these peaks was dependent upon the temperature and solvent used for the column, so that higher temperatures or the omission of citrate from the chromatography buffer produced elution patterns where the dimer peak merges into the monomer 2The column used successfully for our previous study of hCMV protease aggregation state (17Darke P.L.

When the enzyme was incubated prior to chromatography in buffer lacking glycerol or citrate, it was predominantly monomeric, as shown in Fig. 3A Inclusion of 20% glycerol in the enzyme sample during incubation induced the formation of a small proportion of dimer (peak a). The activating anions phosphate and citrate gave increasing proportions of dimer, as shown in Fig. 3, panels B and C Citrate was more effective than phosphate in shifting the equilibrium toward dimer. The eluted peaks from size-exclusion chromatography were assayed for HSV-1 protease activity. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The dimeric enzyme (fractions a1 and a2) was more active than the monomer (b1 and b2). In addition, the lack of baseline resolution between monomer and dimer means that there was some dimer contribution to the activity observed in fractions b1 and b2, and that the intrinsic activity of the monomer was even less than that shown in Fig. 4. Given the physical demonstration of a monomer-dimer equilibrium and the large difference in observed activity for the two forms of the enzyme, a kinetic model can be proposed to describe the dependence of specific activity upon enzyme concentration. In the model, the monomeric enzyme is inactive, and all activity is due to dimers. Hence, the concentration of active dimers is a function of the total enzyme concentration and the dimer dissociation constant Kd (see “Materials and Methods” and “Discussion”). Data for the enzyme concentration dependence of specific activity are well represented by this model, as can be seen by the satisfying fit of the model to the data in Fig. 1. Different solvent conditions were examined for effect on the Kd with the experimental approach illustrated in Fig. 1. In a buffer containing 20% glycerol without phosphate or citrate, the Kd is too high to measure (>1600 nM). Addition of phosphate or citrate to 0.2 M lowers the Kd to around 1000 nM, and higher concentrations of these activating anions lower the Kd further. Citrate was more effective than phosphate for stabilization of dimers according to this kinetic analysis. Under all solvent conditions examined, the model fit the data with an agreement similar to that shown in Fig. 1. These results are summarized in Table I. Enzyme partially inactivated by dilution into a low concentration of citrate can be restored to a higher level of activity by the addition of more citrate or phosphate, suggesting that irreversible processes were not responsible for the trends observed here (data not shown).Table I.Dimer dissociation constants for HSV-1 protease as a function of solventSalt addedAdditive concentrationKdMaximal specific activityMnMnmol min−1 mg−1None>1600NDaNot determined.Sodium phosphate0.21040480.4704610.567969Sodium citrate0.2964500.4240530.522557a Not determined. Open table in a new tab Initial reports of antichaotrope (kosmotrope) activation of the HSV-1 protease suggested that a change in the physical state of the enzyme, as indicated by spectral changes, is coincident with activation (15Yamanaka G.

Here we present kinetic and physical data consistent with dimerization being the activating physical event. Size-exclusion chromatography demonstrates the existence of two forms of the HSV-1 protease, identified as monomer and dimer on the basis of apparent molecular weights (Fig. 3). This finding is qualitatively the same as found for the related hCMV protease (17Darke P.L. Cole J.L. Waxman L. Hall D.L. Sardana M.K. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7445-7449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). An important difference is the more facile re-equilibration of HSV-1 protease monomer and dimer forms as compared to the hCMV protease. Size-exclusion chromatography of the HSV-1 protease performed with solvent conditions used previously for the hCMV protease (10°C, 20% glycerol, 17Darke P.L. Cole J.L. Waxman L. Hall D.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7445-7449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) produces a broad peak, not resolving the monomer and dimer forms (data not shown). A temperature of 5°C and the addition of 0.4 M sodium citrate to the column buffer were necessary to observe resolution of the HSV-1 protease monomer and dimer. Despite these additional measures to slow re-equilibration of an injected sample, column flow rates of 0.25, 0.30, and 0.35 ml min−1 produce slightly different monomer-dimer ratios for a single sample, indicating that some re-equilibration of enzyme forms occurs during the chromatography (data not shown). In contrast to the previous study of hCMV protease, therefore, quantitative comparison of kinetic and chromatographic Kd determinations is not possible. Nonetheless, size-exclusion chromatography used here as a qualitative measure of dimerization provides data completely consistent with interpretation of the kinetics. The use of low temperature for chromatography, fraction collection, and assay enabled the direct demonstration that the dimer is the active form of the HSV-1 protease (Fig. 4). The temperature of 0°C for assays of the eluted fractions minimizes possible monomer-dimer re-equilibration during assays, although the 30-min assay time required to observe significant activity of the dilute fractions may have allowed substrate-induced dimerization to occur during the reaction, contributing to the activity seen in the monomer fractions. Substrate-induced dimerization is known to occur with hCMV protease (17Darke P.L. Cole J.L. Waxman L. Hall D.L. Sardana M.K. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7445-7449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Additional activity in the monomer peak is contributed by a dimer not fully resolved from the monomer peak. A simple model to describe the activity of the HSV-1 protease is depicted in Scheme 1 below. M+M-KdDD+S-KsD⋅S-kcatD+P1+P2D+Skcat/KMD+P1+P2 Catalytic activity arises solely from dimeric enzyme in this scheme. While we cannot rule out a very low level of monomeric enzyme catalytic activity, the data are consistent with the monomer contribution being negligible. Use of this scheme for the kinetic determination of dissociation constants Kd under a range of conditions demonstrates the correlation of dimer formation with activation by antichaotropes (Table I). The parallel increases in dimer proportion seen with size-exclusion chromatography complete a self-consistent body of evidence for antichaotrope activation by dimerization (Fig. 3). Activating antichaotrope influence on the kcat and Km remains to be critically evaluated with consideration of the physical changes in the enzyme outlined here. The Kd for the HSV-1 protease dimer is near 1 μM, similar in magnitude to reported values for the hCMV protease (17Darke P.L. Cole J.L. Waxman L. Hall D.L. Sardana M.K. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7445-7449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The relative stability of these two enzymes is, however, markedly different considering the conditions under which the dissociation constants are known. The use of 15°C and the addition of an activator was necessary to slow down dissociation of the HSV-1 protease in activity measurements to the point where meaningful measurements could be performed, while 30°C assays were readily analyzed for dimerization in the hCMV study. Many viral proteases, despite diverse origin and chemical mechanism, are now known to require an association event to attain maximum activity. Dimerization is absolutely required for the activity of retroviral proteases, and the strength of subunit association is a factor critical for appropriate retrovirus assembly (20Meek T.D. Dayton B.D.

https://openalex.org/W1986212634,"Three endogenous molecules have now been shown to release Ca2+ in the sea urchin egg: inositol trisphosphate (InsP3), cyclic adenosine 5′-diphosphate ribose (cADPR), and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), a derivative of NADP. While the mechanism through which the first two molecules are able to release Ca2+ is established and well characterized with InsP3 and cADPR-activating InsP3 and ryanodine receptors, respectively, the newly described NAADP has been shown to release Ca2+ via an entirely different mechanism. The most striking feature of this novel Ca2+ release mechanism is its inactivation, since subthreshold concentrations of NAADP are able to fully and irreversibly desensitize the channel. In the present study we have investigated the fast kinetics of activation and inactivation of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release. NAADP was found to release Ca2+ in a biphasic manner, and such release was preceded by a pronounced latent period, which was inversely dependent on concentration. Moreover, the kinetic features of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release were not altered by pretreatment with low concentrations of NAADP, although the extent of Ca2+ release was greatly affected. Our data suggest that the inactivation of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release is an all-or-none phenomenon, and while some receptors have been fully inactivated, those that remain sensitive to NAADP do so without any change in kinetic features.

The latter are activated by a pyridine nucleotide metabolite, cyclic adenosine 5′-diphosphate ribose (cADPR) (2Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B. Science. 1991; 253: 1143-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Recently, a third distinct Ca2+ release mechanism has been identified that is potently and selectively activated by a different pyridine nucleotide, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) (3Chini E.N.

NAADP-induced Ca2+ release can be induced both in the intact egg by microinjection and from microsomes of egg homogenates (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release induced by NAADP is not blocked by heparin, a selective inhibitor of InsP3 receptors, nor by 8-amino-cADPR, a selective inhibitor of the cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ release (3Chini E.N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Moreover, NAADP does not cross-desensitize with either InsP3 nor cADPR, showing that it induces Ca2+ release via a mechanism independent of InsP3Rs and RyRs (3Chini E.N. Beers K.W. Dousa T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3216-3223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol.

For example, NAADP-induced Ca2+ release is blocked by L-type Ca2+ channel blockers such as nifedipine and diltiazem, which have no effect on either of the other two Ca2+ release mechanisms in the sea urchin egg homogenates (6Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ store, unlike cADPR- and InsP3-sensitive stores, is insensitive to thapsigargin and cyclopiazoic acid, suggesting that the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanism resides on a distinct intracellular organelle (7Genazzani A.A.

A unique feature of the NAADP-induced Ca2+ release is that it can be selectively inactivated by subthreshold concentrations of this molecule, which per se do not cause Ca2+ release (6Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 8Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this unusual form of desensitization is unclear. However, the binding of NAADP cannot be displaced when microsomes are pretreated with [32P]NAADP and then challenged with a high concentration of NAADP after 3 min (8Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), perhaps indicating that treatment with nonstimulating concentrations of NAADP results in a conformational change of the receptor occluding further association and dissociation of NAADP binding. Recent reports have indicated that mammalian cells possess the metabolic machinery to regulate intracellular levels of NAADP and therefore possibly utilize it as an intracellular messenger. NAADP can be synthesized in cell extracts from β-NADP in the presence of nicotinic acid in various rat tissues, including brain, liver, and spleen (9Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that ADP-ribosyl cyclase, the enzyme responsible for the cyclization of NAD+ to cADPR, and CD38, a lymphocyte differentiation antigen, can also synthesize NAADP (10Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The regulation of this class of enzymes is still unclear, but it appears that NAADP is synthesized in the presence of β-NADP and nicotinic acid at more acidic pH, while cADPR is produced in the presence of β-NAD at more neutral pH values (10Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated the transient kinetics of the NAADP-induced Ca2+ release mechanism in the sea urchin egg homogenates and compared it with the transient kinetics of the InsP3-sensitive and cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ release. Such approach can lead to further understanding of the similarities and differences between these release mechanisms and to provide information on the activation and inactivation mechanisms of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release. NAADP-induced Ca2+ release is composed of a fast and a slow phase, which can be described by two rate constants. Similar biexponential equations can also fit InsP3-induced and cADPR-induced Ca2+ release. NAADP triggers Ca2+ release after a pronounced latency inversely dependent on the concentration of NAADP, while no latency is present before InsP3- and cADPR-induced Ca2+ release. Desensitization by subthreshold concentrations of NAADP does not affect either of the rate constants, but affects the magnitude of release. This finding suggests that NAADP desensitization proceeds in an all-or-none manner, with inactivation affecting a subpopulation of receptors while others are unaffected. Eggs were obtained by stimulating ovulation of female Lytechinus pictus (Marinus, Inc., Long Beach, CA) with a intracoelomic injection of KCl. These were then washed twice in artificial sea water (NaCl, 435 mM; MgCl2, 40 mM; MgSO4, 15 mM; CaCl2, 11 mM; KCl, 10 mM; NaHCO3, 2.5 mM; EDTA, 1.0 mM at pH 8.0) and jelly removed by filtration through 90-μm nylon mesh. Homogenates (2.5%) of unfertilized Lytechinus pictus eggs were prepared as described previously (11Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ loading was achieved by incubation at room temperature for 3 h in an intracellular medium (IM) consisting of potassium gluconate, 250 mM; N-methylglucamine, 250 mM; Hepes, 20 mM (pH 7.2); MgCl2, 1 mM; ATP, 0.5 mM; phosphocreatine, 10 mM; creatine phosphokinase, 10 units/ml; oligomycin, 1 mg/ml; antimycin, 1 mg/ml; sodium azide, 1 mM; fluo-3, 3 mM. Free Ca2+ concentration was measured by monitoring fluorescence intensity at excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 535 nm, respectively. Fluorimetry was performed at 17°C using 500 μl of homogenate in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorimeter. Additions were made in 5-μl volume, and all chemicals were added in IM containing 10 μM EGTA. Basal concentrations of Ca2+ were typically between 100 and 150 nM. Sequestered Ca2+ was determined by monitoring decrease in fluo-3 fluorescence during microsomal loading and by measuring Ca2+ release in response to ionomycin (5 μM) and was constant between experiments. Microsomes were purified from 50% egg homogenates by the Percoll density centrifugation method described previously (11Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, a fractionating buffer was prepared by diluting Percoll stock to 25% in a modified intracellular medium (333 mM N-methylglucamine, 333 mM potassium acetate, 27 mM Hepes, 1.3 mM MgCl2, pH titrated to 7.2 with acetic acid). This was then supplemented with 0.5 mM ATP, 2 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 4 mM phosphocreatine, 10 μM EGTA. 1 ml of 50% egg homogenate was layered on 9 ml of this solution and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 15°C. The top fraction (1 ml) was collected and represented the supernatant fraction. The Ca2+-storing, cADPR- and InsP3-sensitive microsomes formed a distinct tight band half way down the tube. 1 ml of this was collected using a disposable syringe to puncture the vessel wall. The fractions were aliquoted and stored at −70°C until use. Rapid kinetics of Ca2+ release by InsP3, cADPR, and NAADP were carried out on 2.5% homogenate prepared as described above. Stopped-flow measurements were performed as described elsewhere (12Champeil P. Combettes L. Berthon B. Doucet E. Orlowski S. Claret M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 17665-17673Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 13Meyer T. Wensel T. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Mezna M. Michelangeli F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28097-28102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ca2+-loaded homogenate was introduced in a 2.5-ml syringe of a stopped-flow fluorimeter (Applied Photophysics, model SX17 MV), while a 250-μl syringe was filled with either IM, InsP3, or NAADP (diluted in IM) at a concentration 10 times the concentration desired in the mixing chamber, as the mixing ratios of the two syringes were 10:1. Temperature of homogenate in either the syringes or mixing compartment was maintained at 17°C by a circulating water bath. Fluorescence changes of fluo-3 were monitored with an exciting the sample at 490 nm and measuring the emission above 515 nm. Fluo-3 fluorescence was captured over 55 s in a split-time base mode, with 200 recordings taken in the first 5 s and 200 recordings taken in the remaining 50 s. Each experiment represents the average of at least six acquisitions. The averaged traces were then analyzed using nonlinear regression analysis programs supplied by Applied photophysics and Biosoft. The progress of Ca2+ release from at least three different homogenate preparations used in this study were shown to be biphasic and could be best fitted to a biexponential profile using the following equation, [Ca2+]release=A1(1-exp-k1t)+A2(1-exp-k2t)(Eq. 1) where A1, A2, k1, and k2 are the amplitudes and rate constants of Ca2+ release for the fast and slow phases, respectively, and t is the time (seconds). The amplitudes A1 and A2 are expressed in arbitrary units and relate to the fluorescence intensity changes of fluo-3. Since the fluo-3 signal in these experiments was never saturating, these units are related to Ca2+ changes. In experiments where NAADP was used, Ca2+ release was preceded by a latency or lag phase. This latency was quantified and then subtracted prior to further analysis of the Ca2+ release process. In a control experiment the effect of the Ca2+ pumps responsible for the re-uptake of Ca2+ in these preparations were also quantified, and the rate constants of the uptake were essentially negligible compared with Ca2+ release by either InsP3, cADPR, or NAADP. In fact, the rate constant for Ca2+ was 0.0008 ± 0.000004 s−1, while the rate constants observed for Ca2+ release were at least 30 times faster. NAADP was either purchased from Research Biochemicals International (St. Albans, United Kingdom (UK)) or was a kind gift of Prof. T. F. Walseth (University of Minnesota), fluo-3 was from Molecular Probes (Cambridge, UK). All other chemicals were from Sigma (Poole, UK). NAADP released Ca2+ dose-dependently with an EC50 of 25 ± 5 nM (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, NAADP, 3 nM, which per se induced only a negligible release, was able to desensitize the mechanism to a subsequent addition of a maximal concentration of NAADP (200 nM) (Fig. 1C; see also 6Genazzani A.A.

Performing experiments at 7°C did not alter significantly the extent of Ca2+ release nor the extent of inactivation (Fig. 1). If quantal release, first described for the InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, is defined by the observation that submaximal concentrations of mobilizing agent can rapidly release Ca2+ from the Ca2+ stores without affecting their ability to respond to further maximal concentrations of the same agent (15Bootman M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2086-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (incremental detection), NAADP does not release Ca2+ in a quantal manner. It therefore appears either quantal Ca2+ release, which has been also described for the ryanodine receptors (18Cheek T.R. Moreton R.B. Berridge M.J. Stauderman K.A. Murawsky M.M. Bootman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27076-27083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is not central in the operation of all intracellular Ca2+ channels or that incremental detection is not necessarily associated with quantal release. To investigate the fast kinetics of the Ca2+ fluxes activated by NAADP, InsP3, or cADPR, we have employed stopped-flow analysis, with a temporal resolution of 25 ms. In the present experiments Ca2+ pump inhibitors have not been used for two reasons: (i) the rate of Ca2+ uptake in our preparations was at least 30 times slower than the slower Ca2+ release parameter examined and therefore negligible (see also “Materials and Methods”); (ii) NAADP-induced Ca2+ release is known to be affected differently from cADPR and InsP3 by Ca2+ uptake inhibitors (e.g it is insensitive to thapsigargin and cyclopiazoic acid) (7Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). When NAADP, InsP3, or cADPR were added to the homogenate, it resulted in an increased fluorescence signal representing Ca2+ release (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Supramaximal concentrations of NAADP (1 μM) (6Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) released Ca2+ with a t1/2 of 11.2 ± 1.0 s. Supramaximal concentrations of cADPR (3 μM) (6Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) released Ca2+ with a t1/2 of 6.5 ± 0.9 s. In comparison, addition of maximal InsP3 concentrations (10 μM) (6Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) resulted in a more rapid Ca2+ release, with a t1/2 of 2.7 ± 0.8 s. InsP3-induced Ca2+ release appears slower to that observed in cerebellar microsomes, where maximal InsP3 concentrations release Ca2+ with a t1/2 of less than a second (14Mezna M. Michelangeli F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28097-28102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This difference may well reflect the relative abundance of InsP3-sensitive channels in the two systems.Fig. 3Kinetics of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release.

A.U. = arbitrary fluorescence units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An important and consistent feature of the NAADP-induced Ca2+ release was that low concentrations of NAADP did not release Ca2+ instantly, but rather a pronounced latency period was observed prior to release (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). This latent period had a duration of up to several seconds and was found to be inversely dependent on the concentration of NAADP used (Fig. 5). However, at higher NAADP concentrations (3 and 10 μM), Ca2+ release was not preceded by a detectable latency (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). In contrast, no lag phase was observed with any concentration of InsP3 (Fig. 3) This is in agreement with most reports on the fast kinetics of the InsP3 receptor (14Mezna M. Michelangeli F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28097-28102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and consistent with direct gating of InsP3Rs by InsP3, although a lag phase has been reported for InsP3-induced Ca2+ release in rat basophilic leukemia cells (13Meyer T. Wensel T. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). cADPR was also not preceded by a lag phase. To investigate whether this lag phase was due to the conversion of NAADP to an active metabolite, stopped-flow experiments were performed at 7°C. If an enzymatic conversion was responsible for the latency, then lowering the temperature should prolong the lag phase. The lag phases at both 7 and 17°C did not markedly differ at all concentrations tested (Fig. 4). Moreover, NAADP was able to release Ca2+ to the same extent in both conditions (Fig. 1). It therefore seems unlikely that an enzymatic conversion is responsible for the observed latency and that Ca2+ pumps affect release in this system. The marked lag phase observed could be dependent on the requirement of a modulatory protein to bind the NAADP receptor. To investigate this possibility, fluorimetric determinations of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release under various conditions were performed. In Percoll-purified microsomes, which should lack soluble cytosolic proteins, NAADP still released Ca2+, although to a minor extent in respect to the 2.5% homogenate. Unlike cADPR-sensitive Ca2+ stores, NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores are not all contained in this microsomal fraction (4Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and the minor extent of release observed is most likely due to this observation. Addition of calmodulin (1 μM) did not affect NAADP-induced Ca2+ release in microsomes, in contrast to the potentiating effect that it has on cADPR-induced Ca2+ release (19Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Addition of FK506 (10 μM) and rapamycin (10 μM), which are known to affect Ca2+-releasing mechanisms by inhibiting modulatory proteins associated with RyRs and InsP3Rs (20Jayaraman T. Brillantes A.-M. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9474-9477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not affect NAADP-induced Ca2+ release significantly. Moreover, the reconstitution of the preparation with 2.5% supernatant, only slightly enhanced the total amount of Ca2+ released by NAADP (120 ± 12% compared with controls). Ca2+ release by NAADP is also unaffected by preincubation of 2.5% homogenate with cholesteryl hemisuccinate (5 mM), an agent which rigidifies membranes and slows down protein movement in the membrane (21Lazar D.F. Medzihradsky F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1135-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 22Tovey S. Mezna M. Michelangeli F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 429SCrossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that modulatory proteins are unlikely to be involved in the opening of the channel, although the possibility of a closely associated uncharacterized modulatory protein cannot presently be ruled out. The observed lag phase could also be due to the presence of one or more slow temperature-insensitive limiting steps prior to channel opening. NAADP-induced Ca2+ release was best fitted to a biexponential function (see Fig. 6 for an example) as defined by the equation given above as were InsP3- and cADPR-induced Ca2+ release. A monoexponential process proved to be completely unsatisfactory in all three cases cases. On the other hand, the Ca2+ release process that followed addition of low concentrations of cADPR (below 50 nM) could not be fitted to any standard mathematical fit routinely employed. The pattern of Ca2+ release induced by low concentrations of cADPR appeared sigmoidal, with the rate of release slowly increasing throughout the first few seconds of release. This can be explained by the regulatory role that cADPR plays on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (2Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B. Science. 1991; 253: 1143-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). It is possible that at low concentrations of cADPR, the early events of Ca2+ release potentiate further Ca2+ release. Rate constants for both the fast and slow phases of Ca2+ release induced by NAADP, InsP3, and cADPR were comparable in value at saturating concentrations of agonists used (for 10 μM NAADP the fast rate constant was 0.42 s−1 and the slow rate constant was 0.04 s−1; for 10 μM InsP3 the fast and slow rate constants were 0.40 and 0.08 s−1, respectively, and for 5 μM cADPR the fast and slow rate constants were 0.45 and 0.05 s−1, respectively; Figs. 2, 3, 4). The InsP3- and cADPR-induced Ca2+ release rate constants increased with concentration reaching a maximum at around 1 μM (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The increases in the rate constants appear to closely follow the trend in increase in amplitude. Unlike in cerebellar microsomes (14Mezna M. Michelangeli F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28097-28102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the slow rate constant for InsP3 was responsible for most Ca2+ release. This was also observed for NAADP-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 2). However, for NAADP-induced Ca2+ release, the slow rate constant was concentration-insensitive, although the extent of Ca2+ release by this phase increased steadily with increasing concentrations of NAADP. This finding is difficult to rationalize. The most likely explanation is that a fine balance exists between the activation and inactivation of this receptor. Since the EC50 for inactivation is ∼100-fold lower than for activation, at low concentrations a high proportion of receptors will be desensitized without being activated. Increasing concentrations of NAADP will increase the probability that the receptors will activate before inactivating and increase the amplitude of release. As shown in Fig. 7 (for text see below), partial inactivation modifies the amplitude but not the kinetic parameters and therefore this model is plausible. In contrast, the fast rate constant increased with increasing concentrations of NAADP, but the extent of Ca2+ release appeared to plateau at 100 nM and contributed no more than 25% of the overall release. Experiments conducted at 7°C did not substantially alter NAADP-induced Ca2+ release, although the slow rate constant decreased by approximately 30% (data not shown). The presence of two kinetic components can suggest that NAADP releases Ca2+ from two populations of Ca2+ stores with different Ca2+-accumulating capacities, which would account for the two phases. Another hypothesis is that in our homogenate preparation the majority of vescicles sensitive to NAADP have a low proportion of NAADP channels, which account for the slow phase of Ca2+ release, but a few vescicles contain a high proportion of NAADP receptors. With increasing concentrations of NAADP a higher proportion of receptors on this latter population of vescicles is activated and therefore Ca2+ fluxes are faster.Fig. 7Kinetics of the inactivation of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release by minute concentrations of NAADP. The top panel shows representative stopped-flow fluorimetric traces. Homogenates were pretreated for 15 min with picomolar concentrations of NAADP, placed in the stopped-flow syringe, and challenged with NAADP, 200 nM. Pretreatment NAADP concentrations were from top to bottom: 0, 25 pM, 50 pM, 100 pM, 300 pM. The bottom panels show the rate constants and amplitudes of the slow (filled squares) and fast (open circles) phases of Ca2+ release. A.U. = arbitrary fluorescence units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cooperativity of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release was assessed for the fast rate constants and found to have a Hill coefficient of 1.1, suggesting that either only one binding site is involved in Ca2+ release, of that if multiple sites are present they act independently of each other in influencing Ca2+ channel activity. In comparison, it has been demonstrated previously that cADPR-induced Ca2+ release in sea urchin eggs is a cooperative process with a Hill coefficient of approximately 1.8 (23Xu Y. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2815-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We then examined the kinetic properties of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release after partial desensitization with lower concentrations of NAADP. When this was performed, the magnitude of Ca2+ release by maximal concentrations of NAADP was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7). Interestingly, both the fast and slow rate constants were unaffected by the pretreatment with low desensitizing concentrations of NAADP (Fig. 7). One possibility is that inactivation occurs in an all-or-none manner, with submaximal inactivating concentrations of NAADP causing the full inactivation of a proportion of receptors. Increasing the magnitude of the pretreatment, this proportion of inactivated receptors would progressively increase. In such a way, while a proportion of the receptors has been shifted to the desensitized form by the pretreatment, the active ones preserved the kinetic characteristics expressed by the control. In conclusion, NAADP-induced Ca2+ release, although distinct, shows some common kinetic features with the established Ca2+-releasing molecule InsP3. Both release Ca2+ in a biphasic manner and with similar rate constants. In both cases the slow phase of release is responsible for the majority of Ca2+ release. NAADP, unlike InsP3, releases Ca2+ after a latency. Furthermore, NAADP-induced Ca2+ release appears not to be cooperative. Moreover, NAADP inactivation is most likely an intrinsic all-or-none property of the receptor. In fact, partial inactivation does not alter the kinetic properties of the release, although it alters the amplitude, which suggests that the number of receptors responding has diminished but the active receptors have not been altered by pretreatment.

https://openalex.org/W2052795682,"Growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) is believed to be palmitoylated near the N terminus and the modification is assumed to be involved in the membrane anchoring of the protein. However, GAP-43 isolated from bovine brain is not palmitoylated as shown by mass spectrometric analysis, but still retains the ability to bind phospholipids, suggesting that other parts of the molecule are involved in the interaction. Upon addition of acidic phospholipids, purified GAP-43 showed a conformational change from random coil to alpha-helix as indicated by a change in CD spectra. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the calmodulin-binding domain showed a similar conformational change from random coil to alpha-helix in the presence of various acidic phospholipids. These results suggest that the calmodulin-binding domain of GAP-43 is directly involved in the GAP-43-membrane interaction and undergoes a conformational change upon binding to phospholipid membranes. After phosphorylation by protein kinase C, the phospholipid-induced conformational changes were no longer observed. Structural characteristics of the calmodulin-binding domain peptide in aqueous and hydrophobic solvents were further studied in detail by two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance. The results obtained suggest that the domain assumes a nascent alpha-helical structure in aqueous solution, which is stabilized under hydrophobic environments."

We are interested in developing small peptides that are specific for each integrin as a tool for investigating ligand-integrin interactions and as an agent for therapeutic uses. Recently, many small peptides containing the RGD sequence have been synthesized, and their specificity toward integrins has been examined (7Ruggeri Z.M. Houghten R.A. Russell S.R. Zimmerman T.S.

However, it has also been reported that some RGD peptides with a cyclic structure show relatively high specificity (16Peishoff C.E. Ali F.E. Bean J.W. Calvo R. D'Ambrosio C.A. Eggleston D.S. Hwang S.M. Kline T.P. Koster P.F. Nichols A. Powers D. Romoff T. Samanen J.M. Stadel J. Vasko J.A. Kopple K.D. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3962-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Cheng S.

Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the three-dimensional structure of the RGD site itself and/or its flanking regions are very important for the ligand binding specificity, because cyclic peptides have very rigid structure and their three-dimensional structures are considerably fixed. It is also suggested that the α subunit, the critical difference between both integrins, is associated with such a ligand binding specificity. This idea is supported by the results of experiments in which a decapeptide from the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen γ-chain was relatively specific for platelet αIIbβ3 and it cross-linked with αIIb subunit of this integrin (19Smith J.W. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12267-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3440-3446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several peptides without the RGD sequence, which are highly specific for platelet αIIbβ3, have also been reported. For example, a tick saliva protein, which does not have the RGD sequence, is a potent αIIbβ3 antagonist and shows high specificity for this integrin (21Karczewski J. Endris R. Connolly T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6702-6708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another example is barbourin, which is a member of the disintegrins found in snake venom (22Scarborough R.M. Rose J.W. Hsu M.A. Phillips D.R. Fried V.A. Campbell A.M. Nannizzi L. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9359-9362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of our study is to develop a potent and highly specific αIIbβ3 antagonist of small linear peptides (less than six residues) consisting of natural amino acids. We found a novel motif sequence of a hexapeptide. One of the motif peptides, Pro-Ser-Hyp-Gly-Asp-Trp (Hyp representing 4-hydroxy-L-proline) (NSL-9511), inhibited platelet aggregation at a submicromolar concentration, although it did not affect adhesion of human endothelial cells to immobilized vitronectin and fibronectin. The results of the solid phase binding assay suggest that this peptide is a specific antagonist of platelet αIIbβ3. NSL-9511 also exhibited antithrombotic activity in an in vivo thrombosis model. Platelet aggregation studies were performed in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) obtained from various animal species, including humans. Blood was drawn into plastic syringes containing 1/10 volume of 3.8% trisodium citrate. PRP was prepared by centrifugation of citrated whole blood at 160 × g for 15 min at room temperature. PRP was removed, and the platelet count was determined. Platelet-poor plasma was obtained by centrifugation of the remaining blood at 2000 × g for 15 min. Saline or peptide solution of various concentrations was added to PRP at 37°C 1 min prior to the initiation of platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation was initiated with 5 μg/ml collagen, and the aggregation was measured in an aggregometer (NBS Hematracer-601, Nikoh Bioscience Co., Ltd., Tokyo) as an increase in light transmission. Platelet aggregation is presented as the percentage of inhibition of the rate of platelet aggregation compared with control samples, and the IC50 values were calculated from dose-inhibition curves. Vitronectin receptor (αvβ3) was purified according to the procedures described elsewhere (17Cheng S. Craig W.S. Mullen D. Tschopp J.F. Dixon D. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Ruoslahti E. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, human placentas were cut into small pieces and extracted with buffer containing 100 mM octyl glucoside. The extract was centrifugated, and the supernatant was applied to a Sepharose CL4B column and then applied to a GRGDSPK-Sepharose affinity column. The column was washed with five bed volumes of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 3 mM Ca2+ and 50 mM octyl glucoside at 4°C and then washed with five bed volumes of the same solution at room temperature. Bound vitronectin receptor was eluted with TBS containing 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM octyl glucoside. Finally, Ca2+ was added to the eluted fraction so that the final concentration of the free Ca2+ was 2 mM. Platelet fibrinogen receptor (αIIbβ3) was purified from outdated human platelets using a procedure almost identical to that for αvβ3. Briefly, the platelets were washed three times with TBS containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.2% glucose and then were lysed with TBS containing 100 mM octyl glucoside, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After the centrifugation at 30,000 × g, the supernatant fraction was applied to a Sepharose 2B column, and the flow-through fraction was then applied to a GRGDSPK-Sepharose affinity column. Bound fibrinogen receptor was eluted with TBS containing 50 mM octyl glucoside and 5 mM GRGDS peptide. The eluted fraction was dialyzed to remove a GRGDS peptide and concentrated on an Amicon YM 30 filter. Purified human αIIbβ3, purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc., was also used. The inhibitory effects of the peptides on integrin-ligand interactions were evaluated by using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (17Cheng S. Craig W.S. Mullen D. Tschopp J.F. Dixon D. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, for vitronectin-αvβ3 ELISA, 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight at room temperature with 10 μg/ml human vitronectin (Iwaki Glass Co., Ltd., Tokyo), and the plates were washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. αvβ3 solution was added to each well, and then the peptide solution of various concentrations was added to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h and washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Bound receptor was detected by using anti-human αv rabbit polyclonal antibody (Chemicon Int., Inc.) and affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Fibrinogen-αIIbβ3 ELISA was performed using a similar protocol except that microtiter plates were coated with 10 μg/ml human fibrinogen (Sigma) and anti-human αII mouse monoclonal antibody was used. To verify the specificities of ligand-integrin interactions, anti-αv monoclonal antibody (23C6; Serotec Ltd., UK) and anti-αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibody (Becton Dickinson) were used. The binding of the FITC-labeled RGD peptide to activated platelets was studied by flow cytometry. The activated washed platelets were prepared according to the methods of Frojmovic et al. (24Frojmovic M. Wong T. van de Ven T. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 815-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Human PRP was treated with 0.5 μM prostaglandin E1 (Sigma) at room temperature for 10 min. The pH of the PRP was then adjusted to 6.5 with 1 M citrate solution, and the PRP was centrifugated at 1200 × g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin and 0.2 units/ml apyrase (grade III; Sigma), and the suspension was centrifugated at 1200 × g for 10 min again. The pellet was resuspended in Tyrode's solution containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin and 0.38% trisodium citrate (termed PRP (1:10)). 100 μM ADP was added to this platelet suspension and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The platelets were then treated with 0.1 mM FITC-labeled peptide (FITC-WSRGDW) for 25 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of inhibitory peptides at various concentrations. The relative intensity of fluorescence was analyzed in a flow cytometer (Cyto ACE-300, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The adhesion assay was performed in 24-well tissue culture plates. Each well was precoated with 30 μg/ml fibronectin (purified from human plasma, Iwaki Glass Co., Ltd., Tokyo) or 3 μg/ml vitronectin (purified from human plasma, Iwaki Glass Co., Ltd., Tokyo) at 4°C for 24 h. On the day of the experiment, each well was blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. ECV 304 cells (obtained from Health Science Research Resource Bank, Osaka Japan), a cell line cloned from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (25Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1990; 25: 265-274Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar), were cultured in medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C. They were harvested using 0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA and washed twice with divalent cation-free phosphate-buffered saline. Finally, they were resuspended in serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium (5 × 105 cells/ml). The cells were preincubated with appropriate inhibitors for 30 min at 37°C, and then 200 μl of this cell suspension then was added to each well of the 24-well plates precoated with fibronectin or vitronectin, as mentioned above, and were incubated at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. After 30 min, each well was washed with serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium to remove unattached cells, and 100 μl of 65 μg/ml WST-1 (2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt) and 100 μl of 7 μg/ml 1-methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate were added to each well. After 1 h, the number of adhered cells was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm (26Ishiyama M. Shiga M. Sasamoto K. Mizoguchi M. He P.-G. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 41: 1118-1122Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Anti-human αvβ3 monoclonal antibody, 23C6 (Serotec, Oxford, UK), was used to examine the contribution of αvβ3 integrin (27Horton M.A. Lewis D. McNulty K. Pringle J.A.S. Chambers T.A. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5663-5669PubMed Google Scholar). EILDVPST peptide (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan), originating from the CS-1 site of fibronectin (28Komoriya A. Green L.J. Mervic M. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15075-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to examine the contribution of the CS-1 site to the cell adhesion to fibronectin. Male Hartley guinea pigs weighing 230-320 g were anesthetized with pentobarbital (35 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), and an intratracheal cannula was inserted through the incision. To maintain a moderate anesthesia during the experiment, additional pentobarbital administration (intraperitoneal) was done if necessary. The polyethylene tubes filled with saline containing 100 units/ml heparin were inserted into the left jugular vein and right carotid artery, and these two tubes were connected with a silicon tube filled with the same solution. The whole length of this shunt was 6 cm. Each agent was infused via a cannula in a right jugular vein at the rate of 2 ml/h for 70 min. 10 min after the onset of the infusion, the silicon tube was exchanged with a polyethylene tube in which a silk thread was inserted. At every 20 min, the silk thread was exchanged, and the wet weight of the thread was measured. After the termination of the infusion, the thrombus formation was examined for another 60 min. The net thrombus weight was calculated from the thread weights before and after the experiments, and the total thrombus weight during 60 min was the sum of three net thrombus weights during each 20 min. All peptides were synthesized by solid phase methods using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl amino acids on an automatic peptide synthesizer (model 431A, Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The final step of the solid phase synthesis involved the acylation of the N termini with different types of carboxylic acids in the presence of N,N-dimethyl formamide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in 1-(3′,4′-dichlorophenyl)-2-isopropyl-aminoethanol. A trimethylsilylbromide-thioanisol system was used for the final deprotection. The crude peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 preparative column. All peptides were characterized by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, an amino acid analysis, and an analytical high pressure liquid chromatography. The purity of the peptides was >98%. Labeling of a peptide with FITC was performed using FITC isomer I (Sigma). Free FITC was eliminated by dialysis. The conformational analysis was conducted on Macro Model software, version 3.5d (29Mohamadi F. Richards N.G.J. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Lipton M. Caufield C. Chang G. Hendrickson T. Still W.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 440-467Crossref Scopus (3933) Google Scholar). Fifty thousand conformers were generated by the Monte Carlo method (30Chang G. Guida W.C. Still W.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 4379-4386Crossref Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) and minimized with a modified Amber* Force field (31Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar) in vacuum to obtain 2200 conformers. The distance between the guanidino group of the Arg residue and the carboxy group of the Asp residue (d1) and the distance between the imino group of the Pro residue and the carboxy group of the Asp residue (d2) were calculated. Conformers with shorter d1 or d2 (<10 Å) were eliminated, based on Kessler's active conformation (32Müller G. Gurrath M. Kessler H. Timpl R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1992; 31: 326-328Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The electrostatic cut-off distance was set to 5 Å, and the force field was modified in order to not evaluate hydrogen bonds. The statistical significance of the difference between two groups was determined by the Student's t test. The statistical significance of the difference between more than two groups was assessed by a one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnet's test. Differences were considered to be statistically different when p was <0.05. Dose-inhibition curves were obtained by fitting the data to a logistic curve by the least squares method, and the IC50 values were calculated from the fitted curves. In the previous study (33Hayashi Y. Sato Y. Katada J. Takiguchi Y. Ojima I. Uno I Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 1351-1356Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we found that an RGD-containing hexapeptide, PSRGDW, was a very potent inhibitor of human platelet aggregation (IC50 = 0.79 μM). The Pro residue at the N-terminal position of this peptide was essential for its high potency, because the substitution of other amino acids for proline or removal of this Pro residue resulted in a decrease in the anti-platelet activity (e.g. SRGDW was 50 times less potent than PSRGDW). These results suggest that the N-terminal Pro residue is responsible for another interaction between this peptide and the αIIbβ3 receptor besides the guanidino group and the carboxyl group of the RGD site. However, this peptide was not specific for platelet αIIbβ3 integrin, although it was very potent. To develop a potent antagonist of platelet αIIbβ3 with high specificity, we synthesized a series of peptides without the Arg residue. The anti-platelet aggregation activity of these peptides is shown in Table I. A replacement of the Arg residue at the third position with norvaline, which means the removal of the guanidino group of the Arg residue, resulted in a slight increase in the anti-platelet activity, suggesting that the Arg residue of the RGD site is not necessary for the anti-platelet activity of this peptide. L-Proline, L-hydroxyproline, and L-dehydroproline at the third position also reproduced the anti-platelet activity of high potency. We also synthesized N-acetyl PSPGDW, in which the imino group of the N-terminal Pro residue was blocked, to investigate the role of this group and found that the acetylation of the imino group resulted in the complete loss of the activity, suggesting that this free imino group is essential to the anti-platelet activity of this peptide. Among the peptides we synthesized here, PS-Hyp-GDW (Hyp representing 4-hydroxy-L-proline) (NSL-9511) was the most potent inhibitor of the platelet aggregation, and this peptide was used for further experiments.Table I.Inhibition of in vitro human platelet aggregationPeptidePlatelet aggregation (IC50)μMPSRGDW0.87SRGDW40PS-Nva-GDWaNva, L-norvaline.0.59PS-Pro-GDW0.77PS-Hyp-GDWbHyp, 4-hydroxy-L-proline.

Open table in a new tab The anti-platelet activity of NSL-9511 differs apparently among species (Table II). Although NSL-9511 was a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation in guinea pig PRP, it was much less active in mouse and rat PRP.Table IIInhibition of platelet aggregation by NSL-9511 in PRP from different speciesSpeciesPlatelet aggregation (IC50)μMHuman0.39Guinea pig0.87Mouse40.0Rat>1000 Open table in a new tab In our preliminary studies using flow cytometry, we have found that NSL-9511 inhibited the binding of fibrinogen to ADP-activated platelets, suggesting that the anti-platelet activity of NSL-9511 results from the blockage of fibrinogen binding to its receptor on the platelet surface. To clarify the mechanism underlying the anti-platelet activity further, we performed a competitive ELISA in which the binding of purified human platelet fibrinogen receptor, αIIbβ3, to immobilized human fibrinogen was detected by specific antibody. αvβ3 ELISA was also performed using αvβ3 purified from human placenta to examine the binding specificity of NSL-9511. As Fig. 1a shows, 100 μM NSL-9511 almost completely inhibited the binding of αIIbβ3 to fibrinogen, whereas it did not inhibit the binding of αvβ3 to vitronectin. An RGD-containing peptide, GRGDS, at the same concentration did inhibit both the binding of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 and that of vitronectin to αvβ3 completely. These results suggest that NSL-9511 is highly specific for platelet αIIbβ3. Anti-αv monoclonal antibody and anti-αIIbβ3, both of which have been reported as binding-blocking antibody, completely inhibited the binding of vitronectin to αvβ3 and fibrinogen to αIIbβ3, respectively. As Fig. 1b shows, NSL-9511 inhibited the binding of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 70 nM. On the other hand, this compound hardly inhibited the binding of vitronectin to αvβ3 and the percentage of inhibition was only 23% at the highest dose (0.6 mM). Although NSL-9511 is a potent antagonist of αIIbβ3, it does not possess the RGD sequence. To determine whether NSL-9511 and the RGD peptide are mutually exclusive upon binding to αIIbβ3, we synthesized FITC-labeled RGD peptide and examined the effects of NSL-9511 on the binding of this RGD peptide to activated platelets. As Fig. 2 shows, activation of washed platelets with ADP increased the mean fluorescence when the platelets were incubated with 100 μM FITC-WSRGDW. This increment in mean fluorescence was inhibited by the addition of excess unlabeled RGD peptide (1 mM WSRGDW) (data not shown), suggesting that it resulted from the specific binding of FITC-labeled WSRGDW to platelet integrins in an activation-dependent manner. An addition of 10 μM NSL-9511 completely inhibited the increase in the mean fluorescence. These results suggest that NSL-9511 and the RGD peptide share the same binding site on αIIbβ3 or that their binding sites are very close. The binding specificity of NSL-9511 was examined in a cell adhesion assay, in which ECV304 cells, originating from human umbilical vein endothelial cells, adhered to immobilized vitronectin and fibronectin via integrin receptors. As shown in Fig. 3a, the adhesion of ECV 304 cells to immobilized human fibronectin was inhibited by the GRGDS peptide, and almost complete inhibition was observed at 1000 μM. The EILDVPST peptide, which is the sequence within the CS-1 site of fibronectin and is considered to be another sequence responsible for the adhesion of various cell types to fibronectin (28Komoriya A. Green L.J. Mervic M. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15075-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not show such an inhibitory activity up to 100 μM under this assay condition. These results suggest that the adhesion of ECV 304 cells to fibronectin will be mainly mediated by the α5β1 (fibronectin receptor)-RGD interactions. On the other hand, the adhesion of ECV 304 cells to immobilized vitronectin was inhibited by GRGDS by about 50% even at 1000 μM (Fig. 3b). An excess amount of 23C6, the monoclonal antibody to αvβ3 that has been reported to inhibit cell adhesion via αvβ3 integrin (27Horton M.A. Lewis D. McNulty K. Pringle J.A.S. Chambers T.A. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5663-5669PubMed Google Scholar), also inhibited the ECV304 adhesion for vitronectin by about 50%. In this adhesion assay, NSL-9511 did not inhibit the adhesion of ECV 304 cells to immobilized fibronectin and vitronectin up to 1000 μM (Fig. 3, a and b), suggesting that NSL-9511 does not have inhibitory actions on integrins such as αvβ3 and α5β1 and that it is highly specific to platelet αIIbβ3. To examine the antithrombotic activity of NSL-9511 in vivo, a guinea pig arteriovenous shunt model was used. In this model, a shunt circuit is constructed between a carotid artery and a jugular vein with a silicon tube in which a silk thread is inserted, and the circulation of blood in this shunt results in a platelet-rich thrombus formation around the silk thread. As shown in Fig. 4a, the total thrombus weight over 60 min was 14.8 ± 1.2 mg in the control group where saline was infused via a jugular vein. Infusion of heparin (100 units/kg/h), an anticoagulant, inhibited the thrombus formation by about 50%. NSL-9511, administered by infusion, inhibited the thrombus formation in a dose-dependent manner, and at a dose of 10 mg/kg/hr, no thrombus was formed at all during the infusion. After the termination of the infusion, the thrombus formation was examined for another 60 min (Fig. 4b). Although the antithrombotic effect"
