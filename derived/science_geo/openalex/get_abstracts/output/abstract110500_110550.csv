https://openalex.org/W2057567296,"The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) mediates various responses such as stomatal closure, the maintenance of seed dormancy, and the inhibition of plant growth. All three responses are affected in the ABA-insensitive mutant abi1 of Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that an early step in the signaling of ABA is controlled by the ABI1 locus. The ABI1 gene was cloned by chromosome walking, and a missense mutation was identified in the structural gene of the abi1 mutant. The ABI1 gene encodes a protein with high similarity to protein serine or threonine phosphatases of type 2C with the novel feature of a putative Ca2+ binding site. Thus, the control of the phosphorylation state of cell signaling components by the ABI1 product could mediate pleiotropic hormone responses."
https://openalex.org/W2093669238,"In spite of recent advances in identifying genes causing monogenic human disease, very little is known about the genes involved in polygenic disease. Three families were identified with mutations in the unlinked photoreceptor-specific genes ROM1 and peripherin/RDS, in which only double heterozygotes develop retinitis pigmentosa (RP). These findings indicate that the allelic and nonallelic heterogeneity known to be a feature of monogenic RP is complicated further by interactions between unlinked mutations causing digenic RP. Recognition of the inheritance pattern exemplified by these three families might facilitate the identification of other examples of digenic inheritance in human disease."

https://openalex.org/W2129289858,"The estrogen receptor is a transcription factor which, when bound to estradiol, binds DNA and regulates expression of estrogen-responsive genes. A 160-kilodalton estrogen receptor-associated protein, ERAP160, was identified that exhibits estradiol-dependent binding to the receptor. Mutational analysis of the receptor shows that its ability to activate transcription parallels its ability to bind ERAP160. Antiestrogens are unable to promote ERAP160 binding and can block the estrogen-dependent interaction of the receptor and ERAP160 in a dose-dependent manner. This evidence suggests that ERAP160 may mediate estradiol-dependent transcriptional activation by the estrogen receptor. Furthermore, the ability of antiestrogens to block estrogen receptor-ERAP160 complex formation could account for their therapeutic effects in breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2011189608,"Normal male sex differentiation requires that Sertoli cells in the embryonic testes produce müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS), a TGF beta-like hormone that causes müllerian duct regression. In primary Sertoli cells, the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), regulates the MIS gene by binding to a conserved upstream regulatory element. In heterologous (HeLa) cells, MIS gene activation by SF-1 requires removal of the SF-1 ligand-binding domain, implicating a Sertoli cell-specific ligand or cofactor. Finally, the sexually dimorphic expression of SF-1 during development coincides with MIS expression and müllerian duct regression. We propose that SF-1 regulates MIS in vivo and participates directly in the process of mammalian sex determination."

https://openalex.org/W1981850472,"Aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on skeletal muscle fibers is thought to be mediated by the basal lamina protein agrin. Structural similarities shared by agrin and laminin suggested that the laminin receptor dystroglycan-alpha, part of a dystrophin-receptor complex, might also bind agrin. We show here that dystroglycan-alpha and dystrophin-related protein (DRP/utrophin) are concentrated within AChR aggregates in cultures of C2 myotubes and that agrin binds specifically to dystroglycan-alpha in in vitro assays. This binding is calcium dependent and is inhibited by monoclonal antibody (MAb) IIH6 against dystroglycan-alpha, heparin, and laminin, but not by fibronectin. In S27 cells, which do not aggregate AChRs spontaneously, agrin and laminin binding to dystroglycan-alpha are dramatically decreased. Moreover, MAb IIH6 significantly inhibits agrin-induced AChR aggregation on C2 cells. We conclude that dystroglycan-alpha is an agrin-binding protein and part of a dystrophin-receptor complex involved in AChR aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2019670504,"A homozygous mutation in the kinase domain of ZAP-70, a T cell receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinase, produced a distinctive form of human severe combined immunodeficiency. Manifestations of this disorder included profound immunodeficiency, absence of peripheral CD8+ T cells, and abundant peripheral CD4+ T cells that were refractory to T cell receptor-mediated activation. These findings demonstrate that ZAP-70 is essential for human T cell function and suggest that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells depend on different intracellular signaling pathways to support their development or survival."
https://openalex.org/W2055444005,"Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play an integral role in T cell activation and differentiation. Defects in the Src-family PTKs in mice and in T cell lines have resulted in variable defects in thymic development and in T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signal transduction. Here, three siblings are described with an autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) in which ZAP-70, a non-Src PTK, is absent as a result of mutations in the ZAP-70 gene. This absence is associated with defects in TCR signal transduction, suggesting an important functional role for ZAP-70."

https://openalex.org/W1997398245,"T cell-mediated suppression is an established phenomenon, but its underlying mechanisms are obscure. An in vitro system was used to test the possibility that anergic T cells can act as specific suppressor cells. Anergic human T cells caused inhibition of antigen-specific and allospecific T cell proliferation. In order for the inhibition to occur, the anergic T cells had to be specific for the same antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as the T cells that were suppressed. The mechanism of this suppression appears to be competition for the APC surface and for locally produced interleukin-2."
https://openalex.org/W2061645351,"The terminal differentiation of mammalian muscle cells requires the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Unlike their wild-type counterparts, multinucleated myotubes from mouse cells deficient in Rb (Rb-/-) were induced by serum to re-enter the cell cycle. Development of the myogenic phenotype in Rb-/- cells correlated with increased expression of p107, which interacted with myogenic transcription factors. Serum-induced cell cycle reentry, on the other hand, correlated with decreased p107 expression. Thus, although p107 could substitute for Rb as a cofactor for differentiation, it could not maintain the terminally differentiated state in Rb-/- myotubes."
https://openalex.org/W2015114304,"Synapse formation is characterized by the accumulation of molecules at the site of contact between pre- and postsynaptic cells. Agrin, a protein implicated in the regulation of this process, causes the clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Here we characterize an agrin-binding site on the surface of muscle cells, show that this site corresponds to alpha-dystroglycan, and present evidence that alpha-dystroglycan is functionally related to agrin activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alpha-dystroglycan and adhalin, components of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, as well as utrophin, colocalize with agrin-induced AChR clusters. Thus, agrin may function by initiating or stabilizing a synapse-specific membrane cytoskeleton that in turn serves as a scaffold upon which synaptic molecules are concentrated."

https://openalex.org/W2073628003,"Two Arabidopsis thaliana genes, QRT1 and QRT2, are required for pollen separation during normal development. In qrt mutants, the outer walls of the four meiotic products of the pollen mother cell are fused, and pollen grains are released in tetrads. Pollen is viable and fertile, and the cytoplasmic pollen contents are discrete. Pollination with a single tetrad usually yields four seeds, and genetic analysis confirmed that marker loci segregate in a 2:2 ratio within these tetrads. These mutations allow tetrad analysis to be performed in Arabidopsis and define steps in pollen cell wall development."

https://openalex.org/W1994670375,"In mice, X inactivation is preceded by in cis Xist expression. Initially, normal female embryos express the paternal Xist allele exclusively, preceding imprinted X inactivation in the trophectoderm. Later expression of Xist alleles is random, preceding random X inactivation in the epiblast lineage. In this study using uniparental embryos, we demonstrate that Xist expression is initially dictated solely by parental imprinting, causing expression of all paternal alleles. Maternal alleles remain repressed, irrespective of X chromosome number. At the compacting morula stage, this parental imprint is erased, and the mechanism counting the X chromosomes imposes appropriate Xist expression with respect to chromosome number. Our results also suggest that Xist expression may itself be regulated by a novel imprinted maternally expressed gene."
https://openalex.org/W2052448379,"Multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) has been used to determine the structure of the regulatory enzyme of de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides, glutamine 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) amidotransferase, from Bacillus subtilis. This allosteric enzyme, a 200-kilodalton tetramer, is subject to end product regulation by purine nucleotides. The metalloenzyme from B. subtilis is a paradigm for the higher eukaryotic enzymes, which have been refractory to isolation in stable form. The two folding domains of the polypeptide are correlated with functional domains for glutamine binding and for transfer of ammonia to the substrate PRPP. Eight molecules of the feedback inhibitor adenosine monophosphate (AMP) are bound to the tetrameric enzyme in two types of binding sites: the PRPP catalytic site of each subunit and an unusual regulatory site that is immediately adjacent to each active site but is between subunits. An oxygen-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster in each subunit is proposed to regulate protein turnover in vivo and is distant from the catalytic site. Oxygen sensitivity of the cluster is diminished by AMP, which blocks a channel through the protein to the cluster. The structure is representative of both glutamine amidotransferases and phosphoribosyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1566472466,"Cathepsin D is an estrogen (17 beta-estradiol, E2)-inducible lysosomal protease. A putative estrogen receptor (ER)-Sp1-like sequence (GGGCGG(n)23ACGGG) has been identified in the non-coding strand of the cathepsin D promoter (-199 to -165), and electromobility shift assays of nuclear extracts from MCF-7 and HeLa cells confirm that both the ER and Sp1 protein bind to 32P-labeled ER/Sp1 oligo. For example, nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells bind to the 32P-labeled ER/Sp1 oligo; however, ER/Sp1 binding can be decreased by selective competition with excess unlabeled estrogen responsive element and Sp1 oligos, immunodepletion with ER or Sp1 antibodies, and by treating cells with ICI 164,384, an antiestrogen which inhibits formation of ER homodimer. Moreover, E2-induced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in MCF-7 cells cotransfected with a human estrogen receptor expression plasmid and a plasmid containing an ER/Sp1 sequence cloned upstream to a thymidine kinase promoter and a CAT reporter. In cotreatment studies, ICI 164,384 inhibited E2-induced CAT activity. In contrast, E2 did not induce CAT activity in MCF-7 cells transfected with plasmids containing mutations in the ER or Sp1 segments of the ER/Sp1 oligo, thus confirming that both cognate binding sites are required for estrogen responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2141906439,"Specific protein-ligand interactions are critical for cellular function, and most proteins select their partners with sharp discrimination. However, the oligopeptide-binding protein of Salmonella typhimurium (OppA) binds peptides of two to five amino acid residues without regard to sequence. The crystal structure of OppA reveals a three-domain organization, unlike other periplasmic binding proteins. In OppA-peptide complexes, the ligands are completely enclosed in the protein interior, a mode of binding that normally imposes tight specificity. The protein fulfills the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic potential of the ligand main chain and accommodates the peptide side chains in voluminous hydrated cavities."

https://openalex.org/W1521574535,"A novel basic carboxypeptidase clearly different from carboxypeptidase N has been isolated from human plasma. It circulates as an enzymatically inactive precursor enzyme bound to plasminogen. During fibrinolysis, it can be converted to its active form, carboxypeptidase U, through the action of plasmin. The active enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 53,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It hydrolyzes the synthetic peptides hippuryl-L-arginine and hippuryl-L-lysine but, in contrast to other human basic carboxypeptidases, has only a limited esterase activity. After its activation, carboxypeptidase U tends to be very unstable."
https://openalex.org/W2164520041,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a monocyte-specific chemoattractant and activator and is a member of the chemokine-beta family of cytokines. To identify regions of MCP-1 which are required for its biological activity, we constructed human MCP-1 mutants that were expressed in eukaryotic cells and tested for their ability to attract monocytes in vitro. Deletion of amino acids 2-8 destroyed activity, suggesting that the amino-terminal region is necessary for activity. Within the deleted region, mutation of aspartate 3 to alanine produced a protein with 9% of wild-type activity, whereas mutation of asparagine 6 to alanine produced a protein with 52.9% of wild-type activity. Mutation of amino acids within the first intercysteine loop yielded variable results. Changing tyrosine 28 to aspartate or arginine 30 to leucine each produced proteins with essentially no monocyte chemoattractant activity. The side chains of these amino acids are predicted to point into a putative receptor binding cleft, and these loss-of-function mutations are consistent with this model. Also consistent is the retention of 60% of wild-type activity after mutation of serine 27 to glutamine, since the side chain of serine 27 is predicted to point away from the binding cleft. However, mutation of arginine 24, which lies outside of this area, to phenylalanine produced a protein with only 5% of wild-type activity, suggesting more complex interactions. Truncations of the carboxyl terminus, as well as mutation of aspartate 68 to leucine, generated proteins with 10-20% of wild-type activity. (Another carboxyl-terminal insertional mutation demonstrated that O-linked carbohydrate in MCP-1 alpha may be added to a threonine in the carboxyl-terminal region.) These findings are consistent with a structural model of dimeric MCP-1 which is similar to interleukin-8, in which amino acids that point into a cleft between the two carboxyl-terminal alpha-helices of the subunits are important for receptor binding. In addition, however, amino acids at the amino terminus and others outside of the interhelical cleft are also essential for activity. The carboxyl-terminal alpha-helix is not required for signaling per se but is required for maximal specific activity. Finally, four mutant proteins partially inhibited the ability of wild-type MCP-1 to attract monocytes in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2039674297,"Bacterial plasmids may often reach a copy number larger than 1000 per cell, corresponding to a total amount of DNA that may exceed the amount of DNA within the bacterial chromosome. This observation highlights the problem of cellular accommodation of large amounts of closed-circular nucleic acids, whose interwound conformation offers negligible DNA compaction. As determined by x-ray scattering experiments conducted on intact bacteria, supercoiled plasmids segregate within the cells into dense clusters characterized by a long-range order. In vitro studies performed at physiological DNA concentrations indicated that interwound DNA spontaneously forms liquid crystalline phases whose macroscopic structural properties are determined by the features of the molecular supercoiling. Because these features respond to cellular factors, DNA supercoiling may provide a sensitive regulatory link between cellular parameters and the packaging modes of interwound DNA in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1543504325,"Pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a member of a family of collagenous C-type lectins that includes the serum mannose binding proteins and surfactant protein A. Recent studies have shown that rat SP-D (rSP-D) molecules are assembled as tetramers of trimeric subunits (12 mers) and that dodecamers can participate in higher orders of molecular assembly involving interactions of the amino-terminal peptide domains. In order to further study the assembly of SP-D in vitro, Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells were transfected with a full-length rat SP-D cDNA, and stable transfectants with high levels of SP-D production (approximately 6 x 10(6) dodecamers/cell/24 h) were obtained using a glutamine synthetase selection system. The secreted molecules (RrSP-D), which were purified by affinity chromatography on maltosyl-agarose, comigrated with rSP-D on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of reduction, and coeluted with rSP-D dodecamers from 4% agarose. The major bacterial collagenase-resistant peptide showed a decreased mobility on reduction consistent with the formation of intrachain disulfide bonds. A 17-kDa pepsin-resistant fragment was isolated following overnight digestion with pepsin at 27 degrees C, confirming the formation of a triple helical domain comparable in size and thermal stability to that of natural SP-D. The expressed protein contained sialylated endoglycosidase F-sensitive carbohydrate; amino acid analysis of acid and alkaline hydrolysates demonstrated essentially normal levels of hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, and hydroxylysine-glycosides. Electron microscopic studies showed a molecular structure indistinguishable from lung SP-D, with a similar small subpopulation of molecules showing higher orders of multimerization. Solid-phase neoglycoprotein binding assays gave the same saccharide inhibition profile as natural rat SP-D, and both proteins showed efficient saccharide-dependent agglutination of Escherichia coli. These studies demonstrate that a single genetically distinct chain type can account for the various and complex molecular assemblies of SP-D, and further verify the potential physiologic significance of the disulfide-bonded multimers and higher aggregates isolated from rat, bovine, and human lung lavage."

We have designed an alternative to previous universal nucleoside candidates1–9, a new analogue, l-(2'-deoxy-β-D-ribofuranosyl)-3-nitropyrrole (designated M; Fig. 1), which max-imizes stacking while minimizing hydrogen-bonding interactions without sterically disrupting a DNA duplex. Oligonucleotides con-taining M at several sites were used as primers for sequencing and the polymerase chain reaction. The sequencing primer d(5'-CGT AAM CAM AAM ACM AT-3') is as effective as the exact match d(5'-CGT AAT CAG AAA ACA AT-3'). It is also possible to sequence using a primer containing M at several contiguous posi-tions, for example d(5'-CGT AAT MMM MMM MMM AT-3'). Melting curves show that duplexes formed on hybridization of the sequences d(5'-CCT TTT TMT TTT TGG-3') and d(5'-CCA AAA AXA AAA AGG-3'), where X is A, C, G or T, melted at a lower temperature than the corresponding duplexes containing only d(A.T) and d(C.G) base pairs, but showing little variation among different X bases (Tm range 3oC)."
https://openalex.org/W1495187352,"Recently, it has been reported that Raf-1 kinase (Raf-1) has mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) activity in various cells, although Raf-1 and MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) can be phosphorylated by MAP kinase (MAPK) in vitro. Here we show that the maximal hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 and MAPKK (10 min) was substantially achieved after the maximal activation of MAPKKK of Raf-1, MAPKK (2-5 min), and MAPK in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human insulin receptor (CHO-HIR cells) treated with insulin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Moreover, we show that overexpression of MAPK in CHO-HIR cells resulted in enhanced hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1, MAPKK, and mammalian homolog of son of sevenless (mSos) after insulin or TPA stimulation as compared with parental cells. Furthermore, the maximal hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 appears to be accompanied by a significant decrease in MAPKKK activity. These results suggest that 1) signals initiated by insulin and TPA converge on Raf-1 and activate its MAPKKK activity and 2) Raf-1, MAPKK, and mSos not only lie upstream of MAPK but also are phosphorylated by MAPK, directly or indirectly, and at least Raf-1 kinase activity might be down-regulated by this feedback mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W161360456,"The third intracellular domain (3i) of G protein-coupled receptors plays a major role in the activation of G proteins. Alterations in this region of the receptor can affect receptor/G protein coupling efficiency and specificity. We recently reported (Luttrell, L. M., Cotecchia, S., Ostrowski, J., Kendall, H., Lefkowitz, R.J. (1993) Science 259, 1453-1457) that coexpression of the 3i domain of the alpha 1B adrenergic receptor (AR) (alpha 1B3i) specifically inhibited alpha 1BAR-mediated inositol phosphate production, with no effect on D1A dopamine receptor (D1ADR)-mediated cAMP production. Similarly, expression of the 3i domain of D1ADR (D1A3i) inhibited D1ADR-mediated cAMP production but did not affect alpha 1BAR-mediated inositol phosphate accumulation. This suggests that peptides derived from a G protein-coupled receptor might serve as antagonists of receptor/G protein interactions. The present studies were performed to test the generality as well as the specificity of this phenomenon. The effect of expression of the second intracellular domain (2i), the 3i domain, and the fourth intracellular domain (4i) of alpha 1BAR on second messenger generation mediated by the alpha 1BAR, the M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (M1AChR), and the D1ADR was examined. Although the alpha 1B2i domain had no effect on receptor/G protein coupling for any receptor tested, the alpha 1B3i domain inhibited signaling mediated by alpha 1BAR and M1AChR but not by D1ADR, while the alpha 1B4i domain inhibited signaling mediated by each of the receptors. To investigate the generality of 3i domain-induced inhibition of receptor activity further, the 3i domains of two Gq-coupled receptors (alpha 1BAR and M1AChR) and two Gi-coupled receptors (alpha 2AAR and M2AChR) were tested for effects on the second messenger generation mediated by each of the four receptors. In each case, the homologous 3i domain caused significant inhibition (40-60%), while the 3i domain of the receptor coupled to the same G protein also decreased receptor/G protein coupling. In contrast, receptor/G protein coupling appeared unaffected by expression of 3i domains derived from receptors coupled to different G proteins. The alpha 1B3i domain-provoked inhibition of homologous receptor signaling was surmountable at high receptor density, and assays using a phorbol response element/reporter gene construct detected a weak enhancement of basal second messenger generation in cells expressing the alpha 1B3i domain alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1997973843,"When the sympathetic nerves that innervate rat sweat glands reach their targets, they are induced to switch from using norepinephrine as their neurotransmitter to acetylcholine. Catecholamines (such as norepinephrine) released by nerves growing to the sweat gland induce this phenotypic conversion by stimulating production of a cholinergic differentiation factor [sweat gland factor (SGF)] by gland cells. Here, culture of gland cells with sympathetic, but not sensory, neurons induced SGF production. Blockage of alpha 1- or beta-adrenergic receptors prevented acquisition of the cholinergic phenotype in sympathetic neurons co-cultured with sweat glands, and sweat glands from sympathectomized animals lacked SGF. Thus, reciprocal instructive interactions, mediated in part by small molecule neurotransmitters, direct the development of this synapse."
https://openalex.org/W11110039,"The proximal 5‘-flanking region of the rat alpha 1B adrenergic receptor (alpha 1BAR) gene contains discrete transcription start points (tsp) utilized in liver, located at -54, -57 (tsp1), and -443 base pairs (tsp2) upstream from the translation start codon (Gao, B., and Kunos, G. (1993) Gene (Amst.) 131, 243-247). Primer extension analyses using 5‘ upstream primers now identify an additional cluster of tsp between -1035 and -1340 base pairs (tsp3). Northern blots of rat liver mRNA reveal three alpha 1BAR mRNAs of 2.3, 2.7, and 3.3 kilobases in length. Transient transfections of putative promoter/pCAT constructs document the existence of three promoters, P1 (-127, -49), P2- (-813, -432), and P3 (-1363, -1107), which direct transcription from tsp1, tsp2, and tsp3, respectively. P1 contains no recognition sequences for known transcription factors. P2 is (G + C)-rich, lacks a TATA box, and contains a cAMP response element, GC, CACC, and GCAAT boxes, and binding sites for nuclear factor I. P3 contains a putative TATATA and CCAAT box and is flanked by recognition sites for the liver-specific CCAAT/enhancer binding protein and hepatocyte nuclear factor 5. These findings indicate that heterogeneity of alpha 1BAR mRNA in liver is related to transcription of the gene by three distinct promoters. Differential control of these promoters may underlie the well documented developmental and tissue-specific regulation of the alpha 1BAR."
https://openalex.org/W1540439694,"The c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb) can transactivate the human hsp70 promoter in a transient cotransfection assay. The present studies have demonstrated that the heat shock element (HSE) in the hsp70 promoter mediates trans-activation by c-Myb. Mutagenesis of the DNA sequence in HSE indicated that the NGAAN motif is necessary for not only the heat shock response but also the c-Myb-induced trans-activation. The HSE in the hsp70 promoter does not contain a c-Myb-binding site, implying that the sequence-specific DNA binding of c-Myb is not required for the HSE-dependent trans-activation by c-Myb. We had demonstrated that a disruption of the leucine zipper motif in the central portion of the c-Myb molecule increased the degree of c-Myb-induced trans-activation of the promoter containing c-Myb-binding sites, suggesting that a putative inhibitor binds to c-Myb through this leucine zipper (Kanie-Ishii, C., MacMillan, E. M., Nomura, T., Sarai, A., Ramsay, R. G., Aimoto, S., Ishii, S., and Gonda, T. J. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 3088-3092). However, disruption of the leucine zipper in c-Myb abolished the HSE-dependent trans-activation by c-Myb, whereas deletion of the transcriptional activation domain containing acidic amino acids in c-Myb did not abolish the HSE-dependent trans-activation by c-Myb. These results suggest that c-HSEs by interacting with unidentified trans-acting factor(s) but not by a direct binding to the promoter through its DNA-binding domain."

Transient transfection analyses of the terminal transferase-reporter gene constructs identified the basal promoter region within -34 to +40 base pairs relative to the transcription start site. Three promoter elements were defined in this region. The primary element is within 34 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. The CAP site is 62 base pairs upstream of the translation start site. The secondary element involves sequences around the transcription start site. The third is located 25 base pairs downstream from the initiation site (+25 to +40). This tripartite basal promoter was not tissue specific; similar patterns of promoter activity were observed in terminal transferase expressing and non-expressing cells. Transfection analyses also indicated the presence of negative regulatory elements upstream of the basal promoter region, and these elements were preferentially active in cells expressing terminal transferase."
https://openalex.org/W1582650741,"The role of the TATA element in establishing the chromatin structure and inducible transcription of the Drosophila melanogaster hsp26 gene has been analyzed. An hsp26/lacZ fusion gene with a mutant promoter, in which the TATA box sequence TATAAA was changed to CCCAAA, was introduced into Drosophila by P-element transformation. The mutation had little effect on formation of the preset chromatin structure observed prior to induction. However, the mutation dramatically reduced transcription levels following heat shock. Northern analysis indicated that weak, inducible expression of the mutant promoter occurred within the same period of heat shock as for the normal promoter, suggesting that TFIID was associated with the mutant promoter prior to heat shock. Biochemical analysis showed that the mutant promoter still bound TFIID in vitro, but with 3-5-fold less affinity than the normal promoter. DNase I footprinting revealed that the conformation of the TFIID-DNA complex differed significantly from that of the normal promoter. These results indicate that alterations in the conformation or the stability of the TFIID-DNA complex drastically reduce the level of induction, but do not dramatically affect chromatin structure formation. Formation of the requisite chromatin structure is either independent of, or highly tolerant of, changes in the TFIID-DNA complex."
