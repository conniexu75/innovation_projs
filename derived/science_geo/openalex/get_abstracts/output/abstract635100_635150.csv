https://openalex.org/W2952093130,"Context shapes anticommensal immunity The gut bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila is associated with protection from obesity, enhanced wound healing, and augmented antitumor responses. Ansaldo et al. found that this microbe induces antigen-specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies generated by B cells with CD4 + T cell help. This is in contrast to most anticommensal responses, which involve the T cell–independent production of IgA antibodies. In a gnotobiotic setting in which all components of the microbiome are defined, A. muciniphila –specific T cells expanded only when A. muciniphila was present. The T cells primarily displayed a phenotype associated with B cell help. However, in mice with a conventional gut microbiota, other proinflammatory A. muciniphila –specific T cell populations also expanded. Thus, anti– A. muciniphila immunity is context dependent, which may explain the variable immune responses to this microbe reported in patients. Science , this issue p. 1179"

Biology uses light sparingly in this way, but coenzymes such as flavin can be driven to excited states by light. Biegasiewicz et al. investigated this reactivity and found a suite of flavoenzymes that catalyze asymmetric radical cyclization when exposed to light. “Ene”-reductases, when reduced and illuminated, converted starting materials containing an α-chloroamide and an alkene into five-, six-, seven-, or eight-membered lactams. Different enzymes furnished different stereochemistry in the products, likely because of changes in active-site pocket geometry. Science , this issue p. 1166"

https://openalex.org/W2951964187,"Cystic fibrosis is a fatal disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Two main categories of drugs are being developed: correctors that improve folding of CFTR and potentiators that recover the function of CFTR. Here, we report two cryo-electron microscopy structures of human CFTR in complex with potentiators: one with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug ivacaftor at 3.3-angstrom resolution and the other with an investigational drug, GLPG1837, at 3.2-angstrom resolution. These two drugs, although chemically dissimilar, bind to the same site within the transmembrane region. Mutagenesis suggests that in both cases, hydrogen bonds provided by the protein are important for drug recognition. The molecular details of how ivacaftor and GLPG1837 interact with CFTR may facilitate structure-based optimization of therapeutic compounds."

CA19-9 is thus commonly used as a biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression. In a study of mice, Engle et al. found that CA19-9 may be more than an innocent bystander that marks the presence of pancreatic disease; it may play a causal role in disease (see the Perspective by Halbrook and Crawford). Transgenic mice expressing the human enzymes that add CA19-9 to proteins developed severe pancreatitis that could be reversed by treatment with CA19-9 antibodies. When the transgenic mice also harbored a Kras oncogene, they went on to develop pancreatic cancer. These unexpected observations suggest new avenues for the treatment of pancreatic disease.

https://openalex.org/W2902454539,"Improving precision with quantum amplification Quantum mechanically, an object can be described by a pair of noncommuting observables, typically by its position and momentum. The precision to which these observables can be measured is limited by unavoidable quantum fluctuations. However, the method of “squeezing” allows the fluctuations to be manipulated, while preserving the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. This allows improved measurement precision for one observable at the expense of increased fluctuations in the other. Burd et al. now show that an additional displacement of a trapped atom results in amplification of the squeezing and a further improvement in the precision with which the displacement can be determined (see the Perspective by Schleier-Smith). This technique should be useful for a number of applications in metrology. Science , this issue p. 1163 ; see also p. 1137"

As the name implies, it requires tracers that emit positrons, typically through labeling with fluorine or carbon radioisotopes. W. Chen et al. devised a versatile technique to incorporate radioactive fluoride into aromatic rings. The metal-free photochemical method directly substitutes aryl carbon-hydrogen bonds with [ 18 F]fluoride and so is particularly well suited to late-stage transformation of complex molecules into tracers.

These smaller particles are mobile and diffuse through the lattice, so the bonding interaction resembles the classical picture of electrons in metals. Science , this issue p. 1174"

https://openalex.org/W2953285224,"When honey bee colonies collapse from high infestations of Varroa mites, neighboring colonies often experience surges in their mite populations. Collapsing colonies, often called ""mite bombs"", seem to pass their mites to neighboring colonies. This can happen by mite-infested workers from the collapsing colonies drifting into the neighboring colonies, or by mite-free workers from the neighboring colonies robbing out the collapsing colonies, or both. To study inter-colony mite transmission, we positioned six nearly mite-free colonies of black-colored bees around a cluster of three mite-laden colonies of yellow-colored bees. We then monitored the movement of bees between the black-bee and yellow-bee colonies before, during, and after mite-induced collapse of the yellow-bee colonies. Throughout the experiment, we monitored each colony's mite level. We found that large numbers of mites spread to the black-bee colonies (in both nearby and distant hives) when the yellow-bee colonies collapsed from high mite infestations and became targets of robbing by the black-bee colonies. We conclude that ""robber lures"" is a better term than ""mite bombs"" for describing colonies that are succumbing to high mite loads and are exuding mites to neighboring colonies."
https://openalex.org/W2950635058,"Autophagy mediates the degradation of damaged proteins, organelles and pathogens, and plays a key role in health and disease. Thus, the identification of new mechanisms involved in the regulation of autophagy is of major interest. In particular, little is known about the role of lipids and lipid-binding proteins in the early steps of autophagosome biogenesis. Using target-agnostic, high-content, image-based identification of indicative phenotypic changes induced by small molecules, we have identified autogramins as a new class of autophagy inhibitor. Autogramins selectively target the recently discovered cholesterol transfer protein GRAM domain-containing protein 1A (GRAMD1A, which had not previously been implicated in autophagy), and directly compete with cholesterol binding to the GRAMD1A StART domain. GRAMD1A accumulates at sites of autophagosome initiation, affects cholesterol distribution in response to starvation and is required for autophagosome biogenesis. These findings identify a new biological function of GRAMD1A and a new role for cholesterol in autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2951855553,"Biomechanical cues within tissue microenvironments are critical for maintaining homeostasis, and their disruption can contribute to malignant transformation and metastasis. Once transformed, metastatic cancer cells can migrate persistently by adapting (plasticity) to changes in the local fibrous extracellular matrix, and current strategies to recapitulate persistent migration rely exclusively on the use of aligned geometries. Here, the controlled interfiber spacing in suspended crosshatch networks of nanofibers induces cells to exhibit plasticity in migratory behavior (persistent and random) and the associated cytoskeletal arrangement. At dense spacing (3 and 6 µm), unexpectedly, elongated cells migrate persistently (in 1 dimension) at high speeds in 3-dimensional shapes with thick nuclei, and short focal adhesion cluster (FAC) lengths. With increased spacing (18 and 36 µm), cells attain 2-dimensional morphologies, have flattened nuclei and longer FACs, and migrate randomly by rapidly detaching their trailing edges that strain the nuclei by ∼35%. At 54-µm spacing, kite-shaped cells become near stationary. Poorly developed filamentous actin stress fibers are found only in cells on 3-µm networks. Gene-expression profiling shows a decrease in transcriptional potential and a differential up-regulation of metabolic pathways. The consistency in observed phenotypes across cell lines supports using this platform to dissect hallmarks of plasticity in migration in vitro.-Jana, A., Nookaew, I., Singh, J., Behkam, B., Franco, A. T., Nain, A. S. Crosshatch nanofiber networks of tunable interfiber spacing induce plasticity in cell migration and cytoskeletal response."

To some degree, this may reflect reality, but marine fish, perhaps more than any other vertebrate group, are connected across large distances through ocean currents. Ramesh et al. model how these currents distribute the fish larvae of more than 700 species. They used network analysis to assess the degree to which populations found in one part of the world may have come from another. It seems that global fish populations represent a small-world network where connections across populations are tight and particular hubs of productivity are widely important. Such connectivity has wide-ranging implications for conservation, management, and food supplies globally. Science , this issue p. 1192"
https://openalex.org/W2951569176,"We previously reported that the dismutase SOD1 is overexpressed in breast cancer. However, whether SOD1 plays an active role in tumor formation in vivo has never been demonstrated. Further, as luminal cells of normal breast epithelial cells are enriched in SOD1, whether SOD1 is essential for normal mammary gland development has never been determined. We initiated this study to investigate the role of SOD1 in mammary gland tumorigenesis as well as in normal mammary gland development. We crossed the inducible erbB2 (MMTV-iErbB2) and Wnt (MMTV-Wnt) transgenic mice to the SOD1 heterozygote or knockout mice. Our results show that SOD1 is essential for oncogene-driven proliferation, but not normal proliferation of the mammary gland associated with pregnancy or other normal proliferative tissues such as skin and intestines. We show that activation of the oncogene ErbB2 is associated with increased ROS and that high ROS sub-population of ErbB2 cancer cells show elevated SOD1. In the same cells, decrease in SOD1 is associated with an elevation in both apoptosis as well as oncogene-induced senescence. Based on these results, we suggest that SOD1 carries a housekeeping function that maintains ROS levels below a threshold that supports oncogene-dependent proliferation, while allowing escape from oncogene-induced senescence, independently of the oncogene driving tumor formation. These results identify SOD1 as an ideal target for cancer therapy as SOD1 inhibitors hold the potential to prevent the growth of cancers cells of diverse genotypes, activate multiple modes of cell death therefore making acquired resistance more difficult, while sparing normal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2950550656,"Hypospadias, a developmental defect of the penis, is one of the most common congenital malformations in humans. Its incidence has rapidly increased over recent decades, and this has been largely attributed to our increased exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Penis development is primarily an androgen-driven process; however, estrogen and xenoestrogens are known to affect penis development in both humans and mice. Here, we investigated the role of estrogen in the developing penis. Using a novel penis culture system, we showed that exogenous estrogen directly targets the developing penis in utero to cause hypospadias. In addition, we also uncovered an unexpected endogenous role for estrogen in normal postnatal penis development and showed that a loss of estrogen signaling results in a mild hypospadias phenotype, the most common manifestation of this disease in humans. Our findings demonstrated that both androgen and estrogen signaling are intrinsically required for normal urethral closure. These findings confirmed that penis development is not an entirely androgen-driven process but one in which endogenous estrogen signaling also plays a critical role.—Govers, L. C., Phillips, T.

We examined predictors for repeated hyperkalemia among patients after first-time renin angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi) prescription, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or chronic heart failure (CHF); and we also examined potassium trajectories in these patients after their first hyperkalemia event. We used Danish population-based registries to identify all patients with first-time RASi prescription, incident CKD, or incident CHF (2000-2012). For patients with a first hyperkalemia event, potassium trajectories over the following 6 months were examined. The predictors associated with repeated hyperkalemia were assessed, with repeated hyperkalemia defined as a potassium test >5.0 mmol/L after the first event within 6 months. Overall 262,375 first-time RASi users, 157,283 incident CKD patients, and 14,600 incident CHF patients were included. Of patients with a first hyperkalemia event, repeated hyperkalemia within 6 months occurred in 37% of RASi users, 40% with CKD, and 49% of patients with CHF. Predictors included severe hyperkalemia, low eGFR, diabetes, and spironolactone use. In all cohorts, the median potassium levels declined over 2-4 weeks after a hyperkalemia event for the first time, but reverted to levels higher than before the initial hyperkalemia event in those who had repeated hyperkalemia. Following hyperkalemia, discontinuation of RASi and spironolactone was common in the RASi and CHF cohorts. Repeated hyperkalemia was common among the explored cohorts. The first hyperkalemia event was an indicator of increased median potassium levels. Predictors may identify patients likely to benefit from intensified monitoring and intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2950619314,"During exercise, skeletal muscles release cytokines, peptides, and metabolites that exert autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine effects on glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the effects of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), an exercise-responsive myokine, on glucose metabolism in human and mouse skeletal muscle. SPARC-knockout mice showed impaired systemic metabolism and reduced phosphorylation of AMPK and protein kinase B in skeletal muscle. Treatment of SPARC-knockout mice with recombinant SPARC improved glucose tolerance and concomitantly activated AMPK in skeletal muscle. These effects were dependent on AMPK-γ3 because SPARC treatment enhanced skeletal muscle glucose uptake in wild-type mice but not in AMPK-γ3-knockout mice. SPARC strongly interacted with the voltage-dependent calcium channel, and inhibition of calcium-dependent signaling prevented SPARC-induced AMPK phosphorylation in human and mouse myotubes. Finally, chronic SPARC treatment improved systemic glucose tolerance and AMPK signaling in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet-induced obese mice, highlighting the efficacy of SPARC treatment in the management of metabolic diseases. Thus, our findings suggest that SPARC treatment mimics the effects of exercise on glucose tolerance by enhancing AMPK-dependent glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.-Aoi, W., Hirano, N., Lassiter, D.

https://openalex.org/W2952055877,"Background Despite malaria, malnutrition and anaemia being major public-health challenges in Cameroon, very little has been reported on the interaction between these interconnected health determinants. This study therefore sought to investigate the relationship between malaria, anaemia, nutritional and socio-economic status amongst under—ten children living in six localities within two health districts in the North Region of Cameroon. Methods Accordingly, a cross- sectional survey was conducted during the peak malaria season in November 2014, in Pitoa and Mayo-Oulo Health Districts. Three hundred and sixty eight children aged 6months—10 years were enrolled. Structured questionnaires were used to assess socio-economic status. Anthropometric indices were taken using standard methods and nutritional status assessed by calculating Height for Age (HA), Weight for Age (WA) and Weight for Height (WH) z-scores to determine stunting, underweight and wasting respectively. Finger-prick blood samples were used to prepare thin and thick blood smears for microscopy. Whole blood was collected to determine the PCV and blood spots on filter paper were used to extract plasmodium DNA for speciation by PCR. Results Overall prevalence rates of malaria, malnutrition and anaemia were 32.9%, 54.1% and 20.6% respectively. Stunting, underweight and wasting were detected in 56.9%, 63.5% and 34.8% of the children respectively. There was a significant association between malaria and malnutrition [OR = 1.89, (95% CI: 1.12–3.19); (p = 0.017)]. Malnutrition was also strongly associated with malaria status [OR = 2.07, (95% CI: 1.22–3.53); (p = 0.007)]. The prevalence rates of mild, moderate and severe anaemia were 8.1%, 9.2% and 3.3% respectively. Both malaria status and anaemia correlated with development index [OR = 0.75, (95% CI: 0.58–0.99); (p = 0.042)] and [OR = 1.45, (95% CI: 1.05–2.00); (p = 0.023)] respectively. Conclusion Our findings show a synergistic relationship between malaria and malnutrition. Effective collaboration between malaria control and nutrition intervention programmes is essential for proper case management and improved socio-economic status."
https://openalex.org/W2950126679,"Background The relationships between hedonic deficits, type D personality and suicidal ideation were explored in a group of medical students. Methods In a cross-sectional study, 382 medical students filled out several questionnaires measuring suicide risk, depression (using the Beck Depression Inventory, i.e. BDI), type D personality (using the type D personality scale-14, i.e. DS-14) and anhedonia (using the anhedonia subscale of the BDI, the Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale, the Anticipatory and Consummatory subscales of the Physical Anhedonia Scale). Results State anhedonia and, in particular, recent change of state anhedonia and not trait anhedonia was significantly associated with suicidal ideation, specifically when depression was controlled for. Negative affectivity component of type D personality and anhedonia were independent predictors of suicidal ideation even when depression was controlled for. Loss of pleasure and not loss of interest was a significant predictor of suicidal ideation. Conclusions Change of state anhedonia and its component of loss of pleasure measuring dissatisfaction in life could be a risk factor of suicidal ideation in medical students. Dissatisfaction, particularly in the medical course, could be a strong predictor of suicidal ideation in medical students."

This system transfigured the concept of 3D scaffolds for TERM, and was already successfully applied for bone and cartilage regeneration. Due to a number of appealing features, we envisage that it can be applied in many other fields, including in advanced therapies or as disease models for drug discovery. In this review, we intend to highlight the advantages of this new system, while discussing the methodology, and sharing the protocol optimization and results. The different liquefied systems for cell encapsulation reported in the literature will be also discussed, considering the different encapsulation matrixes as core templates, the types of membranes, and the core liquefaction treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2951883968,"The adenylate cyclase (CyaA) toxin is a major virulence factor of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough. CyaA is synthetized as a pro-toxin, pro-CyaA, and converted into its cytotoxic form upon acylation of two lysines. After secretion, CyaA invades eukaryotic cells and produces cAMP, leading to host defense subversion. To gain further insights into the effect of acylation, we compared the functional and structural properties of pro-CyaA and CyaA proteins. HDX-MS results show that the refolding process of both proteins upon progressive urea removal is initiated by calcium binding to the C-terminal RTX domain. We further identified a critical hydrophobic segment, distal from the acylation region, that folds at higher urea concentration in CyaA than in pro-CyaA. Once refolded into monomers, CyaA is more compact and stable than pro-CyaA, due to a complex set of interactions between domains. Our HDX-MS data provide direct evidence that the presence of acyl chains in CyaA induces a significant stabilization of the apolar segments of the hydrophobic domain and of most of the acylation region. We propose a refolding model dependent on calcium and driven by local and distal acylation-dependent interactions within CyaA. Therefore, CyaA acylation is not only critical for cell intoxication, but also for protein refolding into its active conformation. Our data shed light on the complex relationship between post-translational modifications, structural disorder and protein folding. Coupling calcium-binding and acylation-driven folding is likely pertinent for other repeat-in-toxin cytolysins produced by many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.—O'Brien, D. P., Cannella, S.

https://openalex.org/W2949887886,"The role of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) persistently infected ruminants in initiating new outbreaks remains controversial, and the perceived threat posed by such animals hinders international trade in FMD-endemic countries. In this study we report longitudinal analyses of genetic and antigenic variations of FMDV serotype O/ME-SA/Ind2001d sublineage during naturally occurring, persistent infection in cattle and buffalo at an organised dairy farm in India. The proportion of animals from which FMDV RNA was recovered was not significantly different between convalescent (post-clinical) and sub-clinically infected animals or between cattle and buffalo across the sampling period. However, infectious virus was isolated from a higher proportion of buffalo samples and for a longer duration compared to cattle. Analysis of the P1 sequences from recovered viruses indicated fixation of mutations at the rate of 1.816 x 10-2substitution/site/year (s/s/y) (95% CI 1.362–2.31 x 10−2 s/s/y). However, the majority of point mutations were transitional substitutions. Within individual animals, the mean dN/dS (ω) value for the P1 region varied from 0.076 to 0.357, suggesting the selection pressure acting on viral genomes differed substantially across individual animals. Statistical parsimony analysis indicated that all of the virus isolates from carrier animals originated from the outbreak virus. The antigenic relationship value as determined by 2D-VNT assay revealed fluctuation of antigenic variants within and between carrier animals during the carrier state which suggested that some carrier viruses had diverged substantially from the protection provided by the vaccine strain. This study contributes to understanding the extent of within-host and within-herd evolution that occurs during the carrier state of FMDV."

This paper contributes to the incipient literature on within-country allocations of development institutions and assesses the geographic targeting of World Bank projects to the bottom 40 percent. Bivariate correlations between the allocation of project funding approved over 2005–14 and the geographical distribution of the bottom 40 as measured by survey income or consumption data are complemented by regressions with population and other potential factors affecting the within-country allocations as controls. The correlation analysis shows that, of the 58 countries in the sample, 41 exhibit a positive correlation between the shares of the bottom 40 and World Bank funding, and, in almost half of these, the correlation is above 0.5. Slightly more than a quarter of the countries, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa, exhibit a negative correlation. The regression analysis shows that, once one controls for population, the correlation between the bottom 40 and World Bank funding switches sign and becomes significant and negative on average. This is entirely driven by Sub-Saharan Africa and not observed in the other regions. Hence, the significant and positive correlation in the estimations without controlling for population suggests that World Bank project funding is concentrated in administrative areas in which more people live (including the bottom 40) rather than in poorer administrative areas. Furthermore, capital cities receive disproportionally high shares of World Bank funding on average."

A handful of studies to identify potential biomarkers in the peripheral blood of AD dogs and healthy controls have been performed with some showing inconsistent and contradictory results. In this study, we, for the first time, report statistically significant increases in expression of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and miR-203 in plasma from AD dogs compared to healthy controls. In addition, we report a statistically non-significant change of the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, a dramatic decrease of three gene markers (PIAS1, RORA and SH2B1) as well as a panel of differential expression of cytokines in AD dogs in comparison to the healthy controls.

https://openalex.org/W2950946296,"Gait variability is a sensitive metric for assessing functional deficits in individuals with mobility impairments. To correctly represent the temporal evolution of gait kinematics, nonlinear measures require extended and uninterrupted time series. In this study, we present and validate a novel algorithm for concatenating multiple time-series in order to allow the nonlinear analysis of gait data from standard and unrestricted overground walking protocols. The full-body gait patterns of twenty healthy subjects were captured during five walking trials (at least 5 minutes) on a treadmill under different weight perturbation conditions. The collected time series were cut into multiple shorter time series of varying lengths and subsequently concatenated using a novel algorithm that identifies similar poses in successive time series in order to determine an optimal concatenation time point. After alignment of the datasets, the approach then concatenated the data to provide a smooth transition. Nonlinear measures to assess stability (Largest Lyapunov Exponent, LyE) and regularity (Sample Entropy, SE) were calculated in order to quantify the efficacy of the concatenation approach using intra-class correlation coefficients, standard error of measurement and paired effect sizes. Our results indicate overall good agreement between the full uninterrupted and the concatenated time series for LyE. However, SE was more sensitive to the proposed concatenation algorithm and might lead to false interpretation of physiological gait signals. This approach opens perspectives for analysis of dynamic stability of gait data from physiological overground walking protocols, but also the re-processing and estimation of nonlinear metrics from previously collected datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2951002500,"Background Studies exploring adolescents’ perception of health are still scarce in the international literature. Through a qualitative analysis, this study aims to explore the core categories or themes evoked when adolescents describe what it means to be healthy and unhealthy. Methods A convenience purposive sample of 34 15-year-old students from three different upper secondary schools took part in a 2-hour group discussion session. During the session, two conceptual projective techniques, the collage creation and the think-aloud technique, were used to elicit perceptions and descriptions of the typical healthy and unhealthy adolescent. Perceptions and descriptions voiced by adolescents were analysed through content analysis, and the key concepts that emerged were grouped so that core categories or themes could be identified. Results The analysis revealed five core categories that adolescents used to describe what being healthy or unhealthy meant to them: physical appearance, personal commitment and goals, possessions and space, use of free time, and social belonging. Conclusions Instead of those approaches that focuses solely on the avoidance of risk, the identified core categories or themes might be the basics around which health promotion programmes in adolescence should be built. Engaging students in planning for their future and assisting them in mapping out crucial steps to meet their personal goals, including life, academic, and career goals, is a suitable way to address issues that are meaningful to adolescent health."
https://openalex.org/W2949645374,"Transparency of the cornea is essential for vision and is maintained by the corneal endothelium. Consequently, corneal endothelial decompensation arising from irreversible damage to the corneal endothelium causes severe vision impairment. Until recently, transplantation of donor corneas was the only therapeutic choice for treatment of endothelial decompensation. In 2013, we initiated clinical research into cell-based therapy involving injection of a suspension of cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs), in combination with Rho kinase inhibitor, into the anterior chamber. The aim of the present study was to establish a protocol for cryopreservation of HCECs to allow large-scale commercial manufacturing of these cells. This study focused on the effects of various cryopreservation reagents on HCEC viability. Screening of several commercially available cryopreservation reagents identified Bambanker hRM as an effective agent that maintained a cell viability of 89.4% after 14 days of cryopreservation, equivalent to the cell viability of 89.2% for non-cryopreserved control cells. The use of Bambanker hRM and HCECs at a similar grade to that used clinically for cell based therapy (passage 3–5 and a cell density higher than 2000 cells/mm2) gave a similar cell density for cryopreserved HCECs to that of non-preserved control HCECs after 28 days of cultivation (2099 cells/mm2 and 2111 cells/mm2, respectively). HCECs preserved using Bambanker hRM grew in a similar fashion to non-preserved control HCECs and formed a monolayer sheet-like structure. Cryopreservation of HCECs has multiple advantages including the ability to accumulate stocks of master cells, to transport HCEC stocks, and to manufacture HCECs on demand for use in cell-based treatment of endothelial decompensation."
https://openalex.org/W2952627416,"User reliability is notably crucial for personalized cloud services. In cloud computing environments, large amounts of cloud services are provided for users. With the exponential increase in number of cloud services, it is difficult for users to select the appropriate services from equivalent or similar candidate services. The quality-of-service (QoS) has become an important criterion for selection, and the users can conduct personalized selection according to the observed QoS data of other users; however, it is difficult to ensure that the users are reliable. Actually, unreliable users may provide unreliable QoS data and have negative effects on the personalized cloud service selection. Therefore, how to determine reliable QoS data for personalized cloud service selection remains a significant problem. To measure the reliability for each user, we present a cloud service selection framework based on user reputation and propose a new user reputation calculation approach, which is named MeURep and includes L1-MeURep and L2-MeURep. Experiments are conducted, and the results confirm that MeURep has higher efficiency than previously proposed approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2952978237,"This study uses satellite telemetry to track post-nesting movements of endangered green turtles (Chelonia mydas) (n = 6) in the Gulf of Guinea. It identifies a migratory corridor linking breeding grounds of Atlantic green turtles nesting on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, to foraging grounds in the coastal waters of Accra, Ghana. Track lengths of 20-198 days were analyzed, for a total of 536 movement days for the six turtles. Migratory pathways and foraging grounds were identified by applying a switching state space model to locational data, which provides daily position estimates to identify shifts between migrating and foraging behavior. Turtles exhibited a combination of coastal and oceanic migrations pathways that ranged from 957 km to 1,131 km. Of the six turtles, five completed their migration and maintained residency at the same foraging ground near the coastal waters of Accra, Ghana until transmission was lost. These five resident turtles inhabit heavily fished waters and are vulnerable to a variety of anthropogenic threats. The identification of these foraging grounds highlights the importance of these coastal waters for the protection of the endangered Atlantic green turtle."
https://openalex.org/W2950777106,"Missense mutations in the human TUBB3 gene cause a variety of neurological disorders associated with defects in axon guidance and neuronal migration, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Recent studies have shown that direct coupling of dynamic TUBB3 in microtubules with netrin receptors is required for netrin-1-mediated axon guidance, and the interaction of netrin-1 repulsive receptor UNC5C with TUBB3 is involved in netrin-1 mediated axonal repulsion. Here, we report that TUBB3 mutations perturb netrin-1/UNC5C repulsive signaling in the developing nervous system. Among twelve mutants reported in previous studies, five of them show significantly reduced interaction with UNC5C in comparison to the wild-type TUBB3. TUBB3 mutants R262C and R62Q exhibit decreased subcellular colocalization with UNC5C in the peripheral area of the growth cone of primary mouse neurons. Netrin-1 reduces the colocalization of UNC5C with wild-type TUBB3, but not TUBB3 mutants R262C or R62Q, in the growth cone. Results from the in vitro cosedimentation assay indicate that netrin-1 inhibits cosedimentation of UNC5C with polymerized microtubules in primary mouse neurons expressing the wild-type TUBB3, but not R262C or R62Q. Expression of either R262C or R62Q not only blocks netrin-1-induced growth cone collapse and axonal repulsion of primary EGL cells in vitro, but also results in axon projections defects of chicken dorsal root ganglion neurons in ovo. Our study reveals that human TUBB3 mutations specifically perturb netrin-1/UNC5C-mediated repulsion."
https://openalex.org/W2951378607,"A number of mathematical models have been suggested to describe cell polarization in eukaryotic cells. One class of models takes into account that certain proteins are conserved on the time scale of cell polarization and may switch between a fast and a slow diffusing state. We raise the question whether models sharing this design feature can be condensed into one system-spanning model. We show exemplarily for the mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model of Otsuji et al. (Otsuji M et al. (2007) PLoS Comput Biol 3(6):e108) that cell polarization can be classified as active phase separation. This includes a fundamental connection between a number of non-equilibrium demixing phenomena such as cell polarization to phase separation. As shown recently, generic properties of active phase separation close to its onset are described by the Cahn-Hilliard model. By a systematic perturbation analysis we directly map the basic cell polarization model to the universal Cahn-Hilliard model. Comparing the numerical solutions of the polarization model and the Cahn-Hilliard equation also provides the parameter range where the basic cell polarization model behaves like other systems showing active phase separation. Polarization models of the active phase separation type cover essential properties of cell polarization, e.g. the adaptability of cell polarity to the length of growing cells. Our approach highlights how basic principles of pattern formation theory allow the identification of common basic properties in different models for cell polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2951002158,"Object handovers between humans are common in our daily life but the mechanisms underlying handovers are still largely unclear. A good understanding of these mechanisms is important not only for a better understanding of human social behaviors, but also for the prospect of an automatized society in which machines will need to perform similar objects exchanges with humans. In this paper, we analyzed how humans determine the location of object transfer during handovers- to determine whether they can predict the preferred handover location of a partner, the variation of this prediction in 3D space, and to examine how much of a role vision plays in the whole process. For this we developed a paradigm that allows us to compare handovers by humans with and without on-line visual feedback. Our results show that humans have the surprising ability to modulate their handover location according to partners they have just met such that the resulting handover errors are in the order of few centimeters, even in the absence of vision. The handover errors are least along the axis joining the two partners, suggesting a limited role for visual feedback in this direction. Finally, we show that the handover locations are explained very well by a linear model considering the heights, genders and social dominances of the two partners, and the distance between them. We developed separate models for the behavior of ‘givers’ and ‘receivers’ and discuss how the behavior of the same individual changes depending on his role in the handover."

These results were confirmed by the exposure-effect curve obtained from a cubic spline model.This study shows that smokers are more likely to develop PMS and PMDD."
https://openalex.org/W2951329060,"Background From a biological and clinical perspective, it is imperative to establish primate spermatogonial cultures. Due to limited availability of human testicular tissues, the macaque (Macaca fascicularis) was employed as non-human primate model. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of somatic as well as germ cell markers in testicular tissues and to establish macaque testicular primary cell cultures. Materials and methods Characterization of macaque testicular cell population was performed by immunohistochemical analyses for somatic cell markers (SOX9, VIM, SMA) as well as for germ cell markers (UTF1, MAGEA4, VASA). Testicular cells from adult macaque testes (n = 4) were isolated and cultured for 21 days using three stem cell culture media (SSC, PS and SM). An extended marker gene panel (SOX9, VIM, ACTA2; UTF1, FGFR3, MAGEA4, BOLL, DDX4) was then employed to assess the changes in gene expression levels and throughout the in vitro culture period. Dynamics of the spermatogonial population was further investigated by quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence-labeled MAGEA4-positive cells (n = 3). Results RNA expression analyses of cell cultures revealed that parallel to decreasing SOX9-expressing Sertoli cells, maintenance of VIM and ACTA2-expressing somatic cells was observed. Expression levels of germ cell marker genes UTF1, FGFR3 and MAGEA4 were maintained until day 14 in SSC and SM media. Findings from MAGEA4 immunofluorescence staining corroborate mRNA expression profiling and substantiate the overall maintenance of MAGEA4-positive pre- and early meiotic germ cells until day 14. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate maintenance of macaque germ cell subpopulations in vitro. This study provides novel perspective and proof that macaques could be used as a research model for establishing in vitro germ cell-somatic cell cultures, to identify ideal culture conditions for long-term maintenance of primate germ cell subpopulation in vitro."

Core processes operating at local scales, such as species-environment matching and species interactions, shape observed assemblages. Artificial habitats (simplified structure) are useful systems for assessing the main factors affecting community composition and disentangling their assembly rules. Drinking troughs (brickwork tanks for free-ranging cattle watering) are widespread in Italy and represent a suitable aquatic habitat for colonization by various aquatic organisms. Dragonflies larvae are usually found in drinking troughs and often exhibit strong species interactions and striking community assembly patterns. Our primary aim was to search for Odonata communities exhibiting non-random co-occurrence/segregation patterns in drinking troughs. We performed null-model analyses by measuring a co-occurrence index (C-score) on larval Odonata assemblages (13 species from 28 distinct troughs). Overall, we found a non-random structure for the studied dragonfly assemblages, which, given their fast generation time, must have been generated by short-term ecological processes (i.e. interspecific interactions). We thus analyzed potential competition/predation among and within ecological guilds. From the field data, we speculated that interactions within the sprawlers’ guild is likely among the main drivers structuring the studied assemblages, especially the effect of intraguild predation between C. erythraea and Sympetrum spp larval stages. We then experimentally tested these interactions in laboratory and demonstrated that intraguild predation among larvae at different development stages may result in an effective exclusion/negative impact on density pattern, representing one of the processes to take into consideration when studying dragonfly assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W2949310220,"The differences in archaeal diversity and community composition in the sediments and waters of the Qinhuangdao coastal aquaculture zone were investigated. Furthermore, the associations between dominant archaeal taxa with geographic and environmental variables were evaluated. High-throughput sequencing of archaeal 16S rRNA genes yielded a total of 176,211 quality-filtered reads and 1,178 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) overall. The most abundant phylum and class among all communities were Thaumarchaeota and Nitrososphaeria, respectively. Beta diversity analysis indicated that community composition was divided into two groups according to the habitat type (i.e., sediments or waters). Only 9.8% OTUs were shared by communities from the two habitats, while 73.9% and 16.3% of the OTUs were unique to sediment or water communities, respectively. Furthermore, the relative abundances of the dominant OTUs differed with habitat type. Investigations of relationships between dominant OTUs and environmental variables indicated that some dominant OTUs were more sensitive to variation in environmental factors, which could be due to individual taxonomic differences in lifestyles and biological processes. Overall, the investigation of archaeal community variation within the Qinhuangdao coastal aquaculture zone provides an important baseline understanding of the microbial ecology in this important ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2952063947,"We evaluated the ability of a virtual reality (VR) system to reliably detect the reaching frequency midline position of a user; the distinguishing plane between free-choice use of the left and right hand. The paradigm utilized the Leap Motion Hand Tracker along with a custom script written in C# and was realized through a Unity3D application. Stimuli appeared in random locations on the computer screen and required the participant to reach with the hand of their choice to contact them with a virtually coupled hand inside the virtual space. We investigated the effects of two manipulations of effort on the free-choice reaching of either the left or right hand. We varied the height of target positions and applied an additional weight to the non-dominant, left hand. We observed main effects of height and weight on reaching frequency midline positions across the group. We found increased use of the dominant hand as stimuli height increased, as well as a significant increase in overall use of the dominant, right hand when a weighted-glove was worn by the non-dominant, left hand. Our results are in line with previously published research on hand selection from similar paradigms, supporting the use of our VR paradigm in future experiments and applications."
https://openalex.org/W2953080163,"OJECTIVE Clinical consequences of ectopic tendons of the pectoralis minor muscle (PMM) for shoulder pain and range-of-motion limitation have been demonstrated. For better understanding the existence of such ectopic tendons, a phylogenetic hypothesis is proposed. METHODS Forty-five shoulders of anatomical specimens were dissected and examined. Insertions areas of PMM were measured and occurring aberrant tendons were identified. Their relationship with the coracohumeral ligament (CHL) described and samples of the ligament were collected and histologically stained. RESULTS The prevalence of PMM variations was 37.84%. Shoulders with variations showed a statistically significant smaller coracopectoral distance (p<0.001) and larger insertion areas (p<0.003) than shoulders without. A strong negative correlation between these two variables (p<0.001, r = -0.620) was shown. CONCLUSIONS The presented results prompted the conclusion that the CHL may be in fact the remnant of the pectoralis minor tendon (PMT), which migrated from the humerus to the coracoid process through the process of phylogenetic evolution. Variations of PMTs are significantly more common than in previous studies. Imaging techniques appear to be insufficiently sensitive for reliably detecting ectopic tendons. Especially in patients experiencing shoulder pain and stiffness in whom the commoner pathologies have been ruled out the possibility of ectopic PMT should be kept in mind and ruled out."

Here, we investigate the effects of gallium phosphide nanowires on human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Four different geometries of nanowires were suspended in the cell culture for 48 hours. We show that cells internalize the nanowires and that the nanowires have no effect on cell proliferation rate, motility, viability and intracellular ROS levels. By blocking specific internalization pathways, we demonstrate that the nanowire uptake is the result of a combination of processes, requiring dynamin and actin polymerization, which suggests an internalization through macropinocytosis and phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2949547499,"Area-level indices are widely used to assess the impact of socio-environmental characteristics on cancer outcomes. While area-level measures of socioeconomic status (SES) have been previously used in cancer settings, fewer studies have focused on evaluating the impact of area-level health services supply (HSS) characteristics on cancer outcomes. Moreover, there is significant variation in the methods and constructs used to create area-level indices.In this study, we introduced a psychometrically-induced, reproducible approach to develop area-level HSS and SES indices. We assessed the utility of these indices in detecting the effects of area-level characteristics on prostate, breast, and lung cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis in the US. The information on county-level SES and HSS characteristics were extracted from US Census, County Business Patterns data and Area Health Resource Files. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify individuals diagnosed with cancer from 2010 to 2012. SES and HSS indices were developed and linked to 3-year age-adjusted cancer incidence rates. SES and HSS indices empirically summarized the level of employment, education, poverty and income, and the availability of health care facilities and health professionals within counties.SES and HSS models demonstrated good fit (TLI = 0.98 and 0.96, respectively) and internal consistency (alpha = 0.85 and 0.95, respectively). Increasing SES and HSS were associated with increasing prostate and breast cancer and decreasing lung cancer incidence rates. The results varied by stage at diagnosis and race.Composite county-level measures of SES and HSS were effective in ranking counties and detecting gradients in cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis. Thus, these measures provide valuable tools for monitoring geographic disparities in cancer outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2952998960,"Background In 1988, Halabja came under heavy chemical warfare attack using chemicals such as sulfur mustard (SM). Thousands of survivors of SM exposure in the city today live with multiple health complaints, such as severe, long-lasting respiratory symptoms; but their perceptions of health have never been adequately researched. We aimed to explore current major health concern topics in civilian survivors with long-term respiratory symptoms. Method Sixteen subjects (f:m10:6, mean age 45.5 years (range 34–67)) were interviewed. Study participants were recruited in 2016 via a purposive sampling strategy among civilian survivors of chemical warfare in the city of Halabja in Kurdistan-Iraq. A qualitative research design was applied including semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. Data was analyzed using systematic text condensation. Results The analysis yielded fourteen themes related to: (1) General health: all participants described a deterioration in physical and psychological health, following the SM exposure, foremost involving respiratory symptoms, fatigue, sleeping disorders, ocular problems, depressive symptoms, and anxiety; (2) Quality of life: most notably, they reported a limited family life, limited social relations, lack of work ability, and concern about their financial situation. Moreover, many lived in constant fear of a renewed attack; (3) access to health care services: all participants reported that they had no, or only poor, access to health care services and limited access to specialist care, and all reported lack of financial resources to obtain treatment. Conclusions The post-exposure somatic and psychosocial effects such as respiratory symptoms of CWA are plausible contributor to poor general health and quality of life among survivors. We conclude that multidisciplinary interventions are needed to tackle the biopsychosocial complications in survivors of SM exposure to minimize further health damage in the future, as well as to promote their health-related quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2950635705,"Two types of gammaherpesviruses (γEHV) are known to infect horses, EHV-2 and EHV-5. Foals become infected early in life, probably via the upper respiratory tract, despite maternal antibodies. In this study, we analyzed samples from a herd of mares and their foals. The foals were followed from birth to 22 months of age and the dams during the first 6 months postpartum. Blood and nasal swab samples were taken regularly for evaluation of antibody responses, virus isolation and viral load by qPCR. EHV-2 was isolated on day 5, and EHV-5 on day 12, earlier than previously reported. γEHV specific antibodies were not detectable in serum of foals before colostrum intake but peaked a few days after colostrum. Overall, EHV-2 viral load peaked in nasal swab at three to four months of age, paralleled with decline in maternal antibodies, but EHV-5 viral load did not peak until month 12. Maternal antibodies had a notable effect on the viral load and induction of endogenous antibody production. Foals were grouped in two groups depending on the mare’s γEHV specific total IgG levels in serum at birth, group-high and group-low. Group-high had higher levels of maternal γEHV specific total IgG and IgG4/7 for the first 3 months, but when the endogenous production had superseded maternal antibodies, group-low was higher. The maternal antibodies had an effect on the γEHV viral load. Group-low peaked in EHV-2 viral load one month earlier than group-high. These effects were more evident for EHV-5, as there were seven months between the viral load peaks for the groups. The study provides information on how maternal antibody transfer affects γEHV shedding and antibody production in offspring. It also extends our knowledge on the occurrence of EHV-2 and EHV-5 infection in foals during the first two years of life."
https://openalex.org/W2951784550,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a fetal condition that affects up to 10% of all pregnancies and is associated with cardiovascular structural and functional remodelling that persists postnatally. Some studies have reported an increase in myocardial coronary blood flow in severe IUGR fetuses which has been directly associated to the dilatation of the coronary arteries. However, a direct measurement of the coronaries' lumen diameter in IUGR has not been reported before. The aim of this paper is to perform, for the first time, a quantitative analysis of the effects of IUGR in cardiac geometry and coronary vessel size in a well-known rabbit model of IUGR using synchrotron-based X-ray Phase Contrast Tomography Imaging (X-PCI). Eight rabbit fetal hearts were imaged non-destructively with X-PCI. 3D reconstructions of the coronary arterial tree were obtained after semi-automatic image segmentation. Different morphometric features including vessel lumen diameter of the three main coronaries were automatically quantified. IUGR fetuses had more globular hearts and dilated coronary arteries as compared to controls. We have quantitatively shown that IUGR leads to structural coronary vascular tree remodelling and enlargement as an adaptation mechanism in response to an adverse environment of restricted oxygen and nutrients and increased perfusion pressure."

The proposed QDI BCLARC is found to be faster and energy-efficient than the existing asynchronous adders which are QDI and non-QDI (i.e., relative-timed). Compared to existing asynchronous adders corresponding to various architectures such as the ripple carry adder (RCA), the conventional carry lookahead adder (CCLA), the carry select adder (CSLA), the BCLARC, and the hybrid BCLARC-RCA, the proposed BCLARC is found to be faster and more energy-optimized. The cycle time (CT), which is expressed as the sum of the worst-case times taken for processing the data and the spacer, governs the speed. The product of average power dissipation and CT viz. the power-cycle time product (PCTP) defines the low power/energy efficiency. For a 32-bit addition, the proposed QDI BCLARC achieves the following reductions in design metrics on average over its counterparts when considering RTZ and RTO handshaking: i) 20.5% and 19.6% reductions in CT and PCTP respectively compared to an optimum QDI early output RCA, ii) 16.5% and 15.8% reductions in CT and PCTP respectively compared to an optimum relative-timed RCA, iii) 32.9% and 35.9% reductions in CT and PCTP respectively compared to an optimum uniform input-partitioned QDI early output CSLA, iv) 47.5% and 47.2% reductions in CT and PCTP respectively compared to an optimum QDI early output CCLA, v) 14.2% and 27.3% reductions in CT and PCTP respectively compared to an optimum QDI early output BCLARC, and vi) 12.2% and 11.6% reductions in CT and PCTP respectively compared to an optimum QDI early output hybrid BCLARC-RCA.

https://openalex.org/W2950453857,"Purpose Responding to emergency alarms is a daily occurrence for personnel in safety-critical occupations, and is associated with negative health outcomes in this population. The purpose of the present study was to determine the acute inflammatory response to an isolated emergency alarm mobilisation in both day and night conditions. Methods Sixteen healthy males (mean age 25 ± 4 years) spent four days and nights in a sleep laboratory and were required to mobilise to an emergency alarm either during the day (1558 h), or from nocturnal sleep (0358 h). Pro (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine responses to each alarm mobilisation were compared to time-matched control conditions without the alarm and mobilisation stimulus. Results Analysis revealed no significant drift of cytokine levels at 1400 h across the study (P≥0.139). The plasma concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 was 84% greater in the 2-h sampling period following night alarm mobilisation compared to a night control of gentle awakening (P = 0.049), no other condition-by-time interactions were observed. The majority of inflammatory concentrations did not significantly change between alarm mobilisation and control conditions, in either day or night trials. Conclusions These findings may reflect the lack of a true emergency (and the perceived stress) for the alarm mobilisation, together with the neutralising effect of different circadian biorhythms on inflammatory cytokine concentrations."

> “Professors told me that a move to industry would be a path of no return.” 

When I finished my undergraduate training 14 years ago, I wanted to continue in academic research. But none of my applications for Ph.D. programs was successful. I wondered whether spending time in an industry job might help me stand out. At the same time, I worried that going to industry would compromise my chances of ultimately pursuing an academic career. Colleagues and professors told me that a move to industry would be a path of no return, and that big career changes could be rough. It felt like a momentous decision that would set the tone for the rest of my career.

Nonetheless, I decided to take the leap and accept a position at a biotech company. To my surprise, I loved working there. In fact, my experience was so positive that I changed plans. I did not want to do a Ph.D. anymore; I wanted a career in industry. I thought I had found my vocation, and that my path was clear.

But my position was just a 1-year contract, and when I started to look for my next industry job, I hit a bureaucratic obstacle. I was searching for jobs across Europe, and in many countries my undergraduate degree was not considered sufficient training for the positions I wanted. So much for that supposedly clear path.

It looked like it was time for another pivot—back to where I had started, applying to Ph.D. programs. Again, I wondered whether moving back and forth between industry and academia might put me at a disadvantage with potential future employers. But my previous transition had taught me I should be open-minded and embrace opportunities as they come, even if they are not my top choice at the time. You never know how things are going to turn out. So, I tried not to be too anxious about changing course again.

During one interview for a Ph.D. program, the selection committee focused on how uncommon it was for someone working in industry to want to come back to academia. I had played my cards right; I stood out! The program accepted me, and I enjoyed my Ph.D. experience. I loved the science, had a great mentor, and lived in a fantastic city. Even though I had pictured a different course, I didn't have any regrets.

When I finished my Ph.D., I still wanted to return to industry. I thought my previous industry experience coupled with my improved credentials would make the transition relatively easy, but that did not end up being the case. I wasn't getting any job offers. I was disappointed, but I took some solace in remembering how well pivoting had worked out for me in the past. I was now much more comfortable moving from plan A to plan B—or even plan C.

So, I started to apply for postdoctoral positions. I got a great offer to start an independent line of research in a group with an outstanding working environment, and my time there has been great. In addition to my research, I've developed my entrepreneurial and leadership skills as co-founder and president of my Ph.D. program's alumni association. Looking back, plan B feels like a plan A—just as it did so many times before in my back-and-forth career. And now I'm ready to embark on plan C: setting out as an entrepreneur.

I accepted a job in industry when my mind was in academia. I found a job in academia when all I wanted was a job in industry. Yet I feel happy with my career path, and I look forward to the pivots yet to come.
