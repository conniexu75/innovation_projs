https://openalex.org/W2006559495,"mTOR/RAFT1/FRAP is the target of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin and the central component of a nutrient- and hormone-sensitive signaling pathway that regulates cell growth. We report that mTOR forms a stoichiometric complex with raptor, an evolutionarily conserved protein with at least two roles in the mTOR pathway. Raptor has a positive role in nutrient-stimulated signaling to the downstream effector S6K1, maintenance of cell size, and mTOR protein expression. The association of raptor with mTOR also negatively regulates the mTOR kinase activity. Conditions that repress the pathway, such as nutrient deprivation and mitochondrial uncoupling, stabilize the mTOR-raptor association and inhibit mTOR kinase activity. We propose that raptor is a missing component of the mTOR pathway that through its association with mTOR regulates cell size in response to nutrient levels."
https://openalex.org/W2104290916,"Mammalian circadian rhythms are generated by a feedback loop in which BMAL1 and CLOCK, players of the positive limb, activate transcription of the cryptochrome and period genes, components of the negative limb. Bmal1 and Per transcription cycles display nearly opposite phases and are thus governed by different mechanisms. Here, we identify the orphan nuclear receptor REV-ERBα as the major regulator of cyclic Bmal1 transcription. Circadian Rev-erbα expression is controlled by components of the general feedback loop. Thus, REV-ERBα constitutes a molecular link through which components of the negative limb drive antiphasic expression of components of the positive limb. While REV-ERBα influences the period length and affects the phase-shifting properties of the clock, it is not required for circadian rhythm generation."
https://openalex.org/W2023012828,"mTOR controls cell growth, in part by regulating p70 S6 kinase α (p70α) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1). Raptor is a 150 kDa mTOR binding protein that also binds 4EBP1 and p70α. The binding of raptor to mTOR is necessary for the mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation of 4EBP1 in vitro, and it strongly enhances the mTOR kinase activity toward p70α. Rapamycin or amino acid withdrawal increases, whereas insulin strongly inhibits, the recovery of 4EBP1 and raptor on 7-methyl-GTP Sepharose. Partial inhibition of raptor expression by RNA interference (RNAi) reduces mTOR-catalyzed 4EBP1 phosphorylation in vitro. RNAi of C. elegans raptor yields an array of phenotypes that closely resemble those produced by inactivation of Ce-TOR. Thus, raptor is an essential scaffold for the mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and mediates TOR action in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2000350495,"Brassinosteroids regulate plant growth and development through a protein complex that includes the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) brassinosteroid-insensitive 1 (BRI1). Activation tagging was used to identify a dominant genetic suppressor of bri1, bak1-1D (bri1-associated receptor kinase 1-1Dominant), which encodes an LRR-RLK, distinct from BRI1. Overexpression of BAK1 results in elongated organ phenotypes, while a null allele of BAK1 displays a semidwarfed phenotype and has reduced sensitivity to brassinosteroids (BRs). BAK1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase, and BRI1 and BAK1 interact in vitro and in vivo. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant allele of BAK1 causes a severe dwarf phenotype, resembling the phenotype of null bri1 alleles. These results indicate BAK1 is a component of BR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4248219898,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect microorganisms and protect multicellular organisms from infection. TLRs transduce their signals through MyD88 and the serine/threonine kinase IRAK. The IRAK family consists of two active kinases, IRAK and IRAK-4, and two inactive kinases, IRAK-2 and IRAK-M. IRAK-M expression is restricted to monocytes/macrophages, whereas other IRAKs are ubiquitous. We show here that IRAK-M is induced upon TLR stimulation and negatively regulates TLR signaling. IRAK-M prevented dissociation of IRAK and IRAK-4 from MyD88 and formation of IRAK-TRAF6 complexes. IRAK-M(-/-) cells exhibited increased cytokine production upon TLR/IL-1 stimulation and bacterial challenge, and IRAK-M(-/-) mice showed increased inflammatory responses to bacterial infection. Endotoxin tolerance, a protection mechanism against endotoxin shock, was significantly reduced in IRAK-M(-/-) cells. Thus, IRAK-M regulates TLR signaling and innate immune homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1978179863,"The Arabidopsis BAK1 (BRI1 Associated receptor Kinase 1) was identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen as a specific interactor for BRI1, a critical component of a membrane brassinosteroid (BR) receptor. In yeast, BAK1/BRI1 interaction activates their kinase activities through transphosphorylation. BAK1 and BRI1 share similar gene expression and subcellular localization patterns and physically associate with each other in plants. Overexpression of the BAK1 gene leads to a phenotype reminiscent of BRI1-overexpression transgenic plants and rescues a weak bri1 mutant. In contrast, a bak1 knockout mutation gives rise to a weak bri1-like phenotype and enhances a weak bri1 mutation. We propose that BAK1 and BRI1 function together to mediate plant steroid signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2119963782,"Transcriptional regulation by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is mediated by hormone binding, receptor dimerization, and coactivator recruitment. Here, we report the crystal structure of the human GR ligand binding domain (LBD) bound to dexamethasone and a coactivator motif derived from the transcriptional intermediary factor 2. Despite structural similarity to other steroid receptors, the GR LBD adopts a surprising dimer configuration involving formation of an intermolecular β sheet. Functional studies demonstrate that the novel dimer interface is important for GR-mediated activation. The structure also reveals an additional charge clamp that determines the binding selectivity of a coactivator and a distinct ligand binding pocket that explains its selectivity for endogenous steroid hormones. These results establish a framework for understanding the roles of protein-hormone and protein-protein interactions in GR signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2089812281,"We isolated mutations in Arabidopsis to understand how the female gametophyte controls embryo and endosperm development. For the DEMETER (DME) gene, seed viability depends only on the maternal allele. DME encodes a large protein with DNA glycosylase and nuclear localization domains. DME is expressed primarily in the central cell of the female gametophyte, the progenitor of the endosperm. DME is required for maternal allele expression of the imprinted MEDEA (MEA) Polycomb gene in the central cell and endosperm. Ectopic DME expression in endosperm activates expression of the normally silenced paternal MEA allele. In leaf, ectopic DME expression induces MEA and nicks the MEA promoter. Thus, a DNA glycosylase activates maternal expression of an imprinted gene in the central cell."
https://openalex.org/W2022174079,"Phagocytosis is a key aspect of our innate ability to fight infectious diseases. In this study, we have found that fusion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the macrophage plasmalemma, underneath phagocytic cups, is a source of membrane for phagosome formation in macrophages. Successive waves of ER become associated with maturing phagosomes during phagolysosome biogenesis. Thus, the ER appears to possess unexpectedly pluripotent fusion properties. ER-mediated phagocytosis is regulated in part by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and used for the internalization of inert particles and intracellular pathogens, regardless of their final trafficking in the host. In neutrophils, where pathogens are rapidly killed, the ER is not used as a major source of membrane for phagocytosis. We propose that intracellular pathogens have evolved to adapt and exploit ER-mediated phagocytosis to avoid destruction in host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2114353725,"Defining the molecular mechanisms that integrate diverse signaling pathways at the level of gene transcription remains a central issue in biology. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) causes nuclear export of a specific N-CoR corepressor complex, resulting in derepression of a specific subset of NF-kappaB-regulated genes, exemplified by the tetraspanin KAI1 that regulates membrane receptor function. Nuclear export of the N-CoR/TAB2/HDAC3 complex by IL-1beta is temporally linked to selective recruitment of a Tip60 coactivator complex. Surprisingly, KAI1 is also directly activated by a ternary complex, dependent on the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60, consisting of the presenilin-dependent C-terminal cleavage product of the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), Fe65, and Tip60, identifying a specific in vivo gene target of an APP-dependent transcription complex in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2082867992,"Smad3 is a direct mediator of transcriptional activation by the TGFbeta receptor. Its target genes in epithelial cells include cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that generate a cytostatic reponse. We defined how, in the same context, Smad3 can also mediate transcriptional repression of the growth-promoting gene c-myc. A complex containing Smad3, the transcription factors E2F4/5 and DP1, and the corepressor p107 preexists in the cytoplasm. In response to TGFbeta, this complex moves into the nucleus and associates with Smad4, recognizing a composite Smad-E2F site on c-myc for repression. Previously known as the ultimate recipients of cdk regulatory signals, E2F4/5 and p107 act here as transducers of TGFbeta receptor signals upstream of cdk. Smad proteins therefore mediate transcriptional activation or repression depending on their associated partners."
https://openalex.org/W2138505246,"As axons grow past intermediate targets, they change their responsiveness to guidance cues. Local upregulation of receptor expression is involved, but the mechanisms for this are not clear. Here protein synthesis is traced within individual axons by introducing RNAs encoding visualizable reporters. Individual severed axons and growth cones can translate proteins and also export them to the cell surface. As axons reach the spinal cord midline, EphA2 is among the receptors upregulated on at least some distal axon segments. Midline reporter upregulation is recapitulated by part of the EphA2 mRNA 3' untranslated region, which is highly conserved and includes known translational control sequences. These results show axons contain all the machinery for protein translation and cell surface expression, and they reveal a potentially general and flexible RNA-based mechanism for regulation localized within a subregion of the axon."
https://openalex.org/W2002888609,"Transcription factors and RNA polymerase II can be modified by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) monosaccharides at serine or threonine residues, yet the precise functional roles of this modification are largely unknown. Here, we show that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the enzyme that catalyzes this posttranslational modification, interacts with a histone deacetylase complex by binding to the corepressor mSin3A. Functionally, OGT and mSin3A cooperatively repress transcription in parallel with histone deacetylation. We propose that mSin3A targets OGT to promoters to inactivate transcription factors and RNA polymerase II by O-GlcNAc modification, which acts in concert with histone deacetylation to promote gene silencing in an efficient and specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1963802469,"LIM homeodomain codes regulate the development of many cell types, though it is poorly understood how these factors control gene expression in a cell-specific manner. Lhx3 is involved in the generation of two adjacent, but distinct, cell types for locomotion, motor neurons and V2 interneurons. Using in vivo function and protein interaction assays, we found that Lhx3 binds directly to the LIM cofactor NLI to trigger V2 interneuron differentiation. In motor neurons, however, Isl1 is available to compete for binding to NLI, displacing Lhx3 to a high-affinity binding site on the C-terminal region of Isl1 and thereby transforming Lhx3 from an interneuron-promoting factor to a motor neuron-promoting factor. This switching mechanism enables specific LIM complexes to form in each cell type and ensures that neuronal fates are tightly segregated."
https://openalex.org/W2057653416,"The sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide, the principal active component in medicinal plants, has been used conventionally to treat migraines, inflammation, and tumors. However, the antitumor effects of parthenolide and the mechanism(s) involved are poorly understood. We found that parthenolide effectively inhibits hepatoma cell growth in a tumor cell-specific manner and triggers apoptosis of hepatoma cells. Parthenolide triggered apoptosis in invasive sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma cells (SH-J1) as well as in other ordinary hepatoma cells at 5–10 μmconcentrations and arrested the cell growth (at G2/M) at sublethal concentrations (1–3 μm). During parthenolide-induced apoptosis, depletion of glutathione, generation of reactive oxygen species, reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, activation of caspases (caspases-7, -8, and -9), overexpression of GADD153 (an oxidative stress or anticancer agent inducible gene), and subsequent apoptotic cell death was observed. This induced apoptosis could be effectively inhibited or abrogated by an antioxidantN-acetyl-l-cysteine, whereas l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine enhanced it. Furthermore, stable overexpression of GADD153sensitized the cells to apoptosis induced by parthenolide, and this susceptibility could be reversed by transfection with an antisense toGADD153. Parthenolide did not alter the expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL proteins during apoptosis in hepatoma cells. Oxidative stress may contribute to parthenolide-induced apoptosis and to GADD153 overexpression in a glutathione-sensitive manner. The sensitivity of tumor cells to parthenolide appears to result from the low expression level of the multifunctional detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase π. Finally, parthenolide and its derivatives may be useful chemotherapeutic agents to treat these invasive cancers.

Science. 1977; 196: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Parthenolide, the major sesquiterpene lactone found in medicinal plants such as feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), is known to inhibit interleukin 1- and tumor necrosis factor α-mediated NF-κB activation, which is responsible for its anti-inflammatory activity (6Bork P.M. Schmitz M.L. Kuhnt M. Escher C. Heinrich M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar,7Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. J.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 5617-5623PubMed Google Scholar). Parthenolide also exerts an anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the expression of inducible cyclooxygenase, proinflammatory cytokines (8Hwang D. Fischer N.H. Jang B.C. Tak H. Kim J.K. Lee W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (9Fukuda K. Hibiya Y. Mutoh M. Ohno Y. Yamashita K. Akao S. Fujiwara H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cytotoxic and antitumor effects of sesquiterpene lactones have not been well studied because of their low potency. Recently it has been reported that parthenolide inhibits the in vitro growth of tumor cells in a cytostatic fashion, and it has been proposed that if their selectively cytotoxic or cytostatic actions against tumor cells can be established, sesquiterpene lactones may represent a new class of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs (10Ross J.J. Arnason J.T. Birnboim H.C. Planta Med. 1999; 65: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sarcomatoid changes of epithelial neoplasms (carcinomas with spindle-cell components) occur in many organs and histologic types. Sarcomatoid elements in liver cancers are derived from dedifferentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma. Although the incidences of spindle-cell hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma are less than 10% (11Haratake J. Horie A. Cancer. 1991; 68: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Maeda T. Adachi E. Kajiyama K. Takenaka K. Sugimachi K. Tsuneyoshi M. Cancer. 1996; 77: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and ∼5% (13Nakajima T. Tajima Y. Sugano I. Nagao K. Kondo Y. Wada K. Cancer. 1993; 72: 1872-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), respectively, the prognosis for patients with sarcomatoid liver carcinoma is worse than for those with ordinary carcinoma because of the aggressive intrahepatic spreading and the frequent metastasis of sarcomatous cells (12Maeda T. Adachi E. Kajiyama K. Takenaka K. Sugimachi K. Tsuneyoshi M. Cancer. 1996; 77: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, we have established a sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (designated as SH-J1) and have searched for agents that arrest their growth and/or induce their apoptosis. Intriguingly, we have now observed that parthenolide effectively inhibits the proliferation and induces the apoptosis of those sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma cells as well as other ordinary hepatoma cells. The underlying mechanism for the antitumor effects of parthenolide seems to be mediated by oxidative stress. This oxidative stress may subsequently be associated with overexpression ofGADD153, a growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene. Chang liver cells and human hepatoma cell lines, including Hep 3B, PLC/PRF/5, and SK-HEP-1, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). The sarcomatous SH-J1 cells were established in our laboratory (14Kim D.G. Park S.Y. Kim H. Chun Y.H. Moon W.S. Park S.H. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 2002; 132: 120-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine the effects on growth, cells were cultured on coverslips and treated with the indicated concentrations of parthenolide or vehicle (Me2SO) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) and were then stained with the Diff-Quick stain set (Dade Diagnostics of P. R. Inc., Aguada, Puerto Rico). To measure cytotoxic cell death, the cells were cultured in 6-cm culture dishes and exposed to the indicated concentrations of parthenolide. Cell death was determined by trypan blue dye assay, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated by Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) staining. At least 200 cells were counted for each time point, and all counting was done in a blinded fashion. SH-J1 cells were plated in 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at a density of 103 cells/well and treated with 1–3 μm parthenolide in medium for 48 h. The cells were labeled with 1 μCi [methyl-3H]thymidine/well (specific activity, 5 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h at 37 °C and then harvested on fiberglass filter paper strips with a multiple automated sample harvester (Inotech, Dottikon, Switzerland). Each sample was lysed hypotonically, and radioactivity was measured in a Tri-Carb 4530 liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Company). Measurements of cell cycle distribution and apoptotic/hypodiploid cells were performed using a modification of the technique described previously (15Kim D.G., Jo, B.H. You K.R. Ahn D.S. Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For synchronization, the cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml nocodazole (Calbiochem) to induce M block for 16 h, washed, and incubated in the presence or absence of 3 μm parthenolide. Data were analyzed as single-parameter frequency histograms in an SFIT model. The sub-G1 fraction was estimated by gating hypodiploid cells in the DNA histogram using a C-30 program. SH-J1 cells (1 × 106) were seeded in 6-cm Petri dishes and allowed to settle and attach. Cells were then treated with the indicated concentrations of parthenolide for 48 h. For analysis of genomic DNA, cells were harvested and collected together with nonattached cells in the supernatant. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, extracts were treated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K for an additional 16 h at 37 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and then with chloroform and precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate, and 5 μg of DNA was separated on a 2% agarose gel. DNA in the gel was stained with ethidium bromide, visualized under UV light, and photographed. The intracellular generation of ROS was measured using the oxidation-sensitive fluorescein 5,6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For measurement of ΔΨm, cells were treated with 10 μm parthenolide for the indicated times. 5,5′,6,6′-Tetraethylbenzimidazocarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) (Molecular Probes) was added to the medium at 5 μg/ml, and incubation was continued in the dark for 15 min (16You K.R. Wen J. Lee S.T. Kim D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3870-3877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Stained cells were harvested, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by flow cytometry. A BD Biosciences FACscan was used to analyze a minimum of 10,000 cells/sample. Forward and side scatter were used to gate the viable population of cells. At relatively high ΔΨm the dye JC-1 forms J-aggregates, which emit at 590 nm, in the red/orange range of visible light (FL-2 channel). However, in the absence of or at low ΔΨm, JC-1 exists as a monomer, remaining in the cell but emitting at 527 nm, in the green range (FL-1 channel). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum until they were 60% confluent at which time they were treated with 5 μmparthenolide for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted from treated or untreated cells using phenol and guanidine thiocyanate solution (Tri Reagent; Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNAs were then fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to membranes. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (16You K.R. Wen J. Lee S.T. Kim D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3870-3877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The blots were stripped and then rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe to normalize the amount of RNA loaded. Transfection of the GADD153 gene into SH-J1 cells was performed using an expression plasmid vector encoding human GADD153 cDNA or control pcDNA3. The construct of the GADD153 expression vector was made by ligating humanGADD153 (a gift from Dr. Nikki J. Holbrook, NIA, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD) with pcDNA3 at eachBamHI/XhoI site in the sense orientation. To generate the antisense GADD153 expression vector, humanGADD153 was PCR-amplified with the forward primer containing the XbaI restriction enzyme site (5′-GCTCTAGAGGGCTGCAGAGATGGC-3′) and the reverse primer containing theEcoRI restriction enzyme site (5′-GGAATTCGGGACTGATGCTCCCA-3′). The PCR-amplified GADD153double strand DNA was ligated to pcDNA3 at theXbaI/EcoRI site in the antisense orientation. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GADD153-transfected and neo-transfected cells were selected in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418 for 2–3 weeks. Finally, individual colonies were isolated using cloning rings, expanded, and assayed for expression of the transfected gene by Northern analysis and by Western analysis. pGADD-LUC, a hamsterGADD153 promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct, was a gift from Dr. Nikki J. Holbrook (17Fawcett T.W. Eastman H.B. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14285-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the pGADD-LUC construct using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) as noted above. Cells were plated at 2 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates, and 18 h later, the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 500 ng of GADD-LUC plasmid and 50 ng of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of Lipofectin for 16 h. The cells were then replenished with complete medium and treated with equitoxic levels of parthenolide. The cells were lysed in 120 μl of lysis buffer at the indicated time intervals and stored at −20 °C until measurement. Luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter Assay system (Promega) as instructed by the manufacturer and normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. Reduced glutathione was measured using a colorimetric assay kit (OXIS International, Inc., Portland, OR). Cells were treated with either parthenolide alone or in combination with the glutathione precursorN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) for 48 h or with the glutathione depleting agentl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO). Cells treated with BSO were incubated overnight and then treated with parthenolide after washing for 48 h. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min, and its supernatant was used for GSH measurement according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cell pellet dissolved in 1m NaOH was used for the measurement of protein content (18You K.R. Shin M.N. Park R.K. Lee S.O. Kim D.G. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The GSH content was expressed as nmol/mg of protein or percent of the control. Cell lysis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (18You K.R. Shin M.N. Park R.K. Lee S.O. Kim D.G. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from cells in lysis buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and lysis was confirmed by microscopy. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation through 30% sucrose (800 × g, 10 min at 4 °C), mitochondria were collected at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the remaining cell membranes were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C, as described previously. The supernatant (S-100 fraction) was used as the cytosolic extract. After adjustment for protein concentration, 30 μg of each cell lysate was boiled in Laemmli buffer and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE before immunoblot analysis with antibody against cytochrome c(Pharmingen). Signals were detected using an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences). The mouse anti-poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) monoclonal antibody (C2–10), rabbit anti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody, mouse anti-caspase-6 monoclonal antibody (B93-4), mouse anti-caspase-7 monoclonal antibody (B94-1), rabbit anti-caspase-8 polyclonal antibody (B9-2), and mouse anti-caspase-9 monoclonal antibody (B40) were purchased from Pharmingen. The mouse anti-Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (Ab-1) and mouse anti-Bcl-XL monoclonal antibody (H-5) were obtained from Calbiochem and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. All data were entered into Microsoft Excel 5.0. GraphPad Software was used to perform paired ttests. All p values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. To determine whether parthenolide inhibits cell proliferation, SH-J1 cells were cultured on coverslips and exposed to parthenolide at different concentrations (0–10 μm) for 48 h. The cells were fixed and stained with the Diff-Quick stain set, and cell numbers were histocytologically counted. Parthenolide effectively decreased cell numbers in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). To examine whether these cytotoxic effects of parthenolide are tumor cell-specific, SH-J1 cells and Chang liver cells (which were derived from normal liver tissue) were treated with 10 μmparthenolide for 48 h. Histocytological examination revealed that the nonmalignant Chang liver cells were resistant to parthenolide-mediated cell growth inhibition, as compared with SH-J1 cells. The cell numbers of Chang liver cells and SH-J1 cells are about 80 and 20% that of the untreated controls, respectively (Fig.1 B). The parthenolide-induced reduction of cell number may result from cell cycle inhibition or cytotoxic cell death. Thus, to measure quantitative cell death, SH-J1 cells, Chang liver cells, and ordinary hepatoma cells (Hep 3B, PLC/PRF/5, and SK-HEP-1) were cultured in 6-cm dishes and exposed to parthenolide at different concentrations (0–10 μm) for 48 h. The cells were harvested, and dead cells stained with trypan blue dye were counted. Parthenolide decreased SH-J1 cell survival in a dose-dependent manner, and the IC50 for cell survival was about 7.5 μm (Fig. 1 C). The quantitation of cell survival of SH-J1 and Chang liver cells was consistent with the histocytological examination (24.7 ± 2.2% versus80.0 ± 7.4%, p < 0.01). These results suggest that parthenolide exerts its cytotoxic effects in a tumor cell-specific manner. However, cytotoxic cell death was rarely detectable at lower concentrations (1–2.5 μm) of parthenolide. Hep 3B and PLC/PRF/5 cells were more susceptible to the drug-induced cell death than were SK-HEP-1 cells. To demonstrate whether parthenolide induces apoptotic cell death, DNA fragmentation was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. SH-J1 cells treated with parthenolide showed increased fragmentation of lower molecular weight DNAs at higher concentrations of parthenolide (between 5 and 10 μm) (Fig.1 D). Lower concentrations of parthenolide (0–2.5 μm) did not result in any DNA fragmentation. Cells with condensed or fragmented chromosomes and with membrane blebbing, both characteristics indicative of apoptotic morphologies, were examined by staining with Hoechst 33258 after treatment with parthenolide (5–10 μm) (Fig. 1 E). These results indicate that parthenolide effectively induces apoptosis at the relatively higher concentrations but not at the lower concentrations. Lower concentrations of parthenolide seem to reduce cell number by cell cycle inhibition. This was supported by the previous report that parthenolide inhibited cell growth in a cytostatic fashion and that the effect was reversible at lower concentrations (10Ross J.J. Arnason J.T. Birnboim H.C. Planta Med. 1999; 65: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, we quantitatively determined the effect of parthenolide on cell proliferation at sublethal concentrations (1–3 μm). Using a thymidine uptake assay, DNA synthesis was significantly inhibited by 8–51% in cells treated with 1–3 μmparthenolide (Fig. 2 A), which is consistent with a previous report (1Johnson E.S. Kadam N.P. Hylands D.M. Hylands P.J. Br. Med. J. 1985; 31: 569-573Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We next analyzed the impact of parthenolide on the cell cycle of SH-J1 cells. In asynchronized cells, parthenolide increased the fraction of cells in G2/M from 15 to 30% compared with untreated control cells at 12 h of culture (Fig. 2 B). Thus, we further studied the cell cycle inhibition in synchronized cells. For synchronization, SH-J1 cells were arrested in M phase with 0.5 μg/ml nocodazole. Cells were then analyzed at 3-h interval after release from the M block in the presence or absence of parthenolide. Cells treated with parthenolide clearly showed delayed cell cycling (G2/M arrest). In control cells, a normal cell cycle distribution appeared 12 h after release, whereas it appeared only after 36 h after release in cells treated with parthenolide. Treatment of SH-J1 cells with 10 μmparthenolide resulted in ∼80% apoptotic death within 48 h. Remarkably, in the presence of non-cytotoxic doses of general antioxidants, including NAC (800 μm), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (0.25 μm), and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (0.1 μm), the killing activity of parthenolide is effectively inhibited or abrogated (Fig.3 A). NAC was able to completely abrogate parthenolide-induced apoptosis (95 ± 5.5% inhibition, p < 0.01). Vitamin E (200 μm) and vitamin C (200 μm) also effectively inhibited parthenolide-induced apoptosis by 40 ± 3.5 and by 18 ± 2%, respectively (p < 0.05) (data not shown). Thus, the protection afforded by antioxidants against the induction of cell death by parthenolide suggests that free radicals may be involved in this phenomenon. To examine this possibility, we measured the levels of intracellular free radicals before and after exposure to parthenolide using the cell permeant dye DCFH-DA. Measurements of cellular fluorescence revealed that parthenolide generated a 3-fold increase of intracellular ROS in SH-J1 cells. A noncytotoxic dose of NAC completely suppressed parthenolide-induced ROS generation (Fig. 3 B). Reduction of ΔΨm is believed to be mediated by ROS. An assay to detect these changes of ΔΨm in mitochondrial function employs a fluorescent cation, JC-1, which emits a red color when sequestered in mitochondria of healthy cells but emits a green color when it is in the cytoplasmic compartment of apoptotic cells. Treatment of cells with 10 μm parthenolide for 48 h caused a disruption of ΔΨm, as evidenced by a shift in the fluorescence of the probe JC-1, from 3.3 ± 0.5% in the right lower quadrant fluorescence fraction in control cells to 78.3 ± 5.7% in parthenolide-treated cells (Fig. 3 C). The parthenolide-induced reduction in ΔΨm was completely abrogated by NAC (5.2 ± 0.4%). The sum of these results suggests that parthenolide induces ΔΨm dissipation in an antioxidant-sensitive pathway and indicates that parthenolide-mediated generation of ROS causes the reduction in ΔΨm. The ΔΨm disruption appears to be critical for the apoptosis cascade. To determine whether the loss of ΔΨm precedes cytochrome c release, we analyzed the time course of ΔΨm reduction and cytochrome c release. Flow cytometric measurements from 0 to 48 h after parthenolide treatment revealed that the percentage of cells with low ΔΨm in the right lower quadrant began to increase 12 h after the treatment started and reached a maximum at the end of the experimental period, in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). About 80% of the cells showed a collapsed ΔΨm 48 h after treatment. The time course of cytochrome release analyzed by Western immunoblot revealed that cytosolic cytochrome c appeared 12 h after parthenolide treatment (Fig. 4 B). Thus, our data suggest that the collapse in ΔΨm correlates with mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Because caspase activation plays a central role in the induction of apoptosis (19Grutter M.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), to understand the mechanism of parthenolide-induced apoptosis we examined its effect on the activation of initiator and effector caspases and cleavage of their substrate, PARP. The cleavage and/or the decreased level of the apoptotic substrate PARP and procaspase-7 (which is indicative of apoptotic cell death) were demonstrated along the time course, implying that cytochrome c release leads to apoptotic cell death through oxidative stress as previously described (20Yang J.C. Cortopassi G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Interestingly, parthenolide caused a decrease in the procaspase-7 level and its cleavage without changing the level of procaspases-3 or -6, implying that caspase-7 activation is the major effector pathway involved in parthenolide-induced apoptosis. Activation of initiator caspases-8 and -9 were observed in a time-dependent manner, as evidenced by decreased level or cleavage of their pro-caspases. To identify the gene(s) responsible for parthenolide-induced apoptosis, we screened genes known to be involved in drug-induced apoptosis through generation of ROS. We focused on GADD153, the growth arrest and DNA damage gene, because parthenolide triggered suddenGADD153 mRNA overexpression during exposure to the drug (Fig. 5 A). To determine the effect of parthenolide on the activation of the GADD153promoter, SH-J1 cells were transiently transfected with pGADD-LUC, which contains the hamster GADD153 promoter coupled to the luciferase reporter gene. The transfected cells were exposed to 5 μm parthenolide for 48 h (Fig. 5 B). The change in luciferase activity, expressed relative to the level in untreated control cells, indicated that parthenolide increasedGADD153 promoter activation maximally after 24 h of exposure, which preceded the increase of endogenous GADD153mRNA after 36 h of treatment with parthenolide. These results suggest that parthenolide transcriptionally regulatesGADD153 mRNA expression in SH-J1 cells. To further investigate the transcriptional regulation by parthenolide, the decline of GADD153 mRNA levels in parthenolide-treated cells was examined after parthenolide withdrawal and/or the addition of an inhibitor of transcription, actinomycin D. Subconfluent SH-J1 cells were treated with 5 μm parthenolide for 48 h to bring about the accumulation of GADD153 mRNA levels. Cells treated with parthenolide were then fed parthenolide-free medium to which actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) or vehicle was added (21Eymin B. Dubrez L. Allouche M. Solary E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 686-695PubMed Google Scholar). At various times thereafter, relative mRNA levels were calculated by comparing GAPDH-normalized values with the levels observed in cells at time 0 (Fig. 5 C). Parthenolide sustainedGADD153 mRNA after treatment for 9 h in the cells. In the presence of actinomycin D, parthenolide decreased theGADD153 mRNA levels as if parthenolide had been removed from the culture medium. These results imply that parthenolide regulates GADD153 mRNA levels transcriptionally in SH-J1 cells, in accordance with results from the in vitrotransfection experiment. Parthenolide-induced apoptosis was completely blocked by NAC, a glutathione precursor, but other general antioxidants, including pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, vitamin C, and vitamin E, did not block this apoptosis to the same extent, suggesting that the induction of oxidative stress by parthenolide may be related to glutathione depletion. Thus, we measured the cellular glutathione level during parthenolide-induced apoptosis. Parthenolide exposure resulted in a time-dependent decrease in cellular glutathione, which was about 75% that of the control level within 48 h (Fig.6 A). NAC (800 μm) abrogated the parthenolide-mediated glutathione depletion but increased the cellular glutathione level (171% ± 15.2%, p < 0.05), implying that parthenolide-induced glutathione depletion activates the glutathione rescue syste"

These observations led to the proposal that adipo may play important roles in glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance. To elucidate the in vivo role of adipo, we generatedAdipo −/− mice by gene targeting. We found that these mice had no glucose intolerance or insulin resistance under basal conditions or even after they were fed a high-fat diet for 7 months. Unexpectedly, we found that Adipo −/− mice had increased β-oxidation in muscle and liver. This study sheds light on the function of native adipo in vivo. We used a replacement-type targeting vector constructed from a mouse 129/Sv strain bacterial artificial chromosome genomic clone and R1 ES cell line for gene targeting (Fig. 1 A). Transfection and ES cell clone selection were as described (9Chang B.H.-J. Liao W., Li, L. Nakamuta M. Mack D. Chan L. J. Biol.

Nine positive ES clones were injected into blastocysts of C57BL/6J, and chimeric mice obtained were mated with C57BL/6J mice. Germ line transmission was confirmed by Southern blots using tail DNA. Northern blots were performed on total RNA isolated from white and brown adipose tissue using a 32P-labeled mouse full-length cDNA probe as described (9Chang B.H.-J. Liao W., Li, L. Nakamuta M.

Polyclonal rabbit antibody was raised against a C-terminal fragment of mouse adipo (residues 110–247) fused to glutathione S-transferase. Immunoblotting were performed as described previously using 3 μl of plasma (9Chang B.H.-J. Liao W., Li, L. Nakamuta M. Mack D. Chan L. J. Biol.

We measured in vivo glucose utilization by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method as described previously (12Fujita Y. Kojima H. Hidaka H. Fujimiya M. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Mice received an insulin infusion (10 milliunits/kg/min) for 90 min. The infusion rate of glucose solution (4%) was adjusted to a target plasma glucose level of 100 mg/dl. Plasma glucose was monitored every 3 min for 90 min. Total body glucose infusion rate was calculated as described (12Fujita Y. Kojima H. Hidaka H. Fujimiya M. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For high-fat diet feeding experiments, F6 C57BL/6JAdipo −/− and Adipo +/+mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (per Kg feed containing 210 g of milk fat and 341 g of sucrose) diet from Harlan Teklad (TD 88137) for 7 months. For quantitation of β-oxidation, we measured [14C]CO2 production from [1-14C]palmitic acid in isolated soleus muscle as described (13Alam N. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and in liver homogenates as described (14Yu X.X. Drackley J.K. Odle J. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Targeted mice were produced by the strategy shown in Fig.1, A and B. Germ line transmission was confirmed by Southern blotting (Fig.1 C). Initially, six Adipo −/− lines were obtained and we bred three of the lines into C57BL/6J. Experiments were performed with identical results in two independent lines. Homologous recombination removed exon 2 of Adipo, which contained the translation initiation codon. Adipo mRNA was absent in the knock-out mice (Fig. 1 D), and adipo protein was undetectable in the plasma of knockout mice (Fig. 1 E). As the immunoblot was performed with an antibody against the C-terminal fragment of adipo, together with the Northern blot, it excludes the expression of a truncated adipo from a downstream translation initiation codon. Adipo −/− mice were fertile, and the null allele was transmitted to the progeny in a Mendelian pattern. Adipo −/− mice were backcrossed into C57BL/6 for six generations.Adipo −/− and wild-type mice had identical body weights (data not shown) and similar fat pad weights (percent body weights, mean ± S.E.; male epididymal: −/−, 1.17 ± 0.19; +/+, 0.88 ± 0.19; female parametrial: −/−, 1.05 ± 0.11; +/+, 1.33 ± 0.09), as well as plasma lipids (TableIA) and leptin (mean ± S.E., male: −/−, 2.31 ± 0.34 ng/ml; +/+, 1.95 ± 0.41 ng/ml; female: −/−, 3.22 ± 0.38 ng/ml; +/+, 2.82 ± 0.55 ng/ml).Table ICharacterization of Adipo−/− miceA.

Open table in a new tab Data represent mean ± S.E. Intraperitoneal GTT performed on F2 and F3 mice revealed no difference between Adipo +/+ mice andAdipo −/− littermates (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that the uneven mixed genetic background of these early-generation mice might have masked subtle changes in glucose homeostasis, we backcrossed the mice into C57BL/6J and performed the experimental analyses in F6 mice. Like their F6 wild-type littermates, both male and female F6 Adipo −/− mice (with >99% C57BL/6J background) had normal fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels; furthermore, there was no difference in these parameters during a 2-h GTT (Fig. 2,A and B). We next performed an ITT, again detecting no difference in the plasma glucose response to insulin between F6 Adipo −/− mice andAdipo +/+ littermates (Fig. 2 C), which suggests that there was no impairment in insulin sensitivity. The GTT and ITT suggest that Adipo −/− mice have no significant glucose intolerance or insulin resistance. To assess insulin resistance with a more stringent test, we studied Adipo −/− and wild-type mice by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. As shown in Table IB, Adipo −/− andAdipo +/+ had similar serum steady-state insulin concentration. To maintain a similar serum glucose, the glucose infusion rate tended to be higher in Adipo −/−mice (suggesting that they tended to be more sensitive to insulin), although the difference betweenAdipo −/− and Adipo +/+mice was not significant. Therefore, compared withAdipo +/+ mice, Adipo −/−mice displayed no insulin resistance. To bring out potential subtle changes in Adipo −/−mice that were not evident under basal conditions, we fed these mice a HF/HS diet for 7 months. Plasma lipids ofAdipo −/− and Adipo +/+mice were similar (mean ± S.E., triglyceride: −/−, 73.08 ± 10.81 mg/dl; +/+, 79.60 ± 9.23 mg/dl; cholesterol: −/−, 238.88 ± 28.84 mg/dl; +/+, 261.71 ± 24.94 mg/dl; free fatty acids: 1.67 ± 0.53 mm; +/+, 1.69 ± 0.24 mm) while they were maintained on this diet. They also had similar body weights throughout the 7-month feeding period (data not shown). Both wild-type and knock-out mice developed mild fasting hyperglycemia and fasting hyperinsulinemia (compare Figs. 2 and3), indicating that the diet-induced weight gain produced similar degrees of mild insulin resistance in mice that produced adipo as well as those that lacked the protein. The plasma glucose and insulin response of both types of mice to GTT was also similar (Fig. 3, A and B). Although the plasma insulin in wild-type mice was higher than that ofAdipo −/− mice during the GTT, the difference was not significant (Fig. 3 B). We next performed an ITT, which revealed that Adipo −/− mice and theirAdipo +/+ littermates had a similar plasma glucose response to insulin (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, there was no difference in insulin sensitivity (or resistance) inAdipo +/+ or Adipo −/−mice. This was true irrespective of whether the comparison was made while the animals were on regular chow or after they were fed a HF/HS diet for 7 months. As recombinant fragments of adipo were reported to stimulate β-oxidation in muscle of rodents (6Fruebis J. Tsao T.-S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D. Erickson M.R. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Lodish H.F. Proc.

Unexpectedly, we found that β-oxidation rate was significantly increased (by ∼47%) in the muscle of Adipo −/− mice compared with wild-type littermate controls (Table IC). The β-oxidation rate in liver homogenates of these animals was also determined and was found to be ∼30% higher in Adipo −/− mice than that in wild-type littermate controls. Therefore, the absence of adipo stimulates β-oxidation. While we were preparing this manuscript for publication, Kubotaet al. (15Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Yamauchi T. Kubota T. Moroi M. Matsui J. Eto K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25863-25866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar) is unclear, but may be related to environmental factors or genetic background. We did not detect any significant difference in glucose homeostasis in F2 and F3 mice produced in our laboratory. The variation among F2 and F3 mice was higher than that among F6 C57BL/6J mice, presumably because of the inhomogeneous genetic background in the former groups. None of these differences were found to be significant in large groups. To rule out the mixed genetic background as a factor that might have masked differences between knock-out and wild-type mice, we bred them into C57BL/6J background and re-examined the mice at the F6 generation. Again, there was no difference in glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity between Adipo −/− andAdipo +/+ mice (Figs. 2 and 3). This lack of a difference was evident in regular chow-fed mice as well as in mice fed a HF/HS diet for 7 months. The high-fat diet did induce a mild, but similar, degree of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance inAdipo −/− and Adipo +/+mice (Fig. 3). Interestingly, both Kubota et al. (15Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Yamauchi T. Kubota T. Moroi M. Matsui J. Eto K. Yamashita T. Kamon J. Satoh H. Yano W. Froguel P. Nagai R. Kimura S. Kadowaki T. Noda T. J. Biol.

In both studies the plasma insulin during a GTT tended to be (insignificantly) higher in the wild-type mice than in Adipo −/− mice (Fig. 2 Jin Kubota et al. (15Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Yamauchi T.

These are unlikely scenarios if significant insulin resistance existed. The absence of insulin resistance in Adipo −/− mice was also confirmed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method in the current study (Table IB). How can we reconcile the absence of insulin resistance inAdipo −/− mice and the previously reported effects of full-length and partial-length adipo fragments injected into rodents (6Fruebis J. Tsao T.-S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D. Erickson M.R. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar, 7Yamauchi T.

Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar)? The overall phenotype ofAdipo −/− mice could be the result of the activation or overexpression of compensatory biochemical pathways or molecules in Adipo −/− mice that reversed the insulin resistance, if indeed adipo is a natural insulin-sensitizing hormone in vivo. The expression of leptin is largely unchanged in these mice, but there are potentially many other molecules involved in insulin resistance that could be activated in the absence of adipo (16Havel P.J. Curr. Opin. Lipid. 2002; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Another consideration is the fact that the data obtained in many of the experiments involving the injection of recombinant adipo into rodents may not reflect the normal action of the native protein. Adipo normally exists in plasma as trimers that associate noncovalently to form high molecular complexes, and most of the injected fragments were not competent to reassemble into the native multimeric complexes in vivo (17Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Scherer P.E. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 84-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adipo undergoes posttranslational modification (17Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Scherer P.E. Trends Endocrinol.

Adipo contains tissue-specific α2,8-linked di/oligosialic acid chains that appear to be adipocyte-specific (18Sato C. Yasukawa Z. Honda N. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28849-28856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); recombinant adipo produced in non-adipocyte mammalian cells may not contain this specific modification. Such α2,8-linked di/oligosialic acid chains have been shown to be involved in signal transduction as well as other biological activities (19Nagai Y. Iwamori M. Rosenberg A.

In agreement with our study, they observed no evidence of insulin resistance when Adipo −/−mice were fed a regular chow. However, they found that feeding theAdipo −/− mice a HF/HS diet for 2 weeks induced insulin resistance in these animals. The reason for the difference between our study, which involved a 7-month HF/HS diet feeding period, and that of Maeda et al. (21Maeda N. Shimomura I. Kishida K. Nishizawa H. Matsuda M. Nagaretani H.

How loss of hSNF5 contributes to tumorigenesis remains unknown. Because the SWI/SNF subunit BRG1 is required for RB-mediated cell cycle arrest, we hypothesized that hSNF5 deficiency disrupts RB signaling. Here we demonstrate that unlike BRG1, hSNF5 deficient cells retain functional RB since ectopic expression of either p16ink4a or a constitutively active form of RB (PSM-RB) led to cell cycle arrest. To determine how hSNF5 loss might contribute to tumorigenesis, we used a retrovirus to introduce hSNF5 into multiple deficient cell lines. In all cases, re-expression inhibited colony formation and induced cell cycle arrest characterized by a flattened morphology. Flow cytometry revealed that these cells accumulated in G0/G1. Importantly, arrested cells exhibited strong induction of p16ink4a, hypophosphorylated RB, and down-regulation of cyclin A, suggesting that hSNF5 signals upstream of RB to induce growth arrest. Co-expression of SV40 T/t abolished hSNF5-induced G1 arrest and activation of RB. Likewise, HPV-16 E7 was sufficient to partially overcome cell cycle arrest. These results suggest that hSNF5 loss is not equivalent to BRG1/BRM loss in human tumor cell lines. Furthermore, hSNF5-induced cell cycle arrest of deficient cells is mediated in part through activation of p16ink4a expression. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of hSNF5-mediated tumor suppression."

Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, Part I. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1990: 419-472Google Scholar). TGF-β and related proteins initiate cellular responses by binding to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors termed type I and type II. Type I receptor is activated by type II receptor upon ligand binding and mediates specific intracellular signals (2Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Members of the TGF-β superfamily transduce intracellular signals by Smad proteins. Eight different Smad proteins have been identified in mammals and are classified into three subgroups, i.e. receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common-partner Smads (Co-Smads), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 4Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). R-Smads and Co-Smad, Smad4, positively regulate signaling by the TGF-β superfamily (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). Among R-Smads, Smad2 and Smad3 act in the TGF-β/activin pathway, whereas Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 function in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and anti-Müllerian hormone pathways. In contrast to R-Smads and Co-Smad, I-Smads including Smad6 and Smad7 bind to type I receptors and compete with R-Smads for activation by the type I receptors, resulting in the inhibition of TGF-β superfamily signaling (6Imamura T.

Smad6 also inhibits BMP signaling by forming a complex with Smad1 and by interfering with complex formation between Smad1 and Smad4 (9Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar).Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation plays key roles in various biological processes including signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar, 11Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of proteins is induced by an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin ligases. In the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, E3 ligases play a crucial role in the recognition of target proteins and subsequent protein degradation by 26 S proteasomes (12Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, the RING-type and HECT-type ligases have been well characterized in mammals. Many proteins containing RING finger domains have been found to function as E3 ligases, and some of those are involved in signaling pathways (12Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). For example, ROC1·Skp1·Cullin1·F-box protein complex containing Fbw1a (also termed βTrCP1) is an E3 ligase for IκB and β-catenin, which participate in the NFκB- and Wnt-signaling pathways, respectively. We have recently shown that the ROC1·Skp1·Cullin1·F-box protein complex containing Fbw1a induced ubiquitination and degradation of activated Smad3 (13Fukuchi M. Imamura T. Chiba T. Ebisawa T. Kawabata M. Tanaka K. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1431-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 4 (Nedd4) and Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor (Smurf) family proteins represent the HECT-type subclass of E3 ligases; however, the number of HECT-type E3 ligases is less than that of RING-type E3 ligases.Smurf1 was originally identified as an E3 ligase in which ligand independently induces the ubiquitination and degradation of BMP-specific Smads1 and 5 (14Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Smurf2, a Smurf1-related E3 ubiquitin ligase, also interacts with Smad1/5 as well as with activated Smad2 (15Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In addition, Smurf2 interacts with a transcriptional co-repressor SnoN and thereby targets SnoN for ubiquitin-mediated degradation by proteasomes (17Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition, Smurf1 and Smurf2 interact with Smad7 in the nucleus and induce translocation of Smad7 to the cytoplasm. The Smurfs·Smad7 complexes then associate with TGF-β-type I receptor (TβR-I) and enhance its turnover (18Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol.

However, the mechanism of the nuclear export and the plasma membrane localization of the Smurf1·Smad7 complex have not been elucidated.Smurf1 is composed of a protein kinase C conserved 2 (C2) domain at the N terminus with WW domains in the middle and HECT domain at the C terminus. The WW domains bind to a PY motif in the linker regions of Smads, and the HECT domain is responsible for its ubiquitin protein ligase activity. However, the role of the C2 domain of Smurf1 has not been elucidated. The C2 domain was first identified as the Ca2+ binding site in conventional protein kinase C and has been found in various proteins including those involved in signal transduction and membrane trafficking (20Coussens L. Parker P.J. Rhee L. Yang-Feng L. Chen E. Waterfield M.D. Francke U. Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 21Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The C2 domain of Nedd4, which is structurally similar to Smurf1, was found to bind phospholipids and to be responsible for the localization of Nedd4 at the plasma membrane (22Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, Snyder et al. (23Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. McDonald F.J. Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28321-28326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reported that the C2 domain of human Nedd4 is not required for inhibition of the epithelial Na+ channel. Thus, the functional role of the C2 domain of Nedd4 is still unclear. In this study, we examined the role of the C2 domain of Smurf1 in its subcellular localization and biological function in the TGF-β signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONSmurf1 was originally identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that specifically degrades the BMP-specific R-Smads, Smad1 and Smad5 (14Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Smurf2 is highly related structurally to Smurf1 and induces the degradation of Smad1 as well as that of a TGF-β-specific R-Smad, Smad2 (15Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In addition, Smurf1 and Smurf2 have been shown to physically interact with I-Smads, Smad6 and Smad7. Smurfs induce nuclear export of Smad7, interact with the TGF-β receptor complex, and facilitate the degradation of Smad7 as well as that of the TGF-β receptor complex (18Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 19Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Thus, Smurfs negatively regulate the Smad signaling pathways through interaction with both R-Smads and I-Smads.Smad signaling pathways are conserved in vertebrates and inDrosophila (30Das P. Maduzia L.L. Padgett R.W. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). MAD serves as an R-Smad that specifically transmits signals for decapentaplegia. MEDEA acts as a Co-Smad, and DAD is an I-Smad in Drosophila. DSmurf was recently identified as a Drosophila ortholog of vertebrate Smurf1 and 2 (31Podos S.D. Hanson K.K. Wang Y.C. Ferguson E.L. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The function of DSmurf is restricted to the decapentaplegic pathway during development, suggesting critical roles for Smurf ubiquitin ligases in TGF-β superfamily signaling. Similar to Smurf1 and Smurf2, DSmurf appears to control the intracellular pool of MAD and to down-regulate the accumulation of phosphorylated MAD by receptor turnover, possibly through interaction with DAD.In this study, we have shown that the C2 domain of Smurf1 is responsible for the association with the plasma membrane. Although Smurf1 may exhibit activity by degrading R-Smads in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus, membrane localization of Smurf1 appears to be essential for inhibition of TGF-β signaling by the Smurf1·Smad7 complex. Intriguingly, Smurf1(ΔC2) ubiquitinylates Smad7 more efficiently than Smurf1(WT), suggesting that Smurf1 degrades Smad7 and possibly other Smads if it is not targeted to the membrane. Several HECT-type E3 ligases have been identified in mammals including Nedd4 and related Nedd4-like proteins (32Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Nedd4 interacts with epithelial Na+ channel and some other proteins (33Murillas R. Simms K.S. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Kuehn M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2897-2907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nedd4 is observed throughout the cytoplasm in cells, and its interaction with the plasma membrane is mediated by cytosolic Ca2+ (22Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, membrane localization of Smurf1 was not regulated by cytosolic Ca2+, suggesting that subcellular localization of Smurf1 is controlled by certain other mechanisms. There are many non-Ca2+-binding C2 domains, and some of them including those of PTEN and protein kinase Cε still have abilities to bind to the membrane (34Lee J.O. Yang H.

Garcia-Garcia J. Fita I. Corbalan-Garcia S. Verdaguer N. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, it will be important to determine how the association of the C2 domain of Smurf1 with the plasma membrane is mediated under physiological conditions.Levels of expression of I-Smads are regulated by various stimuli including TGF-β, BMPs, growth factors, interferon-γ, NFκB signaling, and shear stress (36Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smad3 and Smad4 and BMP-specific R-Smads bind to the promoter regions of Smad7 and Smad6, respectively (37Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J., Li, W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 38Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K.

In contrast, Smurf1 and Smurf2 appear to be ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, and the regulation of their levels of expression has not been reported. Smurfs may be constitutively expressed in cells once I-Smads are induced by certain stimuli and Smurfs capture I-Smads, induce their nuclear export, and associate with the TGF-β receptor complex.For determination of the ubiquitination of TβR-I by Smurfs, a constitutively active form of TβR-I was used in this study as well as by others (18Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 19Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Because TβR-I and TβR-II spontaneously form a complex without ligand stimulation in transfected cells (39Souchelnytskyi S. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6231-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it has not been determined whether ubiquitination of TβR-I by the Smurf1·Smad7 complex is induced only upon ligand stimulation. However, the ubiquitination of TβR-I by Smurf1·Smad7 may be dependent on the activation status of TβR-I by the TβR-II kinase, because Smad7 fails to efficiently associate with TβR-I in the presence of kinase-inactive form of TβR-II (data not shown) (7Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J., Xu, Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar).It is important to note that Smurf1 enhanced the interaction of Smad7 with the TGF-β receptor complex through targeting of Smad7 to the plasma membrane (see Fig. 2 B). This finding suggests that Smurf1 brings Smad7 to the TGF-β receptor complex and allows Smad7 to compete with R-Smads for receptor activation before it begins to degrade the receptor complex (Fig.7 A). After several hours, Smurf1 begins to induce the degradation of Smad7 and the TGF-β receptor complex, leading to further inhibition of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 7 B). Thus, the C2 domain of Smurf1 plays important roles in both the early and late phases of inhibition of TGF-β signaling by the Smurf1·Smad7 complex. Members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 superfamily are multifunctional proteins that regulate a wide spectrum of cellular responses including growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and morphogenesis (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, Part I. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1990: 419-472Google Scholar). TGF-β and related proteins initiate cellular responses by binding to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors termed type I and type II. Type I receptor is activated by type II receptor upon ligand binding and mediates specific intracellular signals (2Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Members of the TGF-β superfamily transduce intracellular signals by Smad proteins. Eight different Smad proteins have been identified in mammals and are classified into three subgroups, i.e. receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common-partner Smads (Co-Smads), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 4Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). R-Smads and Co-Smad, Smad4, positively regulate signaling by the TGF-β superfamily (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar). Among R-Smads, Smad2 and Smad3 act in the TGF-β/activin pathway, whereas Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 function in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and anti-Müllerian hormone pathways. In contrast to R-Smads and Co-Smad, I-Smads including Smad6 and Smad7 bind to type I receptors and compete with R-Smads for activation by the type I receptors, resulting in the inhibition of TGF-β superfamily signaling (6Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 7Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J., Xu, Y.Y. Grinnell B.W.

Smad6 also inhibits BMP signaling by forming a complex with Smad1 and by interfering with complex formation between Smad1 and Smad4 (9Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation plays key roles in various biological processes including signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar, 11Jesenberger V. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of proteins is induced by an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin ligases. In the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, E3 ligases play a crucial role in the recognition of target proteins and subsequent protein degradation by 26 S proteasomes (12Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, the RING-type and HECT-type ligases have been well characterized in mammals. Many proteins containing RING finger domains have been found to function as E3 ligases, and some of those are involved in signaling pathways (12Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). For example, ROC1·Skp1·Cullin1·F-box protein complex containing Fbw1a (also termed βTrCP1) is an E3 ligase for IκB and β-catenin, which participate in the NFκB- and Wnt-signaling pathways, respectively. We have recently shown that the ROC1·Skp1·Cullin1·F-box protein complex containing Fbw1a induced ubiquitination and degradation of activated Smad3 (13Fukuchi M. Imamura T. Chiba T. Ebisawa T. Kawabata M. Tanaka K. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1431-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 4 (Nedd4) and Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor (Smurf) family proteins represent the HECT-type subclass of E3 ligases; however, the number of HECT-type E3 ligases is less than that of RING-type E3 ligases. Smurf1 was originally identified as an E3 ligase in which ligand independently induces the ubiquitination and degradation of BMP-specific Smads1 and 5 (14Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Smurf2, a Smurf1-related E3 ubiquitin ligase, also interacts with Smad1/5 as well as with activated Smad2 (15Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In addition, Smurf2 interacts with a transcriptional co-repressor SnoN and thereby targets SnoN for ubiquitin-mediated degradation by proteasomes (17Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition, Smurf1 and Smurf2 interact with Smad7 in the nucleus and induce translocation of Smad7 to the cytoplasm. The Smurfs·Smad7 complexes then associate with TGF-β-type I receptor (TβR-I) and enhance its turnover (18Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 19Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the nuclear export and the plasma membrane localization of the Smurf1·Smad7 complex have not been elucidated. Smurf1 is composed of a protein kinase C conserved 2 (C2) domain at the N terminus with WW domains in the middle and HECT domain at the C terminus. The WW domains bind to a PY motif in the linker regions of Smads, and the HECT domain is responsible for its ubiquitin protein ligase activity. However, the role of the C2 domain of Smurf1 has not been elucidated. The C2 domain was first identified as the Ca2+ binding site in conventional protein kinase C and has been found in various proteins including those involved in signal transduction and membrane trafficking (20Coussens L. Parker P.J. Rhee L. Yang-Feng L. Chen E. Waterfield M.D. Francke U. Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 21Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The C2 domain of Nedd4, which is structurally similar to Smurf1, was found to bind phospholipids and to be responsible for the localization of Nedd4 at the plasma membrane (22Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, Snyder et al. (23Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. McDonald F.J. Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28321-28326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reported that the C2 domain of human Nedd4 is not required for inhibition of the epithelial Na+ channel. Thus, the functional role of the C2 domain of Nedd4 is still unclear. In this study, we examined the role of the C2 domain of Smurf1 in its subcellular localization and biological function in the TGF-β signaling pathway. DISCUSSIONSmurf1 was originally identified as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that specifically degrades the BMP-specific R-Smads, Smad1 and Smad5 (14Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Smurf2 is highly related structurally to Smurf1 and induces the degradation of Smad1 as well as that of a TGF-β-specific R-Smad, Smad2 (15Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In addition, Smurf1 and Smurf2 have been shown to physically interact with I-Smads, Smad6 and Smad7. Smurfs induce nuclear export of Smad7, interact with the TGF-β receptor complex, and facilitate the degradation of Smad7 as well as that of the TGF-β receptor complex (18Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 19Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Thus, Smurfs negatively regulate the Smad signaling pathways through interaction with both R-Smads and I-Smads.Smad signaling pathways are conserved in vertebrates and inDrosophila (30Das P. Maduzia L.L. Padgett R.W. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). MAD serves as an R-Smad that specifically transmits signals for decapentaplegia. MEDEA acts as a Co-Smad, and DAD is an I-Smad in Drosophila. DSmurf was recently identified as a Drosophila ortholog of vertebrate Smurf1 and 2 (31Podos S.D. Hanson K.K. Wang Y.C. Ferguson E.L. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The function of DSmurf is restricted to the decapentaplegic pathway during development, suggesting critical roles for Smurf ubiquitin ligases in TGF-β superfamily signaling. Similar to Smurf1 and Smurf2, DSmurf appears to control the intracellular pool of MAD and to down-regulate the accumulation of phosphorylated MAD by receptor turnover, possibly through interaction with DAD.In this study, we have shown that the C2 domain of Smurf1 is responsible for the association with the plasma membrane. Although Smurf1 may exhibit activity by degrading R-Smads in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus, membrane localization of Smurf1 appears to be essential for inhibition of TGF-β signaling by the Smurf1·Smad7 complex. Intriguingly, Smurf1(ΔC2) ubiquitinylates Smad7 more efficiently than Smurf1(WT), suggesting that Smurf1 degrades Smad7 and possibly other Smads if it is not targeted to the membrane. Several HECT-type E3 ligases have been identified in mammals including Nedd4 and related Nedd4-like proteins (32Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Nedd4 interacts with epithelial Na+ channel and some other proteins (33Murillas R. Simms K.S. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Kuehn M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2897-2907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nedd4 is observed throughout the cytoplasm in cells, and its interaction with the plasma membrane is mediated by cytosolic Ca2+ (22Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, membrane localization of Smurf1 was not regulated by cytosolic Ca2+, suggesting that subcellular localization of Smurf1 is controlled by certain other mechanisms. There are many non-Ca2+-binding C2 domains, and some of them including those of PTEN and protein kinase Cε still have abilities to bind to the membrane (34Lee J.O. Yang H.

Thus, it will be important to determine how the association of the C2 domain of Smurf1 with the plasma membrane is mediated under physiological conditions.Levels of expression of I-Smads are regulated by various stimuli including TGF-β, BMPs, growth factors, interferon-γ, NFκB signaling, and shear stress (36Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smad3 and Smad4 and BMP-specific R-Smads bind to the promoter regions of Smad7 and Smad6, respectively (37Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J., Li, W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 38Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K.

Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J., Xu, Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). It is important to note that Smurf1 enhanced the interaction of Smad7 with the TGF-β receptor complex through targeting of Smad7 to the plasma membrane (see Fig. 2 B). This finding suggests that Smurf1 brings Smad7 to the TGF-β receptor complex and allows Smad7 to compete with R-Smads for receptor activation before it begins to degrade the receptor complex (Fig.7 A). After several hours, Smurf1 begins to induce the degradation of Smad7 and the TGF-β receptor complex, leading to further inhibition of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 7 B). Thus, the C2 domain of Smurf1 plays important roles in both the early and late phases of inhibition of TGF-β signaling by the Smurf1·Smad7 complex. We thank Y. Inada and M.

https://openalex.org/W2008913175,"Transcriptional activation of the IFN-β gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, which instructs a recruitment program of chromatin modifiers/remodelers and general transcription factors to the promoter. This program culminates with sliding of a nucleosome blocking the core promoter to a downstream position, a prerequisite for transcriptional activation. We show that delivery of this nucleosome to the same downstream position to create an accessible IFN-β core promoter prior to enhanceosome assembly results in major changes in the gene expression program with regard to the temporal pattern and the signal specificity of the transcriptional response. Thus, the identity of a gene expression program is achieved and maintained by the dynamic interplay between specific enhanceosomes and specific local chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2059286862,"The mammalian circadian system contains both central and peripheral oscillators. To understand the communication pathways between them, we have studied the rhythmic behavior of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) surgically implanted in mice of different genotypes. MEFs from Per1−/− mice have a much shorter period in culture than do tissues in the intact animal. When implanted back into mice, however, the Per1−/− MEF take on the rhythmic characteristics of the host. A functioning clock is required for oscillations in the target tissues, as arrhythmic clockc/c MEFs remain arrhythmic in implants. These results demonstrate that SCN hierarchical dominance can compensate for severe intrinsic genetic defects in peripheral clocks, but cannot induce rhythmicity in clock-defective tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2040230044,"Although the basis for the high mortality rate for patients with mixed bacterial infections is likely to be multifactorial, there is evidence for a synergistic effect of muramyldipeptide (MDP) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines by mononuclear phagocytes. In this study, co-incubation of human Mono Mac 6 cells with MDP and either LPS or peptidoglycan (PGN) resulted in an apparent synergistic effect on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion. Although incubation of cells with MDP alone produced minimal TNF-α, it caused significant expression of TNF-α mRNA. These findings suggest that the majority of TNF-α mRNA induced by MDP alone is not translated into protein. Furthermore, simultaneous incubation of cells with MDP and either LPS or PGN resulted in TNF-α mRNA expression that approximated the sum of the amounts expressed in response to MDP, LPS, and PGN individually. These findings indicate that the apparent synergistic effect of MDP on TNF-α production induced by either LPS or PGN is due to removal of a block in translation of the mRNA expressed in response to MDP. In subsequent studies, the effects of MDP alone and its effect on the production of TNF-α by LPS and PGN were determined to be independent of CD14, Toll-like receptor 2, and Toll-like receptor 4. These findings indicate that MDP acts through receptor(s) other than those primarily responsible for transducing the effects of LPS and PGN. Successful treatment of patients having mixed bacterial infections is likely to require interventions that address the mechanisms involved in responses induced by a variety of bacterial cell wall components."
https://openalex.org/W2165856954,"The function of viral protein 2 (VP2) of the immunosuppressive circovirus chicken anemia virus (CAV) has not yet been established. We show that the CAV VP2 amino acid sequence has some similarity to a number of eukaryotic, receptor, protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) α proteins as well as to a cluster of human TT viruses within the Sanban group. To investigate if CAV VP2 functions as a PTPase, purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-VP2 fusion protein was assayed for PTPase activity using the generalized peptide substrates ENDpYINASL and DADEpYLIPQQG (where pY represents phosphotyrosine), with free phosphate detected using the malachite green colorimetric assay. CAV GST-VP2 was shown to catalyze dephosphorylation of both substrates. CAV GST-VP2 PTPase activity for the ENDpYINASL substrate had a V max of 14,925 units/mg·min and a K m of 18.88 μm. Optimal activity was observed between pH 6 and 7, and activity was specifically inhibited by 0.01 mmorthovanadate. We also show that the ORF2 sequence of the CAV-related human virus TT-like minivirus (TLMV) possessed PTPase activity and steady state kinetics equivalent to CAV GST-VP2 when expressed as a GST fusion protein. To establish whether these viral proteins were dual specificity protein phosphatases, the CAV GST-VP2 and TLMV GST-ORF2 fusion proteins were also assayed for serine/threonine phosphatase (S/T PPase) activity using the generalized peptide substrate RRApTVA, with free phosphate detected using the malachite green colorimetric assay. Both CAV GST-VP2 and TLMV GST-ORF2 fusion proteins possessed S/T PPase activity, which was specifically inhibited by 50 mm sodium fluoride. CAV GST-VP2 exhibited S/T PPase activity with aV max of 28,600 units/mg·min and aK m of 76 μm. Mutagenesis of residue Cys95 to serine in CAV GST-VP2 abrogated both PTPase and S/T PPase activity, identifying it as the catalytic cysteine within the proposed signature motif. These studies thus show that the circoviruses CAV and TLMV encode dual specificity protein phosphatases (DSP) with an unusual signature motif that may play a role in intracellular signaling during viral replication. This is the first DSP gene to be identified in a small viral genome."
https://openalex.org/W2136770627,"p21WAF1 appears to be a major determinant of the cell fate in response to anticancer therapy. It was shown previously that HCT116 human colon cancer cells growing in vitro enter a stable arrest upon DNA damage, whereas cells with a defective p21WAF1 response undergo apoptosis. Here we report that the enhanced sensitivity of HCT116/p21−/−cells to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis correlates with an increased expression of p53 and a modification of their Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in favor of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Treatment of HCT116/p21−/− cells with daunomycin resulted in a reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential and in activation of caspase-9, whereas no such changes were observed in HCT116/p21+/+ cells, providing evidence that p21WAF1 exerts an antagonistic effect on the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Moreover, the role of p53 in activation of this pathway was demonstrated by the fact that inhibition of p53 activity by pifithrin-α reduced the sensitivity of HCT116/p21−/−cells to daunomycin-induced apoptosis and restored a Bax/Bcl-2 ratio similar to that observed in HCT116p21+/+ cells. Enhancement of p53 expression after disruption of p21WAF1resulted from a stabilization of p53, which correlated with an increased expression of the tumor suppressor p14ARF, an inhibitor of the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2. In accordance with the role of p14ARF in p53 stabilization, overexpression of p14ARF in HCT116/p21+/+ cells resulted in a strong increase in p53 activity. Our results identify a novel mechanism for the anti-apoptotic effect of p21WAF1 consisting in maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis that occurs in consequence of a negative control of p14ARF expression. p21WAF1 appears to be a major determinant of the cell fate in response to anticancer therapy.

Depending on the cellular context, activation of p53 promotes either cell cycle arrest to enable DNA repair or apoptosis to eliminate defective cells (4Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Recent studies have addressed the question of how p53 triggers either one or the other of these two pathways, and the protein p21WAF1 has been implicated as a major determinant of cell fate. p21WAF1 is responsible for the p53-dependent checkpoint that results in G1 arrest after DNA damage (5Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar,6Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). Cells deficient in p21WAF1 display a markedly different response to DNA damaging agents compared with cells with an intact p21WAF1-dependent checkpoint. HCT116 human colon cancer cells growing in vitro enter a stable arrest following DNA damage by γ-irradiation or chemotherapeutic drugs, whereas cells with a defective p21WAF1response undergo apoptosis (6Waldman T.

Moreover, whereas irradiation of xenograft tumors established from cells with the intactp21WAF1 gene resulted in no cure, a significant fraction of tumors generated from p21WAF1-deficient cells were completely eliminated (10Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L., Yu, J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Williams J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1034-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Similarly, p21WAF1antisense therapy of wild-type HCT116/p21+/+ cells led to loss of G1 arrest, and increased apoptosis after ionizing radiation exposure both in vitro and in tumor xenografts in nude mice (11Tian H. Wittmack E.K. Jorgensen T.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 679-684PubMed Google Scholar). An anti-apoptotic effect of p21WAF1 on p53-dependent or p53-independent cytotoxic stimulation has also been observed in several other cell types such as melanoma cells (12Gorospe M. Cirielli C. Wang X. Seth P. Capogrossi M.C. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) or lung cancer cells (13Wang Y. Blandino G. Givol D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2643-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Also, we demonstrated that induction of p21WAF1 expression participates in the anti-apoptotic effect of the transcription factor NF-κB during treatment of Ewing sarcoma cells with TNF-α1(14Javelaud D. Wietzerbin J. Delattre O. Besançon F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Expression of p21WAF1 was also shown to play a key role during differentiation of several cellular systems by conferring cell survival. Indeed, inhibition of p21WAF1 expression by treatment of differentiating myocytes or neuroblastoma cells with antisense oligonucleotides resulted in extensive cell death (15Poluha W. Poluha D.K.

Similarly, p21WAF1 was required for cell survival during vitamin D3- or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced differentiation of monocytes to macrophages (18Asada M. Yamada T. Ichijo H. Delia D. Miyazono K. Fukumuro K. Mizutani S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 19Pennington K.N. Taylor J.A. Bren G.D. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1930-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which p21WAF1 inhibits cell cycle progression has been found to involve its binding to G1cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes and to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen proliferating cell nuclear antigen (20Dotto G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1471: M43-M56PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the molecular events underlying the p21WAF1 anti-apoptotic effect have not been fully elucidated. Several steps that are implicated in the apoptotic process have been shown to be inhibited by p21WAF1. These include inhibition of activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and caspase-3 (18Asada M. Yamada T. Ichijo H. Delia D. Miyazono K. Fukumuro K.

Alternatively, in human colorectal carcinoma cells, cyclin-dependent kinase binding or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory activity of p21WAF1 was required to prevent apoptosis (23Lu Y. Yamagishi N. Yagi T. Takebe H. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the mechanisms that are implicated in the enhanced sensitivity to therapeutic agents ofp21WAF1 gene-deleted colocarcinoma cells. We report that abolition of p21WAF1 protein expression induced a post-transcriptional increase of p53 levels that resulted from an enhanced expression of the tumor suppressor p14ARF. The consequence of the increased activity of p53 was a modification of the balance between the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in favor of Bax. Wild-type HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells (HCT116/p21+/+), which express normal p53 and p21WAF1, and a derivative in which bothp21WAF1 alleles have been deleted through homologous recombination (HCT116/p21−/−) were kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and have been described previously (6Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). The pp53-TA-luc vector and the pRSV-β galactosidase (pRSV-βgal) vector were from Clontech and Promega, respectively. The pcDNA vector encoding p14ARF was a gift from Dr. S. Gazzeri (INSERM EMI 9924, Institut Albert Bonniot, La Tronche, France). The following antibodies were used for Western blot analysis: monoclonal antibodies against p53, Mdm2, c-Abl, cIAP1, and Bcl-xL (Pharmigen), caspase-9 (Upstate Biotechnology), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Alexis Biochemicals), XIAP (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co.), p21WAF1 (Transduction Laboratories), p14ARF (Oncogene), Bcl-2 (Dako), actin (ICN), rabbit serum against phospho-JNK and Bad (New England Biolabs), and JNK1, cIAP2, and Bax (Santa Cruz). Mouse monoclonal antibody anti-CD95, clone B.G27, was purchased from Biomol. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or TNF-α were from R&D Systems and Bender Wien, respectively. Pifithrin-α (PFTα) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. Daunomycin, adriamycin, and etoposide were from Sigma. Fragmented nuclei were detected by fluorescence microscopy after staining of cells with the DNA binding dye Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) as described previously (24Besançon F. Atfi A. Gespach C. Cayre Y.E. Bourgeade M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8081-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The scoring was done in a blinded fashion and an average of 400 cells were examined for each point. Variation of the mitochondrial membrane potential during apoptosis was studied using 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide, DiOC6 (3Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) (Calbiochem), as described previously (14Javelaud D. Wietzerbin J. Delattre O. Besançon F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Total cellular extracts were prepared in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, 1 mm sodium vanadate, treated with Benzon nuclease (Merck) for 5 min at room temperature, and boiled for 3 min. Thirty micrograms of proteins were loaded on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20 and then probed with primary antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary antibodies were labeled with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, which were then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The experiments were repeated three times and representative autoradiograms are shown. Bands were quantified with NIH Image software after densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram. Cells (1 × 107) were washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 4 μg of pp53-TA-luc or 4 μg of control pTA-luc plasmids together with 1 μg of pRSV-β-gal in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). Cells were then electroporated at 960 μF, 230 V, and plated in the appropriate medium prior to harvest. Reporter gene activity was determined with the luciferase assay system (Promega). Transfection efficiencies were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activity that was measured using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay (Promega).

Oligonucleotides were added again to the cells 24 h later at a final concentration of 5 μm. Cells were then incubated for 48 or 72 h before Western blot analysis of protein expression. Total cellular RNA was isolated using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Single strand cDNAs were synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers as primers. The cDNAs were amplified using the Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9600 thermocycler for 35 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 1 min denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min annealing at 60 °C, and 1.5 min extension at 72 °C. β2-Microglobulin was used as an internal control. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. In our experimental conditions, amplification of cDNAs was linear up to 38 cycles. Primers used for PCR were as follow: p53 sense (5′-TACCACCATCCACTACAACT-3′), p53 antisense (5′-GAACATCTCGAAGCGCTCA-3′), β2-microglobulin sense (5′-CATCCAGCGTACTCCAAAGA-3′), and β2-microglobulin antisense (5′-GACAAGTCTGAATGCTCCAC-3′). p21WAF1has been reported to exert a protective effect against radiations and various chemical apoptosis inducers (7Waldman T.

Here we investigated whether p21WAF1 similarly influences the cellular response to chemotherapeutic drugs and to death receptor ligands. For this purpose, we used wild-type HCT116/p21+/+ human colon carcinoma cells and HCT116/p21−/− cells in which bothp21WAF1 alleles have been deleted by homologous recombination (6Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from both cell lines were exposed to the chemotherapeutic drugs daunomycin, adriamycin, and etoposide, and to the death receptor ligands TNFα, anti-CD95 (Fas), and TRAIL. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by staining with the DNA binding dye Hoechst 33258, which allows visualization of condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclei. As shown in Fig.1, we observed a drastic increase in the chemosensitivity to daunomycin in cells lacking thep21WAF1 gene. Similar results were obtained for adriamycin and etoposide, in accordance with previously reported observations (8Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 9Mahyar-Roemer M. Roemer K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3387-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Whereas HCT116/p21+/+ and HCT116/p21−/− cells were insensitive to the killing effect of TNFα and anti-CD95, both cell lines undergo cell death to almost similar extents following treatment with TRAIL. This demonstrates that in HCT116 cells, p21WAF1 does not extensively interfere with the death pathway triggered by TRAIL, in contrast to its strong inhibitory effect on chemotherapeutic drug-induced cell death. It has been shown that chemotherapeutic agents can induce apoptosis through multiple pathways, mainly by targeting the mitochondrial pathway (25Grad J.M. Cepero E. Boise L.H. Drug Resist. Update. 2001; 4: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This results in cytochrome c release and activation of the apoptosome complex that then activates downstream caspases. Binding of TRAIL to its cognate receptors DR4 and DR5 can activate a second pathway leading to direct caspase activation independently of mitochondria (26Suliman A. Lam A. Datta R. Srivastava R.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2122-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This explains the fact that TRAIL-induced apoptosis has been reported to be independent of the expression of proteins of the Bcl-2 family in various cell types (27Walczak H. Bouchon A. Stahl H. Krammer P.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3051-3057PubMed Google Scholar). As we observed that p21WAF1exerted an anti-apoptotic effect against chemotherapeutic drugs but not against TRAIL-induced cell death, we analyzed the consequences ofp21WAF1 gene deletion on the expression of various members of the Bcl-2 family. The constitutive level of Bcl-2 was decreased in HCT116/p21−/− as compared with parental cells (Fig. 2 A). Inversely,p21WAF1 deletion resulted in an increase in Bax protein expression, whereas levels of Bcl-xL and Bad were unchanged. As shown in Fig. 2 B (upper), our results were obtained in the linear range of the assay. Quantitative analysis of the intensity of the bands revealed that the apparent Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was 4-fold higher in the absence of p21WAF1(Fig. 2, A and B, lower), thus demonstrating a change in relative amounts of Bax and Bcl-2 in favor of Bax. Treatment of both cell lines with daunomycin did not significantly change this ratio. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the level of expression of other regulators of apoptosis, the IAP proteins (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP known to control caspase activity, were similar in HCT116/p21+/+ and HCT116/p21−/− cells. During the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, mitochondria suffer specific damage such as loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and one of the critical roles of the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family is to protect mitochondrial homeostasis (28Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar, 29Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 1: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (811) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether the increase of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was accompanied by a reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential in HCT116/p21−/− treated with daunomycin as compared with HCT116/p21+/+ cells. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured using DiOC6(3), a cyanine dye that accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix under the influence of the ΔΨm. Treatment of HCT116/p21−/− cells with daunomycin resulted in a significant decrease in DiOC6(3) uptake as compared with untreated cells (Fig.2 C). Such a decrease was not observed in HCT116/p21+/+ cells (Fig. 2 C). This last result further establishes the correlation between the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the ability of daunomycin to disrupt the mitochondrial membrane integrity. As expected, treatment of HCT116/p21−/− cells with daunomycin resulted in an activation of caspase-9, the apical caspase in the mitochondrial pathway (Fig. 2 D). Activation of caspase-3 correlated with activation of caspase-9 as revealed by the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a substrate of caspase-3 (Fig.2 D). Because Bax and Bcl-2 expression have been shown to be, respectively, up- and down-regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 (31Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Lin H.K. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar), we compared p53 levels in HCT116/p21+/+ and HCT116/p21−/− cells. Deletion of the p21WAF1 gene resulted in a higher expression of p53 (Fig. 3 A). To test whether this enhancement in p53 expression was accompanied by an increase in its transcriptional activity, cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of p53-binding elements. As shown in Fig.3 B, the luciferase activity measured in HCT116/p21−/− cells was 5-fold higher than that measured in HCT116/p21+/+ cells. To corroborate the inverse correlation between expression of p21WAF1 and p53 proteins and to eliminate the possibility that this reflects clonal selection of HCT116/p21−/−cells expressing high levels of p53, we used specific antisense oligonucleotides (p21AS) to inhibit p21WAF1 expression in wild-type HCT116 cells. Treatment of HCT116/p21+/+ cells with p21AS resulted in an inhibition of p21WAF1 expression, whereas control oligonucleotide had no effect (Fig. 3 C). No change in actin expression was observed, thus confirming the specificity of action of p21AS. Inhibition of p21WAF1expression by p21AS was accompanied by an increase in p53 level (Fig.3 C), and here again control AS were without effect. Thus, these results further demonstrate that inhibition of p21WAF1 expression results in an enhancement of p53 protein levels. PFTα is a small molecule that was isolated for its ability to reversibly block p53-dependent transcriptional activation (32Komarov P.G. Komarova E.A. Kondratov R.V. Christov-Tselkov K. Coon J.S. Chernov M.V. Gudkov A.V. Science. 1999; 285: 1733-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). We used this compound to investigate whether the higher p53 activity present in HCT116/p21−/− cells as compared with HCT116/p21+/+ cells participated in higher sensitivity to daunomycin-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig.4 A, treatment of HCT116/p21−/− cells with 30 μm PFTα resulted in an inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity. This reduction of p53 activity was accompanied by a reduction of the sensitivity of these cells to daunomycin-induced cell death (Fig.4 B). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4, C andD, PFTα-induced inhibition of p53 activity resulted in both an increase in Bcl-2 expression and a decrease of Bax expression, thus further establishing the correlation between p53 activity and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. p53 expression is tightly regulated through several mechanisms, the most effective one being regulation of protein stability (1Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar, 3Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To investigate whether p21WAF1 affects p53 expression at a transcriptional or a post-transcriptional level, constitutive p53 mRNA expression was analyzed in HCT116/p21+/+ and HCT116/p21−/− cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5 A, no difference in p53 mRNA expression was observed between the two cell lines, indicating that regulation of p53 expression by p21WAF1 occurs at a post-transcriptional level. Several mechanisms have been shown to be implicated in the regulation of p53 stability. A complex pattern of regulation of p53 stability by the stress kinase JNK has been described. Nonphosphorylated JNK targets p53 ubiquitination and degradation (33Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z., Wu, X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) whereas stress-activated JNK stabilizes and activates p53 (34Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Pincus M.R. Ronai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10541-10546Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Because p21WAF1 has been shown to inhibit JNK activation in various cells, we investigated whether absence of p21WAF1 expression in HCT116/p21−/− cells resulted in an enhanced level of phosphorylated JNK that could participate in p53 stabilization. As shown in Fig. 5 B, such a mechanism was not implicated in p53 stabilization that occurs in the absence of p21WAF1 because no difference in JNK expression or activation was observed between HCT116/p21+/+ and HCT116/p21−/− cells. One of the key regulators of p53 expression is the oncogenic protein Mdm2 (35Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar). This protein can transport p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where its ubiquitin ligase activity contributes to the proteasome-mediated degradation of p53. Inversely, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl and the tumor suppressor p14ARFup-regulate p53 levels by preventing its Mdm2-driven nuclear export and ubiquitination (36Sionov R.V. Coen S. Goldberg Z. Berger M. Bercovich B. Ben-Neriah Y. Ciechanover A. Haupt Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 274: 8371-8374Google Scholar, 37Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L.

Cell. 1998; 92: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, p53 stabilization in HCT116/p21−/− cells was not correlated with a decrease of Mdm2 or an increase of c-Abl levels. In contrast, disruption of p21WAF1 resulted in a strong increase in the basal level of p14ARF expression (Fig.5 B). Also, inhibition of p21WAF1 expression in wild-type HCT116 cells with specific antisense oligonucleotides resulted in an increase in p14ARF expression without affecting JNK, phosphorylated JNK, Mdm2, or c-Abl levels (Fig.5 C). These results strongly suggest that disruption ofp21WAF1 resulted in an enhancement of p14ARF expression that in turn allows p53 accumulation by antagonizing Mdm2 activity. In accordance with this hypothesis, overexpression of p14ARF in HCT116/p21+/+ cells resulted in a strong increase in p53 activity (Fig. 5 D). Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process essential to maintain tissue homeostasis. Acquisition of a resistance to apoptosis plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis by disrupting the balance between cell proliferation and cell destruction and by allowing cancer cells to resist radiation and chemotherapy. Identification of mechanisms that can antagonize apoptosis is essential to devise therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing the efficiency of cancer treatment (39Reed J.C. Nat. Drugs Disc. 2002; 1: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Recent technological advances have allowed the successful targeting of individual genes in human somatic cells, thus permitting studies of activation or inactivation of a particular gene on the response of cancer cells to therapeutic agents. Here we observed that disruption of p21WAF1 expression in human colon cancer cells, either by gene targeting or by the use of specific antisense oligonucleotides, increased p53 expression. This effect correlated with a sensitization of cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. It also correlated with a change in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as a consequence of increased expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax and reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, respectively. The roles of the observed enhancement of p53 levels in the sensitization to daunomycin-induced apoptosis, and in the change in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were demonstrated by the fact that inhibition of p53 activity upon treatment of HCT116p21−/− cells with PFTα reversed both effects. The relative ratio of anti- versus pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins has been shown to dictate the ultimate sensitivity or resistance of cells to various apoptotic stimuli (28Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar, 29Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 1: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Therefore the observed modification of this ratio in favor of Bax very likely participates in the enhanced sensitivity of HCT116/p21−/−cells to chemotherapeutic drugs as compared with their normal counterparts. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that additional mechanisms may be implicated in the pro-apoptotic effect of p53. For example, p53 was also shown to induce expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins FAS/APO1, KILLER/DR5, NOXA, p53AIPI, PIDD, and PUMA (1Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar, 3Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 4Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and to reduce expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, survivin (40Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J. Murphy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3247-3257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). We observed that disruption of p21WAF1 up-regulated p53 expression at a post-transcriptional level. A key player in the regulation of p53 stability is the Mdm2 protein that promotes the ubiquitination of p53 and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome (1Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar, 3Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 35Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar). The ability of Mdm2 to promote p53 ubiquitination can be modulated by the binding of other proteins. Among these proteins, p14ARF, the product of an alternative transcript of the INK4a tumor suppressor locus, has been shown to be involved in the response to oncogenic stress by up-regulating p53 expression (37Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I. Lee H.W. Cordon-Cardo C. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 38Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Yarbrough W.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). p14ARF is very likely responsible for p53 stabilization that occurs after p21WAF1 disruption because we observed that it is expressed at a higher level in HCT116/p21−/− cells than in HCT116/p21+/+cells. The ability of p14ARF to control p53 expression was demonstrated by the fact that transfection of HCT116/p21+/+cells with an expression vector encoding p14ARF strongly increased p53 activity. Altogether, our results provide evidence that repression of p14ARF that occurs in consequence of the inhibition of p21WAF1 expression is an initial step in the sensitization of HCT116/p21−/− cells as compared with HCT116/p21+/+ cells to daunomycin-induced apoptosis. The mechanism leading to an increased expression of p14ARFsubsequently to p21WAF1 disruption remains to be established. It has been shown that a transcriptionally functional E2F DNA-binding site is located in the p14ARF promoter region (41Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clarke P. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Control of G1/S transition by p21WAF1 occurs through inhibition of cyclin D-cdk4/6 complex activity in late G1 (20Dotto G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1471: M43-M56PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of such activity maintains the RB protein in an hypophosphorylated form that sequesters E2F1 and inhibits its transcriptional capacity (42Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which inhibition of p21WAF1expression increased the p14ARF level could be the activation of E2F1-dependent transcription. However, although as expected, inactivation of p21WAF1 in HCT116/p21−/− cells resulted in the disappearance of the hypophosphorylated form of RB, it did not correlate with an increased E2F1 transcriptional activity (not shown). One explanation could be a repression of E2F1 by p14ARF, because it was recently reported that p14ARF physically interacts with E2F1 and negatively regulates its activity (43Eymin B. Karayan L. Séité P. Brambilla C. Brambilla E. Larsen C.J. Grazzéri S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). p14ARF expression was also shown to be regulated by other transcriptional regulators such as c-Myc, β-cathenin, and E1A and by the extent ofp14ARF gene methylation (44Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 45Esteller M. Tortola S. Toyota M. Capella G. Peinado M.A. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G.

Whether control of p14ARF expression by p21WAF1 implies one of these mechanisms is presently under investigation. Mutations in the p53 gene are the most frequent genetic alterations in cancer. Intensive efforts are presently aimed to offer new approaches to cancer therapy based on restoring mutant p53 function by small molecule drugs (47Foster B.A. Coffey H.A. Morin M.J. Rastinejad F. Science. 1999; 286: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 48Bullock A.N. Fersht A.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Our results, which show that in the absence of p21WAF1 p53 participates in the triggering of cell death induced by DNA damaging agents, suggest that during chemotherapy high benefits could result from strategies combining inhibition of p21WAF1 expression and restoration of p53 activity in p53-deficient cancer cells. We are deeply grateful to Dr. B. Vogelstein for providing the HCT116/p21+/+ and HCT116/p21−/− cells. We thank Dr. S. Gazzeri for the p14ARF-encoding vector, Dr. H. Ankel for editing assistance, and C. Silvestri for skilful technical help."

Because HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) does not possess 3′- to 5′-exonucleolytic proofreading activity and because RT has been shown to be error-prone in cell free systems, it should be an important contributor to the high rate of HIV-1 mutation. However, because RNA polymerase II (pol II) synthesizes viral RNA, it might also contribute significantly to HIV-1 mutagenesis. To assess the relative contributions of RT and RNA pol II to HIV-1 mutagenesis, a system was established to study the rate and nature of mutations in HIV-1 long terminal repeats (LTRs). Owing to the unique nature of replication at the ends of the viral genome, mutational analysis of retroviral LTRs provides an opportunity to evaluate the relative contribution of HIV-1 RT and RNA pol II to viral mutagenesis. Mutational analysis was performed on both LTRs of 215 proviruses, restricted to a single cycle of replication, employing single-stranded conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing allowing direct identification of mutations in the absence of selection and within autologous viral sequences. A total of 21 independent mutations was identified. Ten mutations were observed in both LTRs, which could have been introduced by either RT or RNA pol II, whereas the other eleven mutations were only present in a single LTR and could only have been introduced by RT. This provides the first direct evidence that HIV-1 RT contributes significantly to HIV-1 mutagenesis and is likely to be the primary engine for HIV-1 mutagenesis. Moreover, mutations were observed at the U3-R border, but the nature of the mutations and their frequency differed from experiments performed using cell-free systems suggesting that other viral and/or cellular factors contribute to fidelity at the ends of the viral genome.

Sequence analyses revealed that virus isolates consist of multiple genomic subclasses, which fluctuate substantially during the course of infection, so HIV-1 exists as complex genetically heterogeneous populations termed “swarms” or “quasispecies” (7Eigen M. Sci. Am. 1993; 269: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 8Collins K.R. Quinones-Mateu M.E., Wu, M. Luzze H. Johnson J.L. Hirsch C. Toossi Z. Arts E.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This characteristically imperfect replication process is responsible for the generation of genetic diversity, which is advantageous for responding to selective forces. However, this genetic diversity imposes serious hurdles for the treatment of AIDS. Theoretically, retroviral mutations can be introduced during transcription by RNA polymerase II (pol II), minus- or plus-strand DNA synthesis by RT, or provirus replication by cellular DNA polymerases. Due to the notable fidelity of cellular DNA replication (10−9 to 10−11 substitution per base pair) (9Wabl M. Burrows P.D. von Gabain A. Steinberg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that mutations occurring during cellular replication of the provirus contribute significantly to the high degree of HIV-1 diversity. Therefore, most mutations are introduced during reverse transcription and/or RNA pol II transcription of the provirus. Unlike cellular replicative DNA polymerases, HIV-1 RT does not possess 3′- to 5′-exonucleolytic proofreading activity (10Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. The Fidelity of Retroviral Reverse Transcriptases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1993: 85-102Google Scholar). Fidelity studies using purified HIV-1 RT in cell-free systems indicate that nucleotide misincorporation frequencies are quite high (2.5 × 10−4 to 5.8 × 10−4 per nucleotide) (11Roberts J.D.

Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), although it is noteworthy that they are typically greater than the overall rate of mutation observed for HIV-1 during virus replication indicating that other factors contribute to the overall fidelity in vivo (14Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 15Mansky L.M. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5087-5094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ji J.P.

Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, based upon these studies, it has been proposed that RT is responsible for the high genetic variability seen for HIV-1 (14Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 18Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, RNA pol II might also contribute significantly to HIV-1 sequence variation during replication, and it is plausible that RNA pol II is an important contributor to HIV-1 mutagenesis. To gain insight into the relative contribution of HIV-1 RT and cellular RNA pol II to HIV-1 mutagenesis, mutational analysis of autologous HIV-1 long terminal repeats (LTRs) was performed after restricting replication of HIV-1-derived vectors to a single cycle. Due to unique aspects of replication of the viral LTRs, a mutation that is found in a single LTR could only be introduced by RT, whereas the same mutation found in both LTRs could be introduced by either RT or RNA pol II (see Fig. 1). Thus, by examining the LTRs, insight can be gleaned concerning the contributions of RT and RNA pol II to HIV-1 mutagenesis. Moreover, direct examination of autologous HIV-1 sequence allows determination of HIV-1 mutation rates of authentic HIV-1 sequences in contrast to the mutation rate of exogenous, non-viral marker sequences (19Mansky L.M. Virology. 1996; 222: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Halvas E.K. Svarovskaia E.S. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10349-10358Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lastly, analysis of the autologous LTR sequence also allows one to address whether there is a mutational hotspot at the U3-R border of the HIV-1 LTR. Cell-free studies using purified HIV-1 RT indicated that, when DNA synthesis reaches the end of the viral RNA template, non-templated additions of at least one nucleotide occur with a frequency approaching 50%, which would result in the introduction of one or more base pairs at the U3-R junctions of an integrated provirus (Fig. 1) (22Patel P.H.

Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). pHIV-gpt and NL4-3 proviral DNA plasmids were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. pHIV-gpt is an HIV-1 vector based on the HXB2 strain (GenBankTM accession number K03455), which has deletions, mutations, and disruptions in the env, nef,vif, and vpr genes (24Page K.A. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5270-5276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ratner L. Fisher A. Jagodzinski L.L. Mitsuya H. Liou R.S. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1987; 3: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). NL4-3gpt was based on HIV-1 strain NL4-3 (GenBankTM accession number AF070521) (26Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To make NL4-3gpt, a 1.2-kbp portion of the envelope gene was deleted from the NdeI site at HIV nucleotide 6402 to theBglII site at HIV nucleotide 7620. A 1.1-kb fragment from pSV2gpt (27Mulligan R.C. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2072-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) from PvuII to DraI was inserted at the deletion site. The inserted fragment includes the simian virus 40 (SV40) origin of replication and promoter and coding sequences for thegpt gene. pTIRevEnv was constructed by inserting HIVrev and env coding sequences (nucleotides 5538 to 8607) into pUHD10-3 (28Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar) between the EcoRI andBamHI sites. The inserted HIV rev andenv coding sequences were under the control of the tetracycline-responsive inducible promoter (Fig. 2). The human embryonal kidney cell line, 293T, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, SH300071.03). The #69TIRevEnv packaging cell line (29Yu H. Rabson A.B. Kaul M. Ron Y. Dougherty J.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4530-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.2 mg/ml G418 (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem Chem. Co.), and 2 μg/ml tetracycline. The HeLaT4 cell line was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin. Plasmid DNA was transfected by the modified calcium phosphate precipitation method (30Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar) into the human 293T cell line. The producer cells containing HIV-1 vector were plated at 2 × 105 cells per 60-mm diameter dish with 2 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) and were induced by withdrawal of tetracycline 24 h after plating. HIV-1 vector virus was harvested 5 days past induction. Infection of HeLaT4 cells (3×105) was performed by first treating with 2 ml of media containing 2 μg/ml Polybrene for 30 min after which HeLaT4 were inoculated with 0.3 ml of 10-fold serial dilutions of virus supernatant for 2 h. Cells were then selected for xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase resistance with 0.25 mg/ml xanthine (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), 15 μg/ml hypoxanthine (Aldrich Chem. Co.), plus 7 μg/ml mycophenolic acid (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) to obtain target cell clones. All polymerase chain reactions in this study used 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm of each dNTP, 5 μm of each primer, 0.7 mg of genomic DNA, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a final volume of 40 μl. The initial PCR reactions were used to screen each proviral LTR on agarose gels for gross rearrangements. Primer names are prefixed with a letter indicating whether the primer is specific for HXB2 (H), NL4-3 (N), or both (B), followed by a number indicating the coordinate of the 5′-end of each oligonucleotide and a “+” or “−” to denote the sense or antisense primer, respectively. The primer pairs used to amplify 5′-LTRs were B8+ (5′-GCTAATTCACTCCCAAAGAAGC-3′) and B732− (5′-CCCTCGCCTCTTGCCGTGC-3′) producing a normal amplicon length of 725 bp. Amplification conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 50 s, carried out for 30 cycles. Amplification of 3′-LTRs was performed using primers B9017+ (5′-ACCTTTAAGACCAATGACAAGG-3′) and B634− (5′-TGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGAC-3′) anticipated to generate a product of 702 bp. Amplification conditions for this PCR were: 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 50 s, for 30 cycles. PCR fragments used for SSCP were restricted to between 150 and 180 bp in length. Each PCR reaction contained 0.2 mCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and the reaction conditions used were the same as those described above for the 5′-LTR. The following primer pairs were used for screening the LTRs by SSCP: SSCP1 (H8+ (5′-GCTAATTCACTCCCAAAGAAG-3′) and H167− (5′-CTTCTGGCTCAACTGGTACTAG-3′) or N8+ (5′-GCTAATTTGGTCCCAAAAAAG-3′) and N168− (5′-CTTGCTCTGGTTCAACTGGTAC-3′)), SSCP2 (B123+ (5′-CCTTTGGATGGTGCTACAAGCTAG-3′) and B275− (5′-GCGGCTGTCAAACCTCCACTCTAAC-3′)), SSCP3 (B244+ (5′-GAGAAGTGTTAGAGTGGAGGTTTGACAG-3′) and B400− (5′-CCAGTCCCGCCCAGGCCACGC-3′), SSCP4 (B347+ (5′-ACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGG-3′) and B507− (5′-CCCTAGTTAGCCAGAGAGCTCCCAGG-3′)), and SSCP5 (B482+ (5′-CCTGGGAGCTCTCTGGCTAACTAGGG-3′) and B634− (5′-TGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTAAAAG-3′)). PCR products were mixed with 6× loading dye (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol) (31Sheffield V.C. Beck J.S. Kwitek A.E. Sandstrom D.W. Stone E.M. Genomics. 1993; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), heated at 94 °C for 3 min, then placed on ice for 5 min before loading onto the gel. The non-denaturing gels either contained 6% polyacrylamide and 5% glycerol or were mutation detection enhancement gels made according to the manufacturer's instructions (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME). SSCP gels were run at 32 watts at 4 °C until the xylene cyanol dye front was within 50 to 80 mm from the bottom of the gel. Typical running times were ∼6.5 h. Then the gels were dried and exposed in PhosphorImager cassettes overnight before scanning (Molecular Dynamics Model 400E). Candidate mutations detected by SSCP were confirmed by independent PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Mutational events were studied by examining provirus sequences after a single cycle of virus replication. Two similar HIV-1 vectors, HIV-gpt (24Page K.A. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5270-5276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NL4-3gpt, derived from the HXB2 and NL4-3 strains, respectively, were employed in these experiments (Fig.2). They were constructed by deleting a large part of env and inserting the gptresistance gene under control of the SV40 early gene promoter. The respective deletions only disrupted the env reading frame, leaving the other coding sequences intact (Fig. 2). The vector virus was subjected to a single cycle of replication followed by molecular analyses of the LTRs according to the protocol outlined in Fig. 3. The HIV-1 vector plasmid (HIV-gpt or NL4-3gpt) was first cotransfected with an amphotropic murine leukemia virus env expression plasmid pEnvAm (32Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. Virology. 1988; 167: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) into human 293T cells to produce pseudotyped HIV-1 vector virus (Fig. 3). 2–3 days later, pseudotyped HIV-1 vector virus was harvested and utilized to inoculate an HIV-1 env inducible cell line, which is CD4-negative at a low multiplicity of infection (29Yu H. Rabson A.B. Kaul M. Ron Y. Dougherty J.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4530-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Individual cell clones harboring a HIV-1 vector provirus were selected, isolated, expanded, and designated Step 2 cell clones (Fig.3). Because these cell clones resulted from infection at a low multiplicity of infection, each was anticipated to harbor a single provirus, which was confirmed by Southern blotting (data not shown). Within the Step 2 cell clones, expression HIV-1 rev andenv was controlled by a tetracycline-responsive promoter. After tetracycline removal, Rev and Env production ensued initiating vector virus production. The vector virus produced from the Step 2 cell clones were then used to infect CD4-positive HeLaT4 cells followed by selection with gpt, with subsequent isolation and expansion of these Step 3 cell clones. Fourteen Step 2 cell clones were utilized to generate 215 Step 3 cell clones, averaging ∼15 progeny Step 3 clones derived from each Step 2 cell clone. From Step 2 clones to Step 3 clones, the vector virus was restricted to a single cycle of replication. Vector virus produced by Step 2 clones could not re-infect the producer cells, because they were CD4-negative, and the HeLaT4-based Step 3 cells could not complement the defective vector, because they do not express Env (Fig. 3). Proviral DNA extracted from Step 3 clones was subject to further molecular analyses. The impetus for examining the viral LTRs was to gain insight into the relative contribution to viral mutagenesis by HIV-1 RT and RNA pol II (Fig. 1). Identical mutations found within both LTRs could have been introduced by either RNA pol II or RT, but mutations found in only one LTR would have been introduced by RT alone (Fig. 1). Molecular analyses of Step 3 provirus LTRs were carried out employing PCR amplification combined with agarose gel electrophoresis, single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and automated DNA sequencing. This allowed identification of mutations in the context of autologous HIV-1 sequence without the need for selection. To detect gross genetic rearrangements, the proviral LTRs were first amplified using appropriate primers. The 5′-LTR was amplified using a primer pair composed of one oligonucleotide with homology to the 5′ most proviral sequence and the other with homology to sequence just downstream of the primer binding site (see “Experimental Procedures” for specific coordinates). This primer pair was anticipated to yield a 725-bp product. The 3′-LTRs were amplified with one primer corresponding to the 3′ most end of the provirus and the other just upstream of the polypurine tract and was expected to yield a 702-bp product. The PCR samples were then subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Of the 430 LTRs analyzed, corresponding to 215 vector proviruses, only five did not display the anticipated mobilities (Fig.4 A). To detect single base mutations, the SSCP assay was employed. This is a relatively simple procedure for detecting single base mutations in a nucleic acid. The PCR product is denatured and electrophoresed in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Mutated fragments will typically display an altered mobility. Conditions were employed that allowed detection of ∼80% of point mutations (33Sekiya T. Mutat. Res. 1993; 288: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments were performed with five samples, each with a single base substitution within the LTR that had been identified by direct DNA sequencing. It was possible to identify four of five mutants via SSCP using the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” and is in agreement with previous publications attesting to the mutational scoring efficiency of this procedure (31Sheffield V.C. Beck J.S. Kwitek A.E. Sandstrom D.W. Stone E.M. Genomics. 1993; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 34Ushijima T. Hosoya Y. Suzuki T. Sofuni T. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Mutat.

A. 1989; 86: 2766-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar) (data not shown). It is noteworthy that SSCP is a more efficient method for scoring mutations relative to utilizing marker gene systems where it has been estimated that ∼40% of mutations are scored with the remainder being silent (20Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 36Parthasarathi S. Varela-Echavarria A. Ron Y. Preston B.D. Dougherty J.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7991-8000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mansky L.M. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 494-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five primer pairs were designed to amplify both LTRs of proviral DNA. Each fragment spanned 150–180 bp with adjacent fragments overlapping each other. The PCR products were isotopically labeled with α-32P, and after amplification, products were denatured and electrophoresed in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by visualization using a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). DNA fragments that displayed a shift in mobility were anticipated to contain mutations. A representative example is shown in Fig. 4 B. Mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing. Any segment that yielded a mutation was amplified and sequenced a second time to confirm that the shift did not result from a mutation introduced during PCR amplification. Given that the frequency of mutation introduced by Taq polymerase is 1 × 10−4 per base pair (38Tindall K.R. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), the chance that the same mutation would arise a second time in the same position then becomes 1 × 10−8, which is three to four logs lower than the mutation frequency observed in this analysis. It should be noted that controls were performed to exclude the possibility that the mutations scored in the Step 3 progeny proviruses were actually fixed in the Step 2 cell proviruses during their development, which involved transfection and one cycle of replication. To that end, the DNA sequence of the LTRs of all 14 Step 2 cell proviruses was determined. The DNA sequence of 13 Step 2 proviruses corresponded exactly to the parental sequence. The DNA sequence of one of the Step 2 proviruses contained a single base substitution, and consequently that base substitution was not scored as a mutation when observed in all of the corresponding Step 3 cell progeny (Figs.5 and 6). In no other case was an identical mutation observed in all of the Step 3 proviruses originating from a particular Step 2 cell clone. Thus, the mutations denoted in Figs. 5 and 6 occurred during replication from the Step 2 to Step 3 cells.Figure 6Genetic Rearrangement. A, the sequences of the relevant segments of the rearrangements are shown. Therectangles indicate sequence overlap at the point of mutation. The boldface letters indicate a point mutation.B, schematic representation of the aforementioned mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As noted above, two HIV-1 vectors, HIV-gpt and NL4-3gpt, based on strains HXB2 and NL4-3, respectively, were used in these studies. This allows the comparison of mutation rates between two different strains one of which, HIV-gpt, contains mutations within some of the accessory genes, in particular Vpr, which has been reported to influence fidelity (Fig. 2) (19Mansky L.M. Virology. 1996; 222: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These two vectors were separately subjected to replication through a single cycle. A total of 215 Step 3 cell clones were collected and analyzed, of which 99 were from the HIV-gpt vector and 116 were from the NL4-3gpt vector. In all, 21 mutations were identified with 10 in both LTRs and 11 in a single LTR. The mutation rates obtained with HIV-gpt and NL4-3gpt were quite close, 9.2 × 10−5 and 7.9 × 10−5 per base pair per replication cycle, respectively, with the overall rate of mutation being 8.5 × 10−5per base pair per replication cycle (TableI).Table ISummary of mutation types and ratesHXB2 (HIV-gpt)NL4–3 (NL4–3gpt)TotalNo. of proviruses analyzed99116215Base substitutions8715Duplications213Insertions101Deletions022Mutations in one LTR8311Mutations in both LTRs3710Mutation rates1-aThe mutation rates represent the number of mutations per bp per replication cycle.

Open table in a new tab The predominant type of mutation was single base substitutions, of which there were 14, comprising 67% of the total number of mutations (Fig. 5 and Tables II andIII). Among them, 10 mutations were transitions (8 G → A and 2 C → T transitions), and 4 mutations were transversions (one of each of the following, T → A, G → T, A → T, and C → A). One mutant LTR harbored three consecutive base substitutions consisting of a change from GAG to ACC, so it contains a mix of both a transition and two transversions (Fig. 5 and Table II). In addition to the base substitutions, there was a single frameshift deletion near the U3-R border of one mutation (Fig. 5).Table IIMutations that occurred in either 5′ or 3′ LTRsClone no.Mutation5′-LTR3′-LTRN42-aThe N-prefixed clones are from the NL4–3 strain.U5, G deletion+H172-bThe H-prefixed clones are from the HXB2 strain.R, C → T+H17R and U5 duplication+N26U3 to U5 deletion+H40tRNA and cellular sequence insertion+H72U3, GAG → ACC+N8528-bp U5 duplication+H115U3, G → T+H122R, C → T+H152U3, G → A+H168Part of U5 duplication+2-a The N-prefixed clones are from the NL4–3 strain.2-b The H-prefixed clones are from the HXB2 strain.

H17 had a duplicated U5 and part of R near the end of an almost complete 3′-LTR (Fig. 6). More specifically, the mutation is 20 bp from the end of the parental LTR. H168 had a nearly complete 3′-LTR duplication, which began after the 16th base pair of U5 of the first LTR with the second LTR starting 13 bp from the beginning of the parental U3 (Fig. 6). Although N85 has a normal 3′-LTR, it also contained two additional bases, GT, as well as a partial U5 duplication (Fig. 6). The pattern of duplications is similar for all three mutants and is likely to share a common mechanism, which is elaborated upon under “Discussion.” Of the remaining two larger mutations, one had a deletion and the other an insertion. The deletion, N26, consisted of a 266-bp deletion within the 3′-LTR (Fig. 6). The deleted sequence included part of U3 and U5 as well as all of R (Fig. 6).

https://openalex.org/W1997092292,"p53 is an important regulator of cell cycle progression and apoptosis, and inactivation of p53 is associated with tumorigenesis. Although p53 exerts many of its effects through regulation of transcription, this protein is also found in association with ribosomes and several mRNAs have been identified that are translationally controlled in a p53-dependent manner. We have utilized murine erythroleukemic cells that express a temperature-sensitive p53 protein to determine whether p53 also functions at the level of translation. The data presented here demonstrate that p53 causes a rapid decrease in translation initiation. Analysis of several potential mechanisms for regulating protein synthesis shows that p53 has selective effects on the phosphorylation of the eIF4E-binding protein, 4E-BP1, and the activity of the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase. These data provide evidence that modulation of translational activity constitutes a further mechanism by which the growth inhibitory effects of p53 may be mediated."
https://openalex.org/W1999440837,"Anti-oxidant response element (ARE) and nuclear factors including Nrf2 and small Maf (MafG and MafK) proteins are known to regulate expression and induction of detoxifying enzyme genes including quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1). Nrf2 upregulates and small Maf proteins lacking the transcriptional activation domain down regulates ARE-mediated expression and induction. In this report, we have investigated the role of c-Maf (large Maf) containing the transcriptional activation domain in the regulation of ARE-mediated genes expression. The overexpression of c-Maf in human hepatoblastoma (Hep-G2) cells led to the repression of ARE-mediated NQO1 and GST Ya genes expression and induction in response to tert-butyl hydroquinone (t-BHQ). This was in contrast to the role of c-Maf in the activation of Maf recognition element (MARE) mediated p53 gene expression. Deletion of transcriptional activation domain of c-Maf (^c-Maf) led to significant loss of MARE-mediated p53 gene expression but had no effect on the repression of ARE-mediated NQO1 gene expression. The overexpression of MafG in Hep-G2 cells repressed both ARE and MARE-mediated genes expression. The co-expression of c-Maf with MafG rescued the MafG repression of MARE but not ARE-mediated gene expression. Band and super shift assays showed the presence of c-Maf in the ARE-nuclear protein complex. Similar assays with in vitrotranslated proteins revealed that both c-Maf and ^c-Maf bound to NQO1 gene ARE as homodimers and heterodimers with small Maf but not as heterodimers with Nrf2. Mutational analysis of the NQO1 gene ARE indicated that core ARE sequence is essential for binding of c-Maf leading to repression of NQO1 gene expression. Northern analysis revealed that c-Maf expression increases 2˜h after t-BHQ treatment. It reached a plateau at 4˜h after t-BHQ treatment. The results together led to the conclusion that c-Maf negatively regulates ARE-mediated detoxifying enzyme genes expression and induction in response to anti-oxidants."
https://openalex.org/W2016606027,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulate a wide variety of cellular functions by phosphorylating their specific substrates. Here we have identified Tob as a novel substrate of MAPK. Tob, a member of the Tob and B-cell translocation gene anti-proliferative protein family, is shown to negatively regulate the proliferation of osteoblasts and T cells. In this study, our two-hybrid screening has identified Tob as an ERK2-interacting protein. Biochemical analyses have then shown that ERK MAPK (ERK2) and JNK/SAPK (JNK2) bind to and phosphorylate Tob in vitro. ERK catalyzes the phosphorylation more efficiently than JNK. When the ERK pathway is activated in cells, phosphorylation of Tob is induced. An ERK-binding or -docking site locates in the N-terminal portion of Tob, and phosphorylation sites reside in the C-terminal stretch region. The docking is crucial for efficient phosphorylation. Mutant forms of Tob, in which serines are replaced by glutamic acids to mimic phosphorylation, show a much reduced ability to inhibit the cell cycle progression to S phase from G0/G1 phase, as compared with wild-type Tob, indicating that ERK phosphorylation negatively regulates the anti-proliferative function of Tob."

Little is known about how these avenues of ion channel regulation may interact. We report that the potassium channel Kv1.2 associates with the actin-binding protein cortactin and that the binding is modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Immunocytochemical and biochemical analyses show that Kv1.2 and cortactin co-localize to the cortical actin cytoskeleton at the leading edges of the cell. Binding assays using purified recombinant proteins reveal a 19-amino acid span within the carboxyl terminus of Kv1.2 that is necessary for direct cortactin binding. Phosphorylation of specific tyrosines within the C terminus of Kv1.2 attenuates that binding. In HEK293 cells, activation of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor evokes tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent suppression of Kv1.2 ionic current. We show that M1 receptor activation also reduces the interaction of cortactin with Kv1.2 and that mutant Kv1.2 channels deficient for cortactin binding exhibit strongly attenuated ionic current.

The earliest and most widely reported examples involve serine/threonine phosphorylation; however, it is also now recognized that tyrosine phosphorylation is an important means of ion channel regulation (8Siegelbaum S.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 242-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was the first ligand-gated ion channel found to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (9Hopfield J.F. Tank D.W. Greengard P. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1988; 336: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The shaker family potassium channel Kv1.2, which is expressed abundantly in cardiac muscle (10Paulmichi M. Nasmith P.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4588-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was the first voltage-gated channel found to be so regulated. Kv1.2 α-subunit protein becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon the activation of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs),1 leading to a profound suppression of Kv1.2 ionic current (14Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Part of the mechanism for such suppression involves phosphorylation of the N-terminal tyrosine Tyr132. However, phosphorylation of additional tyrosines within Kv1.2 is also likely to be required, since Y132F mutant channels are only partially resistant to tyrosine phosphorylation and ionic current suppression. Little is known about the signaling proteins involved in tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent suppression of Kv1.2 ionic current; however, binding of the activated form of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein RhoA to Kv1.2 is required (15Cachero T.G. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1998; 93: 1077-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RhoA is an important regulator of actin dynamics (16Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 17O'Connell C.B. Wheatley S.P. Ahmed S. Wang Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Schafer D.A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1919-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the physical association between RhoA and Kv1.2 suggests a link between the cytoskeleton and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Kv1.2. This is consistent with a growing body of data indicating that the cytoskeleton has an important role in ion channel function and regulation. In addition to affecting channel localization (19Burke N.A. Takioto K., Li, D. Han W. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Sheng M. Wyszynski M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), proteins that compose or associate with the cytoskeleton can influence ion channel activity per se. That conclusion is based primarily on reports showing that pharmacological disruption of the actin cytoskeleton profoundly affects the physiology of a number of ion channels (21Rosenmund C. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1993; 10: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 22Undrovinas A.I. Shander G.S. Makielski J.C. Am. J.

J. Physiol. 1995; 6: C1152-C1161Google Scholar). Such pharmacological data still comprise the bulk of the evidence linking the cytoskeleton to channel physiology, yet several recent reports identify specific cytoskeleton-associated proteins that affect ion channel function. They include ankyrin binding to the ryanodine receptors to influence its ability to release calcium (25Bourguignon L.Y. Chu A. Jin H. Brandt N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17919-17922Google Scholar), SAP90 binding to kainate receptors to affect desensitization (26Garcia E.P. Mehta S. Blair L.A. Wells D.G. Shang J. Fukushima T. Fallon J.R. Garner C.C. Marshall J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), α-actinin coupling with Kv1.5 to affect current density (27Maruoka N.D.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and filamin interacting with Kv4.1 to affect current density (28Petrecca K. Miller D.M. Shrier A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8736-8744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings show that the cytoskeleton has an important but still poorly understood role in regulating the activity of a variety of ion channels. Here we report that Kv1.2 associates with the F-actin-binding protein cortactin in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner and that such binding may have a role in phosphorylation-dependent channel regulation. Cortactin is a substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation within the cortical cytoskeleton, and its modular structure suggests a multifaceted role within the cell. An N-terminal region binds to the Arp2/3 complex, thereby providing a site for actin filament nucleation (29Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C., Li, R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 30Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), an activity that is regulated by cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation (32Huang C., Ni, Y. Wang T. Gao Y. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The C terminus of cortactin contains tyrosines that can serve as SH2 domain docking site for Src kinase (33Okamura H. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26613-26618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and an SH3 domain that binds to a number of proteins, including Shank (34Naisbitt S. Kim E., Tu, J.C.

Orth J.D. Cao H. Wong T.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Collectively, these features make cortactin well suited to couple tyrosine kinase signaling between membrane proteins and the cytoskeleton (37Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, the role of cortactin remains obscure in many cases. We have found that cortactin co-localizes with Kv1.2 within F-actin-rich leading edge structures. Further, we show that cortactin binds directly to the carboxyl terminus of Kv1.2 and that the interaction is reduced by phosphorylation of specific tyrosines within the Kv1.2 C terminus. The same mutations within Kv1.2 that reduce cortactin binding also result in channels that generate significantly less ionic current than do wild type channels. These data reveal a tyrosine kinase-dependent interaction between Kv1.2 and the actin cytoskeleton via cortactin and suggest a role for cortactin in Kv1.2 function. Protein grade Triton X-100 was purchased fromCalbiochem; glutathione, and protein G-conjugated Sepharose and glutathione-Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Biosciences; and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma or as indicated. GST-C was generated using a pGEX-2T vector into which the C terminus of Kv1.2 (aa 413–499) had been subcloned between the BamH1 and EcoR1 multicloning sites. GST-wild type cortactin was a gift from C. Huang and X. Zhan (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). GST-SH3 encodes the SH3-domain of cortactin (aa 490–546) subcloned into pGEX-2T between the BamHI and EcoRI sites and was a gift from Brian Kay (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Truncation mutants were generated by introducing stop codons using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene); GST-cortactn-ΔSH3 was generated by introducing a stop codon at aa 497 within the GST-wild type cortactin construct. Approximately 5 μg of purified GST fusion protein bound to Sepharose beads were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 293m cell lysates or with 100 nm soluble recombinant cortactin (derived by thrombin cleavage of cortactin from GST) in Triton lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads and then separated by SDS-PAGE. GST fusion proteins were detected with anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Stable 293 cell lines were created as described (15Cachero T.G. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1998; 93: 1077-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All stable cell lines expressing Kv1.2wt and mutant channels also stably expressed Kvβ2 subunits. For all experiments, the 293 cells were plated to low confluence (∼3.5 × 106 cells/100-mm plate) 12 h before use. Ionic current generated by Kv1.2 protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes was measured as described (15Cachero T.G. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1998; 93: 1077-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, Xenopus oocytes were injected with 18 ng of cRNA encoding Kv1.2wt, Kv1.2–458stop, or Kv1.2-Y417F. Recordings were made 24–48 h after injection using standard two-electrode voltage clamp at 25 °C in OR-2 saline (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). 293 cells were treated with a control saline or carbachol (10 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and the lysed in 1 ml of Triton lysis buffer (100 mm KCl, 2 mmATP, 3.94 μm MgCl2 (250 nm free magnesium), 1 mm Na4BAPTA, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmHEPES, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), pH 7.4, at 4 °C). The lysate was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 4 min. The supernatant was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The soluble fraction supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube. The remaining high speed pellet (HSP) was washed and resuspended in a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), pH 7.4, at 4 °C). Three distinct anti-Kv1.2 antibodies were used: 1) αKv-p, an affinity-purified rabbit anti-Kv1.2 polyclonal antibody against a peptide region (aa 468–481) within the carboxyl terminus of Kv1.2; 2) αKv-e, a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide encoding a portion of the first extracellular loop (aa 192–208) of Kv1.2 (BIOSOURCE International); 3) αKv-i, a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the nearly complete C terminus (aa 428–499) of Kv1.2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-cortactin antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, and rabbit polyclonal anti-cortactin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). HEK293 cells were plated onto noncoated glass coverslips and grown for 12 h. To detect surface Kv1.2, αKv-e (100 μg/ml) was added to the growth medium overlaying living cells for 20 min at 37 °C and then washed 3 × 5 min with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. All other antibodies were applied after fixation. Primary antibodies are as indicated. Secondary antibodies were AlexaFlour-488-, AlexaFlour-658-, or AlexaFlour-647-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit. Imaging was with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024ES confocal scanning laser microscope system or with an Olympus BX50 epifluorescence microscope as indicated. Images were collected and stored digitally. To determine whether Kv1.2 and cortactin can co-associate, we performed immunoprecipitation studies with native proteins expressed in rat brain. Western blot with an anti-cortactin monoclonal antibody revealed that cortactin co-immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody directed against an epitope within the C terminus of Kv1.2 (αKv-p) or with polyclonal antibody directed against the first extracellular loop of Kv1.2 (αKv-e) but not with protein G beads alone (Fig.1 a). Some cortactin breakdown is typically evident in our co-immunoprecipitation of Kv1.2 from brain tissue but not from HEK293 cells. It is possible that a protease present in brain remains part of the Kv1.2 immunocomplex, where it acts on cortactin. Indeed, cortactin proteolysis may be a means of cortactin regulation in platelets (38Huang C. Tandon N.N. Greco N.J., Ni, Y. Wang T. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19248-19252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since cortactin co-immunoprecipitated with two antibodies directed against different epitopes within Kv1.2, it is unlikely that the observed positive signals occurred through nonspecific antibody cross-reactivity. To examine the interactions between Kv1.2 and cortactin in more detail, we chose HEK293 cells transfected with and under stable selection for a plasmid encoding the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and the potassium channel Kv1.2-α and Kv1.2β2 subunits (293mK cells) (15Cachero T.G. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1998; 93: 1077-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,39Tsai W. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1997; 15: 4597-4605Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This system has the added advantage of allowing the use of a HEK293 cell line expressing M1 muscarinic receptors but not Kv1.2-α or Kv1.2β2 (293m cells) as a rigorous control for nonspecific antibody binding. Consistent with our findings with rat brain, we found that cortactin co-immunoprecipitated with Kv1.2 in the 293 cell system. The cortactin signal was specific to the presence of Kv1.2 and does not represent antibody cross-reactivity because it did not appear in the 293m parental cell line. Data from three independent experiments are summarized in Fig. 1 c. Actin dynamics within the cortical cytoskeleton are regulated in part by the actin-binding protein cortactin. The central region of cortactin contains actin-binding domains that serve to cross-link actin filaments (31Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), whereas an N-terminal domain binds to the Arp2/3 complex, which in turn mediates nucleation of actin filaments (30Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Functionality of cortactin within the cortical cytoskeleton is expanded by the presence of a variety of proteins that bind to cortactin via SH2 and SH3 interactions. Thus, cortactin can dynamically influence physiology associated with the cortical cytoskeleton either directly through cross-linking or indirectly through its binding partners. In particular, cortactin is thought to serve as a nexus for tyrosine kinase signaling within the cortical cytoskeleton (37Weed S.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Since Kv1.2 is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, and since several other ion channels have been shown to associate with components of the cortical cytoskeleton (40Molday L.L. Cook N.J. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18690-18695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Smith P.R. Saccomani G. Joe E.H. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 42Srinivasan Y. Elmer L. Davis J. Bennett V. Angelides K. Nature. 1988; 333: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 43Wechsler A. Teichberg V.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the interaction between Kv1.2 and cortactin occurs within the cortical cytoskeleton. To test this idea, we used differential centrifugation to obtain a cellular fraction enriched in the cortical cytoskeleton. 293mK cells were lysed and subjected to sequential centrifugation in Triton lysis buffer to produce a Triton soluble fraction and a cortical cytoskeleton enriched fraction (HSP) (44Sheetz M.P. The Bilayer and Shell Model of Erythrocyte Membrane. A. R. Liss, New York1980Google Scholar). Western analysis revealed that both Kv1.2 and cortactin are present in the HSP and soluble fractions (Fig.2). Since equal volumes of HSP or soluble fraction lysate were loaded into each lane, the stronger signals evident in the soluble fraction indicate a higher molar concentration of both Kv1.2 and cortactin relative to HSP lysate. Nevertheless, the ability of Kv1.2 to immunoprecipitate cortactin was limited to the HSP fraction (Fig. 2). Identical results were obtained in three independent experiments. To confirm our biochemical findings that Kv1.2 and cortactin associate with each other and that the association occurs within the cortical cytoskeleton, we used confocal and wide field immunofluorescence microscopy to detect co-localization within fixed 293mK cells. Since they conduct potassium ions across the plasma membrane, Kv1.2-α subunits that compose functional Kv1.2 channels reside at the surface of the cell rather than within intracellular compartments. We therefore first sought to differentially detect surface versusinternal Kv1.2 protein and to then ask whether cortactin co-localizes preferentially with either of those subpopulations. To accomplish this, we used rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against an extracellular portion of Kv1.2 (αKv-e), in conjunction with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the intracellular C terminus of Kv1.2 (αKv-i). Confocal microscopy revealed that the αKv-e (Fig.3 b) localizes to the surface of the cell, primarily within leading edge structures, whereas the αKv-i signal localizes primarily within and throughout the central region of the cell (Fig. 3 a). Fig. 3 c is a merge of Fig. 3 a (green) and Fig. 3 b(red), showing that a distinct population of surface Kv1.2 can be readily distinguished from the intracellular population. Presumably, the surface population represents channels capable of conducting ionic current, whereas the internal population may represent immature channel protein (45Li D. Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11597-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). An indication of the possible physiological role of the Kv1.2-cortactin interaction may come from knowing whether the interaction occurs within the surface or the internal population of Kv1.2. To determine which Kv1.2 population cortactin co-localizes with, we used immunofluorescence labeling of either surface or total Kv1.2 and simultaneous labeling of cortactin in fixed 293mK cells. Fig.4 a shows a confocal micrograph of total Kv1.2 labeled with αKv-e antibody. The same cells were labeled with a monoclonal antibody directed against cortactin (Fig.4 b). Fig. 4 c shows a merge of Fig. 4,a (red) and b (green). Little if any co-localization of total Kv1.2 and cortactin can be observed. In contrast, confocal images of surface Kv1.2 (Fig. 4,d and e (red)) and cortactin (Fig. 4,e and i (green)) clearly indicate that the proteins co-localize. That this co-localization occurs primarily in the leading edges of the cell was confirmed with lower magnification wide field fluorescent images of cells surface-labeled with αKv-e (Fig. 4 g) and monoclonal anti-cortactin (Fig.4 h). Co-localization of surface Kv1.2 and cortactin is readily detectable in the leading edge structures of nearly all of the cells around the circumference of the cell cluster. Cortactin is enriched within lamellipodia (30Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 31Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 46Kaksonen M. Peng H.B. Rauvala H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4421-4426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Weed S.A., Du, Y. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443PubMed Google Scholar), where it contributes to the highly dynamic reorganization of the membrane-associated actin cytoskeleton. Our finding that Kv1.2 and cortactin co-localize within that region is consistent with our biochemical data showing co-association in a cortical cytoskeleton enriched fraction. To confirm that the leading edge structures in which we observe Kv1.2 and cortactin co-localization are enriched with F-actin, we triple-labeled 293mK cells with αKv-e primary antibody (Fig. 4, i (blue) and l), α-cortactin primary antibody (Fig. 4, i (red) and j), and fluorescence-conjugated phalloidin to label F-actin (Fig. 4, i (green) and k). F-actin staining in the leading edges was pronounced, and co-localization of all three proteins is evident (Fig. 4, i(white and arrows)). Taken together, the data shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 indicate that Kv1.2 and cortactin co-associate and that they do so within the membrane-associated actin cytoskeleton. Having determined that cortactin co-associates with Kv1.2 in immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays, we next determined whether or not the co-association is direct. To map the domains of the Kv1.2/cortactin interaction, we performed pull-down assays using purified recombinant GST fusion proteins of regions within Kv1.2 and purified recombinant cortactin. Soluble recombinant cortactin and immobilized GST fusion proteins of the amino (G-N) or the carboxyl (G-C) terminal regions of Kv1.2 were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western analysis using a monoclonal anti-cortactin antibody indicates that purified recombinant cortactin binds directly to G-N or G-C but not to GST alone (Fig. 5 a,top). The bottom half of the same gel was stained for total protein to confirm equal loading of G-N, G-CP, and GST (Fig.5 a, middle). Data from three independent experiments are quantified in Fig. 5 a (bottom). Cortactin binds to both the N- and C-terminal regions of Kv1.2, and binding to either may be important to Kv1.2 physiology. However, cortactin binding to the C terminus of Kv1.2 is significantly more robust than to the N terminus, and we therefore chose to proceed by examining only the interaction between Kv1.2 C terminus and cortactin. To gain insight into the regions within the Kv1.2 C terminus required for cortactin binding, we measured the effect of serial truncations of GST-C on cortactin binding. Fig. 5 b indicates binding of 100 nm recombinant cortactin to truncated forms of GST-C normalized to its binding to full-length GST-C. GST-489stop, GST-474stop, GST-470stop, and GST-464stop all bind to cortactin to the same degree as does full-length GST-C. In contrast, GST-462stop bound significantly more weakly. This reduced but detectable binding was maintained with GST-458stop and GST-448stop. Introduction of a stop codon at sites 445 or beyond, however, completely eliminated cortactin binding. Thus, the 19-amino acid span between Lys446 and Glu463, with a small critical zone at each end, is required for cortactin binding to the C terminus of Kv1.2 (Fig.5 c). It is important to note that the cortactin binding span may not be the site of physical interaction between Kv1.2 and cortactin. Instead, it represents a region within the C terminus that is required for such binding. The actual cortactin binding region may lie within that region or within in a portion of the C terminus between aa 413 and 445. Interestingly, a potential SH3 binding ligand region exists in the Kv1.2 C terminus between aa 436 and 442 (Fig.6 a). The Kv1.2 sequence, CPKIPSSP, is not identical to a consensus cortactin SH3 ligand sequence, +PPΨPXKP (48Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quillam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar); however, considerable similarity exists between them. Since an SH3 interaction is important for tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent suppression of a related channel, Kv1.5 (49Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we asked whether cortactin binds to Kv1.2 via an SH3 interaction. We first asked whether soluble recombinant Kv1.2 C terminus could bind to full-length GST-cortactin (G-FL in Fig. 6), to a GST fusion protein containing only the cortactin SH3 domain (G-SH3), or to GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Only full-length cortactin and not the isolated cortactin SH3 domain bound to the soluble Kv1.2 C terminus in a pull-d"
https://openalex.org/W2020923999,"Telomerase is an RNA-protein complex responsible for the extension of one strand of telomere terminal repeats. The catalytic protein subunit of telomerase, known generically as telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), exhibits significant homology to reverse transcriptases (RTs) encoded by retroviruses and retroelements. The mechanisms of telomerase may therefore be similar to those of the conventional reverse transcriptases. In this report, we explore potential similarity between these two classes of proteins in a region with no evident sequence similarity. Previous analysis has implicated a C-terminal domain of retroviral RTs (known as the “thumb” domain) in template-primer binding and in processivity control. The equivalent region of TERTs, although similar to one another, does not exhibit significant sequence homology to retroviral RTs. However, we found that removal of this region of yeast TERT similarly resulted in a decrease in the stability of telomerase-DNA complex and in the processivity of telomerase-mediated nucleotide addition. Moreover, the C-terminal domain of TERT exhibits a nucleic acid binding activity when recombinantly expressed and purified. Finally, amino acid substitutions of conserved residues in this region of TERT were found to impair telomerase activity and processivity. We suggest that mechanistic similarity between telomerase and retroviral RTs may extend beyond the regions with apparent sequence similarity. Telomerase is an RNA-protein complex responsible for the extension of one strand of telomere terminal repeats. The catalytic protein subunit of telomerase, known generically as telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), exhibits significant homology to reverse transcriptases (RTs) encoded by retroviruses and retroelements. The mechanisms of telomerase may therefore be similar to those of the conventional reverse transcriptases. In this report, we explore potential similarity between these two classes of proteins in a region with no evident sequence similarity. Previous analysis has implicated a C-terminal domain of retroviral RTs (known as the “thumb” domain) in template-primer binding and in processivity control. The equivalent region of TERTs, although similar to one another, does not exhibit significant sequence homology to retroviral RTs. However, we found that removal of this region of yeast TERT similarly resulted in a decrease in the stability of telomerase-DNA complex and in the processivity of telomerase-mediated nucleotide addition. Moreover, the C-terminal domain of TERT exhibits a nucleic acid binding activity when recombinantly expressed and purified. Finally, amino acid substitutions of conserved residues in this region of TERT were found to impair telomerase activity and processivity. We suggest that mechanistic similarity between telomerase and retroviral RTs may extend beyond the regions with apparent sequence similarity. reverse transcriptase C-terminal extension high pressure liquid chromatography circular dichroism substitutions in conserved residues telomerase reverse transcriptase Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that is responsible for maintaining the terminal repeats of telomeres in most organisms (1Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). It acts as an unusual reverse transcriptase (RT),1 using a small segment of an integral RNA component as template for the synthesis of the dGT-rich strand of telomeres (2Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity has been characterized from a wide range of organisms and genes encoding both the RNA and protein components of the enzyme complex identified (for reviews see (3Blackburn E.H. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 4Nugent C.I. Lundblad V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1073-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar)). Telomerase RNAs found in ciliated protozoa, in addition to having a short templating region, share a common secondary structure. Telomerase RNAs from yeast and mammals are considerably larger, and within each group conserved structural elements can be identified based on phylogenetic and mutational analysis (5Tzfati Y.

The catalytic reverse transcriptase protein subunit (TERT), first purified from Euplotes aediculatus as p123, was found to be homologous to Est2p, a yeast protein required for telomere maintenance (7Lendvay T.S.

Both proteins possess RT-like motifs, alterations therein can cause inactivation of telomerase activity and reduction in telomere lengths. Subsequently, homologs of TERT were identified in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, human, mouse,Tetrahymena, Oxytricha, andArabidopsis (10Nakamura T.M. Morin G.B. Chapman K.B. Weinrich S.L. Andrews W.H.

Because co-expression of TERT and telomerase RNA in vitro in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system suffices to reconstitute enzyme activity (18Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R., Ma, L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S. Kim N.W. Trager J.B. Taylor R.D. Carlos R. Andrews W.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Harley C.B. Morin G.B. Nat.

Several telomerase-associated polypeptides have been identified using either biochemical or genetic tools. Preliminary studies suggest that these factors may participate in telomerase assembly, function, or regulation (20Collins K. Kobayashi R. Greider C.W.

Extensive mutational analysis of TERT residues equivalent to those located within functional motifs of conventional RTs supports an overall conservation of basic catalytic mechanisms between these two classes of enzymes. For example, the TERT analogues of RT residues essential for catalysis are absolutely required for telomerase activity and telomere maintenance (9Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 18Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R., Ma, L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S.

A. 2000; 97: 6367-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Conserved residues shown previously to modulate RT processivity have been found to be important determinants of telomerase processivity as well (28Bryan T.M. Goodrich K.J. Cech T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24199-24207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46305-46312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, the same tyrosine residue in conserved motif A allows both TERT and RTs to discriminate against incorporating ribonucleotides (31Miller M.C. Liu J.K. Collins K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4412-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, some other crucial RT residues (e.g. a Gln in motif B′) appear to be less important or even dispensable for telomerase function (9Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that despite the high degree of sequence divergence (<20% sequence identity), TERT and conventional RTs may possess very similar polymerization mechanisms. In retroviral RTs, the region immediately C-terminal to the RT motifs (known as the “thumb” domain) has been shown to be important in template/primer binding and in processive nucleotide addition. Such functions are readily comprehended in light of the structural disposition of the thumb domain, which comprises a bundle of three α-helices, part of which makes direct contact with the template/primer duplex (32Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). The comparable region of TERTs (henceforth referred to as the CTE for C-terminalextension) exhibits no evident sequence homology to retroviral RTs. However, previous work from our laboratory indicates that the CTE of yeast TERT (Est2p) is also required for optimal enzyme processivity, raising the possibility that the CTE may also constitute a thumb for telomerase. In this report, we explored the mechanistic basis for the function of telomerase CTE and found that it enhances the stability of telomerase-DNA interaction both before and after polymerization. The CTE of Est2p also possesses a nucleic acid binding activity when recombinantly expressed and purified. Finally, the CTEs of TERTs as a group appear to exhibit a low level of sequence conservation, and substitution of quite a few conserved CTE residues in Est2p was found to impair telomerase activity and processivity. Taken together, our study supports the notion that the CTE of TERT has a conserved function in promoting primer binding and telomerase processivity and that mechanistic similarity between telomerase and conventional RTs may be greater than indicated by apparent sequence similarity. The construction of a Δest2 strain harboring the pSE-Est2-C874 plasmid (containing a protein A-tagged EST2 gene) has been described (33Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This fully functional Est2p is designated as wild type telomerase throughout the text. The construction of the protein A-tagged C745 mutant has been described also (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All substitution mutations in the CTE of EST2 were generated using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene), appropriate primer oligonucleotides, and pSE-Est2-C874 as template. All point mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The oligodeoxynucleotide primers used for telomerase assays were purchased from Sigma and purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis prior to use. The primers have the following sequences: TEL15(m12), TGTCTGGTGTGTGGG; TEL24, TGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGG; TEL66, TAGGGTAGTAGTAGGG. Whole cell extracts and IgG-Sepharose-purified telomerase were prepared as described previously (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 33Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 34Cohn M. Blackburn E.H. Science. 1995; 269: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 35Lue N.F. Peng Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Each primer extension assay was carried out using 20 μl of IgG-Sepharose pretreated with 4 mg of protein extract and was initiated by the addition of a 15-μl mixture containing 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mmmagnesium chloride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmspermidine, primer oligodeoxynucleotides, and varying combinations of labeled and unlabeled dGTP and dTTP. Primer extension products were processed and analyzed by gel electrophoresis as described previously (35Lue N.F. Peng Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Lue N.F. Xia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For the primer challenge experiment, the IgG-Sepharose-bound telomerase was preincubated with 40 ng of TEL15(m12) primer at room temperature for 15 min and then challenged with 400 ng of TEL24 primer. After 5, 15, and 40 min, labeled nucleotides (dTTP, 25 μCi) were added to initiate the polymerization reaction. For the measurement of enzyme-product stability, reactions were performed as described previously. Upon termination, the IgG-Sepharose was washed three times with 100 μl each of TMG-10 (150) buffer. The washes were pooled, digested with proteinase K, and extracted with phenol/chloroform/Isoamyl alcohol, and then the free products were precipitated and analyzed along with the enzyme-bound products. For kinetic analysis, primer extension assays were performed using IgG-Sepharose-purified enzyme, varying concentrations of a 15-nt primer, 50 μm unlabeled dGTP, and 25 μCi of [α-32P]dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The reactions were stopped after 6 min, a time point within the linear range of DNA synthesis. TheK m (for the primer) and V maxvalues were determined by obtaining least square fitting lines of the data in Eadie-Hofstee plots and then calculating the inverse of the negative slope and x-intercept, respectively. For determination of the processivity of substitution mutants, assays were performed using TEL66 as primer. The signal for each product was determined by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and normalized to the amount of transcript by dividing against the number of labeled residues. The TEL66 primer ends in three Gs and can align to only one site along the yeast RNA template, thus supporting the addition of a defined sequence (TGTGGTG). The processivity for each position (Pi) was calculated using the formula Pi = sum(Ti+1 + Ti+2 + … + Tn)/sum(Ti + Ti+1 + … + Tn), where Ti designates the amount of transcript calculated for the primer + i position andn designates the highest number such that a visible signal can be discerned in the PhosphorImager file for the primer +n product. For expression of the TERT CTE, a PCR fragment encoding amino acids 747–874 of Est2p with flanking NdeI and XhoI sites was generated and cloned into the corresponding sites in pTYB12 (New England Biolabs). The resulting plasmid was transformed into BL21 cells. A transformant was inoculated into L broth and grown under ampicillin selection (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C overnight. A 10-ml culture of saturated cells was then diluted with 1 liter of L broth containing ampicillin and grown at 37 °C for 2.5 h. When the OD600 of the culture reached 0.5, the culture was cooled on ice for 30 min, induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.1 mm, and grown at 17 °C for 16 h. The cells were harvested, and extracts were prepared by sonication. The CTE-containing fusion protein was bound to Chitin resin according to the manufacturer's instructions and then cleaved by incubating the resin in 50 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature for 16 h. The free CTE was eluted with 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 8 m urea and then was further enriched by either reverse phase HPLC or S-Sepharose. The HPLC purification was carried out on a Vydac C-4 preparative column (Hesperia, CA) using a water-acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (37Shu W., Ji, H. Lu M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5378-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The resulting preparation was lyophilized and solubilized in water. The S-Sepharose chromatography involved binding of free CTE to a column followed by elution with 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 8 m urea, 1 m NaCl. The resulting preparation was dialyzed stepwise into buffers containing lower concentrations of urea and NaCl until both were removed completely. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were acquired on an Aviv 62DS (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) CD spectropolarimeter equipped with a computer-controlled water bath using a thermostated cuvette of 0.1-cm path length. Measurements of [θ]222 were performed at 0 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl (37Shu W., Ji, H. Lu M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5378-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation measurements were carried out on a Beckman XL-A (Beckman Coulter) analytical ultracentrifuge using an An-60 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) (38Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Filter-binding assays were carried out as described previously (33Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was isolated using the “smash and grab” protocol, digested withPstI, and electrophoretically separated on a 1% agarose gel. Following capillary transfer to nylon membranes, telomere-containing fragments were detected by hybridization with a32P-labeled poly(dG-dT) probe. The levels of Est2p-associated TLC1 RNA were determined by an RNase protection assay. IgG-Sepharose enriched telomerase was prepared as before and de-proteinated with SDS and proteinase K treatment and phenol extraction. The remaining nucleic acids were combined with an antisense probe (100,000 cpm) and hybridized and digested as described previously (39Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For synthesis of uniformly labeled RNA probe, the TLC1 gene (nucleotides 1–1301) (40Singer M.S. Gottschling D.E. Science. 1994; 266: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) was first amplified by PCR and cloned in between the BamHI and EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS+. The resulting plasmid was linearized by digestion with HinfI, and antisense RNA encompassing residues 1097–1301 of the TLC1 gene was generated by T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of 12 μm[α-32P]GTP as described (39Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The levels of Est2p in cell extracts were determined by Western analysis as described previously (30Bosoy D. Lue N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46305-46312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To probe the function of the CTE, we generated a deletion mutant of Est2p (named C745) that removed most of the amino acids beyond the last conserved RT motif (Fig. 1 A, motif E). A yeast strain harboring this deletion mutant was severely defective in telomere maintenance, and telomerase isolated from the strain exhibits a severe reduction in enzyme processivity (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To further analyze the enzymatic defects associated with the removal of CTE, we measured the stability of telomerase-DNA binding using a primer-challenge assay. A test primer (TEL15(m12)) was pre-bound to either wild type or C745-containing telomerase followed by the addition of an excess of a competitor primer (TEL24). A labeled nucleotide was then added after various time intervals to initiate the extension reaction. The amounts of reaction products arising from the test primer were then quantified. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, the challenge primer was able to reduce polymerization on the test primer more quickly when the C745 enzyme was used in the assays. Inspection of Fig.1 C indicates that the half-life of the telomerase-DNA complex for the TEL15(m12) primer was reduced by ∼2-fold by the C-terminal truncation mutation (from about 2 to 1 min). These results are consistent with a role for CTE in telomerase-DNA interaction. We also measured the stability of telomerase-DNA binding after the primer has been extended. For this analysis, we took advantage of the stable association between protein A-tagged telomerase and IgG-Sepharose. Reactions were performed in duplicates using the TEL15(m12) primer. Upon termination of the reactions, the labeled products were separated into soluble and Sepharose-bound fractions before analysis in denaturing gels (Fig.2 A). The ratios of enzyme-bound products to free products at each extension position were then quantified. For ease of presentation, only the results for the Primer + 3 (p + 3) and Primer + 5 (p + 5) position are shown in Fig. 2 B. At both positions, the C745 enzyme bound a smaller fraction of the reaction products than the wild type enzyme, consistent with impaired telomerase-DNA interaction. Similar results were obtained at other positions. It was also evident from the analysis that for both the wild type and C745 enzyme, the fraction of enzyme-bound products was higher at the p + 5 than at the p + 3 position, consistent with the ability of a longer RNA-DNA hybrid to promote enzyme-DNA stability. As yet another measure of telomerase-DNA interaction, we carried out kinetic analysis of nucleotide addition for both the wild type and mutant enzyme. Assays were performed using varying concentrations of a primer oligonucleotide, and the results were analyzed by Eadie-Hofstee plots. As shown in Fig. 3, Aand B, the K m for the C745 telomerase was ∼2.5-fold higher than that for the wild type enzyme, consistent with reduced binding of the primer to the truncated telomerase. Thus, by three different criteria, the loss of the CTE of yeast TERT resulted in a telomerase that binds less strongly to telomeric DNA. To determine whether the CTE of TERT can indeed bind nucleic acids as would be expected for the thumb domain, we expressed amino acids 747–874 of yeast TERT as a fusion protein to an intein-CBD (chitin-binding domain) tag. The fusion protein was purified by adsorption to a chitin column, and the CTE was separated from the tag by intein-mediated self-cleavage in the presence of dithiothreitol. For unknown reasons, the CTE fragment remained bound to the column after cleavage and could not be eluted even with high salt. We therefore eluted the CTE fragment with urea. Following elution, the CTE was purified further either with a reverse phase HPLC or an S-Sepharose column. The HPLC preparation was lyophilized and solubilized in water, whereas the S-Sepharose preparation was renatured by stepwise dialysis into buffers containing reducing concentrations of urea. As shown in Fig. 4 A, both preparations are nearly homogeneous. We then subjected the HPLC-purified fragment to analytical ultracentrifugation and CD analysis. These studies revealed a monomeric protein with high α-helical content (data not shown). Thus, despite the denaturation step during isolation, the purified CTE appears to be well folded. The purified CTE was tested for its ability to interact with nucleic acids using a nitrocellulose filter-binding assay. First, a single-stranded 24-mer oligonucleotide with a telomere-like sequence was assessed for binding. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the S-Sepharose-purified CTE exhibited concentration-dependent binding to this oligonucleotide, whereas a control protein (maltose-binding protein) did not. We then compared the ability of single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, and RNA-DNA hybrid (all with telomere-like sequences) to bind CTE. Equal molar concentrations of the different substrates were tested in filter-binding assays using the same amount of CTE. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4 C, CTE appears to manifest a slight preference for double-stranded substrates (∼2–3-fold), consistent with its putative role in contacting an RNA-DNA hybrid in the context of a telomerase-DNA complex. Analysis of nucleic acid binding by the HPLC-purified CTE gave comparable results (data not shown). Even though the CTEs of TERTs do not exhibit significant sequence similarity to retroviral RTs, they appear to be loosely conserved as a group (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine whether the sequence conservation has functional significance, we mutated conserved residues within the CTE of yeast TERT and tested the resulting enzyme for defects both in vivo and in vitro. A total of five mutants with substitutions inconserved residues (SCR mutants) were made, each with two or three consecutive residues changed to alanines: LF759AA, TID768AAA, NS774AA, YK794AA, FL847AA (with the number designating the position of the first amino acid residue in each pair or triplet; Fig. 5 A). For comparison, a mutant with substitutions in non-conserved residues was also made (CD831AA). Each mutant was tagged at the C terminus with tandem copies of the IgG-binding domain of proteins A, placed on a centromeric plasmid, and used to transform a yeast strain whose chromosomal EST2 (TERT) gene has been disrupted. A similarly tagged wild type EST2 gene was analyzed in parallel as the control. All of the strains were first tested for telomere length defects. As shown in Fig. 5 B, all five SCR mutants exhibited varying degrees of telomere shortening, whereas the CD831AA mutant did not. The most defective SCR mutants (TID768AA, NS774AA, and YK794AA) have telomeres that are indistinguishable from the C745 truncation mutant, suggesting that these substitutions have completely abolished the function of CTE in vivo. To determine whether the telomere maintenance defects can be explained by telomerase activity loss or alteration, we purified protein A-tagged telomerase from the wild type and mutant strains by IgG-Sepharose and subjected it to primer extension assays (Fig.6 A). The results were analyzed both in terms of the overall levels of DNA synthesis (Fig.6 B) and the processivity of nucleotide addition (Fig.6 C). As expected, the CD831AA mutant exhibited a nearly normal level of telomerase activity and a normal pattern of extension, consistent with its ability to maintain normal telomere lengths. In contrast, all of the SRC mutants suffered either a loss of total activity, a significant reduction in enzyme processivity, or both. Interestingly, the two mutants with total activity loss but no evident processivity defect (LF759AA and FL847AA) manifested relatively modest telomere shortening such that the levels of activity correlated with the lengths of telomeres. On the other hand, the three mutants with substantial processivity defects (TID768AAA, NS774AA, and YK794AA) all manifested severe telomere shortening. Of the three, only the YK794AA mutant suffered substantial loss of total activity (>10-fold). These results are in accordance with earlier studies and indicate that both the total activity and the processivity of telomerase are important determinants of telomere lengths. Processivity appears to be the more dominant factor, because only a modest reduction in processivity was sufficient to trigger severe telomere shortening (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The substantial loss of overall activity exhibited by the YK794AA and the FL847AA mutants are surprising in light of previous analysis of the C745 truncation mutant, which has no CTE yet suffers only a modest reduction in overall activity. To determine the basis for the activity loss manifested by the substitutions mutants, we quantified the levels of Est2p and Est2p-associated TLC1 RNA (yeast telomerase RNA) in wild type and mutant strains. As shown in Fig.7, A and B, both the YK794AA and FL847AA mutants have much lower levels of Est2p and Est2p-associated TLC1 RNA in cell extracts, whereas the other mutants have very few defects in this regard. Quantitation indicates that the magnitude of reduction for both RNA and protein was ∼4–10-fold (data not shown). These results suggest that substitution in some conserved CTE residues can impair protein stability (possibly by causing protein misfolding), thereby leading to a reduction in the level of telomerase ribonucleoprotein. We have shown in this and an earlier study (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that the CTE of yeast TERT is required for optimal telomerase processivity and stable telomerase-DNA binding. The yeast CTE also possesses a nucleic acid binding activity when recombinantly overexpressed and purified. These results support the notion that despite the lack of sequence similarity between CTE and the thumb domain of conventional RTs, the CTE of TERT may nevertheless act as a thumb for telomerase. A precedent for sequence divergence coupled with functional (and potential structural) similarity was noted in structural comparison of the thumbs of HIV-1 RT and HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (41Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R. Mathieu M., De, F.R. Rey F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Although both thumbs are believed to contact and help encircle the nucleic acids, they do not show significant sequence homology. Structurally, the HCV domain is much larger with seven instead of three helices. Nevertheless, a modeling exercise suggests that one of the HCV thumb helices (helix P) may have the same disposition relative to nucleic acids as an HIV-1 helix (helix H), which has been shown to be important for substrate interactions (41Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R. Mathieu M., De, F.R. Rey F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13034-13039Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 42Bebenek K. Beard W.A.

Results of our CD analysis provide tantalizing support for the existence of a comparable helix in the CTE of TERTs. Clearly, high-resolution structural analysis of CTE will be required to address this possibility. Telomerase from several species has been shown to form dimers/multimersin vitro and in vivo, although the subunit or domain of the complex responsible for dimerization is not well characterized. The functional significance of dimerization also remains to be determined. The monomeric behavior of the yeast CTE in solution suggests that this domain cannot be the sole determinant of dimerization. This is in agreement with a recent analysis of hTERT, which also fails to detect a homotypic interaction of its CTE domain (43Arai K. Masutomi K. Khurts S. Kaneko S. Kobayashi K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of CTE in different organisms yielded somewhat disparate results. Removal of part or all of the CTE of theTetrahymena and human TERT was found to result in a completely inactive telomerase in either in vitro orin vivo reconstitution assays (44Bachand F. Autexier C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 45Lai C.K. Mitchell J.R. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 990-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 46Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, as we have demonstrated in this and an earlier study, removal of the entire CTE of yeast TERT resulted in a catalytically active telomerase with greatly reduced processivity (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This discrepancy raises the possibility that the CTEs of different TERTs may perform fundamentally different functions. However, this possibility would appear to be contradicted by our mutagenesis studies, which indicate that conserved CTE residues identified by sequence alignment are indeed functionally important, either for protein stability or telomerase processivity. How might the different deletion analysis results be reconciled? Two hypotheses may be considered. First, we have shown that several partial deletions of yeast CTE and amino acid substitution of conserved CTE residues can lead to greatly diminished TERT levels in cell extracts, suggesting that these mutations cause protein misfolding and destabilization (29Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is possible that partial deletions of theTetrahymena and human CTE can have similar deleterious effects. Second, the nucleic acid binding function of the CTE may be more or less essential for telomerase activity, depending on the presence of other nucleic acid binding modules/domains in the enzyme complex. For example, the yeast telomerase reconstituted in vivo may possess other nucleic acid binding components that can partially compensate for the loss of CTE. In this regard, it is interesting to note that Est1p, a non-catalytic component of yeast telomerase, has been shown to possess a single-stranded telomeric DNA binding activity (47Virta-Pearlman V. Morris D.K. Lundblad V. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3094-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 48Zhou J. Hidaka K. Futcher B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1947-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Another distinguishing feature of the yeast enzyme is its relatively long RNA template (17 nucleotides instead of 9 or 10 nucleotides for the Tetrahymena and human RNA), which can presumably bind more strongly to the DNA primer and possibly alleviate the consequence of CTE loss. Although our evidence favors at least one conserved function for CTE, it by no means rules out some additional species-specific functions such as interaction with other components of the telomerase holoenzyme. In particular, the addition of an epitope tag to the C terminus of hTERT resulted in a catalytically active telomerase that is unable to maintain telomeres in vivo, a finding that argues for just such a species-specific function (49Counter C.M. Hahn W.C. Wei W. Caddle S.D. Beijersbergen R.L. Lansdorp P.M. Sedivy J.M. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14723-14728Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar).

These activities are controlled, in part, by the phosphorylation of p53 by the protein kinase ATM. Recent evidence indicates that the monofunctional DNA alkylating agentN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) also triggers up-regulation and phosphorylation of p53; however, the mechanism(s) responsible for this are unknown. We observed that in MNNG-treated normal human fibroblasts, up-regulation and phosphorylation of p53 was sensitive to the ATM kinase inhibitor wortmannin. ATM-deficient fibroblasts exhibited a delay in p53 up-regulation indicating a role for ATM in triggering the MNNG-induced response. Likewise, a mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient colorectal tumor line failed to show rapid up-regulation of p53. However, unlike ATM-deficient cells, these MMR-deficient cells displayed rapid phosphorylation of the p53 residue serine 15 after MNNG. In vitro kinase assays indicate that ATM is rapidly activated in both normal and MMR-deficient cells in response to MNNG. Using a number of morphological and biochemical approaches, we failed to observe MNNG-induced apoptosis in normal human fibroblasts, suggesting that apoptosis-induced DNA strand breaks are not required for the activation of ATM in response to MNNG. Comet assays indicated that strand breaks accumulated, and p53 up-regulation/phosphorylation occurred quite rapidly (within 30 min) after MNNG treatment, suggesting that DNA strand breaks that arise during the repair process activate ATM. These findings indicate that ATM activation is not limited to the ionizing radiation-induced response and potentially plays an important role in response to DNA alkylation. p53 plays an important role in response to ionizing radiation by regulating cell cycle progression and triggering apoptosis.

Clearly, such perturbations within the genome present a tangible risk to the maintenance of cellular integrity and the well-being of the host organism. Hence, DNA damage must be rectified to maintain genomic homeostasis. Furthermore, loss of cellular factors that ensure genome integrity is often associated with enhanced mutation rates and, as a frequently observed consequence, tumorigenesis (1Pegg A.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 472: 253-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such findings firmly underscore the requirement for vigilant maintenance of the genome in organismal health and survival. Important components in the DNA damage response are members of a family of high molecular weight proteins that share catalytic domain homology with the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK).1 PIK-like family members identified in humans include ATM (ataxiatelangiectasia- mutated), ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related), and the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK. These PIK-like proteins each possess a canonical kinase domain at their carboxyl terminus and possess detectable protein (Ser/Thr) kinase activity (2Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y.

Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). The best documented role of a PIK-like protein in the DNA damage response is the function of ATM after exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (IR). The tumor suppressor protein p53 is phosphorylated on a critical serine residue (Ser15) by ATM following IR or radiomimetic drugs (2Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, 3Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Further, ATM activates the kinase Chk2 which, in turn, phosphorylates p53 residue Ser20 (5Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). These events appear to be critical for both the accumulation and activation of p53 as a functional transcription factor in response to DNA damage (6Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Vogt Sionov R. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 7Kastan M.B. Zhan Q., El- Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S.

Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Resulting from these phosphorylation events, p53 controls the cellular levels of a cadre of proteins involved in DNA damage response. For example, p53-dependent up-regulation of p21waf1/cip1 expression is required to establish the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint in response to IR-induced DNA damage (9Dulic V. Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Tlsty T.D. Lees E. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Reed S.I. Cell. 1994; 76: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 10Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Further, ATM is critical in the establishment of the p53-independent S phase and G2/M checkpoints after γ-irradiation (11Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 12Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

In addition to activating checkpoints, ATM also appears to play a role in triggering apoptosis after IR (15Herzog K.H. Chong M.J. Kapsetaki M. Morgan J.I. McKinnon P.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1089-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 16Takagi M. Delia D. Chessa L. Iwata S. Shigeta T. Kanke Y. Goi K. Asada M. Eguchi M. Kodama C. Mizutani S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4923-4929PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, both ATM and p53 are essential components in the cellular response to IR-induced genome damage. In addition to IR, recent studies have suggested that PIK-like proteins are involved in response to DNA alkylation. For example, it has been shown that treatment of cells with the monofunctional DNA alkylating agentN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) results in phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and up-regulation of p53 abundance (17Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Further, this phosphorylation event requires functional protein complexes involved in mismatch repair (MMR); namely, hMutSα (hMSH2/hMSH6) and hMutLα (hMLH1/hPMS2) (17Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,18Hickman M.J. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10764-10769Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Of note, cell lines deficient in hMutSα or hMutLα display lower sensitivity to alkylating agents and fail to elicit a G2/M checkpoint response after treatment with MNNG and other nitrosoureas, unlike MMR-proficient cells (19Kat A. Thilly W.G. Fang W.H. Longley M.J., Li, G.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6424-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 20Hawn M.T. Umar A. Carethers J.M. Marra G. Kunkel T.A. Boland C.R. Koi M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3721-3725PubMed Google Scholar). Such findings suggest that, in addition to its role in DNA repair, the MMR system plays a role in triggering signaling events in response to DNA alkylation. To uncover the mechanism responsible for p53 up-regulation in response to DNA alkylation, we examined MNNG-induced responses in normal diploid human foreskin fibroblast cells (NHF). We observed that wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PIK-like protein activity, ablated p53 up-regulation and Ser15 phosphorylation in response to MNNG. ATM- and MMR-deficient cells show a lack of rapid p53 accumulation shortly after MNNG exposure, suggesting that both ATM and MMR are required for a normal response to MNNG. Further, in vitro kinase assays showed that ATM is rapidly activated by MNNG in both MMR-proficient and -deficient cells. Finally, using several independent assays for apoptotic progression, we did not observe the triggering of apoptosis in MNNG-treated NHF, indicating that DNA strand breaks associated with the apoptotic process are not required for the activation of ATM. However, strand breaks were detected by comet assay in MNNG-treated NHF shortly after exposure, suggesting that strand scission that occurs as a result of DNA repair-associated endonuclease activity may trigger ATM activation. These findings clearly indicate that ATM is activated in response to MNNG-induced DNA alkylation and potentially serve to expand our appreciation of the role that this protein plays in the general genome damage response. Diploid NHF were established from neonatal circumcision specimens collected at the Medical Center of Louisiana-New Orleans. NHF were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep) and generally used at passage 6. The nontransformed A-T fibroblast lines GM01588A and GM02530 (used at passage 6) were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research and cultured in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 20% FBS, 2× essential amino acids, 1× nonessential amino acids, 1× vitamins, and 100 units/ml pen/strep. The SV-40-immortalized A-T fibroblast line AT22IJE-T stably expressing full-length recombinant ATM (designated YZ-5 cells) or cells stably transfected with empty vector (designated EBS7 cells) were isolated and cultured as previously indicated (21Ziv Y. Bar-Shira A. Pecker I. Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The hMLH1-deficient human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HCT-116 was cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% FBS and pen/strep. The human T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat was grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and pen/strep. All of the cell lines were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2incubator. Drug (MNNG or camptothecin) treatments were performed by removing the medium from cultures of logarithmically growing cells and adding serum-free medium. The drug was then added at the indicated final concentration, and the cells were returned to the incubator. After a 1-h drug exposure, the plates were rinsed with PBS and refed on complete growth medium, and the cells were returned to the incubator. Where indicated, the cells were pretreated with 10 μmwortmannin in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of MNNG. MNNG (Aldrich) was dissolved in 0.1 msodium acetate (pH 5.0) at a stock concentration of 10 mm. Wortmannin (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO at a stock concentration of 20 mm. Camptothecin (Sigma) was dissolved in deionized H2O at a stock concentration of 10 mm. All of the drug stocks were stored at −20 °C prior to use. Clonogenic survival was assessed using the method outlined by Ziv et al. (21Ziv Y. Bar-Shira A. Pecker I. Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by trypsinization and replated at known density in tissue culture flasks and returned to the incubator for 18–24 h. The cells were exposed to various doses of IR from a 137Cs source (Gammacell 1000, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.; dose rate = 318 rad/min) or MNNG and, following treatment, returned to the incubator. Nontreated cells were cultured in parallel to determine relative plating efficiency. Ten days post-treatment, the medium was removed, the cells were stained with crystal violet, and colonies consisting of ≥50 cells were scored. Three to six individual survival values (percentage of survival) for each dose were plotted. Immunoblotting was conducted as previously outlined (22Brown K.D. Lataxes T. Kumar S. Mannino J.L. Giardina J. Chen J. Baskaran R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6651-6656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested by trypsinization, and the extracts were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in SDS solubilization solution (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.0% SDS), followed by immersion in a boiling water bath for 5 min. After this, the lysates were briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 2 min at room temperature. The protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and the lysates were stored at −80 °C. Prior to electrophoresis, an appropriate volume of cell lysate was diluted in 3× SDS sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 3% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.01% pyronin-Y) and boiled for 2 min. 25 μg of total cell protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with antibodies directed against total p53 (DO-1, PharMingen), phospho-Ser15 p53 (Cell Signaling Technology), PARP (F-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or tubulin (DM1A, a gift of Dr. D.W. Cleveland). Quantitation of immunoblot signals was performed by densitometry of exposed x-ray films. ATM kinase assays were conducted using the protocol outlined by Shangary et al. (23Shangary S. Brown K.D. Adamson A.W. Edmonson S., Ng, B. Pandita T.K. Yalowich J. Taccioli G.E. Baskaran R. J. Biol.

Briefly, MNNG-treated and untreated cells (1 × 107) were harvested 3 h post-treatment, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 500 μl of 1× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate) and a protease inhibitor mixture. After clarifying the lysates by centrifugation and adjusting their concentrations for equal protein content, 5 μl of the ATM antisera pAb 132 (24Brown K.D. Ziv Y. Sadandanan S.N. Chessa L. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Tagle D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was added to the lysates and incubated for 2 h on ice. After this step, 100 μl of a 50/50 slurry of protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS was added and incubated for another 1 h on an end-over-end rotator at 4 °C. The immune complexes were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with 1× lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and twice with 1× lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. After washing, the immune complexes were resuspended in 35 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 5 mmMnCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 1 μg of bacterially synthesized, purified recombinant GST-p53 fusion protein, 25 μm ATP (unlabeled), and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer followed by immersion in a boiling water bath. The reaction products were resolved on 10% acrylamide gels, electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P membranes, and analyzed by autoradiography. The immunocomplexes were also subjected to immunoblotting with anti-ATM to ensure equivalent kinase abundance. The cells were seeded into culture dishes containing presterilized glass coverslips and allowed to attach overnight. Subsequently, the cells were treated with the indicated drug and 48 h after treatment were fixed by immersion in cold (−20 °C) methanol, washed with PBS, and stained with Hoechst 33258 (final concentration, 0.1 μg/ml) diluted in PBS. Coverslips were then mounted onto glass slides, and DNA morphology was assessed. The cells were photographed using a Leitz microscope equipped with epi-fluorescence optics and a SPOT CCD camera. DNA strand breaks associated with apoptosis were measured in indicated cell populations quantitatively by TUNEL assay using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, the cells were treated as outlined, harvested by trypsinization, washed in PBS, and fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Following this, the cells were permeabilized for 2 min at 4 °C (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100). The cells were then washed twice in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and resuspended in 50 μl of deoxynucleotidyl transferase reaction buffer (40 mm potassium cacodylate, 40 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) containing 1.2 μmfluorescein isothiocyanate-dUTP, 3 μm dATP, 1 mm CoCl2, and 6.25 units of deoxynucleotidyl transferase. This reaction was subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Finally, the cells were washed once in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin and analyzed quantitatively for fluorescein isothiocyanate incorporation using a Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer and data analyzed using CellQuest software. TUNEL-positive staining was established by setting a gate at the highest staining 5% of the population of untreated cells as previously outlined (25Walker L.S. McLeod J.D. Boulougouris G. Patel Y.I. Ellwood C.N. Hall N.D. Sansom D.M. Immunology. 1999; 98: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The comet assay procedure used is based on the method outlined by Singh et al. (26Singh N.P. McCoy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (9039) Google Scholar). A base layer of 1.0% agarose was placed on microscope slides and allowed to harden. 75 μl of 1% low melting point agarose (37 °C) diluted in deionized H2O was mixed with ∼1.0 × 104treated or untreated cells (5–10 μl volume) and applied to the coated slide. A glass coverslip was then overlaid on the cell layer, and the agarose was allowed to solidify. The coverslip was then removed, and a third layer of low melting point agarose (75 μl) was added to the slide. Again, a coverslip was overlaid, and the agarose was allowed to solidify. After this, the coverslip was removed, and the slides were placed in a lysis solution (10 mm Tris, pH 10.0, 2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% Me2SO) at 4 °C for 1 h. The slides were then transferred to an electrophoresis apparatus containing an alkaline solution consisting of 300 mm NaOH and 1 mmEDTA. The slides remained in this solution for 1 h to promote DNA unwinding and were finally subjected to electric current (300 mA) for 1 h. The slides were removed, washed three times for 5 min in neutralizing buffer (0.4 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at room temperature, and stained in 1:10,000 dilution of Sybr Gold (Molecular Probes). The stained nuclei were subsequently viewed and photographed. Exposure of mammalian cells to a variety of DNA-damaging agents results in up-regulation of cellular p53 levels (27Liu Z.G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This process is mediated by the PIK-like protein kinase ATM in response to IR (2Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D.

The principal focus of this study was to determine whether a similar mechanism underlies the response to the monofunctional alkylating agent MNNG. To compare responses to these two distinctly different types of genotoxic events, we initially determined doses of IR and MNNG that are equitoxic in NHF. Hence, we performed clonogenic survival assays on NHF treated with various doses of IR or MNNG. This analysis indicated that 10 grays of IR (137Cs source) (Fig. 1 A), a commonly employed high dose of γ-irradiation, resulted in a mean cell survival of 0.036% (± 0.011, n = 5). Interpolation from the survival curve generated from MNNG-treated cells (Fig. 1 B) indicated that a 1-h exposure to 25 μm MNNG corresponded to a similar rate of survival. To document the profile of p53 up-regulation after IR, we subjected logarithmically growing cultures of NHF to 10 grays of IR and determined total p53 levels and Ser15 phosphorylation both 3 and 18 h after exposure. In NHF extracts, we observed a ∼5-fold increase in p53 levels 3 h after treatment and ∼9-fold increase at 18 h after IR (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–3, top panel). Consistent with previous reports (8Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar,28Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), we found that phosphorylation of the p53 residue Ser15occurs after IR as judged by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–3, middle panel). To confirm that p53 up-regulation following IR is attributable to PIK-like kinase activity, we pretreated NHF with 10 μm wortmannin prior to IR exposure. This concentration of wortmannin potently inhibits ATM activity but has little effect on the activity of the ATM-related kinase ATR (4Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with the documented role of ATM in response to irradiation, we found that a 1-h pretreatment with 10 μm wortmannin significantly reduced the up-regulation of p53 3 h after IR exposure (Fig.1 C, lane 4, top panel). We also observed that pretreatment with wortmannin decreased phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 (Fig. 1 C, lane 4,middle panel). Next, we examined p53 accumulation/phosphorylation in NHF cells after treatment with an equitoxic dose of MNNG. We exposed logarithmically growing NHF cells to 25 μm MNNG and determined the total p53 levels and Ser15 phosphorylation both 3 and 18 h after exposure. We observed a ∼4-fold increase 3 h and an ∼9-fold increase in p53 18 h after treatment with 25 μm MNNG (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1–3, top panel). Concordant with previous findings (17Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we detected phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 after treatment with MNNG (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1–3,middle panel). Pretreatment with 10 μmwortmannin completely abrogated both the up-regulation of p53 (Fig.1 D, lane 4, top panel) and Ser15 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 D, lane 4, middle panel) 3 h after MNNG treatment. Taken together, these findings indicate that MNNG and IR elicit similar effects on p53 abundance/phosphorylation and that these effects are sensitive to wortmannin. To test a potential role for ATM in MNNG-induced p53 up-regulation and phosphorylation, we exposed nontransformed human A-T fibroblasts (GM1588A and GM02530) to 25 μm MNNG and observed neither p53 up-regulation nor Ser15 phosphorylation in these cells 3 h after MNNG treatment (Fig. 2, A andB, lanes 2, top panels). However, ∼6–8-fold up-regulation in total p53 (Fig. 2, A andB, lanes 3, top panels) was observed along with detectable Ser15 phosphorylation 18 h after MNNG exposure. To assure that the defective rapid p53 up-regulation/phosphorylation observed in untransformed A-T fibroblasts was directly attributable to lost ATM function, we assessed complementation of these defects in A-T cells expressing recombinant human ATM. The ATM- reconstituted cell line (designated YZ-5) and its isogenic ATM-deficient control (designated EBS7) are derivatives of the SV-40 transformed A-T line AT22IJE-T (21Ziv Y. Bar-Shira A. Pecker I. Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); hence, assessment of total p53 up-regulation after MNNG was rendered uninformative because of large T antigen-induced stabilization of p53 (data not shown). However, similar to untransformed A-T fibroblasts, no notable Ser15phosphorylation was observed in the ATM-deficient EBS-7 line during rapid (1 h) response to MNNG treatment (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and 2). Conversely, the ATM-proficient YZ-5 line displayed phosphorylation of Ser15 in response to MNNG at this early time point (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3 and4). Taken together, these results indicate that ATM is required for rapid up-regulation and Ser15 phosphorylation of p53 after MNNG but is not required for p53 up-regulation/phosphorylation 18 h after MNNG. Duckett et al. (17Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and Hickman and Samson (18Hickman M.J. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10764-10769Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) observed that low doses of MNNG (5 μm) resulted in p53 up-regulation/Ser15 phosphorylation and that this phenomenon was dependent on a functional MMR system. To test a potential role for the MMR system in MNNG-induced p53 up-regulation and phosphorylation at the higher dose of drug used in this study, we tested the MMR-deficient colorectal tumor line HCT-116. We treated HCT-116 cells with 25 μm MNNG and determined p53 levels 3 and 18 h after exposure (Fig. 3,top panel). These results showed that at this dose, similar to ATM-deficient cells, HCT-116 display no p53 up-regulation 3 h after exposure but notable p53 accumulation 18 h after exposure. However, unlike A-T cells, we observed detectable Ser15phosphorylation 3 h after MNNG that persisted to the 18-h time point in HCT-116 cells (Fig. 3, middle panel). Our findings suggest that although MMR and A-T-deficient cells possess a common phenotype (no p53 up-regulation at 3 h), the molecular lesions in these cells are likely distinct because of the observed differences in rapid (3 h after MNNG) Ser15 phosphorylation. To directly test whether ATM was activated in human NHF following MNNG exposure, we conducted in vitro kinase assays using recombinant p53 as the kinase substrate. Further, we scored ATM activity in MNNG-treated HCT-116 cells to determine whether activation of ATM occurs in this MMR-deficient cell line. We observed a 2.2-fold increase in ATM kinase activity 3 h after treatment in HCT-116 cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and2) and a 2.8-fold increase in NHF (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Although the observed fold increase in ATM catalytic activity was modest, it is consist"

J., Bachs, O., and Agell, N. (2001) Mol. Cell. Biol. 21, 7345–7354) that calmodulin negatively regulates Ras activation in fibroblasts. Hence, anti-calmodulin drugs (such as W13, trifluoroperazine, or W7) are able to induce Ras/ERK pathway activation under low levels of growth factors. We show here that cell treatment with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors abolishes W13-induced activation of Ras, Raf-1, and ERK. Consequently, PKC activity is essential for achieving the synergism between calmodulin inhibition and growth factors to activate Ras. Furthermore, whereas the activation of PKC by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) does not induce Ras activation in 3T3 cells, activation is observed if calmodulin is simultaneously inhibited. This indicates that calmodulin is preventing Ras activation by PKC. Treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor receptor or platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors does not abrogate the activation of Ras by calmodulin inhibition. This implies that epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activities are dispensable for the activation of Ras by TPA plus W13, and, therefore, Ras activation is not a consequence of the transactivation of those receptors by the combination of the anti-calmodulin drug plus TPA. Furthermore, K-Ras, the isoform previously shown to bind to calmodulin, is the only one activated by TPA when calmodulin is inhibited. These data suggest that direct interaction between K-Ras and calmodulin may account for the inability of PKC to activate Ras in 3T3 fibroblasts.In vitro experiments showed that the phosphorylation of K-Ras by PKC was inhibited by calmodulin, suggesting that calmodulin-dependent modulation of K-Ras phosphorylation by PKC could be the mechanism underlying K-Ras activation in fibroblasts treated with TPA plus W13. We have shown previously (Villalonga, P., López- Alcalá, C., Bosch, M., Chiloeches, A., Rocamora, N., Gil, J., Marais, R., Marshall, C. J., Bachs, O., and Agell, N. (2001) Mol. Cell.

Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rebollo A. Martinez A. Blood. 1999; 94: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis for such a great variety of cell responses controlled by Ras proteins relies on the fact that Ras is able to transduce signals from different extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, hormones, and cell-extracellular matrix contacts to many downstream effectors (4Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 5Olson M.F. Marais R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As a molecular switch, Ras cycles between a GTP-bound active and an inactive state when GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. Active Ras interacts with and modulates the activity of effector proteins. The best characterized Ras effector is the serine/threonine kinase Raf, which leads to the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 pathway that plays a major role in cell proliferation and differentiation (6Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

Other effectors for Ras include the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), which is involved in cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism (9Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R.

Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), and the nucleotide exchange factors for Ral GTPase, RalGDS, Rlf, and Rlg (12Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar).Many molecules have been described as influencing the Ras GTP/GDP cycle, mainly through two distinct biochemical activities: 1) the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that regulate the replacement of the nucleotide bound to Ras, favoring the GTP-bound active state; or 2) the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which increase Ras low intrinsic GTPase activity and thereby promote its inactivation. Following extracellular stimulation, GEFs are recruited to the plasma membrane through binding to a set of molecular adaptors, inducing transiently Ras-GTP complexes (13Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Distinct signals such as those transduced from tyrosine kinase receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, or integrin-induced cell attachment to the extracellular matrix all lead to Ras activation. In many cases this is achieved through the membrane recruitment of the Sos exchange factor, which in turn depends on the adaptor protein Grb-2. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine kinase receptors or activation of a variety of non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src, Pyk-2, or focal adhesion kinase in response to the activation of diverse G protein-coupled receptors or cell-extracellular matrix engagement all create phosphotyrosine residues that allow Grb-2/Sos binding and thus its recruitment to the vicinity of Ras at the plasma membrane, leading to its activation (15Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar,16Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar).In addition, other mechanisms are able to link extracellular signals to Ras activation, such as phospholipase C activation and its consequent increase in diacylglycerol and intracellular Ca2+. Ca2+ induces the activation of RasGRF, another Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor present mainly in neurones that lead to Ras activation (17Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In addition, together with diacylglycerol, Ca2+ is also able to activate RasGRPs, a RasGEF family present in lymphocytes and neurones (18Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In turn, protein kinase C (PKC) activation by diacylglycerol is also able to activate Ras in some cellular types. The activation of Ras through PKC-dependent GAP inhibition has been reported in T lymphocytes upon T cell receptor activation (19Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). However, this seems not to be the case for fibroblasts (20Burgering B.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. Medema R.H. van Weeren P.C. Tertoolen L.G. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7248-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), although PKC is able to induce Ras activation in B lymphocytes and COS cells (21Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). GAP activity can also be regulated by binding to phosphorylated tyrosine kinase receptors (22Cleghon V. Gayko U. Copeland T.D. Perkins L.A. Perrimon N. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In summary, a highly interconnected network of multiple pathways regulates Ras activation in response to extracellular signals.The Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM), which acts as a second messenger in cellular signal transduction pathways and regulates cell proliferation (23Klee C. Vanaman T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 24Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 25Lu K.P.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), has been shown to be one of the molecules involved in the modulation of Ras activity. We have shown that CaM down-regulates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in fibroblasts (27Bosch M. Gil J. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22145-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and other groups have shown that CaM is able to inhibit in vitroEGFR (29San Jose E. Benguria A. Geller P. Villalobo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15237-15245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) activity and the shedding of EGF-like growth factors (30Diaz-Rodriguez E. Esparis-Ogando A. Montero J.C. Yuste L. Pandiella A. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although low doses of growth factors are not able to induce activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in fibroblasts, activation is observed if CaM is simultaneously inhibited, indicating that CaM is preventing the activation of this pathway under basal conditions. Furthermore, CaM inhibition in fibroblasts leads to a more sustained level of ERK activation following serum stimulation. CaM functions are mediated by its association with specific target proteins named CaM-binding proteins (CaMBPs), which are regulated upon CaM binding (31Bachs O. Agell N. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Agell N. Aligue R. Alemany V. Castro A. Jaime M. Pujol M.J. Rius E. Serratosa J. Taules M. Bachs O. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that K-RasB is a CaMBP and that this Ras isoform is specifically activated when serum-starved NIH3T3 cells are treated with a CaM inhibitor, suggesting a direct relation between CaM binding to Ras and Ras inhibition by CaM (28Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the activation of Ras by CaM inhibition is low in the absence of growth factors, increasing dramatically in the presence of low levels of mitogens. We have analyzed here the intracellular elements that are cooperating with CaM inhibition to induce Ras activation. Our results show that PKC activity is responsible for this synergism and that CaM is preventing the activation of Ras by PKC in 3T3 fibroblasts.DISCUSSIONAn emerging theme in signal transduction is the fact that the activation of a pathway per se is not enough to explain its biological effects. To understand these effects, it is crucial to achieve a comprehensive knowledge of the spatiotemporal pattern of pathway activation. A paradigm for this is the activation of the Ras/ERK pathway, which leads to cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, or differentiation depending on the timing and intensity of its activation (40Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar, 41Roovers K. Assoian R.K. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms involved in Ras activation have been intensively studied over the past decade, it is not yet completely understood which mechanisms govern Ras inactivation and, hence, its global signaling output in response to given stimuli. We have previously shown that CaM is essential for the impairment of Ras activation at low concentrations of growth factors in fibroblasts. Furthermore, CaM is important to ensure an appropriate signaling level of the ERK cascade in these cells, as CaM inhibition prior to mitogenic stimulation leads to a more sustained ERK activation and to accumulation of the CDK inhibitor p21cip1 (27Bosch M. Gil J. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22145-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CaM is able to specifically impair K-Ras activation but not the activation of the other Ras isoforms, and this is most probably through its direct binding to GTP-bound K-RasB (28Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism of how CaM is able to down-regulate the Ras/ERK pathway, we have analyzed the nature of the signals that are essential to induce the activation of this pathway in cooperation with CaM inhibition.As we had shown previously, low doses of serum, EGF, PDGF, and bombesin were all able to induce ERK activation in the presence of CaM inhibitors (28Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These results suggested that an intracellular regulator of the Ras/ERK pathway, activated by all the above stimuli, was able to activate the Ras/ERK pathway when CaM was inhibited. Protein kinase C has been shown to be a regulator of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway that is able to regulate different levels of this pathway. In many cell types, conventional PKC activation by phorbol ester treatment induces a potent activation of ERK, but there are multiple upstream inputs of PKC in this pathway regarding the cell type. For instance, examples of the activation of Ras, Raf, or MEK by PKC have all been described using different cell systems (20Burgering B.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. Medema R.H. van Weeren P.C. Tertoolen L.G. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7248-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar,43Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19448-19454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether PKC was involved in the activation of ERK that CaM inhibitors were able to induce in the presence of low concentrations of growth factors in both NIH3T3 and Swiss 3T3 cells. Incubation with the broad spectrum PKC inhibitor GF109203X blocked ERK activation induced by W13 in Swiss 3T3 cells. Similarly, in NIH3T3 cells treated with either GF109203X, Ro-0432, or, chronically, TPA, the activation of ERK by W13 was also blocked. These results suggested that PKC was necessary for the observed activation of ERK under our experimental conditions.CaM most probably regulates the Ras/ERK pathway at the level of Ras, because we have shown that CaM binds specifically to GTP-bound K-RasB and that W13 treatment ultimately leads to K-Ras activation. However, the requirement for PKC activity to observe ERK activation in response to CaM inhibition could merely reflect the ability of PKC to activate different levels of this pathway downstream of Ras. To address this issue, we analyzed the effects of PKC inhibition on the activation of Raf-1 and Ras by W13 treatment in NIH3T3. As we had shown previously (27Bosch M. Gil J. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22145-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), treatment with W13 induces Raf-1 kinase activity in serum-starved NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly, PKC inhibition completely prevented W13-induced activation of Raf-1. These results indicated that the PKC-dependent step in W13-induced ERK activation was at least at the level of Raf-1. We finally tested whether Ras activation by W13 was also PKC-dependent. PKC inhibition in serum-starved NIH3T3 completely prevented the activation of Ras by W13 under both 0 and 0.5% FCS. This indicated that PKC was necessary for CaM inhibition to induce Ras activation, thereby placing PKC-dependence at the level of Ras.PKC activity was therefore necessary for the observed activation of the Ras/ERK pathway in response to CaM inhibition under low concentrations of growth factors. Altogether, these results suggested that CaM was preventing Ras activation by PKC in these cells. Thus, under CaM-inhibited conditions, different sources of PKC activity such as the growth factors tested to date were able to induce Ras activation. We therefore analyzed whether PKC activation by TPA treatment alone instead of growth factor treatment was able to cooperate with CaM inhibitors to induce Ras activation in NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly, in these cells PKC activation by TPA is not able to promote Ras activation as measured by the “classic” nucleotide labeling method, although it induces potently ERK activation (20Burgering B.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. Medema R.H. van Weeren P.C. Tertoolen L.G. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7248-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Using the RBD pull-down method, we confirmed that TPA was unable to induce Ras activation in NIH3T3 cells. The inability of PKC activity alone to promote Ras activation ruled out the possibility that the effect of W13 was to induce PKC activation and, consequently, activation of the Ras/ERK pathway. In sharp contrast, TPA treatment in a CaM-inhibited background induced a robust activation of Ras at levels comparable with those achieved by PDGF treatment. These results suggested that CaM was essential in preventing the activation of Ras by PKC in these cells. Regarding the physiological role of this effect of CaM on Ras activation by PKC, this would be relevant in circumstances wherein cells need to keep PKC active but Ras should be down-regulated. For instance, after proliferative activation of the cells, PKC activity is more sustained than that of Ras. We hypothesize that CaM is essential for turning off Ras in an environment wherein PKC activity is high, such as in mitogenically stimulated fibroblasts. If PKC activity was not uncoupled to Ras activation in these cells, an excessively sustained ERK activity could lead to cell cycle arrest through p21cip1 up-regulation.It has been reported that CaM inhibitors can induce cleavage of membrane-bound proteins (30Diaz-Rodriguez E. Esparis-Ogando A. Montero J.C. Yuste L. Pandiella A. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a process that is also influenced by PKC (37Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 38Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24028-24033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the possibility that TPA, together with W13, was inducing Ras/ERK activation via the shedding of membrane-bound, pro-growth factors. The inhibition of both the EGF and PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases demonstrated that Ras activation by TPA together with W13 was independent of the kinase activity of these tyrosine kinase receptors and thus independent of their extracellular stimulation or intracellular transactivation by a PKC-dependent mechanism.As we had shown previously, CaM interacts specifically with K-Ras and inhibits its activation (28Villalonga P. López-Alcalá C. Bosch M. Chiloeches A. Rocamora N. Gil J. Marais R. Marshall C.J. Bachs O. Agell N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether PKC activation, together with CaM inhibition, was able to differentially activate Ras isoforms. As expected, TPA plus W13 induced K-Ras activation nicely but did not induce H- or N-Ras activation. This indicated that the interplay between CaM and PKC in regulating Ras at the molecular level was highly specific, as it was restricted only to K-Ras (consistent with our previous observations). Two models for the possible cooperation between CaM inhibition and PKC activity in K-Ras activation that are in concordance with the results presented up to now are shown in Fig. 7.The mechanistic links lying between PKC and Ras still remain to be characterized in most of the cells types in which Ras is activated by PKC, as this has only been elucidated in T lymphocytes. In these cells, TPA stimulation leads to a very potent activation of Ras, and this has been shown to rely on GAP inhibition (19Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that lymphocytes express RasGRPs, a novel class of nucleotide exchange factors that are regulated by diacylglycerol, and will probably cooperate in the activation of Ras by phorbol esters in lymphocytes (45Genot E. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although there are a few studies of other cell types that suggest that PKC induces GAP inhibition (46Schubert C. Carel K. DePaolo D. Leitner W. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15311-15314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 47Choudhury S. Krishna M. Bhattacharya R.K. Cancer Lett. 1996; 109: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 48Nori M. L'Allemain G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 936-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), there is still no compelling evidence to propose a general role for GAP inhibition in Ras activation by PKC other than in T lymphocytes. Moreover, there is very little information regarding isoform specificity in Ras regulation by PKC, as this has only been investigated in COS cells. In these cells, TPA induces H-, N-, and K-Ras activation (21Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), highlighting the mechanistic differences that must exist between COS and NIH3T3 cells. In NIH3T3 cells, it has been proposed that TPA induces Ras/ERK pathway activation upstream of Shc phosphorylation and its association with Grb-2 (49El-Shemerly M.Y. Besser D. Nagasawa M. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30599-30602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, these conclusions are made on the basis of the use of dominant negative Ras and Sos proteins, but no measurements of Ras activation are shown. We have clearly demonstrated that TPA does not induce Ras activation in NIH3T3 cells, and the use of RasN17 has proven not to be a reliable tool when studying Ras involvement in a signaling pathway (21Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 50Stewart S. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8854-8862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).A strikingly direct link between PKC and K-RasB but not the other Ras isoforms was shown several years ago when PKC induced the direct phosphorylation of K-RasB (51Ballester R. Furth M.E. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed that this phosphorylation could be inhibited in vitro by CaM. Consequently, we favor the hypothesis that PKC phosphorylation of K-Ras is somehow activating its downstream signaling and that this effect would be prevented by CaM binding to K-Ras (Fig.8 b). However, the physiological consequences of this phosphorylation are not yet clear, and further work is needed to prove this hypothesis. The three members of the Ras family of small GTPases, H-, N-, and K-Ras, are key regulators of signal transduction pathways that control cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis (1Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 2Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rebollo A. Martinez A. Blood. 1999; 94: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis for such a great variety of cell responses controlled by Ras proteins relies on the fact that Ras is able to transduce signals from different extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, hormones, and cell-extracellular matrix contacts to many downstream effectors (4Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 5Olson M.F. Marais R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As a molecular switch, Ras cycles between a GTP-bound active and an inactive state when GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. Active Ras interacts with and modulates the activity of effector proteins. The best characterized Ras effector is the serine/threonine kinase Raf, which leads to the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 pathway that plays a major role in cell proliferation and differentiation (6Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

Other effectors for Ras include the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), which is involved in cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism (9Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Many molecules have been described as influencing the Ras GTP/GDP cycle, mainly through two distinct biochemical activities: 1) the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that regulate the replacement of the nucleotide bound to Ras, favoring the GTP-bound active state; or 2) the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which increase Ras low intrinsic GTPase activity and thereby promote its inactivation. Following extracellular stimulation, GEFs are recruited to the plasma membrane through binding t"

Zentralbl. Bakteriol. 1900; 27: 357-363Google Scholar). Two carbohydrate antigens, A and B, and their antibodies constitute this system. The functional A and B alleles at the ABO genetic locus encode glycosyltransferases α1→3GalNAc transferase (A-transferase) and α1→3Gal transferase (B-transferase), respectively. A-transferase transfers a GalNAc residue from UDP-GalNAc to the precursor H substrate, producing A antigens as defined by the trisaccharide determinant structure GalNAcα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→R. Similarly, B-transferase catalyzes the transfer of a Gal from UDP-Gal to the same H substrate, producing B antigens defined by Galα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→R (2Morgan W.T.J. Watkins W.M. Br. Med.

Molecular genetic studies of human ABO genes have demonstrated that ABO genes consist of at least seven exons spanning over 18 kb of genomic DNA and that two critical single base substitutions in the last coding exon result in amino acid substitutions responsible for the different donor nucleotide sugar substrate specificity between A- and B-transferases. A single base deletion in exon 6 was ascribed to shift the reading frame of codons and to abolish the transferase activity of A-transferase in most O alleles (6Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T.

Commun. 1995; 206: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The ABO antigens are expressed in a cell type-specific manner; the isoantigens A, B, and H of blood groups A, B, and O are not confined to red cells but are also found in most secretions and on some epithelial cells. However, they are absent in connective tissues, muscles, and the central nervous system (10Schenkel-Brunner H. Human Blood Groups. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, New York2000: 54-150Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, ABH antigens are known to undergo drastic changes during development, differentiation, and maturation of cells in epithelial lineage as well as erythroid lineage. Immature cells in the basal layers in nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelia, for example, were characterized by the expression of sialylated or unsubstituted precursor peripheral cores, whereas differentiated and mature cells in the upper layers sequentially expressed α1→2 fucosylated H structures and A/B antigens, depending on the ABO genotype of the individual (11Dabelsteen E. Vedtofte P. Hakomori S. Young W.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 79: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similar to ABH antigen expression in epithelia, studies of A antigen expression during maturation of erythroid progenitors in a two phase liquid culture system showed that A-positive cells gradually increased during erythroid maturation (12Wada H. Suda T. Miura Y. Kajii E. Ikemoto S. Yawata Y. Blood. 1990; 75: 505-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bony V. Gane P. Bailly P. Cartron J.P. Br. J.

Robinson J. Lam G. Greaves M.F. Blood. 1982; 60: 703-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The changes of ABH antigen expression have also been documented in pathological processes such as tumorigenesis. Reduction or complete deletion of A/B antigen expression in carcinomas has been reported (15Cordón-Cardó C. Lloyd K. Finstad C.L. McGroarty M.E. Reuter V.E. Bander N.H. Old L.J. Melamed M.R. Lab.

In addition, the loss of ABH antigens has been correlated with tumor progression of various carcinomas, including those in lung and bladder (18Lee J.S., Ro, J.Y. Sahin A.A. Hong W.K. Brown B.W.

Previously we determined two transcription start sites just upstream from the initiation codon by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) technique using human pancreatic cDNA as a template (8Yamamoto F. McNill P.D. Hakomori S. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that the ABO gene promoter was located between −117 and +31, relative to the upstream transcription start site in cells of both epithelial and erythroid lineages (22Kominato Y.

Vox Sang. 2002; 82: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Like many housekeeping genes, the ABO gene contains a typical CpG island that extends from 0.7 kb upstream to 0.6 kb downstream from the transcription start site in exon 1 (24Kominato Y. Hata Y. Takizawa H. Tsuchiya T. Tsukada J. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37240-37250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Expression of the ABO genes was shown to be repressed upon DNA methylation of the CpG island in the promoter region (24Kominato Y. Hata Y. Takizawa H. Tsuchiya T. Tsukada J. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37240-37250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Iwamoto S. Withers D.A. Handa K. Hakomori S. Glycoconj.

Bachman K.E. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3156-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The CpG island located in the gene promoter region is usually the main target of this regional hypermethylation. DNA methylation of CpG islands spanning the promoter is often strongly associated with transcriptional silencing. A group of the methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs) bind preferentially to methylated CpGs (27Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P.

The direct linkages among the MBDs, histone deacetylases, and chromatin remodeling machinery have provided a basis for understanding how DNA methylation can be related to a transcriptionally incompetent chromatin state.Further characterization of the upstream region of the ABO gene is necessary to obtain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that result in the cell type-specific expression of the ABO genes and the changes in ABO gene expression during cell differentiation. Furthermore, it will be also informative for the elucidation of the molecular basis of DNA methylation in the ABO gene promoter in cancer cells. Here we report the identification of an alternative promoter of the ABO genes.DISCUSSIONWe have studied the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of the human ABO genes. Our previous characterization of the 5′-upstream sequence of the ABO gene demonstrated that the region between −117 and +31 had promoter activity in both epithelial and erythroid lineages (22Kominato Y. Tsuchiya T. Hata N. Takizawa H. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25890-25898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Hata Y. Kominato Y. Yamamoto F. Takizawa H. Vox Sang. 2002; 82: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the ABO genes was found to be dependent upon DNA methylation of the proximal constitutive promoter (24Kominato Y. Hata Y. Takizawa H. Tsuchiya T. Tsukada J. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37240-37250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have identified a novel transcription start site at the 5′-end of the CpG island containing the proximal promoter in the ABO gene. This start site appears to mark an alternative starting exon (1a), which is utilized as a transcription starting exon in both erythroid and epithelial lineage cells examined. The region just upstream from the transcription start site is sufficient for the expression of a reporter gene in a cell type-specific manner when placed 5′ adjacent to the luciferase gene. Hypermethylation is commonly observed in the region of repetitive elements 5′ adjacent to the distal promoter region in all of the cell lines examined. These results indicate that a cell type-specific promoter is located between the hypermethylated region of repetitive elements and the CpG island containing the constitutive promoter in the ABO genes.The utilization of multiple promoters and transcription start sites is a frequently used mechanism to create diversity and flexibility in the regulation of gene expression (47Ayoubi T.A.Y. van de Ven W.J.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The level of transcription initiation can vary between alternative promoters: the turnover or translation efficiency of mRNA isoforms with different leader exons can differ, alternative promoters can have different tissue specificity and can react differently to growth signals, and alternative promoter usage can lead to the generation of protein isoforms differing in amino acid sequence. The use of an alternative exon 1a seems to be common in the ABO genes because the ABO blood group genotypes of the AC133−CD34+ cells used in this study were inferred to be AA based on A allele-specific nucleotide substitutions (6Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), whereas those of KATOIII cells, MKN45 cells, and K562 cells were BO, AA, and OO, respectively (24Kominato Y. Hata Y. Takizawa H. Tsuchiya T. Tsukada J. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37240-37250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although the nucleotide sequence of exon 1a does not contain an ATG codon, transfection experiments of MKN28 cells with the expression plasmid A(1a) containing the entire cDNA starting from exon 1a demonstrated the appearance of large amounts of A antigens, suggesting that the functional protein involved in expression of A antigens could be synthesized by the usage of an internal preferential translation start site in the transmembrane domain. 3Y. Hata and Y. Kominato, unpublished data. However, quantitative real time RT-PCR showed that most of the ABO gene transcripts start from exon 1. The low level of the transcripts starting from exon 1a may be caused by different turnover efficiencies of mRNA isoforms with different leader exons or by reduction of the distal promoter activity conferred by corepressor complexes recruited by MBDs that can bind to the hypermethylated interspersed repeats in chromatin. On the other hand, the short open reading frames upstream from the coding sequence may serve to control expression at the translational level, as reported with other genes (49Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In the murine acetylcholinesterase gene, an alternative promoter was identified 5′-upstream from the proximal promoter (50Atanasavo E. Chiappa S. Wieben E. Brimijoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our analyses of the G+C density and CpG frequency in the nucleotide sequence of the upstream region of the murine acetylcholinesterase gene (GenBank accession no.AF148849) demonstrated that the alternative exon is located 5′ adjacent to a CpG island. Based on the histone code hypothesis that distinct histone amino-terminal modifications can generate synergistic or antagonistic interaction affinities for chromatin-associated proteins, which in turn dictate dynamic transitions between transcriptionally active and silent chromatin states (51Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar), it is possible that some activities of the cell type-specific promoter located at the 5′-end of the ABO CpG island prevent histone tails from modifications such as deacetylation and methylation leading to silenced chromatin domains. Further studies are needed to define the relative roles of the distal cell type-specific promoter and the proximal constitutive promoter in the regulation of ABO gene expression. Moreover, elucidation of an association among the hypermethylated region of repetitive elements, the distal promoter, the negative element from position −275 to −118, and the proximal promoter may lead to more precise resolution of a molecular basis for the ABO gene expression in a cell type-specific fashion and of the changes during cell differentiation.CpG islands are almost always maintained in unmethylated states, unlike the CpG sites in the remainder of the genome. However, methylation of CpG islands can occur on an inactive X chromosome, in promoters of imprinted genes, with oncogenesis, and during aging. In all of these cases, methylation of CpG islands spanning the promoter regions is strongly associated with transcriptional silencing. DNA methylation of the distal and proximal promoters in the ABO gene is correlated with the absence of transcripts from the distal and proximal promoter, respectively, in MKN1 cells, MKN28 cells, and HEL cells. However, the possibility still exists that additional factor(s) could function in the down-regulation of ABO gene expression. As of now, there is no clear understanding of what leads to the aberrant methylation of CpG islands commonly seen in cancer. Moreover, it is unclear whether hypermethylation is initiated from the ends of CpG island or at “hypermethylation center(s)” within the CpG island in tumor cells. It has been suggested that maintenance of the unmethylated CpG islands is dependent on continued active transcription and/or the binding of specific proteins that may protect them from being methylated (52Cross S.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Studies of the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase gene locus have identified a potential mechanism of how CpG islands remain free of methylation in embryonic cells (53Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 54Brandeis M. Fank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5163-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Sp1 binding sites and presumably trans-acting factor(s) that bind to those sites apparently protect the CpG island of this gene from methylation. Thus, the loss of specific proteins or interference with their binding and/or the lack of active transcription may contribute to CpG island promoter methylation in cancer. It has also been proposed that repetitive elements such as Alu repeats and long interspersed nuclear elements might serve as foci for de novo methylation and that methylation may spread from such attractors of modification (57Magewu A.N. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4225-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 58Turker M.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In particular, Graff et al. (59Graff J.R. Herman J.G. Myöhänen S. Baylin S.B. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22322-22329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) showed that Alu sequences upstream from E-cadherin and von Hippel-Lindall (VHL) genes are methylated in normal tissues, whereas adjacent CpG island sequences are not. In addition, from their studies of transfected DNA they have suggested that methylation may progressively encroach from the methylated Alu sequence regions flanking CpG islands. However, others have suggested that methylation is initiated at “centers” within the islands and progressively spreads (60Toth M. Lichtenberg U. Doerfler W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3728-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently, Millar et al. (39Millar D.S. Paul C.L. Molloy P.L. Clark S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24893-24899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a marked boundary of the methylated and unmethylated domains correlated with an (ATAAA)19–24 repeated sequence at the 3′-end of hypermethylated Alu sequence of the upstream region in the glutathione S-transferase gene in normal tissues involving prostate tissue. It was also discovered that DNA methylation was present in the core CpG-rich promoter region but did not extend through the 5′-flanking region in two prostate cancer cell lines, whereas the extensive high level of DNA methylation observed in the core promoter region was found to spread through the upstream region to and beyond the boundary in another prostate cancer cell line. Supporting the latter hypothesis, the leukemia-promoting promyelocytes-retinoic acid receptor (PML-RAR) fusion protein has been reported to induce gene hypermethylation and silencing by recruiting DNA methyltransferases to target promoters (48Croce L.D. Raker V.A. Corsaro M. Fazi F. Fanelli M. Faretta M. Fuks F. Coco F.L. Kouzarides T. Nervi C. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Science. 2002; 295: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that the newly methylated CpGs worked as docking sites for methyl-binding proteins, which in turn interacted with both histone deacetylase complexes and DNA methyltransferases, leading to the spreading of hypermethylation to the neighboring regions. In the present study, we found that the region consisting of repetitive elements was methylated in all of the cells examined, although a definite boundary between the methylated and unmethylated domains could not be determined in the ABO gene upstream region. A similar methylation pattern in which the methylated domain is restricted beyond the distal promoter region, was observed in KATOIII cells, K562 cells, and the erythroid cells in ex vivoculture. However, distinctive methylation patterns of the ABO gene upstream region were found among MKN45 cells, MKN1 cells, MKN28 cells, and HEL cells, in which hypermethylation extends from the region of repetitive elements through the distal promoter region. The distal promoter region seems to be preferred for methylation compared with the proximal promoter region in the ABO genes. This preference of the distal promoter region for methylation may be simply the result of different distances between the promoter region and the methylated interspersed repeats. Alternatively, additional factors binding to the sequence downstream the distal promoter may protect the proximal promoter region from methylation. Elucidation of such a phenomenon may provide a clear understanding of the molecular mechanism for the extension of aberrant methylation associated with oncogenesis. In 1900 Karl Landsteiner discovered the ABO blood group system, which is important in blood transfusions and personal identification in criminal investigations (1Landsteiner K. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. 1900; 27: 357-363Google Scholar). Two carbohydrate antigens, A and B, and their antibodies constitute this system. The functional A and B alleles at the ABO genetic locus encode glycosyltransferases α1→3GalNAc transferase (A-transferase) and α1→3Gal transferase (B-transferase), respectively. A-transferase transfers a GalNAc residue from UDP-GalNAc to the precursor H substrate, producing A antigens as defined by the trisaccharide determinant structure GalNAcα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→R. Similarly, B-transferase catalyzes the transfer of a Gal from UDP-Gal to the same H substrate, producing B antigens defined by Galα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→R (2Morgan W.T.J. Watkins W.M. Br. Med. Bull. 1969; 25: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Kabat E.A. Isbell H. Carbohydrates in Solution. American Chemical Society, Washington, D.

Molecular genetic studies of human ABO genes have demonstrated that ABO genes consist of at least seven exons spanning over 18 kb of genomic DNA and that two critical single base substitutions in the last coding exon result in amino acid substitutions responsible for the different donor nucleotide sugar substrate specificity between A- and B-transferases. A single base deletion in exon 6 was ascribed to shift the reading frame of codons and to abolish the transferase activity of A-transferase in most O alleles (6Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 7Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

The ABO antigens are expressed in a cell type-specific manner; the isoantigens A, B, and H of blood groups A, B, and O are not confined to red cells but are also found in most secretions and on some epithelial cells. However, they are absent in connective tissues, muscles, and the central nervous system (10Schenkel-Brunner H. Human Blood Groups. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, New York2000: 54-150Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, ABH antigens are known to undergo drastic changes during development, differentiation, and maturation of cells in epithelial lineage as well as erythroid lineage. Immature cells in the basal layers in nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelia, for example, were characterized by the expression of sialylated or unsubstituted precursor peripheral cores, whereas differentiated and mature cells in the upper layers sequentially expressed α1→2 fucosylated H structures and A/B antigens, depending on the ABO genotype of the individual (11Dabelsteen E. Vedtofte P. Hakomori S. Young W.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 79: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similar to ABH antigen expression in epithelia, studies of A antigen expression during maturation of erythroid progenitors in a two phase liquid culture system showed that A-positive cells gradually increased during erythroid maturation (12Wada H. Suda T. Miura Y. Kajii E. Ikemoto S. Yawata Y. Blood. 1990; 75: 505-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bony V. Gane P. Bailly P. Cartron J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 107: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)1 analysis using monoclonal antibodies demonstrated the expression of A antigens on colony cells derived from BFU-E and CFU-E (14Sief C. Bicknell D. Caine G. Robinson J. Lam G. Greaves M.F. Blood. 1982; 60: 703-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The changes of ABH antigen expression have also been documented in pathological processes such as tumorigenesis. Reduction or complete deletion of A/B antigen expression in carcinomas has been reported (15Cordón-Cardó C. Lloyd K. Finstad C.L. McGroarty M.E. Reuter V.E. Bander N.H. Old L.J. Melamed M.R. Lab.

In addition, the loss of ABH antigens has been correlated with tumor progression of various carcinomas, including those in lung and bladder (18Lee J.S., Ro, J.Y. Sahin"

This ligase mediates ubiquitination of the inhibitor of NF-κB transcription factor (IκB). We have found that HOS is highly expressed in a number of human cancer cell lines. The rates of the HOS gene transcription as well as HOS mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated in cells treated with mitogens or transfected with the inducers of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Conversely, mitogen withdrawal strikingly reduced HOS levels during differentiation of mouse myoblasts. Activators of mitogen-activated protein kinase accelerated IκBα degradation and increased NF-κB transcriptional activity. Inhibition of HOS function via expression of dominant negative HOS (HOSΔF) initiated mouse myoblast differentiation and prevented Ras-mediated acceleration of IκBα degradation as well as NF-κB trans-activation and transformation of NIH3T3 cells.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 pathway is instrumental for both of these characteristics. MAPK signaling is activated in response to external proliferative stimuli (growth factors, phorbol esters, etc.) or expression of oncogenic proteins. Structural components and activities of this pathway are frequently altered in cancer cells. MAPK is induced by a number of canonical oncogenes (including Ras, v-Raf, etc.). Its signaling cascade involves activation of serine/threonine protein kinase Raf and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases kinases (MEK1 and MEK2) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (Erk1 and Erk2). Extracellular signal-regulated kinases activate specific transcription factors, thereby inducing de novo expression of genes whose products accelerate cell cycle progression (1Campbell J.S. Seger R. Graves J.D. Graves L.M. Jensen A.M. Krebs E.G. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 131-159PubMed Google Scholar). Among these factors is the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), in which activation by mitogens is often observed in dividing cells and is essential for normal growth (for review, see Ref. 2Joyce D. Albanese C. Steer J., Fu, M. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Increased cell viability represents a byproduct of MAPK signaling that is favorable for individual cells. Activation of NF-κB by MAPK plays a central role in survival of cells undergoing malignant transformation (3Mayo M.W. Norris J.L. Baldwin A.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It occurs in cells transformed by several cellular and viral oncogenes including Ras, Raf, and others. Enhanced constitutive activity of NF-κB is widely observed in human tumor cells and primary tumors (for review, see Refs. 2Joyce D. Albanese C. Steer J., Fu, M. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar and 4Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: 55-62PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of NF-κB by a transforming Ras mutant is required for malignant transformation of NIH3T3 cells (5Norris J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13841-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NF-κB activity prevents Ras-mediated focus formation (6Finco T.S. Westwick J.K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and even may lead Ras-expressing cells to death via apoptosis rather than to accelerated growth (7Mayo M.W.

In the absence of stress or infection, normal cells suppress basal NF-κB activity and inhibit expression of numerous NF-κB target genes by sequestering NF-κB outside the nucleus. This is achieved by expression of a family of inhibitory proteins (IκB). IκBs tightly bind to NF-κB dimers and mask the NF-κB domains, which are responsible for the nuclear localization and DNA binding. A number of external stimuli, including mitogens, stress, damage, and inflammatory cytokines can activate NF-κB via ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB, which requires phosphorylation of IκB on two critical serine residues by IκB kinases (for review, see Ref. 8Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκB can be recognized by two closely related F-box proteins, βTrCP/Fbw1a (9Spencer E.

These data suggest that effectors that control the abundance of HOS or βTrCP play an important role in the regulation of NF-κB and β-catenin/Tcf signal transduction pathways. Such a role has been recently demonstrated for induction of βTrCP in cells that express an oncogenic mutant of β-catenin (19Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z. Fuchs S.Y. Mol.

In this case, βTrCP-based ubiquitin ligase did not affect stability of a phosphorylation-deficient β-catenin mutant (due to the lack of specific phosphorylation) but did contribute to activation of NF-κB by targeting IκB ubiquitination and degradation. We have found that βTrCP is overexpressed in a number of colorectal tumors (19Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z. Fuchs S.Y. Mol.

Interestingly, we found that some cell lines (e.g. NIH3T3) or tissues (e.g. mouse skin) hardly express any βTrCP (20Spiegelman V.S. Stavropoulos P. Latres E. Pagano M. Ronai Z. Slaga T.J. Fuchs S.Y.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to investigate the regulation of HOS expression in NIH3T3 cells and to determine the levels of HOS in human tumors. In this study, we have detected high levels of HOS expression in a number of human cancer cell lines. We have also found that proliferative stimuli induced HOS expression and that activation of the MAPK pathway was necessary and sufficient for HOS induction and concurrent activation of NF-κB-driven transcription. Maintenance of HOS levels in mouse myoblasts correlated with their proliferation and lack of differentiation. Moreover, the integrity of HOS function was indispensable for Ras-induced IκBα degradation, NF-κB activation, and transformation of NIH3T3 cells in vitro. Thus, we discussed the association between cell proliferation and HOS levels and the likely contribution of HOS induction by mitogens to cell differentiation and transformation and perhaps tumorigenesis. All cells originated from the American Type Culture Collection except TIG normal human fibroblasts (a gift from H. Tahara) and normal epithelial prostate cells (purchased from Clonetics). All cells were cultured in the presence of antibiotics at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. NIH3T3 and TIG normal human fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen). Murine C2C12 myoblast cells were cultured to proliferate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) or induced to differentiate in 2% horse serum (Sigma) and insulin (10 μg/ml). All tumor cell lines were cultured in RPMI medium or a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 5–15% fetal bovine serum. Normal prostate epithelial cells, PrEC, were cultured in PrEGM medium (Clonetics). Constructs for expression of HOS and HOSΔN (14Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z.

We created pCDNA3-HOSΔF by PCR-mediated mutagenesis, resulting in deletion of cDNA sequence encoding HOS amino acids 117–169. Constitutively active MEK1 (MEKEL) was made by introduction of three substitution mutations (F53L, S218E, S222E) in the wild type MEK1 cDNA. N-HOS rabbit antibody, which specifically recognizes HOS, is described elsewhere (21Spiegelman V.S. Tang W. Katoh M. Slaga T.J. Fuchs S.Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The other antibodies used for this study were hemagglutinin (HA) rabbit antibody and myogenin antibody (M-225) from Santa Cruz, M2 FLAG antibody, and mouse monoclonal antibody against heavy chain of skeletal myosin from Sigma. Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Preparations of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemistry procedures are described elsewhere (14Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5785-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using Scion Image Software (version Beta 4.0.2). NIH3T3 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitate technique as described (28Osada M. Tolkacheva T., Li, W. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Saez R. Kimmelman A.C. Chan A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6333-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For each 100-mm plate, 60 ng of Ras expression vector was transfected along with the indicated quantity of HOSΔF or IκBαΔN expression vectors or empty vector to normalize the total amount of transfected plasmids. Cells were fed every 3 days with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum, and the appearance of foci of transformed cells was counted 14 days after transfection. The procedure for semi-solid agar growth assay is described elsewhere (32Chan A. Miki T. Meyers K. Aaronson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were fractionated on an agarose gel, transferred to a nylon filter, and cross-linked with a UV cross-linker (Stratagene). Blots were hybridized with HOS-specific [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes in QuickHyb buffer (Stratagene) supplemented with denatured salmon sperm DNA, stringently washed, and analyzed by autoradiography. Dot blot analyses of cDNAs from primary human tissues fixed to a nylon filter (the Matched Tumor/Normal Expression Array membrane, CLONTECH) were hybridized with the probes to HOS or ubiquitin according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Nuclear run-on analysis was performed as previously described (19Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 877-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We determined the levels of HOS mRNA in human cancer cell lines and primary human cancer tissues. Steady state levels ofHOS mRNA were increased in four of six cell lines derived from human prostate cancers when compared with normal epithelial prostate cells (Fig.1 A, lanes 4–7 versus lane 1). HOS expression was also elevated in one of three tissues from primary human prostate tumors when compared with apparently normal tissues (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). We also observed an increase in HOS expression in five of five human breast cancer cell lines compared with a non-transformed MCF10a cell line (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–6 versus lane 1), and five of nine primary breast tumors (Fig. 1 D, lanes 2, 4,5, 6, and 8). In all, our findings indicate that HOS is overexpressed in a considerable fraction of human primary cancers and human cancer cell lines. To investigate a possible link between cell proliferation and HOS expression, we used NIH3T3 cells, which do not express detectable levels of βTrCP (20Spiegelman V.S. Stavropoulos P. Latres E. Pagano M. Ronai Z. Slaga T.J. Fuchs S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27152-27158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Treatment of these cells with a well characterized mitogen and inducer of NF-κB, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA (33Peters R.T. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), resulted in an increased rate of HOS transcription as measured in a nuclear “run-on” assay (Fig.2 A). The extent of this induction was almost comparable with the increase in transcription of ornithine decarboxylase, a bona fide TPA-inducible gene (34Friedman J. Cerutti P. Carcinogenesis. 1983; 4: 1425-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We also found that treatment of cells with TPA increased the steady state levels of HOS mRNA (Fig. 2 B) as well as HOS protein (Fig. 2 C). The observed increase inHOS mRNA levels by TPA was strikingly diminished by pretreatment of cells with actinomycin D to inhibit transcription (data not shown). Similar results were observed when the cells were treated with epidermal growth factor or when TIG human diploid fibroblast cells were treated with TPA or epidermal growth factor. 2V. S. Spiegelman and S. Y. Fuchs, unpublished data. The observed increase in HOS transcription in response to TPA measured in a run-on experiment indicates that mitogens regulate HOSlevels primarily via transcription. Nevertheless, the lack of concordance between the extent of the effects of TPA on the rate of gene transcription (6.3-fold), mRNA (4.6-fold), and protein (2.4-fold) steady state levels suggests that mRNA and protein stability may also play important roles in the regulation of HOS abundance. Growth stimuli are known to initiate numerous signal transduction pathways, including activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK1-MAPK cascade (1Campbell J.S. Seger R. Graves J.D. Graves L.M. Jensen A.M. Krebs E.G. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 131-159PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we observed that HOS levels were elevated in skin tumors induced in SENCAR mice by a two-stage experimental skin carcinogenesis protocol (25Bhatia N. Herter J.R. Slaga T.J. Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which yields skin tumors harboring activating Ras mutations (35Pelling J.C. Fischer S.M. Neades R. Strawhecker J. Schweickert L. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 1481-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To investigate whether activation of the MAPK pathway was indeed required for induction of HOS by mitogens, we pretreated cells with the pharmacological inhibitor of MEK1 (PD98059). PD98059 inhibited the induction of HOS by TPA (Fig.3 A) and epidermal growth factor.2 Furthermore, the expression of constitutively active Ras, Raf (v-Raf), or MEK1 (MEKEL) led to a robust activation of luciferase reporter driven by the HOSpromoter. This activation was partially inhibited by dominant negative MEK1 mutant (dnMEK1; Fig. 3 B). These data indicate that activation of MAPK pathway is both necessary and sufficient for induction of HOS transcription. We have also observed that expression of MAPK pathway activators led to accumulation of endogenous HOS protein (Fig. 3 C) and mRNA (data not shown). Because the transfection efficiency in our experiments was ∼20–25%, it is likely that the real extent of HOS accumulation was underestimated. DnMEK1 not only abrogated the induction of HOS by Ras but also decreased basal HOS levels (Fig. 3 C). These findings indicate that MAPK activities contribute to induction of HOS by mitogens as well as to the maintenance of basal HOS levels. We occasionally observed the appearance of slowly migrating HOS species, which might represent phosphorylated HOS, in the cells expressing MAPK-inducing constructs. Accumulation of βTrCP in response to Wnt or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation resulted in an increased activity of SCFβTrCP (19Spiegelman V.S. Slaga T.J. Pagano M. Minamoto T. Ronai Z. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 877-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Spiegelman V.S. Stavropoulos P. Latres E. Pagano M. Ronai Z. Slaga T.J. Fuchs S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27152-27158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We tested whether an induction of HOS by MAPK may activate the respective HOS-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Forced expression of Ras resulted in a noticeable acceleration in IκBα degradation, with the half-life changing from more than 80 min to less than 35 min (Fig. 4, A andB). These data agree with the findings of Finco et al. (6Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), who observed a Ras-mediated increase in NF-κB binding to DNA in NIH3T3 cells. Whereas co-expression of HOS slightly promoted further Ras-induced IκBα degradation, transfection of cells with a dominant negative HOSΔF prevented IκBα degradation induced by Ras (Fig. 4, A and B). Of note, the rate of IκBα degradation well correlated with the levels of HOS. The half-life of IκBα was reduced by half in the Ras-expressing cells (with an approximately 2-fold increase in HOS levels, Fig.4 B, inset) as compared with the cells, which did not express Ras. These data indicate that HOS is required for acceleration of IκB degradation mediated by Ras. Several reports indicate that activation of IκB phosphorylation by IκB kinases (IκB kinase β (36Arsura M. Mercurio F. Oliver A.L. Thorgeirsson S.S. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5381-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) or IκB kinase ε (33Peters R.T. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar)) and Rsk1 (37Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol.

Zantema A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3133-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) contributes to TPA-, Ras-, or v-Raf-dependent activation of NF-κB. Thus, we tested the effects of the MAPK cascade activators on IκBα phosphorylation. Whereas expression of activated Ras or Raf increased the overall IκBα kinase activity, constitutively active MEK1 (MEKEL) failed to do so (Fig.4 C, inset). Yet all these constructs were efficient in MAPK activation (as judged by immunoblotting with antibody against phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase; data not shown) as well as in stimulation of NF-κB transcriptional activity (Fig.4 C, black bars). This result suggests that activation of IκB phosphorylation by Ras or Raf may not entirely be mediated via MAPK activity. Co-expression of dominant negative HOSΔF did not affect MAPK activation per se(data not shown) but inhibited the effect of all of the MAPK inducers on NF-κB trans-activation (Fig. 4 C, gray bars). As evident from the data presented in Fig. 4 C, constitutively active MEK1 induced NF-κB in a HOS-dependent manner without further activation of IκB kinases. In all, our findings suggest that HOS induction contributes to activation of NF-κB by MAPK signaling. The undifferentiated status of C2C12 mouse myoblast cells in vitro is achieved by their maintenance in high serum conditions and requires elevated levels of NF-κB activity. Inhibition of NF-κB activity by a non-degradable IκBα super-repressor resulted in C2C12 cell differentiation even in the presence of proliferative stimuli (31Guttridge D.C. Albanese C. Reuther J.Y. Pestell R.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5785-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether the levels of HOS are altered upon myoblast differentiation. When placed in the low serum-containing medium, C2C12 cells started to express specific markers of differentiation (myogenin and skeletal myosin, Fig.5, B and C) followed by development of characteristic morphological features of myocyte tubes (data not shown). At the same time, we observed a dramatic decrease in the levels of HOS mRNA (Fig. 5 A) and protein (Fig. 5 B). Of note, forced expression of dominant negative HOSΔF mutant per se led to C2C12 differentiation even in the high serum-containing medium (Fig.5 C), albeit with a lesser efficiency than observed with the IκB super-repressor (data not shown). These findings together with earlier reports (31Guttridge D.C. Albanese C. Reuther J.Y. Pestell R.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5785-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that maintenance of active HOS levels and NF-κB activity by mitogen signaling plays a key role in preventing myoblast differentiation. Activation of NF-κB by Ras or v-Raf is indispensable for malignant cell transformation induced by these oncogenes, and inhibition of NF-κB activity by the IκBα super-repressor can block this transformation (5Norris J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13841-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to determine the effect of inhibiting HOS activities for NIH3T3 transformation. Transient expression of increasing concentrations of the HOS dominant negative construct (HOSΔF) led to a noticeable decrease in the ability of co-expressed Ras to induce NIH3T3 cells to form foci (Fig. 6, black bars) or grow in an anchorage-independent manner in soft agar (Fig. 6, gray bars). Similar results were obtained with another HOS mutant (HOSΔN, data not shown) as well as with IκBΔN super-repressor, used as a positive control. The latter data are in line with previously published results (6Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that HOS activities are required for transformation of NIH3T3 cells by Ras oncogene. Elevated activity of NF-κB is a hallmark of many malignant tumors. Activation of NF-κB in tumor cells is achieved by either expression of abnormal NF-κB proteins (e.g."

Upon transition to elongation, the polymerase releases promoter and forms a stable elongation complex. Little is known about the changes in polymerase conformation or polymerase:DNA interactions that occur during this process. To characterize the transitions that occur in the T7 RNA polymerase transcription complex during initiation, we prepared enzymes with Fe-BABE conjugated at 11 different positions. Addition of H(2)O(2) to transcription complexes prepared with these enzymes led to nucleic acid strand scission near the conjugate. Changes in the cleavage sites revealed a series of conformational changes and rearrangements of protein:nucleic acid contacts that mediate progression through the initiation reaction."

In both cardiac and skeletal muscles, the generation of force through the interaction of thick and thin filaments of the sarcomere is under the control of Ca2+ concentration in the sarcoplasm. The heterotrimeric troponin (Tn) 1The abbreviations used are: Tn, troponin; A, F-actin; TM, tropomyosin; S1, subfragment 1 of myosin; TnC, Ca2+ binding component of Tn; TnI, inhibitory component of Tn; TnT, TM binding component of Tn; fsTnI, chicken fast skeletal isoform of TnI; ssTnI, slow skeletal isoform of TnI; cTnI, human cardiac isoform of TnI; cTnC, human cardiac isoform of TnC; fsTnC, chicken fast skeletal isoform of TnC; cTnT, human cardiac isoform of TnT; fsTnT, chicken fast skeletal isoform of TnT; Ip, inhibitory peptide. complex through its interaction with the thin filament proteins F-actin (A) and tropomyosin (TM) is the dominant player in this control. Conformational changes associated with Ca2+ binding to the regulatory N domain of troponin C (TnC) alter its interactions with both of the other Tn subunits, troponin I (TnI, inhibitory subunit) and troponin T (TnT, TM binding subunit), and of TnI and TnT with TM and A. In consequence, TM moves from its steric blocking position, facilitating interaction of thick filament myosin heads with the thin filament and generation of ATPase activity and contraction. Sequestration of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasma reticulum reverses the process with ensuing relaxation (for reviews, see Refs. 1Geaves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar and 2Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). As key components of this system, the functional and structural relationships of TnC and TnI and their interaction in the presence and absence of Ca2+ have been the subject of intensive investigation over several decades (for reviews, see Refs. 2Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 3Farah C.S. Reinach F.C.

Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While high resolution structures of the binary or ternary (with TnT) complexes by x-ray crystallographic or NMR approaches have remained elusive, considerable progress has been made in the mapping of interaction sites of the TnC and TnI components. Two such TnI regions, first described by S. V. Perry and colleagues (for review, see Ref. 5Perry S.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1), involve the NH2-terminal segment of fast skeletal TnI (fsTnI) (residues ∼1–30) and the so-called inhibitory peptide or Ip region (residues 96–116). While the high affinity interaction involving residues ∼1–30 likely persists throughout the contraction-relaxation cycle, the weaker Ca2+-dependent interaction involving Ip permits toggling between TnC (+Ca2+) and TM·A (−Ca2+). As such it accounts for a significant proportion of the inhibitory capacity of TnI and the Tn complex (−Ca2+). More recently several studies have shown that for full functional competence additional TnI segments that are COOH-terminal to the Ip region are operative. Thus, for example, Tripetet al. (6Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) identified an additional Ca2+-sensitive TnC binding region (fsTnI-(116–131)) and a second TM·A binding segment (fsTnI-(140–148)). In a report from our laboratory (7Pearlstone J.R. Sykes B.D. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we described a sequence motif repeated 3-fold, once in the Ip region (residues ∼101–114, designated α) and twice more in the region of residues ∼121–132 (β) and ∼135–146 (γ). The latter two correspond approximately to those described by Tripetet al. (6Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Based on binding studies to TnC and its isolated domains we concluded that while residues 96–116 (Ip) largely interact with the structural C domain, residues 117–148 (β and γ) bind to the regulatory N domain (7Pearlstone J.R.

Consistent with these observations and from a comparison of the cardiac and skeletal TnI α, β, and γ sequence motifs, we previously identified several highly conserved charge differences, especially in the β motif, and suggested (7Pearlstone J.R. Sykes B.D. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) these as potential candidates responsible for the differential acid pH effect on the Ca2+ sensitivities of the two systems (see Fig.1). Here we describe experiments to test this proposal. The pET3a·cTnC and pET3a·fsTnC constructs have been described previously (15Pearlstone J.R. Chandra M. Sorenson M.M. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35106-35115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Slupsky C.M. Kay C.M. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7365-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the present study, the Cys-34 and Cys-83 codons (TGC) of pET3a·cTnC were mutated to Ser codons (AGC) using paired 31- and 37-mer oligonucleotides, respectively (Stratagene). The 37-mer oligonucleotide also incorporated a base change for the Arg-84 codon from CGG (rare in Escherichia coli) to CGC (common). This construct has been designated herein as pET3a·cTnC“WT”. Protocols for transformation, expression in BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells, and purification were as described previously (7Pearlstone J.R. Sykes B.D. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding human cardiac TnI (cTnI) was kindly provided as clone pCT1-2 by P. J. R. Barton of Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK (17Vallins W.J. Brand N.J. Dabhade N. Butler-Browne G. Yacoub M.H. Barton P.J.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It was engineered into theNdeI/BamHI sites of pET3a using standard PCR technology. These procedures also involved the mutation of Ala-1 and Gly-3 codons to GCC and GGT, respectively, as recommended (18Al-Hillawi E. Minchin S.D. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) for high yield expression. Using this construct (pET3a·cTnI) as template, the Cys-79 and Cys-96 codons were mutated to Ser (AGC) in two rounds of mutagenesis using paired 24- and 27-mer primers, respectively. In the case of the Cys-96 to Ser mutation the oligonucleotides used also introduced a codon mutation for Arg-97 from CGA (rare) to CGC (common in E. coli). The final construct is designated pET3a·cTnI“WT.” The pET3a·cTnI(Q155R/A162H/E164V), pET3a·cTnI(Q155R/E164V), and pET3a·cTnI(A162H) were initially constructed using pET3a·cTnI as template for sequential rounds of mutagenesis using paired 25-, 27-, or 29-mer oligonucleotides. Codon changes were to CGT for Arg, GTG for Val, and CAT for His. The C79S and C96S mutants were then introduced into these constructs as for pET3a·cTnC“WT.” The fsTnI construct in pET3a was a gift from F. C. Reinach (19Quaggio R.B. Ferro J.A. Monteiro P.B. Reinach F.C. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1053-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of this construct, which expressed poorly in our experiments, showed that the codons for Arg-13 and Arg-14 were both CGG (rare in E. coli). Mutation of these to CGT (common) by the PCR chain extension method markedly improved expression. The codons for Cys-48 and Cys-65 were mutated to AGC (Ser) by two cycles of mutagenesis using paired oligonucleotides. This construct is herein designated pET3a·fsTnI“WT”. Using the latter as template, mutation of the His-130 codon from GAC to that for Ala (GCC) was by the PCR chain extension method to produce pET3a·fsTnI(H130A). Transformation and protein expression of all TnI constructs were the same as for the TnCs. Following cell lysis in a French press at pH 9.0 and centrifugation, the pellets were extracted with 8 murea, pH 9.0 and fractionated on a CM-Sepharose column in 8m urea, pH 7.0 with a 0–0.3 m NaCl gradient. Final purities were assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino acid analyses. A clone (pSBET·cTnT) for expression of cTnT was a gift from Dr. S. Hitchcock-DeGregori (20Mukherjea P. Tong L. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13296-13301Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expression was the same as for the TnCs except that BL21 (DE3) cells and kanamycin for antibiotic selection were used. Purification of cTnT from a cell acetone powder extract (pH 8.0, 6 m urea) was on Q-Sepharose (pH 8.0) and CM-Sepharose columns (pH 6.0), both in 6 m urea. Chicken muscle fsTnT was prepared as described for the rabbit protein (21Mak A.S. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14330-14334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A from rabbit skeletal muscle was prepared as described previously (22Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Final dialysis was against pH 7.0 or 6.5 assay buffer (plus 1 mm ATP). Final stock concentration was 90–115 μm. Assays were carried out within 2 weeks. Rabbit skeletal myosin subfragment 1 (S1) with associated light chains (A1 and A2) was prepared as described previously (23Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against pH 7.0 or 6.5 assay buffer. Final stock concentration was 22–26 μm. Rabbit skeletal TM, prepared as freeze-dried powder (24Smillie L.B. Colowich S.P. Kaplan N.B. Methods in Enzymology. 85. Academic Press, New York1982: 234-241Google Scholar) without fractionation into α and β chains, was dissolved and dialyzed against pH 7.0 or 6.5 assay buffer to give a 12–14 μm stock solution. Precise concentrations of all three stock solutions were determined by amino acid analyses. The stock solution of TnC (∼5 mg/ml) was in assay buffer; TnI (∼5 mg/ml) was in H2O at pH 4.0–4.5; and TnT (∼5 mg/ml) was in 4 m guanidine·HCl, 1 m KCl, 100 mm imidazole, 4.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. Concentrations of each stock solution were determined by amino acid analyses, and then all three were combined to give a molar ratio of TnI:TnT:TnC of 1:1:2. Following dialysis against pH 7.0 or 6.5 assay buffer (−EGTA, +50 μm Ca2+) the precise Tn stock concentration (16–24 μm), expressed as [TnI], was determined by amino acid analyses. This simplified reconstitution protocol gave equivalent ATPase assay data as native Tn in control experiments. At pH 7.0 the assay buffer was 30 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 4.5 mmMgCl2, 0.15 mm NaN3, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. At pH 6.5 the [KCl] was reduced to 26 mm. The protein molar ratios for A:S1 assays were 6:1, for TM:A:S1 assays were 1:6:1, and for Tn:TM:A:S1 assays were 2:1:6:1. Final [A] was 7.5 μm in all assays. The order of addition to each assay tube was pH 7.0 or 6.5 assay buffer, S1, A, TM, varying amounts of 2 mmCa2+ in pH 7.0 or 6.5 assay buffer, and Tn. Reaction at 25 °C was initiated by final addition of 12.5 μl of 20 mm ATP in pH 7.0 or 6.5 assay buffer to a final total volume of 200 μl. Final free [Ca2+] was computed with an in-house program and expressed as pCa = −log[Ca2+]. Reactions were terminated, and inorganic phosphate was determined by the method of Heinonen and Lahti (25Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Initially as controls we compared human cardiac and chicken fast skeletal Tns reconstituted from their respective isolated recombinant components. In all experiments the two Cys residues on each of cTnI and fsTnI had been previously mutated to Ser. These are designated “WT.” In addition, the two Cys residues in cTnC were also mutated to Ser. These changes have previously been shown not to alter ATPase activities or Ca2+ sensitivity in reconstituted Tn·TM actomyosin S1 ATPase assays (26Putkey J.A. Dotson D.G. Mouawad P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kluwe L. Maeda K. Maeda Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and in our experiments had increased assay reproducibility. A comparison of Ca2+ sensitivities of the cardiac and skeletal Tns at pH 7.0 and 6.5 is shown in Fig. 2. In agreement with previous reports the skeletal “WT” reconstituted system showed only a small decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity (ΔpCa0.5 = 0.08) (Table I) when pH was lowered to 6.5. This can be considered as an adaptation to anaerobic metabolism as in vigorous exercise. The Ca2+ sensitivity of the cardiac “WT” system, however, was very significantly decreased from a pCa0.5 of 5.89 to 5.40.Table IParameters of Ca2+-regulated troponin-tropomyosin actomyosin S1 ATPase reconstituted with cardiac or skeletal “WT” or mutated TnI at pH 7.0 and 6.5TnIpHATPase Activity (% of A·S1)aA·S1 ATPase activities in various preparations of F-actin varied from 0.70 to 0.94 s−1at pH 7.0 and from 0.62 to 0.85 s−1 at pH 6.5 with the A·S1 ratio (6:1) and buffer conditions used.

Open table in a new tab To test the effects of the β motif charge differences between the cardiac and skeletal TnIs (see Fig. 1) we first mutated all three residues in human cTnI to the corresponding residues in the β motif of fsTnI to produce cTnI(Q155R/A162H/E164V). Following reconstitution with human cardiac TnC and TnT and measurement of ATPase activity as a function of pCa (where pCa = −log[Ca2+]) at pH 7.0 and 6.5 (see Fig.3 A and Table I) it was evident that the mutation of all three residues had markedly decreased the acid sensitivity of the human cardiac Tn. We next examined the effects of mutating only two of the residues to produce cTnI(Q155R/E164V). Similar ATPase assays (Fig. 3 B) at pH 7.0 and 6.5 as a function ofpCa showed that this double mutant had a Ca2+sensitivity virtually identical to cTnC“WT”; i.e. these mutations had no effect on the acid sensitivity of the cardiac system. Since this result clearly indicated the primary importance of the A162H mutation in this phenomenon we next carried out assays on the single mutant cTnI(A162H). In comparison with cTnI“WT” (Fig.4 A and Table I) it was clear that this single mutation had largely eliminated the acid pH sensitivity of the system. Thus while the pCa0.5for the cTnI“WT” was reduced from 5.89 ± 0.05 at pH 7.0 to 5.40 ± 0.06 at pH 6.5, the corresponding values for cTnI(A162H) were 5.89 ± 0.01 and 5.79 ± 0.01, respectively (see TableI). This latter decrease in pCa0.5(ΔpCa0.5 = −0.10) is similar to that observed with the fsTnI“WT” (ΔpCa0.5 = −0.08) as shown in Fig. 2 and Table I.Figure 4Comparison of Ca2+ regulation of cTnI“WT” and cTnI (A162H) (A) and fsTnI“WT” and fsTnI (H130A) (B).

The data show that in contrast to fsTnI“WT,” this single mutation significantly increased the acid pH sensitivity of the Ca2+-regulated complex. Thus the ΔpCa0.5 values in going from pH 7.0 to 6.5 are −0.08 for fsTnI“WT” and −0.31 for fsTnI(H130A). The data clearly indicate an important role for His-130 in the maintenance of Ca2+ sensitivity against the effects of decreased pH in the fast skeletal muscle system. The ATPase data of Table I provide additional insights into the roles of the cardiac and skeletal Tn components and of their TnI mutants. Under +Ca2+ conditions the ATPases of both the cardiac and skeletal “WT” Tn systems showed enzymic activity levels significantly above that of A·S1 alone (taken as 100%). Previous studies (Ref. 28Oliveira D.M. Nakaie C.R. Sousa A.D. Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27513-27519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar and references therein) have shown that this potentiation of activity occurs only with the complete Tn complex and not with TnI·C lacking TnT. The present direct comparison of the cardiac and fast skeletal “WT” Tns under identical experimental conditions shows a large difference in their potentiating effects (∼125 and ∼180%, respectively), an observation to our knowledge not previously reported. The data thus imply distinct functional differences of the two TnTs and their interactions with their respective TnI and TnC isoforms. The data for the effects of the Ala to His and His to Ala TnI mutations on their respective reconstituted Ca2+-activated Tn·TM·A·S1 activities also show major differences. Thus the cTnI(A162H) mutation showed little effect either on the level of inhibition (−Ca2+) or on the potentiating effect (+Ca2+) in comparison with cTnI“WT.” Based on the present data we may conclude that this mutation has a singular effect in blunting the effects of acid pH on the Ca2+ sensitivity of the cardiac system without materially affecting its minimal (−Ca2+) and maximal (+Ca2+) ATPase activities. This is not the case with the fast skeletal system in which the H130A mutation led to virtual elimination of this potentiation effect reducing ATPase activity from ∼180% to levels close to 100%. Thus, the fast skeletal TnI His-130 residue appears to play a critical role, either directly or indirectly, in interactions among the Tn components, not only in conferring resistance to acid pH but also in facilitating significant increases in ATPase levels over those observed with A·S1 alone. The present data are of direct relevance to studies on slow skeletal muscle TnI (ssTnI) (see Refs. 11Westfall M.V. Metzger J.M. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 278-281PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li G.

Physiol. 2001; 536: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and references therein). As the major TnI isoform in fetal and newborn hearts, ssTnI is replaced during development by the adult protein. Consistent with the glucose-dependent metabolism and high lactate levels of fetal/neonatal cardiac tissue (29Makinde A.-O. Kantor P.F. Lopaschuk G.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 188: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), its contractile properties have a resistance to acid pH comparable to that of fast skeletal muscle. Recent evidence has implicated the COOH-terminal region of ssTnI as responsible for this phenomenon (11Westfall M.V. Metzger J.M. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 278-281PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li G.

Res. 2000; 86: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons of the several TnI isoforms (Fig. 1) reveal that as with fsTnI the acid resistance of ssTnI can be attributed to the equivalent His. The acid base properties of the imidazole side chain of His (pK a ∼6.5) are, of course, uniquely suited to the role of His in blunting the effects of decreased pH on the Tn system. As pH is decreased from 7.0, the increased positive charge of His can be postulated to lead to stronger interaction with one or more Glu or Asp side chains in the regulatory N domain of TnC, thereby stabilizing this region. Identification of such acidic residue(s), currently not possible based on present structural information (30Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 31Wang X., Li, M.X. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31124-31133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) of the TnI·C interface, will require further investigation. In conclusion we consider the observations reported here to be of potential relevance to therapeutic treatments of heart disease by gene transfer, stem cell, and cell transplantation approaches. In addition to restoring Ca2+ sensitivity at pH 6.5 to that at pH 7.0, the data indicate that neither maximal ATPase (pCa 4.0) nor inhibition (pCa 7.0) is significantly compromised by this TnI A162H mutation as compared with wild type. This singular property would of course be an important consideration in the development of remedial protocols. Note Added in Proof—A recent communication (Westfall, M., Borton, A. R., Albayya, F. P., Forfa, S., and Metzger, J. M. (2002)Biophys. J. 82,388a) reports that for the slow skeletal isoform of TnI, expressed in adult cardiac myocytes, the mutations H132A and V134E increase the acid pH sensitivity of tension development to levels similar to that observed with cardiac TnI. Since these are equivalent to two of the reverse mutations observed in the present study we predict that only their H132A mutation will be found responsible for the observed effects. We thank G. D. Lopaschuk and M. N. G. James for helpful discussions."

Homologous recombination frequency is generally reduced in priA null cells, suggesting a role of PriA in general homologous recombination (4Kogoma T. Cadwell G.W. Barnard K.G. Asai T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). iSDR, originally identified as a mode of DNA replication induced by various treatments that induce SOS responses in E. coli, persists in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis and depends on RecA, as well as RecB and RecC proteins (9Magee T.R. Kogoma T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Asai T. Sommer S. Bailone A. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3287-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Another mode of SDR, cSDR, is constitutively observed in an rnhAmutant that lacks the major cellular RNase H activity (11Kogoma T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 361-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cSDR also depends on RecA protein, but not on RecB or RecC proteins (12Hong X. Kogoma T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6731-6734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas iSDR does not require transcription, cSDR completely depends on ongoing transcription. It was proposed that iSDR and cSDR are initiated from D-loop and R-loop structures, respectively, on the chromosome (3Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Asai T. Kogoma T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1807-1812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposal, PriA binds to synthetic DNA structures resembling D-loops (15McGlynn P., Al- Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and the φX174-type primosome was shown to be assembled on recombination intermediates of Mu phage DNA replication or on a model D-loop structure (16Jones J.M. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6886-6895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liu J., Xu, L. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tanaka, K. Arai, and H. Masai, unpublished result. It was proposed that PriA preferentially binds to structured DNA containing bent DNA (22Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The primary structure of PriA protein is characterized by the presence of unique zinc finger structures that interrupt the conserved motifs of DEXH-type DNA helicases (23Nurse P. DiGate R.J.

The zinc finger structures are essential for in vitro primosome assembly on n′-pas (26Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4337-4346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as for recombination-dependent DNA replication in vivo(27Masai H. Deneke J. Furui Y. Tanaka T. Arai K. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This motif appears to be involved in interactions with other primosomal proteins (28Liu J. Nurse P. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15656-15661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ATPase/DNA helicase-deficient mutants of PriA protein are fully active for in vitro replication of the φX174-type primosome (29Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6933-6940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas they are only partially active for iSDR and cSDR (27Masai H. Deneke J. Furui Y. Tanaka T. Arai K. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).2 The above two classes of mutants are proficient in binding to D-loop structures, indicating that the structural determinants for DNA binding of PriA are present in regions other than the ATP-binding regions and zinc finger structures (27Masai H. Deneke J. Furui Y. Tanaka T. Arai K. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified a novel conserved motif in the N-terminal region of the PriA protein that is evolutionally conserved in eubacteria and have shown that the isolated segment containing this motif is capable of structure-specific binding. Furthermore, another novel motif as well as the conserved “HARD” motif in the C-terminal DNA helicase domain are also essential for DNA binding of PriA. All the mutants defective in D-loop binding are incapable of supporting recombination-dependent DNA replication and are partially deficient in other cellular functions. On the basis of these results, we discuss a possible mode of recognition of DNA by PriA protein. The E. coli strains used in this study, AQ634 (thyA,priA +) and AQ8851 (thyA,priA1::kan) (3Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), were grown in M9 medium supplemented with required amino acids (50 μg/ml), thymine (20 μg/ml), and glucose (0.4%) at 37 °C, except where indicated otherwise. For selection of antibiotic-resistant cells, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; kanamycin, 50 μg/ml. pRA45 is based on pT7-6 and carries thepriA gene under control of the T7 promoter (24Lee E.H. Masai H. Allen Jr., G.C. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4620-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All point mutants were constructed on pT7-7, a derivative of pT7-6. pHM6050 is an ampicillin-resistant mini-R1 plasmid (30Masai H. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8082-8090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmids were amplified in DH5α in LB medium containing ampicillin. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in TableI. D-loop and bubble substrates were prepared as previously reported (15McGlynn P., Al- Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The end-labeled oligonucleotide number 1 was annealed with oligonucleotides numbers 2 and 3 for D-loop or with oligonucleotide number 2 for bubble by heating and cooling. Complexes were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then radioactive bands were excised and incubated in elution buffer, as described (27Masai H. Deneke J. Furui Y. Tanaka T. Arai K. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). DNA eluted from gel pieces was precipitated with ethanol and used in assays. n′-pas oligonucleotide is a 66-mer derived from the n′-pas sequence of φX174 viral DNA (number 18 in Table I). The end-labeled n′-pasoligonucleotide was purified by G-25 spin column (AmershamBiosciences).Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyNumber of OligonucleotideLengthSequence (5′-3′)Use1 Upper strand61GACGCTGCCGAATTCTACCAGTGCCTTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCCD-loop or bubble2 Lower strand61GGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCGGCTGCTCATCGTAGGTTAGTTGGTAGAATTCGGCAGCGTCD-loop or bubble3 Invading strand41TAAGAGCAAGATGTTCTATAAAAGATGTCCTAGCAAGGCACD-loop4 PriA N (EcoRI-RBS)37GGAATTCGAAGGAGATATACATATGCCCGTTGCCCACConstruction of mutant PriA on mini-R1 plasmid5 PriA C (EcoRI)28GGAATTCTTAACCCTCAATCGGATCAACConstruction of mutant PriA on mini-R1 plasmid6 PriA C (BamHI)29CGGGATCCTTAACCCTCAATCGGATCAACConstruction of mutant PriA on pT7–77 WYY-s36TTGCTGCTAGGGGCGGCAGATGGCGGTCATCATCCGConstruction of WYY8 WYY-as36CGGATGATGACCGCCATCTGCCGCCCCTAGCAGCAAConstruction of WYY9 P101L-s24TTTCATGCCTTGCTGATTTTACTAConstruction of P101L10 P101L-as24GCGTAGTAAAATCAGCAAGGCATGConstruction of P101L11 HA-LD-s24TGGCGCTATCTTGACCGCGATCTGConstruction of HA-LD12 HA-LD-as24CAGATCGCGGTCAAGATAGCGCCAConstruction of HA-LD13 RREH-A-s74CTCGTATCGACGCCGATACCACCAGCGCCAAAGGGGCGCTGGAACAGCAACTGGCAGCAGTAGCTCGCGGCGGCConstruction of RREH-A14 RRHA-A-as74GCGCCGCCGCGAGCTACTGCTGCCAGTTGCTGTTCCAGCGCCCCTTTGGCGCTGGTGGTATCGGCGTCGATACGConstruction of RREH-A15 5′-224GGCAGCCATATGCCCGTTGCCCACN-terminal polypeptides (1–193 and 1–181)16 3′-133GCAGCCGGATCCTTATTATGGTGTTTCACTTGCN-terminal polypeptide (1–193)17 3′-233GCAGCCGGATCCTTATTAAGAAACGGCATAGTTN-terminal polypeptide (1–181)18 n′-pas66AGGTTATAACGCCGAAGCGGTAAAAATTTTAATTTTTGCCGCTGAGTGGGGTTGACCAAGCGAAGCGCn′-pasoligonucleotide19 PriA-N-SalI35CGGGATCCGTCGACATGCCCGTTGCCCACGTTGCCN-terminal polypeptide for antibody20 PriA-N2-antisense (BamHI-EcoRI)35CGGGATCCGAATTCGGCGGTGGCCTGTTCGGTATTN-terminal polypeptide for antibody Open table in a new tab In gel shift assays, binding reactions (12.5 μl) contained 40 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 40 mm potassium glutamate, 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05 pmol of a labeled substrate (final 4 nm), and various amounts of PriA protein as indicated. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reaction mixtures were directly loaded onto a 6% (29:1) polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE and 10% glycerol. Electrophoresis was run at room temperature at 25 V/cm for 50 min in 0.5× TBE as running buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were dried onto filter paper under vacuum and were exposed to a Fuji BAS imaging plate (Fuji Photo Film). To quantify the level of DNA binding, radioactivity in the free, uncomplexed substrate and that in the shifted forms (including that present at the origin of the gel) was quantified for each lane, and the ratio of the value in the latter fraction to the total radioactivity was calculated. For filter binding assays, the DNA binding reactions, assembled and incubated as described above, were mixed with 100 μl of the same binding buffer (lacking substrate and protein) and spotted under gentle suction onto a nitrocellulose filter (HAWP, Millipore), which had been pretreated with the binding buffer. The filters were washed with the binding buffer (1 ml, 2 times) and radioactivity trapped on each filter was measured by scintillation counting. ATPase activities were measured in reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) containing 40 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol, 40 mm potassium glutamate, 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm ATP with 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and 1 mm dithiothreitol in the presence or absence of 0.05 pmol of effector DNA oligonucleotide (final 4 nm), which is a 66-mer n′-pas oligonucleotide or a synthetic D-loop. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, an aliquot of reaction mixture was directly spotted onto a polyethyleneimine paper (POLYGRAM CEL300PEI/UV254, MACHEREY-NAGEL), which was developed with 1 m HCOOH and 0.5 mLiCl. The paper was dried, and exposed to a Fuji BAS imaging plate. Radioactivity was quantified to calculate the ratio of free phosphate to the total amount of ATP. Seventy-five μg of the wild-type PriA protein was digested by trypsin at a concentration of 1:1 (w/w) at 0 °C for 4 h. Reaction was terminated by addition ofN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone to 50 μg/ml and further incubated for 1 h. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto Superdex 200 gel filtration columns and proteins were fractionated by using the SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). Each fraction was directly used for gel shift assays or SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or Western blotting analysis. Mutagenesis was conducted by the Kunkel method (31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis or amplification of truncated DNA segments are listed in Table I. After PCR, amplified fragments were inserted into NdeI-EcoRI orNdeI-BamHI sites in pT7-7 and the expected base substitutions were confirmed. Wild-type and mutant PriA proteins were purified from BL21(DE3) harboring pRA45 or pT7-7-mutant priAconstructs. Cells were grown in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin toA 600 0.5, at which isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and were kept incubated for an additional 3 h. The harvested cells, resuspended in buffer A (40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 40 mm potassium glutamate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol), were lysed with sonication and the supernatant was saved after centrifugation. Proteins were precipitated by adding 0.28 g of solid ammonium sulfate per ml of each soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. The dialyzed protein fraction was applied to a heparin-agarose column by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and the peak fractions that eluted around 0.5m KCl were saved and used for assays. PriA N-terminal regions amplified with PCR using primer sets, PriA5′-1 (number 15 in Table I) and PriA3′-1 (number 16) or PriA5′-1 (number 15) and PriA3′-2 (number 17), were cloned into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen), resulting in His-PriA-(1–193) or His-PriA-(1–181), respectively. Expression was induced by addition of 0.7 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 29 °C for 5 h or overnight. Lysates, prepared as described above in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 300 mm KCl, were mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 1 h and were loaded onto an open column. The resin was washed with buffers containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm KCl, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride without imidazole or with 20 mm imidazole. Histidine-tagged polypeptides were eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Eluted His-tagged polypeptide, after concentration and buffer exchange using Centricon YM-10 (MWCO 10,000, Millipore), was treated with thrombin (1/100, w/w) in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 80 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm CaCl2at room temperature for 1 or 2 days. Benzamidin-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the digested polypeptide and filtrated to remove thrombin. The N-terminal polypeptide without the His tag was applied onto SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted around 300–400 mm KCl. Purified fractions were saved and used in assays. Overexpression and purification of the N-terminal mutant polypeptides were conducted as described for the wild-type histidine-tagged polypeptide. Mutant His-tagged polypeptides were directly used in assays, because the presence of the His tag did not affect binding activities. For cloning of priA gene onto a mini-R1 plasmid, the coding frame of the wild-type or mutant priA genes on pRA45 or pT7-7 was amplified by PCR with the PriA-N (EcoRI-RBS) (number 4) and PriA-C (EcoRI) (number 5; hybridizing with a sequence on the vector), digested with EcoRI and inserted at the EcoRI site of pHM6050 (30Masai H. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8082-8090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PriA-N (EcoRI-RBS) primer contains a ribosome-binding site in front of the initiation codon and is expected to facilitate expression of PriA on a read-through transcript from the vector. A polyclonal antibody specific to the PriA N-terminal polypeptide-(1–207) was prepared in rabbit. An expression vector (pT7-7/pQE30) was constructed by substituting the multiple cloning sites of pT7-7 with aNdeI-ClaI fragment from that of pQE30 (Qiagen) carrying the His6 sequence. The PriA N-terminal region amplified from pRA45 by PCR using the primer sets, PriA-N-SalI (number 19) and PriA N2-antisense (BamHI-EcoRI) (number 20), was digested byBamHI and inserted at the BamHI site of pT7-7/pQE30. Overexpression was conducted by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h to the culture and cleared lysate was fractionated on a heparin-agarose column by the fast protein liquid chromatography system. For further purification, a dialyzed peak fraction was applied to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Eluted polypeptide was used as antigen for antibody generation. E. coli cells grown to A 600 1.0 were harvested and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Aliquots of each sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore), which was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with the antiserum (1/1000 dilution in TBST) at room temperature for 3 h or at 4 °C overnight. The membrane, washed with TBST 3 times for 5 min each, was incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, 1/20000 dilution in TBST) for 30 min at room temperature and washed with TBST 3 to 4 times. The immunoreactive bands were detected with the Lumi-lightplus Western blotting substrate kit (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) and exposure to x-ray films (Kodak). iSDR was measured as described previously (3Masai H. Asai T. Kubota Y. Arai K. Kogoma T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5338-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Magee T.R. Kogoma T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Torrey T.A. Kogoma T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells, grown in M9 medium at 37 °C overnight, were diluted to A 600 0.5 and were transferred to M9 medium without thymine. After incubation for 3 h, cell densities were measured, and [3H]thymine (4 μCi/ml), chloramphenicol (150 μg/ml), and rifampicin (200 μg/ml) were added. One-hundred μl of the culture, withdrawn at regular intervals, was added to 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and acid-insoluble DNA was trapped onto glass fiber filters (GF/C, Whatman). Radioactivity on the filters was counted using a liquid scintillation counter and was corrected by the cell densities at the time of addition of [3H]thymine. E. coli cells were serially diluted and plated onto M9 plates. Plates were exposed to UV light at the doses indicated in the figure. After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, numbers of growing colonies on each plate were counted. One-hundred ng of each plasmid DNA was transformed by electroporation into AQ634 or AQ8851 electrocompetent cells, which were plated onto M9-ampicillin plates. The numbers of growing colonies were counted after incubation at 37 °C for 48 h. PriA protein was originally identified as a protein essential for conversion of φX174 single stranded to replicative form in vitro and was shown to bind specifically to n′-pas, a stem-loop structure (33Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6794-6798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was later shown that PriA protein binds to structured DNAs including a D-loop-like structure (15McGlynn P., Al- Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). PriA binds efficiently to a D-loop mimic containing a forked structure with an arrested nascent DNA (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–6), but binds much less efficiently to a bubble containing a fork without a hybridizing strand, as was previously shown (Fig. 1 A,lanes 7–12) (22Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PriA generated specific protein-DNA complexes on the D-loop in gel shift assays, whereas it generated smeared bands on bubble only at higher concentrations of PriA. The affinity of PriA to D-loop was nearly 1 order of magnitude higher than that to bubble, as estimated from the concentration of PriA protein required for half-maximum binding to each substrate (∼10 and 90 nm, respectively; Fig. 1 B). To examine the presence of a domain(s) of PriA capable of binding to DNA, we conducted a limited tryptic digestion of the full-length PriA protein. The tryptic digests of PriA protein were separated by size fractionation on Superdex 200 and each fraction was analyzed by gel shift assays to detect polypeptides capable of binding to D-loop. D-loop binding was detected in fractions 16–19 at a molecular weight of ∼100,000 (Fig. 2). Examination of the polypeptides in each fraction by SDS-PAGE revealed comigration of two closely migrating polypeptides of about 12 kDa in size with the binding activity. Western blotting with the antibody against the N-terminal 207-amino acid polypeptide of the PriA protein showed that these fragments are strongly reactive with this antibody, indicating that they contain an N-terminal region of PriA protein. This result suggests a possibility that the N-terminal region contains a D-loop-binding domain. We then constructed deletion derivatives of PriA containing N-terminal polypeptides (Fig. 3 A), and examined their ability to bind to D-loop-like structures in vitro. On comparison of various PriA-related polypeptides, we have noted that the helicase domain starts from the residue 194. On the other hand, the prediction of secondary structure suggested the absence of helix or sheet structures after residue 182. Therefore, we have prepared two N-terminal polypeptides of PriA, one containing residues 1–181 and the other 1–193. Both 181- and 193-amino acid polypeptides were capable of binding to the D-loop (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7–26). However, the affinity to D-loop of the N-terminal polypeptides was more than 20-fold reduced compared with the full-length PriA protein (concentration required for half-maximum binding of the 1–193 and full-length being ∼200 and 8 nm, respectively; Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, both 181- and 193-amino acid polypeptides bound to a bubble structure with affinity only slightly lower than that to D-loop (Fig. 3 C), in contrast to the full-length protein that exhibited high affinity binding specifically to D-loop DNA, suggesting that the C-terminal segment may contribute to the affinity and specificity of PriA binding to DNA. These results show the presence of a DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal 181 amino acids, consistent with the results of tryptic digestion. All the members of PriA-like proteins from various eubacteria contain N-terminal segments of ∼200 amino acids long outside of the helicase-conserved motifs, and alignment of these amino acid sequences revealed the presence of conserved amino acid residues (Fig.4 A). This motif appears to be unique to the PriA protein family. We have introduced amino acid substitutions at the conserved residues of this motif to assess whether it contributes to DNA binding activity of PriA protein. To facilitate purification of recombinant proteins, we have added a histidine tag at the N terminus of the N-terminal 193-amino acid polypeptide. The histidine-tagged protein bound to D-loop with efficiency similar to that of the nontagged polypeptide (Fig.4 B, lanes 1–14). A WYY mutant, in which the three conserved residues (Trp-83, Tyr-87, and Tyr-88) were replaced with glycine, bound to D-loop with reduced affinity. The affinity of the P101L mutant to D-loop was also reduced. The concentrations required for half-maximum binding of the wild-type, WYY, and P101L His-PriA-(1–193) polypeptides were ∼100, 200, and 300 nm (Fig. 4 C). More notably, formation of distinct mobility shifted complexes on the gel at lower protein concentrations was significantly disrupted with the mutant proteins, and the complexes appeared as a smear, migrating faster than those generated with the wild type at the same concentrations (comparelanes 15, 16, and 22,23 with 8, 9 in Fig. 4 B), suggesting the instability of the mutant-D-loop complexes in the polyacrylamide gel. The result of the filter binding assays are also consistent with reduced affinity of the mutant polypeptides to DNA (Fig. 4 D). Although the isolated N-terminal segment of PriA can bind to D-loop-like structures, its binding efficiency is lower than the full-length PriA by more than 1 order of magnitude, and the binding specificity also compromises in that it binds to both D-loop and bubble with"
https://openalex.org/W2011162658,"Mammalian TBP consists of a 180 amino acid core that is common to all eukaryotes, fused to a vertebrate-specific N-terminal domain. We generated mice having a modified tbp allele, tbp(DeltaN), that produces a version of TBP lacking 111 of the 135 vertebrate-specific amino acids. Most tbp(DeltaN/DeltaN) fetuses (>90%) died in midgestation from an apparent defect in the placenta. tbp(DeltaN/DeltaN) fetuses could be rescued by supplying them with a wild-type tetraploid placenta. Mutants also could be rescued by rearing them in immunocompromised mothers. In immune-competent mothers, survival of tbp(DeltaN/DeltaN) fetuses increased when fetal/placental beta2m expression was genetically disrupted. These results suggest that the TBP N terminus functions in transcriptional regulation of a placental beta2m-dependent process that favors maternal immunotolerance of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2035314982,"Transcription initiation as catalyzed by T7 RNA polymerase consists primarily of promoter binding, strand separation, nucleotide binding, and synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond. The promoter strand separation process occurs at a very fast rate, but promoter opening is incomplete in the absence of the initiating NTPs. In this paper, we investigate how initiating NTPs affect the kinetics and thermodynamics of open complex formation. Transient state kinetic studies show that the open complex, EDo, is formed via an intermediate EDc, and the conversion of EDc toEDo occurs with an unfavorable equilibrium constant. In the presence of the initiating NTP that base-pairs with the template at position +2, the process of open complex formation is nearly complete. Our studies reveal that the nucleotide that drives open complex formation needs to be a triphosphate and to be correctly base-paired with the template. These results indicate that the melted template DNA in the open complex is positioned to bind the +2 NTP. The addition of +1 NTP alone does not stabilize the open complex; nor is it required for +2 NTP binding. However, there appears to be cooperativity in initiating NTP binding in that the binding of +2 NTP facilitates +1 NTP binding. The dissection of the initiation pathway provides insights into how open complex formation steps that are sensitive to the promoter sequence upstream from the initiation start site modulate the affinity of initiating NTPs and allow transcription initiation to be regulated by initiating NTP concentration."

https://openalex.org/W2060001698,"Rat C6 glioma cells were used as a model system to study the biosynthesis, intracellular targeting, and degradation of the EAAC1 transporter, a sodium-dependent glutamate/aspartate transport protein that encodes System X−A,G activity. At steady state, nearly 70% of the EAAC1 transporter was located at the cell surface. The newly synthesized EAAC1 protein was co-translationallyN-glycosylated with high mannose oligosaccharide chains that were processed into complex-type sugar chains as the protein matured. The final maturation steps for EAAC1 protein coincided with its plasma membrane arrival, which was first detected at about 45 min after the initial synthesis. The newly synthesized EAAC1 protein was protected from degradation during the maturation and targeting process, as well as during the first 5 h after plasma membrane arrival. After this initial lag period, both the newly synthesized transporter and the total cellular EAAC1 pool were degraded by first order kinetics with a half-life of 6 h.

Rat EAAC1 cDNA encodes an integral membrane protein of 523 amino acids with a predicated nonglycosylated core molecular mass of 56.8 kDa (10Velaz-Faircloth M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C67-C75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is N-glycosylated under normal conditions (11Dowd L.A. Coyle A.J. Rothstein J.D. Pritchett D.B. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 465-473PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that GLAST, GLT1, and EAAC1 form homo-multimers, even when detected using immunoblotting under reducing conditions (12Haugeto O. Ullensvang K. Levy L.M. Chaudhry F.A. Honore T. Nielsen M. Lehre K.P. Danbolt N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27715-27722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). On analysis with denaturing gels, the mature monomers of these transporters each runs as a broad band between 66 and 74 kDa, which is likely due to the microheterogeneity of theirN-glycosylation sites and possibly other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (11Dowd L.A. Coyle A.J. Rothstein J.D. Pritchett D.B. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 465-473PubMed Google Scholar). Among the members of the glutamate/aspartate transporter family, the EAAC1 transporter appears to be the most ubiquitously expressed. Although quite abundant in brain, a significant level of expression of this transporter can also be detected outside the nervous system in small intestine, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, lung, liver (9Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar, 10Velaz-Faircloth M. Am. J.

J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C603-C614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is postulated that the EAAC1 transporter may play a role in keeping the neuronal intracellular glutamate at high levels for use as a precursor for γ-aminobutyric acid synthesis or for other metabolic reactions in the brain (14Kanai Y. Bhide P.G. Difiglia M. Hediger M.A. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, consistent with its ubiquitous expression among different tissues, EAAC1 transporter functions as a primary mechanism to provide glutamate and aspartate for general metabolism and other intracellular functions. Rat C6 glioma cells exhibit several biochemical features of normal glial cells, such as expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (15Bissell M.G. Rubinstein L.J. Bignami A. Herman M.M. Brain Res. 1974; 82: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These cells express a high level of System X−A,G transport activity (16Deas J. Erecinska M. Brain Res. 1989; 483: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although there are reports that GLT1 is expressed in C6 cells (17Casado M. Bendahan A. Francisco Z. Niels D.C. Carmen A. Gimenez C. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27313-27317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most evidence indicates that C6 glioma cells express EAAC1 but not GLAST, GLT1, or EAAT4 (11Dowd L.A. Coyle A.J. Rothstein J.D. Pritchett D.B. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 465-473PubMed Google Scholar, 18Palos T.P. Ramachandran B. Boado R. Howard B.D. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the distribution, regulation, and mechanism of anionic amino acid transporters has been extensively studied, much less is known about their biosynthesis and intracellular trafficking. It has been shown that the surface expression of EAAC1 can be rapidly up-regulated by both protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways (19Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rosthein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 5228-5327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting the redistribution of EAAC1 from an intracellular compartment. Furthermore, Lin et al. (21Lin C.I. Orlov I. Ruggerio A.M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lee A. Jackson M. Rothstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have made the interesting observation that EAAC1 activity can be modulated through protein-protein interactions with GTRAP3–18. For the studies described here, C6 glioma cells were used as a model system to study the biosynthesis, intracellular targeting, and degradation of EAAC1. The results reveal that the EAAC1 protein is N-glycosylated in a co-translational manner. Synthesis and trafficking to the plasma membrane required a minimum of 45 min, and there was a lag of about 5 h prior to degradation of transporters on the cell surface. With regard to turnover, the plasma membrane resident EAAC1 was endocytosed and then degraded with a half-life of about 6 h. Interestingly, the newly synthesized plasma membrane-associated transporter population was degraded at the same rate as the total pool of EAAC1, suggesting that both surface and intracellular EAAC1 proteins have similar half-life values. The results obtained provide the basis for studying the role of EAAC1 transporter synthesis and degradation during disease states. C6 glioma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL107) and maintained in supplemented Eagle's medium (MEM)1 containing 10% FBS as a monolayer culture under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air (37 °C) for a maximum of eight passages. The cultured cells were transferred to 24-well cluster dishes for whole cell transport assays or to 100–150-mm culture dishes for metabolic labeling, cell surface biotinylation, and total cellular protein or membrane protein collection. Amino acid uptake by C6 glioma cells was measured using the cluster tray method (22Kilberg M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 564-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One hundred thousand C6 cells were placed into each well of a 24-well tray and cultured for 24 h. To partially deplete the intracellular pool of amino acids and thus minimize trans-effects on transport and remove extracellular Na+, the cells were incubated at 37 °C twice for 15 min each in sodium-free Krebs-Ringers phosphate buffer (choline-KRP). To initiate transport, [3H]aspartate in 250 μl of either NaKRP (sodium-containing Krebs-Ringers phosphate buffer) or choline-KRP (37 °C) was added simultaneously to each of the 24 wells in the cluster tray for 1 min. The transport measurement was terminated by discarding the radioactivity and rapidly washing the cells five times with 2 ml of ice-cold choline-KRP. The Na+-dependent transport is taken as the difference between uptake in NaKRP and choline-KRP. The data are expressed as pmol·mg−1 protein·min−1 and are presented as the averages of four assays on at least two different batches of cultured cells. Gel electrophoresis was performed in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels following the protocol originally described by Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: C1-C24Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The protein samples were diluted with an equal volume of sample dilution buffer (SDB) consisting of 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% β-mecaptoethanol, 30 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 0.125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6–6.8. The amount of protein loaded per lane will be stated in each figure legend. For immunoblotting, the fractionated proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membrane in 4 °C transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-base, 190 mm glycine, 20% methanol) at 299 mA and constant current for 20 h. After the transfer, the blot was stained briefly in Fast Green stain (0.1% Fast Green, 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid) and destained (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid) to check for the efficiency of transfer and the evenness of loading. The blots were blocked in TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% Carnation nonfat dry milk for 2 h at or overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation on an orbital shaker. The blots then were incubated in the same blocking solution containing a rabbit polyclonal anti-EAAC1 (rat) antibody (1:2000 dilution of serum) for 2 h at room temperature in test tubes with constant rotation. After extensively washing in TBS-T with 1% nonfat dry milk, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase). The blots were extensively washed with TBS-T with 1% nonfat dry milk before being visualized with SuperSignal Chemiluminescence detection reagents (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Light emissions from the blots were captured on Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences), and the band intensity was quantitated in the linear range of the film on a Visage Bioscan video densitometer. The preparation and characterization of the rabbit anti-EAAC1 polyclonal antibody against a rat EAAC1-maltose-binding protein fusion protein as antigen has been described previously (13Matthews J.C. Beveridge M.J. Malandro M.S. Rothstein J.D. Campbell-Thompson M. Verlander J.W. Kilberg M.S. Novak D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C603-C614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the de novo biosynthesis and the intracellular targeting of the EAAC1 transporter protein in C6 cells, pulse-chase labeling withl-[35S]methionine-cysteine (ProMix; AmershamBiosciences) was used. After placing 9 × 106 cells onto each 100-mm culture dish or 2.3 × 107 cells onto each 150-mm dish, the cell monolayers were cultured for 24 h to permit growth to near confluence. The cells were washed once with sterile 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and incubated with 15 ml/58-cm2 surface area of methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) for 2 × 15 min at 37 °C to deplete the intracellular pool of free methionine and cysteine. The depletion medium then was aspirated, and the cells were incubated with 200 μCi/ml of [35S]Met-Cys in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 15–30 min (see each figure legend). The cells were washed twice at 37 °C with MEM containing 5 mmeach of nonradioactive methionine and cysteine (chasing medium) and then transferred to fresh chasing medium and incubated for 0–60 h (see each figure legend) followed by immunoprecipitation of the EAAC1 protein. For experiments in which the chase period was longer than 24 h, 1% FBS was added to the medium. Immunoprecipitation of the EAAC1 transporter protein was performed following the procedure outlined by Harlow and Lane (24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) with modifications. After pulse-chase labeling with l-[35S]Met-Cys, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with SEB buffer (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and then frozen in 2.5 ml of SEB buffer containing proteinase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotonin, pepstatin,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, andN-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) at −80 °C. For analysis, the cells were thawed on ice, and another 2.5 ml of ice-cold hypotonic EB buffer (2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) was added. The cells were scraped from the plates and homogenized on ice with 15 passes through a prechilled steel block cell homogenizer with a clearance of 0.0025 inches (Auburn Tool & Dye, Warwick, RI). The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 280,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to collect a total membrane pellet, which was then extracted in PES buffer (2% C12E9, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for 1 h on ice with constant stirring. After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was recovered, and the protein concentration was determined by a modified Lowry method (24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) or the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce protein assay kit). An equal amount of starting protein (100–500 μg) from each sample was transferred into microcentrifuge tubes, brought to a volume of 500 μl with PES buffer, and used for the immunoprecipitation assay. To minimize nonspecific interaction between labeled membrane proteins and the immunoglobulins, an unrelated nonimmune rabbit serum IgG (5 μg) and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% suspension in PES buffer) were added to the extracts and incubated (“precleared”) for 3 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. The samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 s to collect the protein A-Sepharose-IgG complexes, and this precleared supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube. EAAC1 antibody (5 μg of IgG) was added to the precleared extract and incubated at 4 °C overnight with constant mixing. A 50-μl aliquot of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads was then added and incubated for 2 h to collect the immunoprecipitates. The pellets were washed with PES extraction buffer (3 × 1 min) and with PES containing 0.35 mNaCl (for a total salt concentration of 0.5 m) (4 × 10 min) at 4 °C with constant mixing. A series of salt washes were tested, and the data showed that binding between the antibody and the EAAC1 protein can withstand salt washing up to 1 m NaCl but that 0.5 m salt is sufficient to eliminate all of the nonspecific binding (data not shown). The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads with the gel electrophoresis SDB containing 6 m urea and 10% β-mercaptoethanol for 20 min at 37 °C and separated by SDS-PAGE. For fluorography, the gels were fixed at room temperature in 10% trichloroacetic acid, 40% methanol for 30 min, soaked in water for 30 min, and then incubated in 1 m sodium salicylate for 1 h before drying at 65 °C under vacuum. The dried gels were exposed to autoradiographic film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen, and the band intensity was quantitated in the linear range of the film on a Visage Bioscan video densitometer. A 5 μg of anti-EAAC1 antibody (purified total IgG from the immune rabbit serum) was shown to be sufficient to precipitate all of the EAAC1 protein from 500 μg starting material by immunoblotting EAAC1 protein in the immunoprecipitation supernatant (data not shown). Also, preliminary experiments showed that the amount of EAAC1 protein immunoprecipitated by 5 μg of anti-EAAC1 antibody was proportional to the amount of starting protein from 0–500 μg (data not shown). To test for the endoglycosidase H (Endo H) sensitivity of the newly synthesized EAAC1, C6 cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]Met-Cys and chased with medium containing 5 mm each of unlabeled methionine and cysteine for 30–240 min, as described above. At the end of each chase period, EAAC1 was immunoprecipitated and then eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads with 10 μl of 5× denaturing solution containing 2.5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol in water for 30 min at 37 °C. After dilution to 1× denaturing solution with 40 μl of water, each of the eluates was collected and then divided into two microcentrifuge tubes. A 110 volume of 500 mmsodium citrate, pH 5.5, and 500–1000 units (1–2 μl) of Endo H (BioLabs Inc.) was added to each of the tubes. For the control tube, 1–2 μl of enzyme storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm Na2EDTA) was added, instead of the enzyme. All of the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDB buffer before the samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel for separation and autoradiographic detection. To determine the N-linked glycosylation of both the newly synthesized forms of the EAAC1 transporter protein, protein endoglycosidase F (PNGase F) digestions were performed. Total C6 cellular membrane protein was collected from the cells, with or without pulse-chase labeling and then solubilized with PES buffer, and EAAC1 protein was immunoprecipitated. The precipitates were eluted with 10 μl of 5× denaturing solution (2.5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 37 °C and then diluted to 1× denaturing solution with water, as described above for the Endo H digestions. For each PNGase F digestion, 110 volume each of 10% Nonidet P-40 and a buffer consisting of 10% Nonidet P-40, 500 μm sodium citrate, pH 7.5, as well as 500–1000 units of PNGase F (BioLabs Inc.) were added. For the controls, the enzyme was replaced with equal volume of enzyme storage buffer. All of the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and then mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDB buffer before they were loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel for separation and autoradiographic detection. To determine the half-life of the cell surface EAAC1 protein, C6 glioma cells were washed twice with NaKRP buffer (119 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KHCO3, 5.6 mm glucose, 25 mmNa2HPO4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, pH 7.5) and incubated with 0.5–1 mg/ml of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in NaKRP for 30 min to 1 h at 4 °C. The specific conditions for each experiment are given in the figure legends. The biotin-containing buffer was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed twice with fresh MEM containing 50 mmglycine and then incubated in fresh MEM and 1% FBS at 37 °C for specific chase times ranging from 0 to 24 h at 37 °C. At the end of each chase period, the cells were washed once with ice-cold NaKRP, washed once with ice-cold SEB containing protease inhibitors (as above), and then frozen in 2 ml of SEB containing protease inhibitors at −80 °C. The percentage of the biotinylation for EAAC1 was 69%, compared with a value of less than 2% for the intracellular proteins, asparagine synthetase (cytoplasmic) and GRP78 (endoplasmic reticulum) (data not shown). To determine the transit time of newly synthesized EAAC1 transporter proteins to the plasma membrane, C6 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met-Cys for 15–30 min and chased in medium containing 5 mm each of nonradiolabeled methionine and cysteine for 0–36 h. At the end of each chase time, these metabolically labeled C6 cells were washed twice with NaKRP and then cell surface-biotinylated with 0.5–1 mg/ml of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in NaKRP at 15 °C for 30–60 min. After aspirating the biotinylation solution, the cells were rinsed once in NaKRP and then incubated with NaKRP containing 50 mm glycine for 2 × 15 min at 15 °C to quench the remaining free biotin. The cells were washed once with ice-cold SEB containing protease inhibitors and frozen at −80 °C until all of the samples were collected. The surface-biotinylated C6 cells were thawed on ice and homogenized with a steel block homogenizer, and the total cellular membrane proteins were collected and solubilized with PES buffer, as described above. Equal amounts of solubilized proteins were then subjected to two successive precipitations. For the immunoprecipitation of total EAAC1 protein, the protein samples were precleared with nonimmune rabbit IgG and then immunoprecipitated with anti-EAAC1 antibody, as described above. The precipitated EAAC1 protein was eluted from the beads with 1 ml of 0.1m glycine, pH 2.8, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 s to remove the beads, the eluate was removed and neutralized with 50 μl of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. For the selective precipitation of the biotinylated EAAC1 molecules, 25 μl of packed monomeric avidin-beads was washed twice with 1 ml of PES buffer and then preincubated for 2 h with nonbiotinylated total C6 cellular membrane protein to block the nonspecific binding sites on the beads. Then the immunoprecipitated EAAC1 protein collected above was added to the pretreated monomeric avidin-beads and incubated for 18 h with constant mixing at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, the beads were washed extensively with 1 ml of PES supplemented with 350 mm NaCl for 40 min at 4 °C with a total of six changes of buffer. The doubly precipitated proteins were eluted from the beads with 2× SDB containing 2 mm free d-biotin and separated by gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography, as described above. To demonstrate the plasma membrane localization of EAAC1 transporter in C6 cells, the accessibility of EAAC1 protein from the extracellular space was tested by cell surface biotinylation using a membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin reagent. After biotinylation, total C6 cellular membrane proteins were collected, and the biotinylated proteins were isolated using avidin precipitation and then separated by gel electrophoresis. The biotinylated EAAC1 protein was then detected using immunoblotting with anti-EAAC1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a large portion of the EAAC1 protein was readily biotinylated, demonstrating that much of the total amount of the transporter resides at the cell surface. By monitoring the percentage of total cellular EAAC1 protein that could be biotinylated, it was established that ∼70% of EAAC1 protein was labeled by the cell surface reaction (Fig. 1 B). On contrast, less than 2% of asparagine synthetase (cytoplasm) or glucose-regulated protein 78 (endoplasmic reticulum) were biotinylated. As an example of another plasma membrane protein, 89% of the NaK-ATPase was biotinylated (Fig. 1 B). These data document that a majority of EAAC1 transporter protein is localized at the plasma membrane but that an intracellular pool of transporter also exists. The deduced amino acid sequence for the rat EAAC1 transporter contains four putativeN-glycosylation consensus sequences, and three of these predicted N-glycosylation sites are localized within the second extracellular loop (10Velaz-Faircloth M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C67-C75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that the EAAC1 transporter is N-glycosylated and that its glycosylation pattern may vary in different host cell lines (11Dowd L.A. Coyle A.J. Rothstein J.D. Pritchett D.B. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 465-473PubMed Google Scholar). To test for theN-glycosylation of EAAC1 protein in C6 cells, PNGase F digestion was used to cleave between the first GlcNAc residue and the asparagine residue (25Maley F. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Without PNGase F digestion, EAAC1 monomer and oligomer bands were detected after immunoprecipitation of solubilized total membrane proteins with anti-EAAC1 antibody (Fig. 1 C). Prior to enzyme treatment, the EAAC1 bands were broad, likely because of the microheterogeneity of the glycosylation or other post-translational modifications. However, a relatively sharp 57-kDa band (EAAC1 core) and, to a lesser extent, a 114-kDa band (possibly a core dimer) were detected after incubation of the immunoprecipitated EAAC1 protein with PNGase F for 15 min or more. The deglycosylated monomer band appears to represent less protein, but this apparent discrepancy may be due to the sharpness of the deglycosylated band relative to the broader smear that the glycosylated monomer for presents. These results are consistent with the data by Dowd et al. (11Dowd L.A. Coyle A.J. Rothstein J.D. Pritchett D.B. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 465-473PubMed Google Scholar) and show that deglycosylation of the EAAC1 dimer does not reverse its oligomerization. To determine the biosynthesis rate of EAAC1 protein in C6 glioma cells, the cells were metabolically labeled with 200 μCi/ml of [35S]Met-Cys for 15–120 min and then chased for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 2 A, even a 15-min pulse labeling time is sufficient to detect newly synthesized EAAC1, and all three forms (monomer, dimer, and oligomer) of EAAC1 appear to be proportional to each other, regardless of the pulse time length. These results suggest that the oligomerization is not a late step in the maturation process for the EAAC1 protein. Interestingly, the biosynthesis rate of EAAC1 was decreased when a higher number of cells were plated, indicating that EAAC1 biosynthesis is down-regulated by increased cell density (Fig. 2 B). This observation is consistent with preliminary experiments showing that the total EAAC1 protein content was reduced as cells became more confluent (data not shown). Therefore, in all remaining experiments a fixed number of cells were plated (900,000/100-mm dish) and then cultured for an exact period of time (24 h) prior to labeling. To study the maturation process of EAAC1, C6 glioma cells were pulse-labeled with 500 μCi/ml of [35S]Met-Cys for 15 min and then chased for 0–120 min. When chased for less than 30 min, only the low molecular mass (57 kDa), immature form of EAAC1 was detected primarily (Fig. 3), but after longer chase periods, the 57-kDa form of EAAC1 matured into the 73-kDa protein. The maturation of EAAC1 protein started after 45 min of chase time and finished after 190 min. The data in Fig. 3 show that oligomeric forms were detected not only for the mature EAAC1 protein but also for the immature EAAC1 form (e.g. chase time = 0). To address the time required for the newly synthesized EAAC1 protein to be targeted to the plasma membrane, the cells were metabolically labeled with 200 μCi/ml of [35S]Met-Cys for 15 min and chased in medium containing 5 mm each of nonradiolabeled Met and Cys for 0–360 min at 37 °C (Fig.4). The pulse time was short (15 min), and an increased amo"
https://openalex.org/W2314821113,"We examined the effect of a constitutively active Raf protein (Raf-CAAX) on the differentiation and the coincident apoptosis of skeletal myoblasts. We found that a low level of Raf signaling leads to accelerated differentiation when compared to parental myoblasts, while a higher level of Raf signaling induces a transformed morphology and abrogates both differentiation and the coincident apoptosis. Raf signaling abrogates apoptosis without blocking the activation of caspase 3 and the subsequent cleavage of caspase 3 substrates. Eliminating the signal from Raf through MEK does not restore the ability to differentiate or to undergo apoptosis in the myoblasts with a high level of Raf signal, nor does it abrogate the accelerated differentiation observed in myoblasts with lower levels of Raf signal. Constitutive signaling through MEK is required, however, to maintain a transformed morphology. These results indicate that the effect of Raf on the differentiation and apoptosis of skeletal myoblasts is dictated by the level of Raf signaling, and that Raf signaling sufficient to abrogate the apoptosis coincident with differentiation does so downstream of caspase 3 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2329582032,"Replication of DNA containing 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8oxoG) can generate 8oxoG/A base pairs which, if uncorrected, lead to G→T transversions. It is generally accepted that the repair of these promutagenic base pairs in human cells is initiated by the MutY DNA glycosylase homolog (hMYH). Here we provide biochemical evidence that human cell extracts perform base excision repair (BER) on both DNA strands of an 8oxoG/A mismatch. At early repair times the specificity of nucleotide incorporation indicates a preferential insertion of C opposite 8oxoG leading to the formation of 8oxoG/C pairs. This is followed by repair synthesis on the opposite DNA strand that is consistent with hOGG1-mediated correction of 8oxoG/C to G/C. Repair synthesis on either strand is completely inhibited by aphidicolin suggesting that a replicative DNA polymerase is involved in the gap filling. This is the first demonstration that repair of 8oxoG/A base pairs is by two BER events likely mediated by Polδ/ε. We suggest that the Polδ/ε-mediated BER is the general mode of repair when BER lesions are formed at replication forks."
https://openalex.org/W2322155775,"Spectrins play a pivotal role in axonal transport, neurite extension, the organization of synaptic vesicles, as well as for protein sorting in the Golgi apparatus and cell membrane. Among spectrins there is great variability in sequence composition, tissue distribution, and function, with two known genes encoding the α-chain, and at least five encoding the β-chain. It remains unclear as to whether novel β-spectrins such as elf1-4are distinct genes or β-G-spectrin isoforms. The role for ELF in the developing nervous system has not been identified to date. In this study we demonstrate the genomic structure of elf-3, as well as the expression of ELF in the developing mouse brain using a peptide specific antibody against its distinctive amino-terminal end. Full genomic structural analyses reveal that elf-3is composed of 31 exons spanning ∼67˜kb, and confirm that elfand mouse brain β-G-spectrin share multiple exons, with a complex form of exon/intron usage. In embryonic stages, E9–12, anti-ELF localized to the primary brain vesicular cells that also labeled strongly with anti-nestin but not anti-vimentin. At E12–14, anti-ELF localized to axonal sprouts in the developing neuroblasts of cortex and purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, as well as in cell bodies in the diencephalon and metencephalon. Double labeling identified significant co-localization of anti-ELF, nestin and dystrophin in sub ventricular zone cells and in stellate-like cells of the developing forebrain. These studies define clearly the expression of ELF, a new isoform of β-G-spectrin in the developing brain. Based on its expression pattern, ELF may have a role in neural stem cell development and is a marker of axonal sprouting in mid stages of embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1983881946,"Vascular endothelial growth factor is a specific endothelial cell mitogen that is essential for the formation of the vascular system but in the adult individual is involved in several pathological conditions, including cancer. It is a homodimeric protein that activates its receptor by binding two receptor molecules and inducing dimerization. By mixing two vascular endothelial growth factor monomers, each with different substitutions, heterodimers with only one active receptor binding site have previously been prepared. These heterodimers bind the receptor molecule but are unable to induce dimerization and activation. However, preparation of heterodimers is cumbersome, involving separate expression of different monomers, refolding the mixture, and separating heterodimers from homodimers. Here we show that a fully functional ligand can efficiently be expressed as a single protein chain containing two monomers. Single-chain vascular endothelial growth factor is functionally equivalent to the wild-type protein. By monomer-specific mutagenesis, one receptor binding site was altered. This variant competitively and specifically antagonizes the mitogenic effect of the wild-type protein on endothelial cells. The results obtained with the single-chain antagonist show the feasibility of the single-chain approach in directing alterations to single specific regions in natural homodimeric proteins that would be impossible to target in other ways."

Most Hsp100 proteins are composed of five domains that include two nucleotide-binding domains required for their ATP-dependent oligomerization. Mutations within the first but not the second nucleotide-binding site disrupt self-assembly of bacterial Hsp100, whereas the reverse is true for yeast Hsp104. We have examined the functional requirements for oligomerization of plant Hsp101 and have found that Hsp101 resembles Hsp104 in that it assembles into a hexameric complex in an ATP-dependent manner. Self-assembly of Hsp101 involves at least three distinct interaction domains located in the N-proximal domain and in the first and second nucleotide-binding domains. The interaction domain in the second nucleotide-binding domain included the Walker A motif, and mutations within this element disrupted self-assembly of Hsp101. In contrast, mutations affecting conserved residues of the Walker A motif within the first nucleotide-binding site did not affect self-assembly. No interaction between Hsp101 and Hsp104 was observed.

Hsps are functionally similar to the extent that they act upon cellular proteins through protein-protein interactions. In addition to their extensive interaction with cellular proteins, interactions between classes of Hsps and the self-assembly of Hsps into complexes have been reported for several classes (reviewed in Refs. 1Becker J.

Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Little else is known about the requirements for self-assembly of either Hsp104 or ClpB. The difference in the requirement of the first or second nucleotide-binding domains of bacterial ClpB and yeast Hsp104 for their oligomerization is surprising given their conservation of protein organization and that they share 58% similarity. Plant Hsp101 shares 60% similarity with Hsp104 and is 64% similar toE. coli ClpB. As with all class I members, Hsp101 contains five domains, of which the two nucleotide-binding domains and the middle domain exhibit the greatest degree of conservation among plant, yeast, and bacterial orthologs. Expression of Hsp101 is induced by heat and is developmentally regulated (44Young T.E. Ling J. Geisler-Lee J. Tanguay R.L. Caldwell C. Gallie D.R. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 777-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although Hsp101 is required to confer thermotolerance in plants as well as in thermosensitive yeast (36Hong S.W.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 777-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), little is known about its structure/functional requirements and whether they would be similar to those of Hsp104 or to those of ClpB. In this study, we demonstrate that Hsp101 forms hexamers in an ATP-dependent process. Mutations of the C-proximal nucleotide-binding site that are known to inhibit ATP-binding reduced self-assembly, whereas the analogous mutations to the N-proximal nucleotide-binding site did not affect self-association. Three interaction domains were identified, one of which mapped to the second nucleotide-binding site. Mutation of the P-loop within this ATP-binding site inhibited self-interaction of the full-length protein but not the interaction of the isolated domain, suggesting that ATP binding regulates self-assembly through global changes in protein conformation. Despite the conservation between Hsp101 and Hsp104, no interaction between these proteins was detected, suggesting that the interaction domains have diverged sufficiently to prevent cross-species interaction or that Hsp104 utilizes entirely different domains for its self-assembly. Our findings indicate that self-assembly of Hsp101 requires multiple domains whose interaction is regulated by a functional C-proximal nucleotide-binding site. The tobacco Hsp101 was introduced into the BamHI/NotI sites of pGal under the control of the GAL1 promoter or into theBamHI site of pTPI under the control of the triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) promoter as described previously (41Wells D.R. Tanguay R.L., Le, H. Gallie D.R. Genes Devel. 1998; 12: 3236-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The cDNA was also introduced into the BamHI site of pLexA, pGAD424, and pACT2. The Hsp101 cDNA was introduced into the BamHI site of pET19b for expression of recombinant His-tagged protein. Hsp101 deletion constructs were made by PCR amplification of the appropriate region using oligonucleotides that included restriction sites for introduction into the two-hybrid or yeast expression vectors. The fragments were sequenced to ensure that they were in frame with the activation or deletion domains of the two-hybrid vectors. Point mutations of each ATP-binding site were made by designing oligonucleotides corresponding to an ATP-binding site that altered a specific amino acid. The GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system was used as described by the manufacturer (Promega Corp.) to incorporate the mutation into the Hsp101 sequence. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The fragment containing each mutant ATP-binding site was then used to replace the wild-type sequence in the full-length tobacco Hsp101 cDNA by using unique restriction sites. The single and double point mutants in the yeast vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of recombinant His-tagged Hsp101 from pET19b was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight in 375 ml of E. coli strain BL21 in LB medium. The harvested cells were washed with binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl) at 4 °C and resuspended in 4 ml of binding buffer supplemented with lysozyme (1 mg/ml), proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were sonicated for 2 min in a dry ice/EtOH bath, and the cell debris was pelleted for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein from the supernatant was allowed to bind to 700 μl of Talon metal affinity resin (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) with gentle shaking for 20 min at 4 °C. The collected resin was washed three times with binding buffer, and the protein was eluted with 300 μl and then 150 μl of elution buffer (1 m imidazole, 500 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) for 15 min each at 4 °C. The eluant was then run over a 750-μl Sephadex G50 column to remove the imidazole. 100 μl of the protein was incubated in oligomerization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 15 min at room temperature and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. 100 μl of 1 m glycine was added to quench the cross-linking, and the protein was precipitated at −20 °C with 1.3 ml of acetone and 5% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol, resolubilized in SDS running buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and resolved on a 3.5% acrylamide gel. The gel was fixed overnight in 40% ethanol and 7% acetic acid, and the protein bands were revealed by silver staining. Constructs were introduced into SL304A (leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-1 ade2-1 his3-11,15 lys2Δcan1-100 hsp104::LEU2) (40Schirmer E.C. Lindquist S. Vierling E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1899-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), a Δhsp104 yeast mutant (generously provided by Dr. Susan Lindquist, University of Chicago), using polyethylene glycol/LiCl as described (45Gietz D., St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar, 46Hill J. Donald K.A. Griffiths D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and grown in synthetic dextrose medium containing the appropriate supplements. The yeast were diluted to the indicated O.D., and complementation of Hsp104 function was determined in a thermotolerance assay in which survival of the yeast at 51 °C was measured (42Parsell D.A. Sanchez Y. Stitzel J.D. Lindquist S. Nature. 1991; 353: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 38Sanchez Y. Lindquist S. Science. 1990; 248: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Anti-Hsp101 antiserum raised against wheat Hsp101 was described previously (47Tanguay R.L. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14316-14322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For Western analysis, a membrane containing the protein of interest was blocked for 30 min in TPBS (0.1% Tween 20, 13.7 mm NaCl, 0.27 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.14 mmKH2PO4) with 5% reconstituted dry milk and incubated with anti-Hsp101 antiserum (from 1:500 to 1:2000) in TPBS with 1% milk for 1.5 h. The blots were then washed with TPBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Southern Biotechnology) diluted 1:20,000 for 1 h, and Hsp101 was detected using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast extracts were prepared by boiling 6 × 106 cells in 2× SDS loading buffer, the protein was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and Hsp101 was measured by Western analysis as described above. Yeast strain L40 was transformed simultaneously with a HIS+ pLexA (DB fusion) construct and a LEU+ pGAD424 or pACT2 (AD fusion) construct.LacZ reporter gene activity was monitored visually by the X-gal filter assay (48Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) and was quantified by measuring β-galactosidase activity in mid-log phase liquid cultures as described (49Clark K.L. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate. For the filter assay, yeast on supporting Whatman filters were cracked open by immersing the filters in liquid nitrogen twice. The filters were placed on a second Whatman filter soaked in Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, pH 7.0) with 38 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.33 mg/ml X-gal and incubated at room temperature. For the quantitative assays, mid-log phase cells grown in SD medium lacking leucine and histidine were harvested and resuspended in buffer 1 (10 mm HEPES, 15 mm NaCl, 0.45 mmaspartate, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20), cracked open by immersing the tubes in liquid nitrogen three times, and the reaction was initiated with the addition of 2.23 mmchlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside in buffer 1. Following color development, 3 mm ZnCl2 was added to stop the reaction. The samples were centrifuged prior to determining the absorbency at 578 nm. A unit of β-galactosidase activity is defined as the amount that hydrolyzes 1 mmol of chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside/min/cell. To examine whether plant Hsp101 is similar to yeast Hsp104 in assembling into hexameric complexes, N-terminal histidine-tagged tobacco Hsp101 expressed in E. coli was purified using affinity chromatography. Assembly of Hsp104 into hexameric complexes was demonstrated previously using SDS-PAGE of protein cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (21Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the same approach, purified Hsp101 was cross-linked in solution with glutaraldehyde and resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel, and the complexes were detected by silver staining. Self-assembly up to a hexamer complex was observed over a range of cross-linking times (Fig.1 A) and concentrations of glutaraldehyde (Fig. 1 B). The molecular mass of the Hsp101 hexameric complex determined from this analysis was 671 kDa, which is within 7.5% of the predicted molecular mass of the complex based on the cDNA-derived monomer mass of 104 kDa and is within 2.5% of the predicted molecular mass of the complex based on an apparent monomer molecular mass of 109 kDa. Hsp101 self-assembly was ATP-dependent as the monomer form predominated in the absence of ATP (Fig. 1 C). Self-assembly also required Mg2+ (Fig. 1 D, lane 1). Yeast Hsp104 is a hexamer in the presence of ATP but is a monomer or dimer in the absence of ATP (21Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, ADP, like ATP, can stabilize the hexameric form of Hsp104 (21Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although ClpB assembles into an ATP-dependent hexamer and remains a monomer without ATP like Hsp104 (50Zolkiewski M. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Maurizi M.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), full oligomerization of ClpB is inhibited by ADP (50Zolkiewski M. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Maurizi M.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast to the bacterial ortholog, ADP supported at least partial hexamerization of Hsp101 (Fig.1 D, lane 2), data suggesting that Hsp101 is more similar to Hsp104 than it is to ClpB in that it can form a hexamer in a Mg2+-ATP or ADP-dependent manner. To determine whether Hsp101 self-assembly required ATP in vivo and, if so, to identify which nucleotide-binding site is required, we examined oligomerization of Hsp101 using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Like all Hsp100 family members, Hsp101 has two domains that contain a Walker A motif (i.e. GX 2GXGKT, whereX is any amino acid) (11Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). These two ATP-binding domains are separated by a middle domain, the length of which is characteristic of the class I family (12Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Mutations within the first but not the second Walker A motif of ClpA or ClpB affected their oligomerization (19Kim K.I. Cheong G.W. Park S.C., Ha, J.S. Woo K.M. Choi S.J. Chung C.H. J. Mol.
