https://openalex.org/W2080757497,A proportion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responding to infection by influenza recognize target cells that express the viral nucleoprotein. Recent work showed that CTL can recognize short overlapping regions of large nucleoprotein fragments expressed in transfected L cells. This led to the suggestion that CTL recognize segmental epitopes of denatured or degraded proteins in a similar way to helper T cells. One corollary of this idea is that CTL should recognize appropriate short peptides on the target cell surface. We demonstrate that the epitopes of nucleoprotein recognized by CTL in association with class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex in both mouse and man can be defined with short synthetic peptides derived from the nucleoprotein sequence.

This factor has the ability to induce differentiation of a murine myelomonocytic leukemia cell line WEHI-3B(D+) and cells from patients with newly diagnosed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). A complementary DNA copy of the gene encoding a pluripotent human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant form of hG-CSF is capable of supporting neutrophil proliferation in a CFU-GM assay. In addition, recombinant hG-CSF can support early erythroid colonies and mixed colony formation. Competitive binding studies done with 125I-labeled hG-CSF and cell samples from two patients with newly diagnosed human leukemias as well as WEHI-3B(D+) cells showed that one of the human leukemias (ANLL, classified as M4) and the WEHI-3B(D+) cells have receptors for hG-CSF. Furthermore, the murine WEHI-3B(D+) cells and human leukemic cells classified as M2, M3, and M4 were induced by recombinant hG-CSF to undergo terminal differentiation to macrophages and granulocytes. The secreted form of the protein produced by the bladder carcinoma cell line 5637 was found to be O-glycosylated and to have a molecular weight of 19,600."
https://openalex.org/W2078157295,"A systematic search for sequences that potentially could form metal-binding domains in proteins has been performed. Five classes of proteins involved in nucleic acid binding or gene regulation were found to contain such sequences. These observations suggest numerous experiments aimed at determining whether metal-binding domains are present in these proteins and, if present, what roles such domains play in the processes of nucleic acid binding and gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2012330153,"Adhesive interactions of the platelet surface with plasma proteins such as fibrinogen and fibronectin play an important role in thrombosis and hemostasis. The binding of both of these proteins to platelets is inhibited by synthetic peptides containing the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp, which corresponds to the cell adhesion site in fibronectin and is also present in the alpha chain of fibrinogen. An affinity matrix made of an insolubilized heptapeptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence selectively binds the platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa from detergent extracts of platelets. When incorporated into liposome membranes, the isolated protein confers to the liposomes the ability to bind to surfaces coated with fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vitronectin but not to surfaces coated with thrombospondin or albumin. This platelet receptor is related to the previously identified fibronectin and vitronectin receptors in that it recognizes an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence but differs from the other receptors in its wider specificity toward various adhesive proteins. These results establish the existence of a family of adhesion receptors that recognize the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp."
https://openalex.org/W2045489285,"Base sequence information can be stored in the local structure of right-handed double-helical DNA (B-DNA). The question arises as to whether a set of rules for the three-dimensional readout of the B-DNA helix can be developed. This would allow the design of synthetic molecules that bind DNA of any specific sequence and site size. There are four stages of development for each new synthetic sequence-specific DNA-binding molecule: design, synthesis, testing for sequence specificity, and reevaluation of the design. This approach has produced bis(distamycin)fumaramide, a synthetic, crescent-shaped oligopeptide that binds nine contiguous adenine-thymine base pairs in the minor groove of double-helical DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2001201602,"The modulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by hormones and neurotransmitters has important implications for the control of many Ca2+-dependent cellular functions including exocytosis and contractility. We made use of electrophysiological techniques, including whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones, to demonstrate a role for GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) as signal transducers in the noradrenaline- and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels. This action of the transmitters was blocked by: (1) preincubation of the cells with pertussis toxin (a bacterial exotoxin catalysing ADP-ribosylation of G-proteins); or (2) intracellular administration of guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP-beta-S), a non-hydrolysable analogue of GDP that competitively inhibits the binding of GTP to G-proteins. Our findings provide the first direct demonstration of the G-protein-mediated inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels by neurotransmitters. This mode of transmitter action may explain the ability of noradrenaline and GABA to presynaptically inhibit Ca2+-dependent neurosecretion from DRG sensory neurones."
https://openalex.org/W2033217413,"The trans-activator gene (tat-III) of the human T lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III/LAV) is shown to regulate positively the expression of viral proteins. Viruses in which the tat-III gene is deleted are incapable of prolific replication and do not demonstrate cytopathic effects in T4+ cell lines. These defects can be fully complemented in cell lines that constitutively express the tat-III gene product. We conclude that the tat-III gene product is required for efficient replication of HTLV-III in T4+ cells, and for that reason is important for the cytopathic effects of virus infection. These observations predict that inhibitors of the tat-III gene product may constitute effective therapeutic agents."

https://openalex.org/W2030577752,"The Rous sarcoma virus oncogene product, pp60v-src, transforms cultured fibroblasts but its corresponding proto-oncogene product, pp60c-src, does not. Both proteins are known to be protein-tyrosine kinases. Published results suggest that the kinase activity of pp60c-src is inhibited relative to that of pp60v-src, due perhaps to phosphorylation of a tyrosine in pp60c-src that is not phosphorylated in pp60v-src. In this study, it was observed that the tyrosine phosphorylated in pp60c-src is Tyr527, six residues from the COOH-terminus of the protein. The region of pp60c-src from residue 515 to the COOH-terminus, including Tyr527, has been replaced with a different sequence in pp60v-src. Thus, the increase in transforming ability and kinase activity that occurred in the genesis of pp60v-src may have resulted from the loss of a tyrosine involved in negative regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2112638355,"The transcripts of most eukaryotic genes contain intervening sequences and must be spliced to yield functional messenger RNA. We report that a brief severe heat shock blocks the processing of intervening sequences in Drosophila cells and that this block persists for at least 2 hr after cells are returned to normal temperatures. If a mild heat shock, which induces the synthesis of heat shock proteins, is administered prior to the severe heat shock, processing occurs under otherwise restrictive conditions. When heat shock protein synthesis is inhibited, this protection is not observed. We suggest that the disruption of intron processing contributes to heat-induced lethality and developmental abnormalities and that one function of the heat shock proteins is to protect processing from heat-induced disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2151687078,"We studied transcription during the first 14 mitotic cycles of Drosophila development, by gel electrophoresis of RNA pulse-labeled in vivo. Synthesis of rRNA, tRNAs, 5S RNAs, snRNAs, poly(A)+ RNAs, and histone mRNAs is first detectable during cycle 11 or 12. Histone genes are transcribed during S phases, and reach maximal activation in cycle 12, whereas nonhistone genes are transcribed only in G2 periods, and reach maximal activation during late cycle 14. The high transcriptional activity characteristic of cycle 14 can be precociously induced by extending interphase with cycloheximide as early as, but not before, cycle 10. We conclude that all classes of genes become competent for activation during cycle 10, and that subsequent activation is differentially suppressed by functions associated with nuclear division."
https://openalex.org/W2084192026,"The genetic structure of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), a D-type retrovirus, has been determined. In addition to the viral gag, pol, and env genes is an ORF overlapping both gag and pol and that encodes the viral protease. Surprisingly, the MPMV env protein is highly homologous to that of the avian C-type virus, reticuloendotheliosis associated virus REV-A. The env sequence encodes an immunosuppressive peptide, which suggests that MPMV, like REV-A, may transiently induce a T-suppressor cell population. The different phylogenies of the MPMV pol and env genes indicate a recombinatorial origin for the D-type viruses. Sequence comparisons show that SRV-1, an MPMV-like virus etiologically linked to simian AIDS (SAIDS), is in fact a variant of MPMV. While MPMV-like viruses cannot be used as direct models for the AIDS/SAIDS associated with lentiviruses, they provide an important system for studying the molecular basis of immunosuppressive diseases in primates."
https://openalex.org/W2166182249,"The human excision repair gene ERCC-1 was cloned after DNA mediated gene transfer to the CHO mutant 43-3B, which is sensitive to ultraviolet light and mitomycin-C. We describe the cloning and sequence analysis of the ERCC-1 cDNA and partial characterization of the gene. ERCC-1 has a size of 15 kb and is located on human chromosome 19. The ERCC-1 precursor RNA is subject to alternative splicing of an internal 72 bp coding exon. Only the cDNA of the larger 1.1 kb transcript, encoding a protein of 297 amino acids, was able to confer resistance to ultraviolet light and mitomycin-C on 43-3B cells. Significant amino acid sequence homology was found between the ERCC-1 gene product and the yeast excision repair protein RAD10. The most homologous region displayed structural homology with DNA binding domains of various polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2133522044,"A cytolytic pore-forming protein (PFP, perforin) was purified from isolated granules of cloned NK-like cytolytic cells, which showed an apparent Mr of 70–75 kd (reduced) and 62–66 kd (nonreduced). Cytolysis produced by this protein occurred only in the presence of Ca2+ and was accompanied by the formation of membrane lesions of 160 Å diameter. The purified protein depolarized cells and made lipid vesicles leaky to monovalent and divalent ions. This protein formed large, voltage insensitive and nonselective ion channels in planar bilayers that remained preferentially in the open state. The channels were heterogeneous in size distribution averaging 400 pS/U in 0.1 M NaCl. The membrane lesions formed by PFP were morphologically and functionally similar to those formed by intact NK-like cells and their granules. This PFP could be released from granules during cell killing, followed by its polymerization on target membranes to form large transmembrane pores."
https://openalex.org/W2066943324,"In multidrug resistance, which is observed clinically and in tissue culture, cells that are challenged with certain cytotoxic drugs develop resistance not only to the selective agent but also to other, seemingly unrelated, agents. The multidrug-resistant phenotype is associated with DNA sequence amplification and with the overproduction of a number of cytosolic and membrane glycoproteins. The differential amplification and altered expression of at least two related genes, termed multidrug-resistant associated genes has been shown in multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster cells. In multidrug-resistant mouse and human cells, genes homologous to those in Chinese hamster cells are also amplified. The level of expression of these genes varied and did not correlate with their copy number. Furthermore, in Chinese hamster cells, the development of resistance to a single drug and multidrug resistance were closely related, but uncoupled, events. The overexpression of the multidrug-resistant genes was better correlated with the degree of resistance to the selective agent than it was with the extent of multidrug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1993377322,"The gag-pol gene of HTLV-III (human T-lymphotropic virus), the virus linked to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), was expressed in yeast, and processing of the gag precursor into proteins of the same size as those in the virion was observed. Processing of the gag gene in yeast cells mimics the process that naturally occurs in mammalian cells during maturation of virions. Therefore it was possible to perform mutational analysis of the virus genome to localize the gene that codes for the protease function to the amino terminal coding region of the pol gene. Since this region overlaps the gag gene, it is likely that ribosomal frameshifting occurs from gag to pol. Antibodies in all of the AIDS patients' sera tested recognized the yeast synthesized gag proteins, although the sera showed differences in relative reactivity to the individual gag proteins and the precursor. This yeast system should be valuable not only for production of viral proteins for diagnostic or vaccine purposes but also for analysis of the genetics and biochemistry of viral gene functions—parameters that are difficult to study otherwise with this virus."

https://openalex.org/W1978245541,"Polyadenylated RNA isolated from senescent human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) inhibited DNA synthesis in proliferation-competent cells after microinjection, whereas polyadenylated RNA from young HDF had no inhibitory effect. Polyadenylated RNA from young cells made quiescent by removal of serum growth factors had a slight inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis. The abundance level of inhibitor messenger RNA (mRNA) from senescent cells was estimated at 0.8 and that of quiescent cells at 0.005 percent. These results demonstrate the existence of one or more antiproliferative mRNA's in nonproliferating normal human cells; these RNA's code for factors that either work antagonistically to initiators of DNA synthesis or regulate the expression of the initiators in some way. The abundance level of the inhibitory mRNA in senescent cells indicates the feasibility of developing a complementary DNA probe that will be useful in studying cell cycle control mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2137393873,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binds to the extracellular domain of a specific 170,000-dalton transmembrane glycoprotein; this results in rapid removal of both ligand and receptor from the cell surface. In WB cells, a rat hepatic epithelial cell line, ligand-directed receptor internalization leads to receptor degradation. We tested whether the EGF receptor was replenished at a constitutive or enhanced rate following EGF binding by immunoprecipitating biosynthetically labeled EGF receptor from cells cultured with [35S]methionine. EGF stimulated receptor synthesis within 2 h in a dose-dependent manner; this was particularly evident when examining the nascent form of the receptor. To determine the site of EGF action, total WB cell RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose paper after electrophoresis and was hybridized to cDNA probes from both the external and cytoplasmic coding regions of the human EGF receptor. EGF increased receptor mRNA by 3-5-fold. Therefore, at least in some cells, the surface action of EGF that leads to EGF receptor degradation is counterbalanced by a positive effect on receptor synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1583574874,"The V1 nuclease from cobra venom preferentially hydrolyzes double helical RNA and has been used extensively for detecting RNA secondary structure. To increase the utility of this enzyme as an RNA structure probe, we have investigated its properties and substrate specificity, using assays for polynucleotide hydrolysis based on fluorescent polynucleotide derivatives. Enzymatic activity requires both Na+ and Mg2+, with optima at 100 and 0.3 mM, respectively. From the sharp decrease in enzyme activity above 100 mM Na+ we estimate that 3-4 ionic interactions between the protein and polynucleotide phosphates take place. Analysis of products remaining after extensive V1 digestion also shows that the minimum size substrate is 4-6 nucleotides long. Helical RNAs and DNAs have Michaelis constants a factor of 3-10 times lower than most single-stranded RNAs. However, poly(epsilon A) has a Michaelis constant equal to the best synthetic double helices tested and is hydrolyzed at a rate comparable to helical RNA. The major V1 cutting sites in yeast tRNAPhe have Michaelis constants lower than any synthetic polymers. These data suggest that V1 nuclease recognizes any 4-6-nucleotide segment of polynucleotide backbone with an approximately helical conformation, but does not require that the bases be paired in a helix. A few single-stranded V1 cleavage sites are known in tRNA and rRNA, and their structures are consistent with the suggested V1 recognition site."
https://openalex.org/W1538369254,"An important component of the decrease in protein synthesis in muscle of diabetic animals is a fall in the ribosome content. Therefore, we have investigated the turnover of ribosomes in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver of rats during the onset of diabetes. Synthesis rates were measured by incorporation of label into the protein moieties of the ribosomes, and a dual isotope technique was used to relate ribosome synthesis to that of total tissue protein. Degradation rates were calculated as the difference between the rates of synthesis and accumulation. The loss of ribosomes from gastrocnemius muscle and heart took place mainly between the 2nd and 4th days of insulin deficiency and was brought about largely by a very pronounced increase in the degradation rate, though synthesis also fell by a substantial amount. Rates of total tissue protein synthesis decreased markedly, but the degradation rates were only slightly elevated, if at all. Thus, the effect of diabetes on muscle ribosome breakdown was quite distinct from that on degradation of total tissue protein. In liver the response of protein synthesis to diabetes was much less pronounced than in muscle, and ribosome synthesis was not affected."

https://openalex.org/W1966353533,"Electrophysiological recordings were used to analyze single calcium channels in planar lipid bilayers after membranes from bovine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles had been incorporated into the bilayer. In these cell-free conditions, channels in the bilayer showed unitary barium or calcium conductances, gating kinetics, and pharmacological responses that were similar to dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels in intact cells. The open channel current varied in a nonlinear manner with voltage under asymmetric (that is, physiological) ionic conditions. However, with identical solutions on both sides of the bilayer, the current-voltage relation was linear. In matched experiments, calcium channels from skeletal muscle T-tubules differed significantly from cardiac calcium channels in their conductance properties and gating kinetics."

https://openalex.org/W1603930781,"The pathway for synthesis of three glycosphingolipids bearing a common sialyl-Lex determinant (NeuAc alpha 2—-3Gal beta 1—-4[Fuc alpha 1—-3]GlcNac beta 1—-R) from their type 2 lactoseries precursors has been studied using the 0.2% Triton X-100-soluble fraction from human lung carcinoma PC9 cells. Two enzymes were found to be required for their synthesis: (i) an alpha 1—-3 fucosyltransferase, the properties of which have been characterized as being similar to the enzyme from human small cell lung carcinoma NCI-H69 cells (Holmes, E. H., Ostrander, G. K., and Hakomori, S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7619-7627); and (ii) an alpha 2—-3 sialyltransferase that was efficiently solubilized by 0.2% Triton X-100 and required divalent metal ions and 0.3% Triton CF-54 for optimal activity at pH 5.9 in cacodylate buffer. Biosynthesis of the sialyl-Lex determinant was shown to proceed via sialylation of nLc6 and nLc4, followed by alpha 1—-3 fucosylation at the penultimate GlcNAc residues, based on the following: (i) transfer of NeuAc by PC9 cell sialyltransferase was found only when the nonfucosylated acceptors nLc4 and nLc6 were added, and none of the glycolipids with Lex structure (III3FucnLc4; V3FucnLc6; III3V3Fuc2nLc6) were sialylated; and (ii) the PC9 cell fucosyltransferase was active with both neutral and ganglioside neolacto (type 2 chain) acceptors. Transfer of fucose to VI3NeuAcnLc6 yielded mono- and difucosyl derivatives, whereas only a monofucosyl derivative was obtained when VI6NeuAcnLc6 was the acceptor. This is most probably due to different conformations at the terminus of the two acceptor gangliosides. The fucosyltransferase was incapable of transferring fucose to sialyl 2—-3 lactotetraosylceramide (IV3NeuAcLc4)."
https://openalex.org/W1530246162,"To determine the role of 1,2-diacylglycerol (1,2-DAG) and protein kinase C in pancreatic enzyme secretion, we measured the effect of various pancreatic secretagogues on the cellular mass of 1,2-DAG and amylase release in dispersed pancreatic acini from the guinea pig. In addition, we measured the effect of a recently described protein kinase C inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) (Hidaka, H., Inagaki, M., Kawamoto, S., and Sasaki, Y. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5036-5041), on secretagogue-stimulated amylase release from the acini. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-OP), cholecystokinintetrapeptide, and carbachol each increased 1,2-DAG 2-3-fold but the increases occurred only with concentrations of these secretagogues that were supramaximal for amylase release and that had an inhibitory effect on stimulated amylase release. Supramaximal concentrations of bombesin stimulated only a small increase in 1,2-DAG and did not cause inhibition of stimulated amylase release. When the action of carbachol was terminated with atropine or CCK-OP with dibutyryl cyclic GMP, stimulated amylase release ceased immediately but cellular 1,2-DAG required at least 15 min to return to the basal level. Increasing cytosolic free Ca2+ with the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, in Ca2+-containing incubation media augmented amylase release stimulated by 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but inhibited amylase release stimulated by CCK-OP, carbachol, and bombesin without decreasing the cellular content of 1,2-DAG. H-7 inhibited protein kinase C activity in a pancreatic homogenate but augmented amylase release from acini stimulated by either CCK-OP, carbachol, or 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These findings indicate that 1,2-DAG and protein kinase C do not have a stimulatory role in pancreatic stimulus-secretion coupling but may have an inhibitory one."

https://openalex.org/W2044076292,"A combination of genetics, biochemistry, and biophysics was used to show that calmodulin is involved in the regulation of an ion channel. Calmodulin restored the Ca2+-dependent K2+ current in pantophobiac, a mutant in Paramecium that lacks this current. The restoration of the current occurred within 2 hours after the injection of 1 picogram of wild-type calmodulin into the mutant. The current remained for approximately 30 hours before the mutant phenotype returned. The injection of calmodulin isolated from pantophobiac had no effect. These results imply that calmodulin is required for the function or regulation of the Ca2+-dependent K2+ current in Paramecium."
https://openalex.org/W1518588038,"The effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation on sarcolemmal protein phosphorylation and contractile slow responses were studied in intact myocardium. Isolated rat ventricles were perfused via the coronary arteries with 32Pi after which membrane vesicles partially enriched in sarcolemma were isolated from individual hearts. Alterations in the sarcolemmal slow inward Ca2+ current were assessed in the 32P-perfused hearts using a contractile slow response model. In this model, Na+ channels were first inactivated by partial depolarization of the hearts in 25 mM K+ after which alterations in Ca2+ channel activity produced by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic agonists could be assessed as restoration of contractions. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation (phenylephrine + propranolol) of the perfused hearts resulted in increased 32P incorporation into a 15-kDa sarcolemmal protein. This protein co-migrated with the 15-kDa sarcolemmal protein phosphorylated in hearts exposed to beta-adrenergic stimulation produced by isoproterenol. beta-Adrenergic stimulation, but not alpha-adrenergic stimulation, also resulted in phosphorylation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum protein, phospholamban. Phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein in perfused hearts in response to either alpha- or beta-adrenergic stimulation was associated with restoration of contractions, indicative of increases in the slow inward Ca2+ current. Increases in 32P incorporation into the 15-kDa protein preceded restoration of contractions by phenylephrine. Nifedipine abolished the contractile responses to alpha-adrenergic stimulation while having no effect on increases in 15-kDa protein phosphorylation. The effects of alpha-adrenergic stimulation occurred in the absence of increases in cAMP levels. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein may be involved in increases in the slow inward current produced by stimulation of either alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1535507795,"A region of the rat growth hormone gene and 5' flanking DNA has been identified which promotes accurate, thyroid hormone-regulated transcriptional initiation. GC rat pituitary tumor cells were transfected with chimaeric plasmids containing various lengths of rat growth hormone gene and 5' flanking DNA fused to the coding region of the dominant selectable marker gene neo. Thyroid hormone induction of rGH-neo RNA was observed by Northern and dot blot analysis of cells transfected with rGH-neo chimaeric genes sharing the rat growth hormone gene and upstream regions from -235 to +11. Initiation of rGH-neo transcription was mapped by S1 nuclease protection to the in vivo initiation site of the natural growth hormone gene. Transcription of the most deleted thyroid hormone responsive construct involved an induction-attenuation cycle qualitatively similar to the response of the natural gene. However, the 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine responsiveness of this deleted construct was approximately 2- to 3-fold less than that of less deleted rGH-neo genes tested. These results suggest that, at a minimum, the sequences required for the cyclic 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine transcriptional response are located within the region of the gene from -235 to +11. Other sequences essential for full responsiveness appear to be located elsewhere in the 5'-flanking DNA. Rat growth hormone promoter utilization appears to be strongly cell-type dependent. We obtained stable transfectants with rGH-neo constructs only in GC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2101021310,"Evidence is presented that the IIb-IIIa glycoprotein complex, which functions as the receptor for fibrinogen on platelets and is central to platelet aggregation, is expressed on the surface of leukocytes where it may function as a receptor for fibronectin. F(ab′)2 fragments of a monoclonal antibody, 25E11, raised against activated large granular lymphocytes, inhibited killing by natural killer cells, blocked the binding of fibronectin-coated particles by monocytes, and stimulated neutrophils to exhibit increased antibody-dependent killing. Immunoprecipitation studies of leukocytes and platelets, and the ability of 25E11 to inhibit platelet aggregation, identified the antigen as an epitope on the IIb-IIIa complex. This glycoprotein thus constitutes the first example of a receptor mediating both platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1598076772,"The nucleotide sequence of LEU4, a yeast gene encoding alpha-isopropylmalate synthase, has been determined. An open reading frame of 1857 nucleotides specifies a protein of 619 residues whose calculated molecular weight (68,416) and amino acid composition agree well with earlier estimates based on protein data. The 5' flanking region contains three blocks of sequence potentially involved in the general control of amino acid biosynthesis. It also has six blocks of homology in common with the 5' flanking regions of two other LEU structural genes (LEU1 and LEU2). One of these blocks coincides with a palindromic element that has previously been demonstrated to be important for the specific leucine control of LEU2 (Martinez-Arias, A., Yost, H. J., and Casadaban, M. J. (1984) Nature 307, 740-742). Determination of the 5' ends of the LEU4 transcript indicates the existence of four major and several minor potential transcription start sites. Two of the major sites are located downstream from the ATG at the beginning of the long open reading frame. Utilization of these sites would lead to mRNA that could be translated from an in-frame AUG located 90 nucleotides downstream from the first one. The protein thus generated would be 30 amino acid residues shorter than the larger one. This situation might account for the occurrence of two alpha-isopropylmalate synthase-related proteins observed both in cell-free extracts and in in vitro translation mixtures (Hampsey, D. M., Lewin, A. S., and Kohlhaw, G. B. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 1270-1274). The larger of these proteins was incorporated into the mitochondria while the smaller one was not. We conclude that selection of appropriate transcription and translation start sites might control the subcellular localization of the LEU4 gene product. This conclusion is discussed with respect to other examples in yeast of genes that encode two forms of the same protein."
https://openalex.org/W2082458422,"Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis has been used to alter highly conserved sequences within the intervening sequence (IVS) of the Tetrahymena large ribosomal RNA precursor. Mutations within either sequence element 9L or element 2 eliminate splicing activity under standard in vitro splicing conditions. A double mutant with compensatory base changes in elements 9L and 2 has accurate splicing activity restored. Thus, the targeted nucleotides of elements 9L and 2 base-pair with one another in the IVS RNA, and pairing is important for self-splicing. Mutant splicing activities are restored by increased magnesium ion concentrations, supporting the conclusion that the role of the targeted bases in splicing is primarily structural. Based on the temperature dependence, we propose that a conformational switch involving pairing and unpairing of elements 9L and 2 is required for splicing."

Such transformants showed morphological alterations and induced carcinomas when transplanted into nude mice, whereas primary human epidermal keratinocytes treated with these chemical carcinogens failed to show any evidence of transformation. This in vitro system may be useful in assessing environmental carcinogens for human epithelial cells and in detecting new human oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1593079269,"Bromo-eudistomin D induced a contraction of the chemically skinned fibers from skeletal muscle at concentrations of 10 microM or more. This contractile response to bromo-eudistomin D was completely blocked by 10 mM procaine. The extravascular Ca2+ concentrations of the heavy fractions of the fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum (HSR) were measured directly by a Ca2+ electrode to examine the effect of bromo-eudistomin D on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. After the HSR was loaded with Ca2+ by the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump, the addition of 10 microM bromo-eudistomin D caused Ca2+ release that was followed by spontaneous Ca2+ reuptake. In the presence of 2 microM ruthenium red or 4 mM MgCl2, no Ca2+ release was induced by 20 microM bromo-eudistomin D. The rate of 45Ca2+ efflux from HSR, which had been passively preloaded with 45Ca2+, was accelerated 7 times by 10 microM bromo-eudistomin D. The concentration of bromo-eudistomin D for half-maximum effect on the apparent efflux rate was 1.5 microM, while that of caffeine was 0.6 mM. The bromo-eudistomin D-evoked efflux of 45Ca2+ was abolished by 2 microM ruthenium red or 0.5 mM MgCl2. Bromo-eudistomin D was found to be 400 times more potent than caffeine in its Ca2+-releasing action but was similar in its action in other respects. These results indicate that bromo-eudistomin D may induce Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through physiologically relevant Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1493578072,"The mechanism by which estrogen and antiestrogens modulate cytoplasmic thymidine kinase (TK) activity has been studied in MCF-7 cells. Using a cloned cDNA probe for human TK, we have identified a single 1500-nucleotide transcript as the cytoplasmic TK-mRNA in MCF-7 cells. In normally cycling or synchronously growing cells, the level of this mRNA maximally increased 2-3-fold after 24 h of estradiol-17 beta (E2) stimulation and decreased below control level in the presence of antiestrogens. Neither E2 nor antiestrogens altered the size of TK-mRNA. Hormonal regulation of TK-mRNA paralleled changes in TK enzyme activity and [3H]thymidine incorporation. Using endogenous nuclear run-off transcription to investigate the expression of the human TK gene, we demonstrate that TK-mRNA levels were regulated by transcriptional control. Modulation of TK gene activity during the process of estrogen stimulation or antiestrogen inhibition was not accompanied by changes in the methylation pattern at internal sites of the TK gene. These results suggest a transcriptional control of human TK gene by E2 and antiestrogens in MCF-7 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1602041190,"Autoantibodies reactive with specific nuclear and cytoplasmic small RNAs were identified by immunoprecipitation of HeLa cell RNA. Approximately 30% of antisera examined from patients with autoimmune disorders contained anti-RNA antibodies. Two previously undescribed specificities--anti U1 RNA and anti-initiator methionine tRNA--were identified. Anti-RNA antibodies were reactive with gel-purified species as well as with RNA synthesized in vitro using the SP-6 transcription system. Antigenic mapping using two sera specific for the human initiator methionine tRNA revealed separate epitopes, one of which is conserved in formyl-methionine initiator tRNA from Escherichia coli. RNA fragmentation studies further suggested that secondary or tertiary tRNA structure is required for antibody recognition. The mammalian U1 RNA specific antibodies did not precipitate small RNAs of yeast but were highly reactive with yeast ribosomal RNA, thus indicating a possible relationship between these RNA species. Results obtained with these antisera are discussed in terms of higher order structure of small RNA molecules as well as the role of nucleic acid antibodies in the autoimmune phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1542378601,"The T cell lymphoma LSTRA contains an elevated level of a tyrosine protein kinase of molecular weight of 56,000 (pp56Tcell) that is present in normal T lymphocytes. Treatment of 32P-labeled LSTRA cells with the phorbol ester 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA), followed by immunoprecipitation of pp56Tcell, revealed that PMA causes complex changes in the state of phosphorylation of pp56Tcell, and the appearance of several new forms of pp56Tcell with higher apparent molecular weights on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The 32P-labeled pp56Tcell from untreated LSTRA cells contains phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine in a ratio of 2:1. After treatment of LSTRA cells with PMA, the form of pp56Tcell that runs with a molecular weight of 56,000 has approximately equal amounts of phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine, while the higher molecular weight forms of pp56Tcell seen after PMA have 3-4 times more phosphoserine than phosphotyrosine. The induction by PMA of higher molecular weight forms of pp56Tcell could also be demonstrated in preparations of normal human T lymphocytes. The changes in the state of phosphorylation of pp56Tcell after treatment of cells with PMA are consistent with the possibility that pp56Tcell is an in vivo substrate for protein kinase C and provide documentation for a linkage between a mitogenic agent and pp56Tcell."
https://openalex.org/W1604966084,"Polyclonal antiserum and monoclonal antibodies raised against the sodium channel from rat skeletal muscle sarcolemma have been immobilized on Sepharose and used to immunoaffinity purify this channel directly from skeletal muscle without the intervening purification of surface membranes. These antibodies isolate a approximately 260-kDa protein from whole muscle, although each purifies predominantly a 150-kDa component when isolated sarcolemmal membranes are used as starting material. A 45-kDa band is also found in the material purified from sarcolemma but not that obtained from whole muscle. In addition, these immunoaffinity columns isolate a 38-kDa band from both whole muscle and sarcolemma that copurifies with the 260-kDa protein. In some preparations this component appears as two closely spaced bands of 37 and 39 kDa. These small subunits coelute with the 260-kDa subunit when thiocyanate gradients are used to displace protein bound to the immunoaffinity columns and behave as integral components of the sodium channel. Estimates of stoichiometry were made for the large and small subunits of the muscle channel protein. After correction for labeling efficiency, values consistent with a ratio of one 260-kDa subunit to one 38-kDa subunit were obtained. We conclude that the rat skeletal muscle sodium channel contains a large alpha subunit of approximately 260 kDa that is sensitive to proteolytic nicking during the isolation of sarcolemmal membranes. In addition, at least one 38-kDa beta subunit is associated with each alpha subunit in the native channel."
https://openalex.org/W2022688248,"Truncated transcripts of the rnpB gene from E. coli, coding for M1 RNA, the catalytic subunit of RNAase P, and fragments of M1 RNA generated by nuclease treatment have been prepared, and their ability to function catalytically in vitro has been determined. Molecules missing as many as 122 nucleotides at the 3' terminus retain catalytic activity, although at a much lower level than M1 RNA itself. No activity is observed with an RNA that is missing 70 nucleotides at the 5' terminus. The removal of even a small number of nucleotides from both termini eliminates all catalytic function. The preservation of one intact terminus may be essential for the tertiary and quaternary interactions required to generate the conformation of an active RNA species."
https://openalex.org/W2002842607,"Transduction of cellular genes by retroviruses requires two recombinations: one to form the left-hand junction between cellular gene and viral genome, the other to form the right-hand junction. Previous findings raised the possibility that the right-hand recombination might use RNA molecules as intermediates. We now provide direct experimental support for this view by showing that the right-hand end of v-fps in the avian sarcoma virus PRCII was formed by recombination within the poly(A) tract at the 3' end of the mRNA for the proto-oncogene c-fps. Recombination of this sort may be mediated by ""copy-choice"" during reverse transcription, acting on either homologous or non-homologous nucleotide sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1536046092,"Abstract Orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OD-Case) catalyzes the conversion of orotidine 5'-monophosphate to UMP. In mammals, ODCase is present as part of a bifunctional protein which also contains orotate phosphoribosyltransferase; the preceding enzyme in the de novo UMP biosynthetic pathway. We have isolated a plasmid (pMEJ) which contains a cDNA for the ODCase domain of UMP synthase. Insertion of this sequence into an Escherichia coli expression vector (pUC12) has allowed for the expression of ODCase and not orotate phosphoribosyltransferase in E. coli. The molecular weight of the expressed protein is 26,000-27,300 from immunoblot analysis which corresponds closely to the molecular weight of the ODCase domain (28,500) isolated by tryptic digestion of UMP synthase. We have sequenced the cDNA insert of pMEJ and deduced the amino acid sequence. The molecular weight of the ODCase domain calculated from the amino acid sequence in 28,654. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence from pMEJ with that for yeast ODCase (a monofunctional protein) demonstrated that 52% of the amino acids were identical when the two sequences are compared. Furthermore, several stretches of the amino acid sequence have 80% or greater absolute homology."
https://openalex.org/W1507890231,"We have investigated the mechanism by which dexamethasone (DEX) increases alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) secretion by the McA-RH8994 rat hepatoma cell line. In contrast to the 7777 cell line, DEX was found to increase the amount of hybridizable cytoplasmic AFP mRNA in McA-RH8994 cells. This effect was dose-dependent, reversible after removal of DEX, and was partially blocked by progesterone in excess, indicating a receptor-mediated response. In vitro nuclear transcription experiments showed that DEX increased AFP gene transcription in McA-RH8994 cells. Cycloheximide blocked the effect of DEX on AFP mRNA levels in both the McA-RH8994 and 7777 cell lines, showing that ongoing protein synthesis is required for glucocorticoids either to enhance or to suppress AFP gene expression in these cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1508167424,"Two NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase-dependent iron-sulfur proteins were detected in both porcine kidney and bovine adrenal mitochondria by using high resolution polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Adrenodoxin (Mr = 12,000) constituted the major ferredoxin activity in adrenal mitochondria and a similarly sized protein (Mr = 11,500) was isolated as the major renal ferredoxin activity. A second, higher molecular weight ferredoxin was observed in both adrenal (Mr = 13,300) and kidney (Mr = 13,000) mitochondria. The two renal ferredoxins were isolated by the use of ion exchange, gel exclusion, and preparative electrophoretic techniques. An absorption spectrum typical of [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins was obtained for each protein; however, the larger renal molecule had an unusually high 276 nm absorbance. Immunologic studies revealed a significant degree of antigenic commonality between the two renal proteins as well as specific cross-reactivity of adrenodoxin with antiserum raised against the renal proteins. A possible precursor-product relationship between the paired renal and adrenal ferredoxins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1580207622,"We report here the identification of a common immunological determinant in Escherichia coli and Bombyx mori (silkworm) alanine tRNA synthetases. The E. coli protein is a tetramer of identical Mr = 95,000 chains, and the silkworm enzyme is a monomer of Mr = 115,000. Antibodies against the silkworm enzyme react with E. coli Ala-tRNA synthetase. Analysis of 10 fragments of the E. coli enzyme has mapped the cross-reacting epitope to between amino acids 350 and 385. This is within the part of the enzyme which is essential for alanyladenylate synthesis. The anti-B. mori Ala-tRNA synthetase antibodies which cross-react with the E. coli enzyme were affinity-purified. They react specifically with the catalytic domain of the silkworm enzyme and not with the remaining dispensable segment of 500 amino acids. The results support the concept that the core catalytic structural elements, and not the dispensable portions, are the most related among the synthetases."
https://openalex.org/W1567521535,"The widely used phosphodiesterase inhibitor MIX (1-methyl 3-isobutyl xanthine) blocked insulin antagonism of cAMP-stimulated glycogenolysis in rat hepatocytes but other phosphodiesterase inhibitors including Ro 20-1724 had no effect. Dose-response curves for MIX potentiation of cAMP-stimulated glycogenolysis and for MIX inhibition of the effects of insulin on cAMP-stimulated glycogenolysis suggested that at higher concentrations (250 microM) MIX may act at a site other than phosphodiesterase inhibition. MIX, at 250 microM, attenuated the insulin antagonism of glucose release stimulated by 8-bromo-cAMP, an extremely poor substrate for phosphodiesterase; other phosphodiesterase inhibitors did not. The possibility that MIX acts as an adenosine antagonist interfering with a postulated role for adenosine in insulin action was examined using N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA), an Ra adenosine receptor agonist which increases hepatic cAMP levels. MIX inhibited insulin antagonism of PIA-stimulated glycogenolysis under conditions where it did not act as an adenosine antagonist (MIX and Ro 20-1724 both increased the response to PIA equally). The effect of concanavalin A on cAMP-stimulated glycogenolysis was antagonized by MIX, suggesting a post-receptor site of action for MIX. MIX paradoxically increased lactate production in the presence of 8-bromo-cAMP, reminiscent of the reported actions of calcium mobilizing hormones on lactate formation in fed hepatocytes. Cytosolic free Ca2+, as measured in Quin 2-loaded cells, was increased by MIX. In cells depleted of calcium, MIX no longer blocked insulin antagonism of 8-bromo-cAMP-stimulated glucose release, suggesting that MIX may function through an insulin-insensitive release of calcium. MIX greatly potentiated the stimulation of glycogenolysis by phenylephrine but did not alter the response to vasopressin. The relationship of this effect of MIX to the mechanism of insulin action and the ability of insulin to antagonize only alpha-adrenergic responses and not those of vasopressin is discussed."
