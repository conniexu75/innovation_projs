https://openalex.org/W1973186908,"Studies involving the cloning and disruption of the gene for acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) have shown that alternative mechanisms exist for triglyceride synthesis. In this study, we cloned and characterized a second mammalian DGAT, DGAT2, which was identified by its homology to a DGAT in the fungus Mortierella rammaniana. DGAT2 is a member of a gene family that has no homology with DGAT1 and includes several mouse and human homologues that are candidates for additional DGAT genes. The expression of DGAT2 in insect cells stimulated triglyceride synthesis 6-fold in assays with cellular membranes, and DGAT2 activity was dependent on the presence of fatty acyl-CoA and diacylglycerol, indicating that this protein is a DGAT. Activity was not observed for acyl acceptors other than diacylglycerol. DGAT2 activity was inhibited by a high concentration (100 mm) of MgCl2 in anin vitro assay, a characteristic that distinguishes DGAT2 from DGAT1. DGAT2 is expressed in many tissues with high expression levels in the liver and white adipose tissue, suggesting that it may play a significant role in mammalian triglyceride metabolism.

Because of their hydrophobicity, triglycerides are concentrated in cytosolic lipid droplets in cells or are found in the plasma as core components of lipoproteins. Excess storage of triglycerides in adipocytes results in obesity, which is increasing in prevalence in humans at alarming rates (1Mokdad A.H. Serdula M.K. Dietz W.H. Bowman B.A. Marks J.S. Koplan J.P. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 1519-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms of triglyceride synthesis is of potential importance for elucidating the molecular processes that contribute to obesity and other disorders of triglyceride metabolism. Until recently, it was believed that a single enzyme, acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT,1 EC 2.3.1.20), was responsible for triglyceride synthesis (2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 3Brindley D.N. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.

DGAT catalyzes a reaction in which diacylglycerol is covalently joined to long chain fatty acyl-CoAs. Diacylglycerol for this reaction comes from the glycerol-phosphate pathway, in which glycerol phosphate is sequentially acylated at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions by acyltransferases, followed by the removal of the phosphate group of phosphatidic acid to form diacylglycerol. The glycerol-phosphate pathway and DGAT activity are present in most tissues (5Lehner R. Kuksis A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 169-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In some cells, such as enterocytes (2Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 6Coleman R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and adipocytes (7Jamdar S.C. Cao W.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), diacylglycerol may also be derived directly from monoacylglycerol in a reaction catalyzed by monoacylglycerol acyltransferase. Previously, we identified a cDNA encoding a DGAT (8Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Homologues for this DGAT gene have been identified in many species, including plants and humans (9Hobbs D.H. Lu C. Hills M.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Bouvier-Navé P. Benveniste P. Oelkers P. Sturley S.L. Schaller H. Eur. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26765-26771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). To investigate the in vivofunction of this gene, we generated DGAT-deficient (Dgat−/−) mice (12Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). These mice have reduced body fat and are resistant to diet-induced obesity through a mechanism that involves increased energy expenditure (12Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). In addition, femaleDgat−/− mice have a lactation defect. Surprisingly, however, Dgat−/− mice have normal plasma triglyceride levels and abundant triglycerides in their adipose tissue, indicating that alternative mechanisms exist for synthesizing triglycerides. How are triglycerides synthesized in Dgat−/−mice? One possibility is from the activity of another DGAT. Biochemical studies have provided evidence for more than one DGAT activity in rat liver (13Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Abo-Hashema K.A.H. Cake M.H. Power G.W. Clarke D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35577-35582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One activity appears to be more closely coupled with synthesizing triglycerides for storage in the cell and the other with secretion of triglycerides for lipoprotein assembly. Studies of rat intestine have suggested that a second DGAT may exist in this tissue as part of a multienzyme complex (15Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13630-13636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that triglyceride synthesis may occur by acyl-CoA-independent mechanisms, such as by the actions of transacylase enzymes. Indeed, a diacylglycerol transacylase activity, in which a fatty acyl chain is transferred from one diacylglycerol molecule to another, has been reported in rat liver and small intestine (16Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8781-8786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a transacylase activity in which a fatty acyl chain is transferred from phosphatidylcholine to diacylglycerol appears to account for the majority of triglyceride synthesis in yeast (17Oelkers P.

A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), although this activity has not been reported in mammals. Recently, a DGAT enzyme without sequence homology to previously identified DGAT genes was isolated by protein purification from the fungus Mortierella rammaniana (26Lardizabal K.D. Mai J.T. Wagner N.W. Wyrick A. Voelker T. Hawkins D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38862-38869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the identification of a mammalian gene family related to this fungal DGAT. Furthermore, we report the cloning and functional characterization of one member of this family, DGAT2, whose characteristics identify it as a second mammalian DGAT. The protein sequence for a DGAT isolated from the fungus M. rammaniana2was used to search the BLAST data base. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for three different mouse genes and their human homologues and for two human genes with no apparent mouse homologue were identified. For mouse cDNAs, primers for amplifications were derived from EST sequences, and full-length cDNAs were generated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and polymerase chain reaction. Human cDNA sequences were deduced from genomic sequences of the high throughput sequencing data base (accessed through workbench.sdsc.edu), based on homology with the other gene family members. Primers for polymerase chain reactions were designed, and amplifications were performed from tissue cDNA. Full-length cDNAs were amplified from mouse liver (mDGAT2 and mDC2) and human testis (hDGAT2). The complete coding sequence for mDC3 is contained in EST clone AA822348. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were cultured from 14-day-old wild-type or Dgat−/− embryos (19Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and immortalized by passaging every 3 days. MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 7% CO2 incubator. Pulse assays were then performed using a protocol similar to that described by Goldsteinet al. (20Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well on six-well plates. On the following day, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing 1 mm [14C]oleic acid provided as a [14C]oleic acid-bovine serum albumin (BSA) complex (10% BSA, 10 mm sodium oleate; specific activity: 2 µCi/µmol), and the cells were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% BSA and twice with phosphate-buffered saline alone, and then cellular lipids were extracted with hexane:isopropanol (3:2 v:v). Lipid extacts were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), the triglyceride band was isolated, and radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. Mouse adipocytes were isolated by collagenase treatment of pooled reproductive fat pads isolated from three wild-type orDgat−/− mice (21Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Perez L. Price D. Galloway L. Poklepovic A. Sajan M.P. Cenni V. Sirri A. Moscat J. Toker A. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25308-25316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The fat pads were cut into small pieces, rinsed in 5 ml of Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 3 ml of collagenase solution (2% collagenase (Sigma), 1% BSA in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer). The resulting adipocyte suspension was washed twice in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, and the volume of adipocytes was estimated and diluted in buffer to obtain a 25% (v:v) cell suspension. Aliquots (100 µl) of this cell suspension were transferred into plastic tubes in a water bath at 37 °C. The assay for triglyceride synthesis was started by adding 10 µl of [14C]oleic acid-BSA complex (0.1 µCi/µl, 10 mm sodium oleate, 1% BSA), and the cells were incubated for 24 h. Cellular lipids were extracted with 1 ml of hexane:isopropanol (3:2 v:v) and 0.5 ml of distilled water. An aliquot (10 µl or ∼2000 dpm) of [3H]triolein (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each sample before extraction to assess recovery. Lipids were separated by TLC, and the triglycerides were isolated and quantified as described above. The human and mouse DGAT2 coding sequences with or without an N-terminal FLAG epitope (MGDYKDDDDG, epitope underlined) were subcloned into pVL1392 or pVL1393 baculovirus vectors (PharMingen). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by cotransfecting the transfer vectors with BaculoGold DNA (PharMingen), and high viral titers were obtained from two rounds of amplification in Sf9 insect cells (cultured in Grace's medium (Life Technologies) and 10% fetal bovine serum at 27 °C) as described (8Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). For protein expression, Sf9 cells were infected, and the membrane fraction was isolated as described (8Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Membrane samples were immunoblotted with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DGAT activity assays were performed by measuring activity under apparent Vmaxconditions in tissue membranes (10–50 µg of protein) as described (8Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), except that exogenous diacylglycerol was added in acetone (6Coleman R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In brief, these assays measured the incorporation of [14C]oleoyl-CoA (specific activity: ∼20,000 dpm/nmol) into triglycerides in a 5-min assay using 0.4 mmdiacylglcyerol and 25 µm oleoyl-CoA as substrates. In some assays, [14C]sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (specific activity: 12.5 µCi/µmol, 0.4 mm final concentration) was used as an acyl acceptor with unlabeled oleoyl-CoA (25 µm). Different concentrations of MgCl2(0–100 mm) were used in specific experiments. Lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1 v:v), dried under N2, and separated by TLC in hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1 v:v:v). Radioactivity in the triglyceride band was measured by scintillation counting. In some experiments, triglyceride mass was quantified by using unlabeled oleoyl-CoA as a substrate. After lipid extraction and separation by TLC, lipids were visualized by immersion in a solution of cupric sulfate (10%) and phosphoric acid (8%), followed by heating at 180 °C for 29 min. The triglyceride band was quantified by densitometry. For substrate competition assays, 5 nmol of [14C]oleoyl-CoA (∼20,000 dpm/nmol) was diluted with 5 nmol of unlabeled fatty acyl-CoAs (Sigma). The reaction was started by adding 50 µg of membrane protein. For activity assays using other fatty acyl-CoA acceptors, sn-1,2-diacylglycerol and 2-monoacylglycerol were dispersed in acetone, and glycerol 3-phosphate and lysophosphatidic acid were dissolved in water. The final concentration of each acceptor was 0.4 mm. Reaction products were separated with a two-solvent system. TLC plates were developed for 8 cm in chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:20:10:10:5 v:v:v:v:v), allowed to air dry, and then developed in hexane:methanol:acetic acid (80:20:1 v:v:v). Lipid standards were visualized by exposing the TLC plates to I2 vapor. TLC plates were exposed to x-ray film to assess the incorporation of radioactivity into lysophosphaditidic acid, phosphatidic acid, and neutral lipids. For analysis of DGAT2 expression in human tissues, a Multiple Tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) and a Multiple Tissue Expression Array (CLONTECH) were probed with a32P-labeled 680-base pair cDNA fragment (EST numberH25560) corresponding to the 3′ end of the human DGAT2 cDNA. Expression in adipose tissue was analyzed by using a Human Normal Tissue Blot (Invitrogen). For mouse tissues, a Multiple Tissue Northern blot (See-gene) and a blot prepared with total RNA from mouse tissues were probed with a 32P-labeled 1-kilobase cDNA fragment (EST AI195633) corresponding to the 3′ end of the mouse DGAT2 cDNA. For analysis of DGAT2 expression during differentiation of NIH 3T3-L1 cells, total cellular RNA was extracted at different times after the induction of differentiation (22Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the mouse cDNA fragment was used to probe the blot. DGAT activity, measured by our standard DGAT assay (8Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), is nearly absent in membranes from most tissues ofDgat−/− mice (12Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). However, significant amounts of triglycerides are present in these mice (12Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). To further examine the ability of Dgat−/− tissues to synthesize triglycerides, we compared triglyceride synthesis in isolated membranes with that in intact MEF cells and adipocytes. Although DGAT activity was nearly absent in the membrane preparations, the incorporation of radiolabeled oleic acid into triglycerides in intact MEF cells and adipocytes was 37 and 48%, respectively, of that in Dgat+/+ cells (Fig.1A). Thus, theseDgat−/− cells were capable of synthesizing triglycerides. We hypothesized that residual triglyceride synthesis inDgat−/− tissues may reflect the action of a second DGAT whose activity was not detected under our standard assay conditions. To test this hypothesis, we altered the conditions of thein vitro DGAT assay. Removing MgCl2 from the assay buffer resulted in increased DGAT activity in membranes fromDgat−/− brain, heart, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1B). DGAT activity was also increased inDgat−/− liver and adipose tissue when MgCl2 concentrations less than 100 mm were used, with maximal activity at 5 mm MgCl2 for both tissues (Fig. 1C). The level of DGAT activity inDgat−/− adipose tissue with 5 mmMgCl2 in the assay (∼1000 pmol of triglyceride formed per mg of protein/min) was comparable to that normally found in mouse liver. To identify a cDNA that encoded a second DGAT activity, we performed homology searches of sequence data bases using coding sequence for the first-cloned DGAT (DGAT1). However, only ACAT1 and ACAT2 homologues, which are known members of the DGAT1 gene family (23Farese Jr., R.V. Cases S. Smith S.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), were found. Recently, a DGAT was isolated by protein purification in the fungus M. rammaniana(26Lardizabal K.D. Mai J.T. Wagner N.W. Wyrick A. Voelker T. Hawkins D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38862-38869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The gene encoding this DGAT (MrDGAT2A) has no sequence homology with members of the DGAT1 family, including genes related to plant DGAT1 (9Hobbs D.H. Lu C. Hills M.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Bouvier-Navé P. Benveniste P. Oelkers P. Sturley S.L. Schaller H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Using sequences of the newly identified fungal DGAT to perform homology searches of EST data bases, we identified a family of related genes in mammalian species (Fig.2A). Using methods based on the polymerase chain reaction or by deducing the cDNA sequence from the gene sequence of large genomic clones, we determined the full-length cDNA sequence for three murine and five human DGAT2-related genes. In the present study, we focused on the functional characterization of one of these genes, which we have named DGAT2. We have designated the other gene family members as DGAT candidate genes until it is determined whether the encoded proteins possess DGAT activity. 2If this is the case, we propose to name the gene described in this paper DGAT2α and subsequent DGATs in this gene family DGAT2β, DGAT2γ, etc. This will distinguish this family of DGAT genes from DGAT1, which is a member of the ACAT/DGAT gene family. The mouse and human DGAT2 cDNAs are predicted to encode proteins of 388 and 387 amino acids, respectively. The sequence for mouse DGAT2, which is 43% identical to the M. rammaniana DGAT, is shown in Fig. 2B. Analyses of the predicted protein sequences (TMHMM program, workbench.sdsc.edu) consistently identifed one potential transmembrane domain and the possible existence of at least one other (Fig. 2C). In addition, the DGAT2 proteins contain three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, six potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (PROSITE data base), and sequences that share similarity with elements of a putative glycerol phospholipid domain (GenBankTM accession number PS50239) found in glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases, and related acyltransferases (24Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 25Coleman R.A. Reed B.C. Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Lane M.D. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7256-7261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The latter domain is thought to be involved in the active site of the acyltransferase reaction (25Coleman R.A. Reed B.C. Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Lane M.D. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7256-7261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The alignment of the predicted proteins encoded by the mammalian DGAT2-related cDNAs reveals regions of identity or high similarity throughout the molecules, including many residues dispersed throughout the proteins that are conserved in all members of the family (Fig.3). To determine whether DGAT2 cDNA encoded a protein possessing DGAT activity, we expressed FLAG-tagged versions of human or mouse DGAT2 in Sf9 insect cells. Insect cells were infected with recombinant mouse DGAT2 baculovirus, and membranes were isolated at different times after infection. The expression of the FLAG-tagged DGAT2 protein (molecular mass: ∼44.5 kDa) was maximal 48 h after infection (Fig.4A, inset). In DGAT assays peformed with 5 mm MgCl2 in the assay buffer, DGAT activity in DGAT2-infected membranes was 4–6-fold greater than the endogenous activity, and the maximal activity correlated with maximal protein expression (Fig. 4A). However, when the assay contained 100 mm MgCl2, there was no detectable increase in DGAT activity in membranes expressing DGAT2 as compared with the endogenous activity. DGAT activity was maximal for DGAT2 when 20 mm MgCl2 was used in the assay (not shown). In a separate experiment, we expressed human DGAT2 cDNA in insect cells; human DGAT2 also catalyzed triglyceride synthesis 30-fold over background (640 versus 20 pmol/mg of protein/min with 20 mm MgCl2 in the assay buffer) in membrane assays. Several characteristics of DGAT2 activity identified it as a DGAT. First, triglycerides were the major product of the in vitroreaction catalyzed by DGAT2 expressed in insect cell membranes; autoradiography of TLC plates used to analyze reaction products did not reveal the incorporation of [14C]- oleoyl-CoA substrate into other lipids (not shown). Second, DGAT2 activity was primarily localized in the membrane fraction (data not shown). Third, membranes expressing DGAT2 catalyzed a 2-fold increase in triglyceride synthesis over endogenous activity (354 ± 54 versus 169 ± 42 pmol/mg protein/min, n = 3) when labeled diacylglycerol was used as a substrate. In addition, adding exogenous diacylglycerol stimulated DGAT activity 10-fold in membranes expressing DGAT2, establishing the dependence on diacylglycerol as a substrate (Fig. 4B). Fourth, the mass of triglycerides produced from the in vitro reaction increased as a function of the oleoyl-CoA concentration in membranes expressing FLAG-tagged DGAT2 (Fig. 4C). Triglyceride synthesis by DGAT2 was similar to that for comparable levels of expressed FLAG-tagged DGAT1, although at high concentrations of oleoyl-CoA (200 µm), DGAT1 retained 80% of its maximal activity, whereas DGAT2 retained only 25%. Finally, we tested membranes expressing DGAT2 for activities with other fatty acyl-CoA acceptors, including glycerol 3-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, and monoacylglycerol. Activity was only found when sn-1,2-diacylglycerol was used (Fig.4D). Next, we examined fatty acyl-CoA substrate specificity for DGAT1 and DGAT2 by comparing the ability of palmitoyl-CoA, linoleoyl-CoA, and arachidonyl-CoA to compete with labeled oleoyl-CoA in DGAT assays. For both DGAT1 and DGAT2, arachidonyl-, linoleoyl-, and palmitoyl-CoA competed similarly with oleoyl-CoA for incorporation into triglycerides (Table I).Table IFatty acyl-CoA specificity for triglyceride synthesis by DGAT1 and DGAT2 expressed in insect cells: competition of fatty acyl-CoAs with [14C]oleoyl-CoA for incorporation into triglyceridesProtein expressedRelative activitiesOleoyl-CoAPalmitoyl-CoAArachidonyl-CoALinoleoyl-CoADGAT11.000.670.490.54DGAT21.000.460.450.44Cell membranes were prepared and assayed in duplicate as described under “Materials and Methods.” Similar amounts of FLAG-tagged DGAT1 and DGAT2 were used in membrane assays. For DGAT1, DGAT activity with oleoyl-CoA alone was 6850 pmol of triglyceride formed per mg of protein/min; for DGAT2, it was 4880 pmol of triglyceride formed per mg of protein/min. Open table in a new tab Cell membranes were prepared and assayed in duplicate as described under “Materials and Methods.” Similar amounts of FLAG-tagged DGAT1 and DGAT2 were used in membrane assays. For DGAT1, DGAT activity with oleoyl-CoA alone was 6850 pmol of triglyceride formed per mg of protein/min; for DGAT2, it was 4880 pmol of triglyceride formed per mg of protein/min. Northern blots of human and mouse tissues were performed to determine whether DGAT2 is expressed in tissues that are relevant to triglyceride metabolism. Two mRNA species of ∼2.4 and ∼1.8 kilobases were detected for human DGAT2 (Fig. 4A). The significance of the two mRNA species is unknown. In human tissues, the highest levels of expression were in liver and white adipose tissue. Lower levels of expression were found in mammary gland, testis, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Figs.5, A and B). The high expression levels in mammary gland may result in part from expression in adipocytes. In mouse tissues, the major mRNA for DGAT2 was ∼2.4 kilobases in size (Fig. 5C). An additional smaller hybridization band was observed in mouse testis RNA. The pattern of expression was generally similar in mouse and human tissues, except in small intestine, where DGAT2 expression was found in mice, but was very low in humans in three independent Northern blots. DGAT2 was also expressed at high levels in brown adipose tissue in mice (Fig.5D). DGAT2 mRNA levels were not up-regulated in liver or adipose tissues of Dgat−/− (DGAT1-deficient) mice (Fig. 5D). We also examined DGAT2 expression in a cultured cell model of adipocyte differentiation (NIH 3T3-L1 cells) in which DGAT activity increases markedly, both in the presence and absence of MgCl2 in the assay mix (Refs. 8Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After 10 days of differentiation, DGAT2 mRNA increased 30-fold, consistent with a possible role in adipogenesis (Fig.6). The disruption of the mouse DGAT1 gene indicated the existence of multiple mechanisms for triglyceride synthesis (12Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). In the current study, we cloned and characterized DGAT2, a second mammalian DGAT that was identified by its homology to a DGAT in M. rammaniana.2 DGAT2 is a member of a family of genes whose members are unrelated to DGAT1 by sequence homology and are candidate genes for additional mammalian DGATs. DGAT1 and DGAT2 exhibit different sensitivities to MgCl2 in in vitroassays, and the activity of DGAT2 may account for the residual DGAT activity in Dgat−/− mice, which is apparent when lower concentrations (0–20 mm) of MgCl2are used in the assay. Several findings indicate that the DGAT2 cDNA encodes a DGAT. First, overexpression of this cDNA in insect cell membranes resulted in large increases in triglyceride synthesis in in vitro assays, as measured by either accumulation of mass or radiolabeled tracer. Second, increases in triglyceride synthesis activity were directly related to increases in the concentration of either substrate, diacylglycerol or oleoyl-CoA, in the reaction. Third, DGAT2 catalyzed the synthesis of labeled triglycerides using either oleoyl-CoA or diacylglycerol as the labeled substrate. Fourth, we did not detect an activity for any acyl acceptor other than diacylglycerol. Finally, the homologous member of the DGAT2 gene family in M. rammaniana catalyzes triglyceride synthesis in a highly purified membrane fraction.2 These observations indicate that the DGAT2 cDNA encodes a DGAT. Enzyme purification or gene knockout experiments will be useful in determining whether triglyceride synthesis is the sole function of this enzyme. The ability to express similar levels of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in insect cells enabled us to compare the activity levels and substrate specificities of the two enzymes. The two enzymes had similar maximal capacities for triglyceride synthesis in the mid-range (∼100 µm) of oleoyl-CoA concentration. DGAT2 tended to be slightly more active at lower oleoyl-CoA concentrations (0–50 µm), whereas DGAT1 was more active at higher (>200 µm) oleoyl-CoA concentrations. It is tempting to speculate that the two enzymes have different capacities for triglyceride synthesis with regard to fatty acyl-CoA availability. However, the findings at high oleoyl-CoA concentrations may simply reflect different sensitivities of the two enzymes to the detergent effects of fatty acids. Furthermore, it is unknown whether our findings in an insect cell overexpression system are relevant to the roles of DGAT enzymes in triglyceride synthesis in mammalian tissues. DGAT1 and DGAT2 had similar fatty acyl-CoA specificities, each utilizing several different long chain fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates. For both DGAT1 and DGAT2, linoleoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, and arachidonyl-CoA all competed similarly with oleoyl-CoA in DGAT assays of insect cell membranes. Thus, both DGAT enzymes had broad substrate specificity in this expression system. Given the fundamental role of triglycerides in energy storage, it is not surprising that more than one DGAT enzyme contributes to triglyceride synthesis. It is somewhat surprising, however, that the two identified DGATs are members of gene families that do not share obvious homology. Interestingly, both the DGAT1 and the DGAT2 gene families have phylogenetic relatives dating back to yeast, and both enzymes have homologues that function as DGATs in plants (9Hobbs D.H. Lu C. Hills M.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,10Bouvier-Navé P. Benveniste P. Oelkers P. Sturley S.L. Schaller H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).2 It seems likely that a DGAT2 homologue in yeast (GenBankTM accession number CAA99466) contributes to the triglyceride synthesis activity not accounted for by lecithin:diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity, which appears to be the major triglyceride synthesis activity in this organism (17Oelkers P.

It remains to be determined whether DGAT2 or related family members account for the residual DGAT activity inDgat−/− tissues. The observation that DGAT2 activity is maximal in in vitro assays when MgCl2 concentrations are low supports this possibility, as DGAT activities in Dgat−/− tissues were also maximal at low MgCl2 concentrations. In addition, DGAT2 is expressed in tissues, such as liver and adipose tissue, that appear to have significant capacities to synthesize triglycerides inDgat−/− mice. It is unclear why the residual DGAT activity in Dgat−/− tissues, which presumably is due to DGAT2 or other DGAT2 gene family members, is relatively low, even when low MgCl2 concentrations are used in the assay. It is possible that our enzyme assays have not been fully optimized to detect DGAT2 activity. It is also possible that DGAT enzymes are not rate-limiting for triglyceride synthesis and that their level of activity is not crucial for regulating this process. The identification of a second DGAT in humans and mice has significant implications for the understanding of triglyceride synthesis and metabolism. Molecular tools will now be available to study the regulation, localization, and cell biology of the two enzymes and to elucidate their respective roles in physiology and human disease.

In summary, we have identified a novel NADPH oxidase that generates superoxide and functions as a H+ channel in a Ca2+-dependent manner.

In addition to their long known toxic effects, which are involved in the killing of microorganisms, aging, and cancerogenesis, ROS are now recognized as physiologically relevant signaling molecules.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2017-2025PubMed Google Scholar).Superoxide generation by phagocytes plays an important role in the killing of microorganisms during host defense. It is catalyzed by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, an enzyme complex that has been known and studied for a long time (8Clark R.A. J. Infect.

The main subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, gp91phox forms a transmembrane heterodimer with p22phox and functions as an electron transport chain containing four NADPH binding regions, an FAD binding site, and two heme groups anchored by four histidines (12Rotrosen D.

However, association of cytosolic proteins, including p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2, with the transmembrane subunits is crucial for the activation of the electron flow (9Babior B.M.

Bioessays. 1994; 16: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar)) also generate superoxide. The subsequent search for nonphagocyte NADPH oxidases led to the discovery of two families of gp91phoxhomologues. The NADPH oxidase (NOX) family members have approximately the same length as gp91phox (i.e.∼560–580 amino acids), while the dual oxidase (DUOX) family members are markedly longer (∼1550 amino acids) because of their N-terminal extensions consisting of two EF hand (i.e. presumed Ca2+ binding) motifs, an additional transmembrane helix, and a peroxidase homology domain (20Lambeth J.D.

NOX1 and NOX4 have been shown to produce low amounts of superoxide in a constitutively active manner (21Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K.

The novel gp91phox homologues have been proposed to regulate cell growth (NOX1), participate in host defense (NOX1), mediate in oxygen sensing (NOX4), or play a role in thyroid hormone synthesis (DUOX1 and -2); however, so far no conclusive evidence concerning these proposals exists.Activation of DUOX enzymes by elevations of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]c, has been suggested based on their EF hand motifs and the previously described Ca2+-activated superoxide generation in thyroid cells (30Nakamura Y. Makino R. Tanaka T. Ishimura Y. Ohtaki S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4880-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). But hitherto no direct experimental evidence exists. [Ca2+]c elevations do not activate NOX4 (24Geiszt M. Kopp J.B. Varnai P. Leto T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8010-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), and there is no evidence that they would activate NOX1 or NOX3. gp91phox can be activated by Ca2+, although most likely not because of a direct effect of Ca2+ on gp91phox but rather because of the activation of Ca2+-sensitive second messenger systems (31Christiansen N.O.

There is now growing evidence that, in addition to their electron transport function, gp91phox and its homologues may also function as H+ channels, allowing charge and pH compensation (35Banfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 37Henderson L.M. Meech R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is an alternatively spliced short form of NOX1, which is devoid of elements of the electron transport chain. For this protein, H+ conduction may even be the only physiological role (22Banfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Here we describe a distant relative of the members of NOX and DUOX families, NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5). NOX5, which is found in testis and lymphoid organs, contains an N-terminal extension with three EF hands and is able to generate superoxide and to conduct H+ ions in response to cytosolic free [Ca2+] elevations.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we describe the novel superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase NOX5. It is distantly related to the NOX and the DUOX families of NADPH oxidases and characterized by three N-terminal EF hand motifs. Both the superoxide production and the H+ conductance of NOX5 is activated in response to [Ca2+]c elevation. Because of its high level expression in testis and in lymphoid tissues, it is likely to play a role in sperm and lymphocyte biology.Despite its evolutionary distance, NOX5 resembles gp91phox more closely than any other gp91phox homologues from a functional point of view. (i) NOX5 is a second messenger-activated enzyme, while presently available data suggest that NOX1 and NOX4 are constitutively active. (ii) Heterologously expressed NOX5 generates large amounts of superoxide, while NOX1 and NOX4 appear to generate only low levels (21Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar,24Geiszt M. Kopp J.B. Varnai P. Leto T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1417-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 6). From a biological point of view, this makes sense: regulated NADPH oxidases may generate high amounts of superoxide for a limited period of time, while constitutively active enzymes should produce lower amounts to avoid toxicity.However, while gp91phox needs to assemble several other subunits for its activation, it appears that in NOX5 the regulatory and catalytic modules are combined within one protein. Indeed, heterologously expressed NOX5 generates superoxide upon [Ca2+]c elevations in HEK293, COS-7, and HeLa cells, and at least one of these cell lines (HEK293) is completely devoid of p47phox and p67phox (data not shown). We can, however, not exclude a role for p22phox in NOX5 activity as low levels of p22phox mRNA were found in all three cell lines used for transfections (data not shown). Similarly, the existence of hitherto undefined, widely distributed NOX5-interacting proteins cannot be excluded at this point.Similar to gp91phox and NOX1, NOX5 acts as a H+ channel. Thus, many (possibly all) gp91phox homologues fulfill a double function: transport of electrons and proton conductance. However, while the NOX5 H+ channel is quiescent in nonstimulated cells and activated only upon [Ca2+]cincrease, the gp91phox and NOX1 H+channels conduct protons without a need for any activator when heterologously expressed in nonphagocytic cells (22Banfi B.

The two isoforms use different sites of the NOX5 gene for transcription initiation, suggesting different promoter usage in the different tissues. The difference of the two mRNA products is mainly restricted to the 5′-untranslated region, suggesting differences in mRNA handling in spleen and testis as it has been described for other 5′ isoforms (51Fautsch M.P. Perdok M.M. Wieben E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24691-24695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A study published since submission of this manuscript (42Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), has described a fetal kidney-derived NOX5 cDNA that does not contain the N-terminal EF hands. In our studies, NOX5 without EF-hands does not generate superoxide. 2B. Bánfi, G. Molnár, A. Maturana, K. Steger, B. Hegedûs, N. Demaurex, and K.-H. Krause, unpublished observations.NOX5 mRNA is most abundantly found in pachytene spermatocytes. Thus, NOX5 might have a function in the early stages of spermatogenesis such as cell division, induction of apoptosis, or DNA compaction. However, the mRNAs for proteins of mature spermatozoa are synthesized early in spermatogenesis because later DNA compaction prevents gene transcription (52Monesi V. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 22: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, we favor the hypothesis that the NOX5 protein plays a role in the function of mature spermatozoa. Indeed, although superoxide generation is typically associated with phagocytes, mammalian spermatozoa were one of the first cells in which a respiratory burst was detected (53MacLeod J. Am. J. Physiol. 1943; 138: 512-518Crossref Google Scholar). It was later shown that generation of reactive oxygen species by spermatozoa is activated by [Ca2+]c elevations (54Aitken R.J. Buckingham D.W. West K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) suggesting the presence of a Ca2+-activated NADPH oxidase. This ROS generation is thought to be an important mediator of the acrosome reaction and sperm-oocyte fusion as those two functions of the mature sperm are inhibited by ROS scavengers (7Aitken R.J. Paterson M. Fisher H. Buckingham D.W. van Duin M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2017-2025PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NOX5 might couple [Ca2+]c elevations during sperm activation to spermatozoa effector functions.The NOX5 mRNA is also highly expressed in cortical and paracortical lymphocytes of lymph nodes and in the white pulp of spleen. In the cortical area of lymph nodes, NOX5 mRNA is expressed in the mantle zone surrounding the germinal centers suggesting that the NOX5-expressing cells are mature memory B-lymphocytes. The abundant expression of NOX5 in the mostly T-cell-containing paracortex suggests that T-lymphocytes also express NOX5. Similarly in spleen, NOX5 mRNA was found both in the mature B-lymphocyte-rich area (mantle zone of folliculi) and in the T-lymphocyte-rich area (periarterial lymphoid sheaths). What might be the possible function of a Ca2+-activated superoxide-producing enzyme in follicular memory B-cells and in splenic and lymph node T-cells? Although no definitive answer can be given at this point, three pieces of information suggest a reasonable working hypothesis. (i) Both memory B-cells and T-lymphocytes express Ca2+-mobilizing receptors, the B-cell receptor and the T-cell receptor. Thus, upon exposure to their specific antigen, the lymphocytes raise [Ca2+]c, which leads to activation: memory B-cells divide rapidly and develop large clusters of plasmoblasts (55Martin F. Kearney J.F. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 70-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The T-lymphocytes also proliferate and differentiate into memory and effector cells. (ii) The rise of [Ca2+]c may activate NOX5, which generates both intra- and extracellular superoxide at least in the transfected cells. Superoxide spontaneously (or catalyzed by SOD) dismutates to H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide is able to cross biological membranes and influence redox-sensitive processes. (iii) Proliferation and differentiation of both B- and T-cells involve redox-sensitive processes, in particular the NFκB/IκB kinase pathway (49Ginn-Pease M.E. Whisler R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 346-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 56Kaisho T. Takeda K. Tsujimura T. Kawai T. Nomura F. Terada N. Akira S. J. Exp.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway (17Lee J.R. Koretzky G.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4188-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Pani G. Colavitti R. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Also, ROS generation appears to be involved in interleukin-6 secretion by B-lymphocytes (17Lee J.R. Koretzky G.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4188-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, NOX5 might play a role as a bridge between the B-cell and T-cell receptor activation and the proliferation and differentiation of B- and T-lymphocytes. Over the last 10 years, our concept of the biological role of reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 has remarkably evolved. In addition to their long known toxic effects, which are involved in the killing of microorganisms, aging, and cancerogenesis, ROS are now recognized as physiologically relevant signaling molecules. They have been shown to regulate a large number of biological processes including gene expression (1Schoonbroodt S. Piette J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), kinase activation (2Lo Y.Y. Wong J.M. Cruz T.F. J. Biol.

Bone. 1994; 15: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), cell growth (6Burdon R.H. Free Radic. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2017-2025PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide generation by phagocytes plays an important role in the killing of microorganisms during host defense. It is catalyzed by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, an enzyme complex that has been known and studied for a long time (8Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: S309-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Upon assembly, the NADPH oxidase generates electron currents (11Schrenzel J. Serrander L. Banfi B. Nusse O. Fouyouzi R. Lew D.P. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) that flow from intracellular NADPH to extracellular (or phagosomal) oxygen resulting in superoxide generation. The main subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, gp91phox forms a transmembrane heterodimer with p22phox and functions as an electron transport chain containing four NADPH binding regions, an FAD binding site, and two heme groups anchored by four histidines (12Rotrosen D.

However, association of cytosolic proteins, including p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2, with the transmembrane subunits is crucial for the activation of the electron flow (9Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over the last several years it has become apparent that nonphagocytic cells (e.g. vascular smooth muscle (4Munzel T. Hink U. Heitzer T.

Bioessays. 1994; 16: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar)) also generate superoxide. The subsequent search for nonphagocyte NADPH oxidases led to the discovery of two families of gp91phoxhomologues. The NADPH oxidase (NOX) family members have approximately the same length as gp91phox (i.e.∼560–580 amino acids), while the dual oxidase (DUOX) family members are markedly longer (∼1550 amino acids) because of their N-terminal extensions consisting of two EF hand (i.e. presumed Ca2+ binding) motifs, an additional transmembrane helix, and a peroxidase homology domain (20Lambeth J.D.

Both depletion and adoptive transfer experiments indicate that CD4 T cells are primarily responsible for the pathology observed in sfmice (2Godfrey V.L. Wilkinson J.E. Russell L.B. Am. J.

Appleby M.W. Brunkow M.E. Wilkinson J.E. Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2546-2554PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotype of sf mutant mice is strikingly similar to that observed in mice deficient in expression of CTLA-4, indicating that scurfin may also be an important regulator of the T cell activation program (10Waterhouse P.

Yasayko S.A. Wilkinson J.E. Galas D. Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Brunkow M.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 68-73PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type sf gene (Foxp3) encodes a novel 48-kDa protein, scurfin (SFN). The protein is expressed at low levels, primarily in CD4 T cells (15Jeffery E.W. Hjerrild K.A. Paeper B. Clark L.B. Yasayko S.A. Wilkinson J.E. Galas D. Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Brunkow M.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 68-73PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, SFN expression levels do not appear to be modulated following activation. The sfmutation is a 2-bp insertion that results in a premature stop codon. It is not known if the predicted truncated protein is stably expressed in mutants. However, overexpression of a transgene encoding the mutant form of the SFN gene in wild type mice yielded no phenotype (15Jeffery E.W. Hjerrild K.A. Paeper B. Clark L.B. Yasayko S.A. Wilkinson J.E. Galas D. Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. Brunkow M.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 68-73PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the sf phenotype most likely results from a loss of SFN function. The observations that females heterozygous for the sf mutation are phenotypically normal and display random X-inactivation also support this interpretation. Concurrent with the cloning of the sf gene, several reports of mutations in the human ortholog of the Foxp3 gene have been made (16Chatila T.A. Blaeser F. Ho N. Lederman H.M. Voulgaropoulos C. Helms C. Bowcock A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: R75-R81Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 17Wildin R.S. Ramsdell F. Peake J. Faravelli F. Casanova J.L. Buist N. Levy-Lahad E. Mazzella M.

Affected males present symptoms similar to those observed in sf mice and include a predilection to autoimmune diseases and allergy. The majority of the mutations in these patients also result in premature stop codons. Although the phenotype ofsf mice and of patients with the immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome (IPEX), or X-linked autoimmunity-allergic dysregulation syndrome (XLAAD) indicate a critical role for the foxp3 gene product in the negative regulation of T cell activation, it is not immediately evident how the protein exacts this effect. The most prominent structural feature of SFN is a forkhead/winged helix domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. Forkhead/winged helix domain-containing proteins are members of a rapidly growing family of DNA binding factors. Since the identification of the original forkhead (FKH) protein in Drosophila in the early 1990s, over 80 FKH family proteins, classified into 17 different subfamilies, have been described in a variety of species, including nematodes, yeast, and mammals (Ref. 19Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar and www.biology.pomona.edu/fox.html). Although both transcriptional activators and repressors have been identified in this family, FKH domain-containing proteins typically function in the regulation of lineage commitment and developmental differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 20Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). SFN, with an FKH domain of only 84 amino acids, is an atypical winged helix family member. QRF-1, a previously described partial protein sequence (21Li C. Tucker P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11583-11587Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), contains a similarly truncated FKH domain. Li and Tucker (21Li C. Tucker P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11583-11587Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the FKH domain of QRF-1 is necessary and sufficient for binding to oligonucleotides containing DNA sequences described to bind FKH domain-containing proteins. The sequence identity between the FKH domain of QRF-1 and scurfin suggested that the latter would also function as a DNA binding protein. Another distinct feature of SFN is the location of the FKH domain at its C terminus. Generally, the FKH domain is located near the amino terminus of proteins in this family. This unique structural feature may be significant in the protein's function and help distinguish SFN from other FKH family proteins active in CD4 T cells. With the ultimate goal of identifying how SFN acts to regulate T cell function, we have carried out fundamental analyses of this protein. Here, we report that scurfin is a DNA binding protein that can repress transcription. The FKH domain is required for this activity. Complimentary to the observation of hyper-responsive T cells in mice carrying the inactivating sf mutation, and the description of T cell-mediated autoimmunity in humans with the IPEX or XLAAD syndrome, overexpression of scurfin attenuates the T cell activation response, as evidenced by reduced cytokine production in response to activating stimuli. The ability to bind DNA, i.e. inclusion of the FKH domain, is required for this effect. Although the exact mechanisms by which SFN regulates T cell activation remain to be elucidated, the findings presented here suggest that the ability of scurfin to act as a negative regulator of cytokine production by CD4 T cells may involve direct repression of NFAT-mediated transcription. cDNA encoding full-length human scurfin (amino acids 1–431) or a fragment lacking the FKH domain (amino acids 1–327) was inserted into the expression vector pIRES2-EGFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), the GST fusion vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), and the tetracycline-responsive vector pREV-TRE (CLONTECH). A multimeric FKH binding site construct was created by annealing complementary oligonucleotides containing three tandem repeats of the FKH binding site V1P (sequence given below). Restriction sites were included at the ends of the oligonucleotides to facilitate subcloning of the multimer into the SV40 promoter-driven luciferase reporter, pGL-3 Promoter (Promega, Madison, WI) to create 3xFKH-luc. Sequencing confirmed all constructs to be correct and free of mutation. HEK 293T cells and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin. The Jurkat subline D4 was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin. Tetracycline-inducible (Teti) Jurkat clones were generated following neomycin selection of D4 cells transfected with pREV-Tet-On (CLONTECH). Co-expression of a Tet-responsive GFP construct allowed selection of a clone yielding minimal promoter activity in the absence of treatment with the tetracycline analog, doxycycline (CLONTECH). This clone, hereafter referred to as TO, was used to create Tetiexpressers of empty vector (TO.TRE), full-length scurfin (TO.SFN), or scurfin lacking the FKH domain (TO.ΔFKH). The full-length (SFN), deletion mutant (ΔFKH), or empty pIRES2-EGFP construct was transiently expressed in HEK 293T cells using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). After 24 h of culture, ∼5000 cells/well were plated on poly-lysine-coated microscope slides and allowed to adhere overnight at 37 °C. 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin. Cells were stained with pre-immune sera (Pre) or polyclonal antisera raised against full-length human scurfin (αSFN), followed by goat α-rabbit IgG Alexa-568, the actin stain phalloidin-Alexa 488, and the DNA intercalating dye Toto-3 (all from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After several phosphate-buffered saline washes, mount medium (50% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well. A coverslip was then applied and sealed. The Laser Scanning Confocal Imaging System, MRC 1024 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), was used to visualize subcellular localization of full-length and ΔFKH scurfin. Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein was isolated from HEK 293T transient transfectants as previously described (22Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Equal quantities of cytoplasmic and nuclear protein were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The subcellular localization of scurfin was assessed by immunoblotting with αSFN, followed by detection with a chemiluminescent reagent. Single-stranded oligonucleotides containing the consensus FKH binding sites (21 and references therein) TTR-S (5′-TCG AGT TGA CTA AGT CAA TAA TCA GAA TCA G) and V1P (5′-TCA AAA ATA TTG AAG TGT TAT CAC ATA CAC), an irrelevant sequence (5′-ATG AAT ATG CAA ATC AGG TG), or putative FKH/NFAT composite binding sites in the human GM-CSF enhancer (5′-TCT GCC CTG CCA CAA CCC CAT CGG AGC CCC TGA GTC AGC ATG G), the human IL-2 promoter (5′-ATC AGA AGA GGA AAA ATG AAG GTA ATG TTT TTT CAG ACT GGT AA), or the NFAT multimeric reporter construct (5′-AAG AGG AAA ATT TGT TTC ATA CAG AAG GCG) were annealed with their complementary strand and used as cold competitors or radiolabeled probe in gel shift assays with Jurkat-derived nuclear protein. A dimer of the TTR-S oligonucleotide (5′-CTG AAT TCT GAT TAT TGA CTT AGT CAA CAT TCT GAT TAT TGA CTT AGT CAA C) and a different irrelevant competitor (5′-GAT TTA AAA GTG TGT CCC AGC AGC CCT GGT CCA GCC CTC T) were annealed with their complementary strand, filled in with Klenow, and used in EMSA assays performed with recombinant proteins. GST fusion proteins were affinity purified from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacterial lysates in the presence of protease inhibitors using pre-swelled glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Nuclear extracts were prepared from D4 cells as previously described (22Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein (4 μg/lane) or a comparable amount of purified GST fusion protein was preincubated at room temperature with binding buffer supplemented with 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) and a 50- to 100-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide competitor for 10 min (23Schubert L.A. King G. Cron R.Q. Lewis D.B. Aruffo A. Hollenbaugh D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29624-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Probe (2 × 104 cpm, end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP) was then added to a final volume of 25 μl, and the incubation continued for an additional 15 min at room temperature. In some reactions, rabbit pre-immune sera or antisera raised against full-length SFN was incubated with nuclear protein for 30 min on ice prior to addition of the probe. All reactions were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4% gels in 0.027 m Tris borate, 0.6 mm EDTA buffer. The activity of the 3xFKH-luc or the pGL-3 Promoter luciferase reporter construct was assessed in COS-7 cells. Calcium phosphate transfection was used to transiently express the β-galactosidase control vector, pSV-β-gal (Promega), the luciferase reporter pGL-3 Promoter or 3xFKH-luc, and the SFN, ΔFKH, or empty pIRES2-EGFP expression construct in COS-7 cells. 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysates were prepared in 1× Reporter lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured in cellular lysates using the Luciferase assay system (Promega) and the EG & G Berthold Lumat 9507 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) according to the manufacturers' specifications. The β-galactosidase activity in duplicates of each lysate was determined using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega) and used to normalize measured luciferase activity. The Jurkat subline D4 was transiently transfected with the expression construct encoding full-length human SFN or the parent vector as described previously (23Schubert L.A. King G. Cron R.Q. Lewis D.B. Aruffo A. Hollenbaugh D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29624-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After 24 h of culture in the absence or presence of 1 or 10 μg/ml CD3 antibody (OKT3), culture supernatants were collected. IL-2 secretion was evaluated by bioassay using the IL-2-dependent murine cell line HT-2 (9Clark L.B. Appleby M.W. Brunkow M.E. Wilkinson J.E. Ziegler S.F. Ramsdell F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2546-2554PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of a luciferase reporter containing a multimer of a regulatory NFAT site (−280) from the murine IL-2 gene (NFAT-luc) (24Petrak D. Memon S.A. Birrer M.J. Ashwell J.D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2046-2051PubMed Google Scholar) or the SV40 promoter-driven luciferase reporter, pGL-3 Promoter, was assessed in the TO.TRE, TO.SFN, and TO.ΔFKH cell lines. Cells were cultured in 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h prior to transfection. Equal concentrations (107 cells/0.4 ml) of each clone were electroporated with 10 μg of the control vector pSV-β-gal and either NFAT-luc or pGL-3 Promoter as previously described (23Schubert L.A. King G. Cron R.Q. Lewis D.B. Aruffo A. Hollenbaugh D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29624-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were rested for 2 h at 37 °C. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and 106 cells per well were cultured in the absence or presence of ionomycin (1.5 μm) and PMA (25 ng/ml) for 6 h. Cells were harvested, and lysates were prepared in 1× reporter lysis buffer. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized based on the β-galactosidase activity detected in duplicate lysates. Distinct sequences present in the FKH domain have been described to mediate nuclear localization and DNA binding by proteins containing this structural feature (25Hellqvist M. Mahlapuu M. Blixt A. Enerback S. Carlsson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23335-23343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To analyze scurfin localization, we first assessed the ability of transiently expressed scurfin to localize to the nucleus. A construct directing expression of scurfin (SFN), a fragment lacking the FKH domain (ΔFKH), or the parent vector pIRES2-EGFP (293) was transiently transfected into HEK 293T cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Scurfin localization was assessed at both the single cell level by confocal microscopy (Fig.1, A–D) and at the level of the transfected population by fractionation of total cellular protein into nuclear and cytoplasmic components and subsequent Western blotting (Fig. 1E). Scurfin (in red) predominantly localizes to the nucleus of HEK 293T cells (Fig. 1C). As predicted, removal of the FKH domain results in the exclusion of the majority of scurfin from the nucleus (Fig. 1D). The residual red staining observed in the nucleus of ΔFKH-transfected cells could reflect staining of scurfin endogenously expressed in HEK 293T cells or, more likely, cross-reactivity of the antisera with other FKH domain-containing proteins expressed in these cells. A similar, low level of reactivity with the SFN antisera is observed in the nucleus of cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 1B). Finally, staining with the scurfin antisera is specific, because no detectable signal is observed when pre-immune sera is used for staining (Fig.1A). To demonstrate that the results observed by confocal microscopy were representative of the entire transfected population, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein were concomitantly isolated from transfectants. Equal quantities of cytoplasmic (c) and nuclear (n) protein were immunoblotted with scurfin antisera (Fig. 1E). As observed with confocal microscopy, the majority of scurfin (∼48 kDa) localizes to the nuclear protein fraction, and removal of the FKH domain (∼34-kDa band) results in its retention in the cytoplasm. These findings indicate that scurfin can localize to the nucleus and that the FKH domain is required for this to occur. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting of nuclear protein isolated from Jurkat cells both indicate that endogenously expressed SFN also localizes to the nucleus (data not shown). Based on the sequence identity between the FKH domain of the previously described partial protein QRF-1 and scurfin, we predicted that scurfin would form a complex with the same DNA sequences (21Li C. Tucker P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11583-11587Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of both recombinant GST fusions with scurfin and endogenously expressed scurfin to bind to oligonucleotides containing these sequences. As shown in Fig.2A, a fusion of GST with full-length scurfin binds to a probe containing a dimer of the FKH consensus binding site from the TTR-S gene (Fig. 2A,lane 3). Addition of a 50-fold molar excess of cold competitor of the same sequence eliminates formation of the lowest band (Fig. 2A, lane 4), but inclusion of the same amount of an irrelevant DNA sequence does not (Fig. 2A,lane 5). Addition of polyclonal antisera raised against SFN in the gel shift reaction results in retardation of the lowest band (Fig. 2A, lane 6). This indicates that SFN is a primary component of the lowest DNA-protein complex and that the two higher bands may represent nonspecific binding activity. As expected, a fusion of GST with a deletion mutant of scurfin, which lacks the FKH domain, fails to form a complex with the probe (Fig. 2A,lane 2). Finally a fusion between GST and c-Jun, a protein known to bind a distinct DNA sequence, fails to form a complex with the TTR-S probe (Fig. 2A, lane 1). These results suggest that scurfin is a DNA binding protein that specifically complexes with a consensus FKH binding site and that the FKH domain is required for this activity. The FKH domain-dependent ability of recombinant scurfin to bind to DNA was not surprising. However, this finding did not prove that scurfin binds DNA under more physiologically relevant circumstances. Because CD4 T cells express scurfin and are most affected by the inactivating sf mutation, we next studied the DNA binding ability of endogenously expressed scurfin. Nuclear protein was extracted from Jurkat cells activated with αCD3 for 2 h and used in gel shift assays. As observed with recombinant full-length protein, endogenously expressed scurfin forms a complex with a probe that contains a FKH protein consensus DNA binding site from the V1P promoter (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and5). A 50-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide competitor of the same DNA sequence as the probe (Fig. 2B,lane 2) or the FKH binding site from the TTR-S promoter (Fig. 2B, lane 3) competes away the protein/probe complex, indicating that a specific complex is formed. Furthermore, addition of an irrelevant DNA sequence does not disrupt complex formation (Fig. 2B, lane 4). The same findings were attained when the FKH binding site from the TTR-S promoter was used as the probe (data not shown). Inclusion of antisera raised against scurfin (Fig. 2B, lane 6), but not pre-immune sera (Fig. 2B, lane 7), results in retardation of the migration of the complex, demonstrating that scurfin is a major component of the protein-DNA complex. These findings confirm that scurfin is present in the nucleus of CD4 T cells and is capable of binding DNA. The same DNA binding activity is observed in nuclear protein isolated from unstimulated Jurkat cells (data not shown). Next we investigated the functional significance of the ability of scurfin to bind DNA. The FKH family of DNA binding factors contains transcriptional activators as well as repressors of transcription. The documented transactivation domains of other FKH family proteins are located C-terminal of the FKH domain (26Mahlapuu M. Pelto-Huikko M. Aitola M. Enerback S. Carlsson P. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K., L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 28Schuddekopf K. Schorpp M. Boehm T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9661-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As previously mentioned, the scurfin FKH domain is unique in that it ends only 11 amino acids from the C terminus of the protein. We hypothesized that SFN might lack a transactivation domain and possibly inhibit transcription. To address this question, we examined the effect of SFN on the expression of the SV40 minimal promoter reporter flanked by multiple FKH binding sites. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with an expression construct directing the production of scurfin (SFN), a mutant lacking the FKH domain (ΔFKH), or the parent vector pIRES2-EGFP (Control). The control vector pSV-β-gal and either 3xFKH-luc (Fig. 3,speckled bars) or the parent luciferase reporter pGL-3 Promoter (Fig. 3, solid bars) were co-transfected with each expression construct. Lysates were harvested and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity measured 48 h later. Comparable levels of luciferase activity are detected in cells transfected with the pGL-3 Promoter, irrespective of the expression construct co-transfected (Fig.3, solid bars). Activity of the 3xFKH-lucconstruct in COS-7 cells transfected with the parent vector (Fig. 3,Control, speckled bar) and SFN lacking the DNA binding domain (Fig. 3, ΔFKH, speckled bar) is comparable. However, overexpression of full-length scurfin consistently results in more than a 50% reduction of transcription of the reporter gene (Fig. 3, SFN, speckled bar), suggesting that SFN can repress transcription. The observation that SFN overexpression does not affect promoter activity in the absence of FKH binding sites (Fig. 3, SFN, solid bar) and that removal of the DNA binding domain eliminates the reduction in expression of the 3xFKH-luc reporter gene (Fig. 3, ΔFKH,speckled bar) both indicate that this repression is specific and most likely mediated by the FKH domain. Although Fig. 3 shows an apparent reduction in expression of the 3xFKH-luc in ΔFKH-transfected cells, relative to that observed in control transfected cells, this trend has not been"

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 7-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 2Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Yeast. 1998; 16: 1471-1510Crossref Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 3Coleman R. Lewin T. Muoio D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The enzyme is responsible for transferring an acyl group from acyl-coenzyme-A to the sn-3 position of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) to form triacylglycerol (TAG). As the final step in TAG biosynthesis via the Kennedy pathway, it is the only step not involved in membrane biosynthesis. In plants and fungi, DGAT is associated with the membrane and lipid body fractions, particularly in oilseeds, where it contributes to the storage of carbon used as energy reserves. In animals, the role of DGAT is more complex. Triacylglycerols are synthesized and stored in several cell types including adipocytes and hepatocytes (4Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), but, in addition, DGAT may play a role in lipoprotein assembly and the regulation of plasma triacylglycerol concentration (4Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), as well as participate in the regulation of DAG levels (5Brindley D.N. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1991: 171-203Google Scholar, 6Nishizuka Y.

Using coding sequences from acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), expressed sequence tag data bases were searched and a gene identified that shared 20% identity with the mouse ACAT. After cloning and expression of the gene in insect cells, no ACAT activity was detected in isolated membranes; however, using [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA as substrate, a range of acceptors was examined and Cases et al. discovered DAG was the acceptor molecule, thus demonstrating DGAT activity. Hobbs et al. (8Hobbs D.H. Lu C. Hills M.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) reported the cloning of an Arabidopsis homologue of the mouse DGAT gene and confirmed the presence of DGAT activity in insect cells expressing the cDNA. Southern analysis indicated a single gene copy was present in Arabidopsis. Katavicet al. (9Katavic V. Reed D.W. Taylor D.C. Giblin E.M. Barton D.L. Zou J.-T. MacKenzie S.L. Covello P.S. Kunst L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and Zou et al. (10Zou J. Wei Y. Jako C. Kumar A. Selvaraj G. Taylor D.C. Plant J. 1999; 19: 645-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also implicated this gene in seed oil production when an insertional mutation (AS11) in the gene was found to lower seed oil levels and decrease DGAT activity. The locus, at ∼35 cM on chromosome II, was designatedTAG1. Routaboul et al. (11Routaboul J.-M. Benning C. Bechtold N. Caboche M. Lepiniec L. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) reported similar results identifying an Arabidopsis mutant (ABX45) harboring a frameshift mutation near the 5′ end of the TAG1 reading frame. This mutation resulted in a complete change in coding sequence after the first 60 amino acids. With the identification of a singleDGAT gene copy in Arabidopsis and the detection of DGAT activity even after a frameshift mutation disabled gene translation, Routaboul et al. concluded that another protein must be responsible for the remaining DGAT activity. We chose the oleaginous fungus Mortierella ramanniana as our source material since the organism produces up to 80% of its dry weight as TAG when grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions. M. ramanniana had previously been identified as exhibiting high levels of DGAT activity, and is easily cultured in the laboratory (12Kamisaka Y. Yokochi T. Nakahara T. Suzuki O. Lipids. 1993; 28: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,13Kamisaka Y. Nakahara T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our approach to the identification of DGAT involved protein purification, peptide sequencing, cloning of the corresponding cDNAs, and testing the gene products for DGAT function. In this report a new class of proteins involved in TAG production was identified. Two polypeptides from M. ramanniana microsomes that co-purified with DGAT activity were sequenced and their corresponding cDNAs cloned. Expression of the cDNA sequences in insect cells conferred high levels of DGAT activity on membranes isolated from those cells. Although the genes encode proteins with DGAT activity, they are unrelated to the previously identifiedDGAT gene family (now designated DGAT1), which is related to the ACAT gene family. We designate this new DGAT family DGAT2, and refer to the two genes in M. ramanniana as DGAT2A and DGAT2B. Based on nucleic acid comparison, we identified homologues of DGAT2genes in fungi, plants, and mammals. We describe the cloning of several of these genes, their expression in insect cells, and confirmation of DGAT activity by enzyme assay. Yellow 86 CL-6B-agarose, 1,2–18:1 diacylglycerol (prepared as a 150 mm stock in 2-methoxyethanol), andl-α-phosphatidic acid (prepared as a 50 mmstock in 1% (w/v) Triton X-100) were obtained from Sigma. Hydroxyapatite was obtained from Bio-Rad. Heparin CL6B-agarose was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). [1-14C]Oleoyl coenzyme A (50–55 Ci/mol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protease inhibitors from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany) were included in all buffers at the following concentrations: 0.1 µmaprotinin, 1 µm leupeptin, and 100 µmPefabloc. Restriction enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. M. ramanniana was cultured as described by Kamisaka (12Kamisaka Y. Yokochi T. Nakahara T. Suzuki O. Lipids. 1993; 28: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by passing 10–13-day-old cultures through Miracloth and removing excess liquid by hand wringing. Wet packed cells were stored at −70 °C. Lipid bodies were isolated from 70–75 g of wet packed cells. Immediately prior to use, cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in 200 ml of Buffer A (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 m KCl, 0.5 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA). Samples were lysed with an equal volume of 0.5-mm glass beads in a cell disrupter (Bead-Beater, Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) set on “Homogenize” for 45–90 s. The cell slurry containing glass beads was centrifuged at 500 × g, the supernatant removed, and the pellets washed with another 5 ml of Buffer A. Following centrifugation, the supernatants from both centrifugations were combined. This was divided into six ultracentrifuge tubes (25 × 89 mm), and each was overlaid with 5 ml of Buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 m KCl, and 0.3 m sucrose). Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C for 3 h. The lipid body fractions, floating on top of the overlays, were combined and solubilized in 50 ml of Buffer C (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 75 mm KCl, 0.5 m sucrose, and 1.5% Triton X-100). Non-solubilized material was removed by ultracentrifugation (90,000 × g for 1.8 h). The floating lipid layer was discarded, and the supernatant containing the solubilized fraction (Triton X-100 extract) was retained for column purification. DGAT activity was measured as the production of [14C]triacylglycerol from [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA and unlabeled dioleoyl-DAG. For non-solubilized samples, the reaction mixture (0.1 ml) consisted of enzyme extract, 3.67 µm[1-14C]oleoyl-CoA, and 1.5 mm 1,2–18:1 diacylglycerol in a buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100–150 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (w/v). Assay mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min and reactions terminated by adding 1.5 ml of heptane:isopropanol:0.5m H2SO4 (10:40:1, v/v/v). For solubilized samples 1,2–18:1 DAG was reduced to 0.5 mm, Triton X-100 was increased to 0.2%, and 300 µml-α-phosphatidic acid was included. Thel-α-phosphatidic acid was required to recover activity following solubilization with detergent as described by Kamisakaet al. (13Kamisaka Y. Nakahara T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), except we found that 300 µmrather than 500 µm phosphatidic acid gave a greater stimulation of activity. Following solubilization, product formation was dependent on the addition of exogenous DAG. Under these conditions the reaction rate was linear with respect to time for up to 10 min. After the assay was stopped, radiolabeled glycerolipids were isolated by adding 0.1 ml 1 m NaHCO3 and 1 ml of heptane containing 15 nmol/ml triolein as a carrier. The mixture was vortexed and the upper organic phase was removed to a new glass vial. The organic extract was back-extracted with 1 ml 1 m NaCl. Forty percent of the final organic phase was removed for liquid scintillation counting and the remaining organic phase evaporated to dryness under nitrogen gas. The residue was resuspended in hexane and subjected to TLC on Silica gel-G with a preadsorbent loading zone (model 31011; Analtech, Newark, DE). The TLC plate was developed in hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (50:50:1, v/v/v), dried, and scanned by a radioimage analyzer (model 3000; AMBIS, San Diego, CA) to determine the portion of radioactivity incorporated into TAG. Confirmation of TAG identity on the TLC plate was determined by comigration of the unlabeled triolein carrier and the [14C]TAG following exposure to iodine vapor. DGAT activity in the Triton X-100 extract was further purified by dye-binding chromatography on a Yellow 86-agarose column (2.5 cm × 6.4 cm) equilibrated with 75 mm KCl in Buffer D (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) glycerol). The column was washed with five volumes of equilibration buffer at 2 ml/min, and then activity was eluted with 500 mm KCl in Buffer D. DGAT activity was stable to freeze/thaw at this stage of purification so eluted fractions were assayed immediately and active fractions stored at −70 °C. Four preparations of Yellow 86-agarose-purified activity were combined and concentrated 12-fold by ultrafiltration (YM-30 membrane, Amicon, Beverly, MA). The activity was further purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography on a 1.0 cm × 25.5 cm column equilibrated with 500 mm KCl in Buffer D. The column was washed with 40 ml of equilibration buffer before bound proteins were eluted with a step gradient to 100 mm dipotassium phosphate in the equilibration buffer. Fractions containing DGAT activity were pooled and diluted 1:3.3 in Buffer D to reduce the KCl concentration from 500 to 150 mm. The diluted sample was applied to a heparin column (0.55 × 4.7 cm) equilibrated with 150 mm KCl in Buffer D. The column was washed with five volumes of equilibration buffer at 0.5 ml/min, and bound proteins were eluted in a 10-ml linear gradient of 150–500 mm KCl followed by 10 ml of 500 mm KCl in Buffer D at 0.25 ml/min. Fractions of 1.1 ml were collected. The protein concentration of extracts was determined according to Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (10–13%) was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with some of the modifications of Delepelaire (16Delepelaire P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 111-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resolving gel contained a 10–13% linear gradient of acrylamide stock stabilized by a 0–10% linear gradient of sucrose. Proteins were visualized by staining with silver according to the method of Blumet al. (17Blum H. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3630) Google Scholar) or with Coomassie Blue (0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250, 50% methanol (v/v), 10% acetic acid (v/v)). Proteins in active fractions eluting from the heparin step were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ice-cold acetone, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands at apparent molecular masses of 36 and 36.5 kDa were excised from the gel and sent to a commercial laboratory (Argo Bioanalytica, Morris Plains, NJ) for analysis. Gel slices were digested in situ with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. Amino acid sequencing was performed on a model 473 Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Total RNA was prepared from wet packed cells essentially as described by Joneset al. (18Jones A. Davies H.D. Voelker T. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The RNA was then used to synthesize double-stranded amplified cDNA using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized on an oligonucleotide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 394) and used as primers in polymerase chain reaction. The peptide sequences used for synthesizing the corresponding coding and complementary oligonucleotides were designed according to the partial amino acid sequence obtained. The Marathon cDNA was used as a template. The amplification mixture consisted of template, polymerase chain reaction buffer, 200–300 ng of each primer, 2.5 mmdNTP, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 50 µl. The amplification program consisted of one 10-min hold at 95 °C, 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (62 °C, 10 s, 10% ramp to 50 °C, 15 s), and primer extension (72 °C, 2 min). Products of the reaction were separated on a 0.7% agarose gels, excised, and then purified according to the QIAPREP DNA extraction handbook (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). The purified products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RACE reactions were completed according to the instruction manual for Marathon cDNA amplification kit using oligonucleotides designed from the products of the degenerate PCR. Gel-purified RACE products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector. Data base searches of the predicted proteins from the public genomic data bases ofCaenorhabditis elegans yielded three similar sequences. Searches of the public Saccharomyces cerevisiae predicted protein data base yielded one sequence. Searches of proprietaryArabidopsis expressed sequence tag data bases yielded partial sequences that were sufficient for PCR primer design. Total RNA was collected from these three organisms, and first strand cDNA libraries were created using the Marathon cDNA library kit (CLONTECH). The primers in TableI were used to PCR-amplify each of the sequences. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector.Table IPrimer sequences used to clone DGAT2 homologuesOrganismGenBank™ no.Primer sequencesC. elegansU648525′-GCGCGGCCGCCTGCAGTCACTGGAAGATGAG-3′5′-GCGCGGCCGCATGAGACTCCGGCTGAGCTCG-3′C. elegansAF0033845′-GAGCGGCCGCATGCCACATCTACTAGGAGTTGA-3′5′-CGGCGGCCGCCTGCAGTTAATTGATAACAAGTTGT-3′C. elegansZ815575′-GCGCGGCCGCATGCTAAACTACCAAATTCACA-3′5′-TGGCGGCCGCCTGCAGTCACTGAAAAACGAGCC-3′S. cerevisiaeZ751535′-CAGCGGCCGCATGTCAGGAACATTC-3′5′-CACTGCAGTTACCCAACTATCTTCAA-3′A. thalianaAL1334525′-AACTCGAGCTGCAGATGGGTGGTTCCAGAG-3′5′-AGCGGCCGCTCGAGTCAAAGAATTTTCAGC-3′ Open table in a new tab DNA sequence determinations were carried out using a modified protocol from Applied Biosystems. Sequence analyses were carried out using software of the Gen Codes Corp. (Ann Arbor, MI). The commercial BAC-to-BAC baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to express full-length proteins in cultured insect (Sf9) cells. Full-length DGAT2 open reading frames were amplified by PCR employing primers containing restriction sites at the 5′ ends (NotI and SpeI to the sense primers andPstI to the antisense primers). The PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1TOPO vector and sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the constructs. Full-length cDNAs in pCR2.1-TOPO vectors were digested with NotI and PstI and cloned into theNotI and PstI restriction sites of the pFASTBAC1 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Insect cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05–0.1 and harvested after 5 days at 27 °C by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in Buffer E (100 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl) and lysed by sonication (2 × 10 s). Cell walls and other debris were pelleted by centrifugation and discarded. Membranes were harvested by centrifugation of the supernatant fraction (100,000 × g for 1 h), and pellets were resuspended in Buffer E for enzyme assay. Assays were linear with respect to protein and time. Transformed insect cells were assayed for triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine by the following methods. An insect cell culture suspension was diluted to a standard optical density (usually 0.5) at an absorbance of 600 nm with culture medium. To a sample of 4.5 ml of insect cells in culture medium, 200 µl glacial acetic acid, internal standards consisting of 12.5 µg of C17:0 TAG and 25 µg of C15:0 phosphatidylcholine, and 10 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) were added. After vortexing, the phases were separated by centrifugation (about 500 × g, 5 min). The lower, organic phase was saved, and the upper, aqueous phase was re-extracted. The two organic extracts were combined and evaporated under nitrogen gas to a final volume of 0.4 ml. Twenty-five percent of the final volume was spotted onto a hard layer silica gel-GHL TLC plate with inorganic binder (Alltech Associates, Inc., Newark, Delaware). The TLC plate was developed for 30 min in hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:2, v/v/v) containing 20 mg/100 ml propyl gallate as an antioxidant. The plate was dried, sprayed with 0.001% primuline in 80% acetone, and the lipid bands identified under UV light. The TAG and phospholipid bands were scraped from the TLC plate into glass vials. The samples were methanolyzed in 2 ml of 5% H2SO4 in methanol at 90 °C for 2 h. After cooling, 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl and 0.50 ml of hexane were added and the top hexane layer analyzed for fatty acid methyl esters by gas chromatography (18Jones A. Davies H.D. Voelker T. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A summary of the purification of two proteins from M. ramanniana is presented in TableII. Initial steps included homogenization of the fungal paste, isolation of the lipid bodies by centrifugation, and solubilization of the membrane-bound proteins using the detergent Triton X-100. In the early stages of purification, high salt and detergent concentrations were necessary to maintain the solubility of the hydrophobic proteins. Enzyme activity was stable through the first column, Yellow 86-agarose (Fig.1A), but was rapidly lost during subsequent purification. For that reason, scale-up occurred by pooling and concentrating the eluted fractions from four Yellow 86-agarose preparations.Table IIPurification scheme for DGAT2FractionProteinActivitySpecific activityPurificationRecoverymgnmol/minnmol/min/mg-fold%1500 ×g2341.21218.00.51.0100Triton X-100 extract117.62069.217.633.8169.8Yellow load63.61458.822.944.1119.7Yellow flow-through washND719.2NDND59.0Yellow eluted1.6678.0440.3846.255.7Hydroxyapatite pool0.56340.2607.61167.627.9Heparin eluted0.20264.61323.02646.021.7Heparin fraction 220.002651.01961.53769.54.2Heparin fraction 280.007620.02631.65057.21.6A lipid body fraction isolated from 300 g of M. ramanniana cell paste were used for the preparation. Recovery values for MrDGAT2A (Heparin fraction 28) andMrDGAT2B (Heparin fraction 22) are reported separately in the last chromatographic step. Open table in a new tab A lipid body fraction isolated from 300 g of M. ramanniana cell paste were used for the preparation. Recovery values for MrDGAT2A (Heparin fraction 28) andMrDGAT2B (Heparin fraction 22) are reported separately in the last chromatographic step. In order to maintain maximal activity, subsequent chromatography was performed and fractions assayed on the same day. Significant purification was achieved using hydroxyapatite chromatography (Fig.1B). Although DGAT activity did not bind the column, 64% of the protein present bound the column and was removed. Active fractions from the flow-through of the hydroxyapatite column were purified on heparin CL 6B-agarose (Fig. 1C). Two activity peaks eluted from the heparin column, one during the 100–500 mmKCl gradient and one during the 500 mm KCl wash. Several protein bands (36.5, 36, 35, and 34 kDa) were associated with the first peak of activity (Fig. 2,fraction 22). The 34-kDa band did not correlate with DGAT activity in all chromatographic steps so it was eliminated (data not shown). The second peak had a higher specific activity (TableII) and contained a major protein band at 36 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2,fraction 28). Three proteins (36.5, 36, and 35 kDa) were identified from the purification as potential DGAT candidates. The three proteins associated with DGAT activity were gel-purified by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and then excised for protein sequencing. In-gel digestion of the proteins was performed using trypsin, and peptides were purified using reversed-phase HPLC. Examination of the peptide maps revealed that the 36.5-kDa map and the 35-kDa map were identical. Only peptides from the 36.5-kDa band were sequenced. The peptide map of the 36-kDa protein was significantly different than that of the 36.5/35-kDa proteins, and several of these peptides were sequenced. Degenerate primers (Fig. 3), designed from the amino acid sequences generated from the 36-kDa peptide, were constructed in both sense and antisense orientations. These primers were employed in different combinations to amplify cDNA produced from M. ramanniana total RNA. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and analyzed by DNA sequencing. Comparisons between peptide sequences obtained by Edman degradation not used to design the primers and the deduced amino acid sequences of PCR products were used to confirm the identity of the fragments. RACE using primers specific to these fragments was performed to yield a 1280-bp cDNA. This cDNA, which was designated DGAT2A (accession no.AF391089), contains a large open reading frame starting at bp 1. The most 5′ ATG codon of this reading frame is located at bp 26, allowing for the translation of a 355-amino acid polypeptide (DGAT2A, Fig.3). 2Sequence is also present in Patent Application WO 00/01713. A similar strategy was employed to clone the cDNA encoding the 36.5-kDa protein. We observed similarities between peptide sequences obtained from the 36- and 36.5-kDa polypeptides. Therefore, degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed to the sequences of the 36.5-kDa peptide that had the least homology to the 36-kDa protein (Fig. 3). Evolutionary PCR, combined with RACE using primers specific to these fragments, was performed to yield a 1133-bp cDNA. This cDNA, which was designated DGAT2B (accession no. AF391090), contains a single large open reading frame from the 5′ end to bp 1086. The most 5′ ATG codon of this reading frame is located at position 40, which allows for the translation of a 349-amino acid polypeptide (DGAT2B, Fig. 3).2 Both designated MrDGAT2 ATG codons are followed by a G residue, the consensus nucleotide for initiation of translation in eukaryotes at this position. DGAT2A encodes a polypeptide of a calculated molecular mass of 40,602.5 Da, and a theoretical pI value of 9.18. DGAT2Bencodes a polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 39595.49 Da, and a theoretical pI value of 9.40. These predicted molecular sizes fit very well with the apparent mass of the purified proteins, which indicates that DGAT2 polypeptides do not undergo major posttranslational proteolytic processing in vivo. The two polypeptides share 54% identity at the protein level (Fig. 3,top two sequences). GenBank™ searches showed that these polypeptides are not sequence- related to the known DGAT1 or any other acyltransferases, but were members of a previously unannotated gene family present in major phyla of eukaryotes, in particular fungi, plants, animals, and basal eukaryotes (Fig. 3). An alignment of members from different major eukaryotic phyla shows that these sequences are approximately conserved in length and they co-align over large stretches, with about 10% of totally conserved residues dispersed throughout. This represents strong evidence for common evolutionary origin. A preliminary phylogenetic tree built from currently available sequences (Fig.4) shows clustering of sequences by systematic relationship of species, indicating that DGAT2gene variations, as found in Morteriella, C. elegans, and mammals, appear to be the result of relatively late gene duplications, having occurred after the divergence of the respective main branches of eukaryotes. The two putativeDGAT genes identified in M. ramanniana were expressed in an insect cell system to determine if they indeed encoded polypeptides with DGAT activity. Membranes from baculovirus-infected insect cells expressing DGAT2 cDNAs were harvested and assayed for activity. A significant elevation in DGAT activity was detected relative to untransformed Sf9 cells for both DGAT2A and DGAT2B proteins of 94- and 37-fold, respectively. (Fig.5A). Full-length clones were obtained for several of the genes whose sequences showed homology to the M. ramanniana DGAT2 genes. The genes (S. cerevisiae DGAT2; C. elegans DGAT2A, 2B, and 2C; andArabidopsis thaliana DGAT2) were selected from different phyla to test the relatedness of protein function. These cDNAs were expressed in insect cells, and the isolated membranes were assayed for DGAT activity. A 2–180-fold increase in DGAT activity was observed, relative to untransformed Sf9 cells, confirming that the genes encode proteins which are related by function (Fig. 5,A and B). Since we did not tag the gene product, we were unable to determine the amount of each protein produced and normalize the data. In addition to the observed increa"

In addition, we found similar C-terminal fragments of β-amyloid precursor-like proteins 1 and 2; these were also cleaved at corresponding sites.

Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). EGF-R is activated by EGF, transforming growth factor-α, amphiregulin, and betacellulin. Following ligand binding, inactive monomeric EGF-R undergoes homodimerization or heterodimerization with other members of the HER family (2Yarden Y. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Activation of EGF-R is associated with phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region and thereby the recruitment of effector proteins that contain SH2 domains. For example, interaction of EGF-R with the Shc and Grb2 adaptor proteins links receptor activation to the Ras signaling pathway (3Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D.

Activation of EGF-R is also associated with the formation of complexes with the c-Src nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (6Luttrell D.K. Lee A. Lansing T.J. Crosby R.M. Jung K.D. Willard D. Luther M.

The finding that overexpression of EGF-R in fibroblasts confers growth in soft agar and induces tumorigenicity in nude mice has indicated that EGF-R can function as an oncogene (8Di Fiore P.P.

The interaction between EGF-R and c-Src is further supported by the demonstration that c-Src is required for EGF-R-dependent mitogenesis (10Wilson L.K. Luttrell D.K. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The human DF3/MUC1 mucin-like glycoprotein is highly overexpressed by human carcinomas (11Kufe D. Inghirami G. Abe M. Hayes D. Justi-Wheeler H. Schlom J. Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Whereas MUC1 expression is restricted to the apical borders of normal secretory epithelium, this transmembrane protein is aberrantly expressed by carcinoma cells at high levels over the entire cell surface (11Kufe D. Inghirami G. Abe M. Hayes D. Justi-Wheeler H. Schlom J. Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The MUC1 protein consists of an N-terminal ectodomain with variable numbers of conserved 20 amino acid tandem repeats that are subject to O-glycosylation (12Gendler S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J.

The C-terminal region includes a transmembrane domain and a 72-amino acid cytoplasmic tail that contains seven sites for tyrosine phosphorylation. The >250-kDa ectodomain associates with the ∼25 kDa C-terminal region as a heterodimer at the cell surface. β-Catenin, a component of the adherens junction of mammalian epithelial cells, binds directly to MUC1 at a SAGNGGSSL motif in the cytoplasmic domain (14Yamamoto M.

Cell lysates were prepared at 48 h after transfection. pIRESpuro2, pIRESpuro2-MUC1, and pIRESpuro2-MUC1(Y46F) were transfected into HCT116 colon carcinoma cells by LipofectAMINE. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 0.4 μg/ml of puromycin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co., San Diego, CA). Lysates from subconfluent cells were prepared as described previously (18Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from the cell lysates were incubated with mouse or rabbit IgG, monoclonal antibody DF3 (anti-MUC1) (11Kufe D. Inghirami G. Abe M. Hayes D. Justi-Wheeler H. Schlom J. Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), or anti-EGF-R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The immune complexes were prepared as described previously (18Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The immunoblots were probed with monoclonal antibody DF3, anti-EGF-R, anti-c-Src (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-P-Tyr (RC20H; Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), or anti-β-catenin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Reactivity was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies and chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). ZR-75-1 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and blocked with 5% fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) and 5% normal goat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., Westgrove, PA) in phosphate-buffered saline (blocking buffer) for 45 min at room temperature. After incubation with anti-MUC1 (1:400) and rabbit anti-EGF-R (1:100) in blocking buffer for 14 h at 4 °C, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) or Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., Westgrove, PA) for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then mounted onto coverslips using the slow fade mounting kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed by confocal microscopy (inverted Zeiss LSM 510). Images were captured at 0.6-nm increments along the z axis under ×63 magnification and converted to composite images by ImageSpace 3.10 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Purified wild-type and mutant MUC1/CD proteins were incubated with 0.1 unit of purified EGF-R (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co, San Diego, CA) in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase reactions and analysis of the reaction products were performed as described previously (19Li Y. Kuwahara H. Ren J. Wen G. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6061-6064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Purified wild-type and mutant MUC1/CD proteins were incubated with 0.1 unit of EGF-R in the absence and presence of 200 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. GST-c-Src or GST-β-catenin bound to glutathione beads was then added, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, the precipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-MUC1/CD (18Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) or anti-Tyr(P). To determine whether MUC1 forms a complex with EGF-R, anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates from lysates of human ZR-75-1 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-EGF-R. The results demonstrate that EGF-R coprecipitates with MUC1 (Fig.1 A). As a control, there was no detectable EGF-R in immunoprecipitates prepared with IgG (Fig.1 A). In the reciprocal experiment, analysis of anti-EGF-R immunoprecipitates with anti-MUC1 confirmed that EGF-R associates with MUC1 (Fig. 1 B). To extend these findings, 293 cells, which express low levels of EGF-R and are negative for MUC1 (18Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), were transfected to express EGF-R and MUC1. Immunoblot analysis of anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates with anti-EGF-R demonstrated coprecipitation of EGF-R and MUC1 (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained when anti-EGF-R immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-MUC1 (Fig. 1 D). These findings demonstrate that MUC1 constitutively associates with EGF-R. To assess the subcellular localization of MUC1 and EGF-R, confocal microscopy was performed with rabbit anti-EGF-R and mouse anti-MUC1 antibodies. In control ZR-75-1 cells, EGF-R was distributed uniformly over the cell membrane (Fig.2 A, left). Similar findings were obtained for the distribution of MUC1 (Fig.2 A, middle). Overlay of the EGF-R (green) and MUC1 (red) signals supported colocalization (red + green →yellow) (Fig. 2 A, right). Following EGF stimulation, the EGF-R signals were clustered in patches at the cell membrane (Fig. 2 B, left). An identical pattern was observed for MUC1 (Fig. 2 B, middle). Moreover, overlay of the signals showed that EGF-R and MUC1 colocalize in clusters at the cell membrane (Fig. 2 B,right). Analysis of the control and EGF-stimulated cells by coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated no detectable difference in the association between EGF-R and MUC1 (data not shown). These findings and those obtained in coprecipitation studies demonstrate that MUC1 and EGF-R associate constitutively at the cell membrane. To determine whether EGF-R phosphorylates MUC1, anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates from control and EGF-stimulated ZR-75-1 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P). The results demonstrate a detectable level of tyrosine-phosphorylated MUC1 in control cells (Fig.3 A). Moreover, EGF stimulation was associated with an increase in phosphorylation of MUC1 on tyrosine (Fig. 3 A). EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of MUC1 was also observed in 293 cells transfected to express EGF-R and MUC1 (Fig.3 B). The 72-amino acid MUC1 cytoplasmic domain (MUC1/CD) contains 7 tyrosines (see schema in Fig.4 D). To define potential sites of EGF-R phosphorylation, we incubated the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain (MUC1/CD) with EGF-R and [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products demonstrated that EGF-R phosphorylates MUC1/CD (Fig.3 C). Mutation of the Tyr8 site to Phe had no detectable effect on EGF-R-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1/CD (Fig.3 C). There was also no apparent effect when the Tyr20 or Tyr35 sites were mutated to Phe (Fig.3 C). By contrast, incubation of MUC1/CD(Y46F) with EGF-R was associated with a marked decrease in phosphorylation as compared with that found with wild-type MUC1/CD (Fig. 3 C). Mutation of Tyr26 also resulted in decreased phosphorylation, but to a lesser extent than that obtained with Y46F (Fig. 3 C). To determine whether the Tyr46 site is phosphorylated in vivo, human HCT116 cells, which express EGF-R and not MUC1, were stably transfected to express the empty vector, wild-type MUC1, or the MUC1(Y46F) mutant. Analysis of anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates with anti-Tyr(P) demonstrated that EGF-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1(Y46F) is decreased compared with that obtained with wild-type MUC1 (Fig. 3 D). Relative intensities of the anti-Tyr(P) signals were determined by densitometric scanning (Fig. 3 D). Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments (legend to Fig.3 D). The findings that the MUC1(Y46F) mutation decreases tyrosine phosphorylation only in part is in concert with additional tyrosine sites in the MUC1/CD, which can function as substrates for other tyrosine kinases. These results thus demonstrate that EGF-R phosphorylates MUC1 on Tyr46 in vitro and in cells.Figure 4EGF-R-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1 enhances the interaction of MUC1 with c-Src and β-catenin. A, purified MUC1/CD or MUC1/CD(Y46F) was incubated with EGF-R in the presence or absence of ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. GST-Src-SH2 or GST-β-catenin was then added, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins precipitated with glutathione beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-MUC1/CD and anti-Tyr(P). Equal loading of the proteins was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting with anti-β-catenin. B, lysates from ZR-75-1 cells treated with or without 10 ng/ml EGF for 5 min were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MUC1. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Src (upper panel), anti-β-catenin (middle panel), and anti-MUC1 (lower panel). C, HCT116/vector, HCT116/MUC1, and HCT116/MUC1(Y46F) cells were treated without or with 10 ng/ml EGF for 5 min at 37 °C. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-MUC1. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Src (upper panel), anti-β-catenin (middle panel), and anti-MUC1 (lower panel). D, amino acid sequence of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail. The GSK3β binding and phosphorylation site (STDRSP), the c-Src SH2 binding motif (YEKV), and the β-catenin binding site (SAGNGGSSLS) are highlighted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether EGF-R-mediated phosphorylation regulates the interaction of MUC1 with c-Src and β-catenin, we incubated MUC1/CD with EGF-R and ATP and then assessed binding to GST-Src-SH2 and GST-β-catenin. Immunoblot analysis of adsorbates to glutathione beads with anti-MUC1/CD showed that GST-Src SH2 binds to MUC1/CD following EGF-R phosphorylation (Fig.4 A). In addition, compared with MUC1/CD, there was substantially less binding of GST-Src-SH2 to the MUC1/CD(Y46F) mutant that had been incubated with EGF-R and ATP (Fig. 4 A). Similar findings were obtained for binding of GST-β-catenin (Fig.4 A). To assess whether EGF-R-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1 induces binding of MUC1 to c-Src and β-catenin in vivo, anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates from ZR-75-1 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Src or anti-β-catenin. Analysis of lysates from control ZR-75-1 cells demonstrated a low but detectable interaction of MUC1 with c-Src and β-catenin (Fig.4 B). In concert with the in vitro results, stimulation of ZR-75-1 cells with EGF induced the interaction of MUC1 with c-Src and β-catenin (Fig. 4 B). To confirm involvement of the MUC1 Tyr46 site, HCT116 cells stably expressing wild-type MUC1 or MUC1(Y46F) were stimulated with EGF. Immunoblot analysis of anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates with anti-c-Src demonstrated that, compared with wild-type MUC1, there was less EGF-induced binding of MUC1(Y46F) to c-Src (Fig. 4 C). Similar findings were obtained for β-catenin (Fig. 4 C). These results show that EGF-R-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1 Y46 induces the interaction of MUC1 with c-Src and β-catenin. The present findings and those recently reported for the mouse mammary gland (20Schroeder J. Thompson M. Gardner M. Gendler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13057-13064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) demonstrate that MUC1 interacts with EGF-R. The present results further show that EGF-R phosphorylates the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail on the YEKV motif. These findings and the recent demonstration that c-Src phosphorylates Tyr46 (19Li Y. Kuwahara H. Ren J. Wen G. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6061-6064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) have supported regulation of the YEKV site by both EGF-R and c-Src. The available evidence indicates that Tyr46 is functionally important in regulating the interactions of MUC1 with multiple signaling pathways. EGF-R-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1 Tyr46functions as a binding site for the c-Src SH2 domain. Moreover, EGF stimulation is associated with increased binding of MUC1 and c-Srcin vivo. EGF-R-mediated phosphorylation of MUC1 Tyr46 also induces binding of MUC1 with β-cateninin vitro and in cells. In addition, phosphorylation of MUC1 Tyr46 by EGF-R or c-Src down-regulates the interaction of MUC1 and GSK3β (Ref. 19Li Y. Kuwahara H. Ren J. Wen G. Kufe D. J. Biol.

In concert with these findings, the YEKV motif resides between the GSK3β binding and phosphorylation site (STDRSP) (18Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and the β-catenin binding site (SAGNGGSSLS) (14Yamamoto M. Bharti A. Li Y. Kufe D. J. Biol.

The aberrant overexpression of MUC1 in human carcinoma cells could thus contribute to the transformed phenotype by dysregulation of EGF-R, c-Src, β-catenin, and/or GSK3β signaling.

In the present study, we evaluated the role of cholesterol in synaptic plasticity and neuronal degeneration by a combination of adult rat hippocampal slice technology, a well-established procedure for limited cholesterol efflux, lipid metabolic labeling, extracellular recording of CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), and immunofluorescence.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Increased cholesterol efflux impairs short- and long-term synaptic plasticitySynaptic plasticity is a fundamental feature of the central nervous system (CNS) that allows synapses to ‘remember’ previous activity and express plastic changes to fine-tune current synaptic action.

https://openalex.org/W2113887382,"The two mammalian neuropeptides NPFF and NPAF have been shown to have important roles in nociception, anxiety, learning and memory, and cardiovascular reflex. Two receptors (FF1 and FF2) have been molecularly identified for NPFF and NPAF. We have now characterized a novel gene designated NPVF that encodes two neuropeptides highly similar to NPFF. NPVF mRNA was detected specifically in a region between the dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei. NPVF-derived peptides displayed higher affinity for FF1 than NPFF-derived peptides, but showed poor agonist activity for FF2. Following intracerebral ventricular administration, a NPVF-derived peptide blocked morphine-induced analgesia more potently than NPFF in both acute and inflammatory models of pain. In situ hybridization analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of FF1 and FF2 in the rat central nervous system. FF1 was broadly distributed, with the highest levels found in specific regions of the limbic system and the brainstem where NPVF-producing neurons were shown to project. FF2, in contrast, was mostly expressed in the spinal cord and some regions of the thalamus. These results indicate that the endogenous ligands for FF1 and FF2 are NPVF- and NPFF-derived peptides, respectively, and suggest that the NPVF/FF1 system may be an important part of endogenous anti-opioid mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2050569275,"The most frequently expressed drug resistance genes, MDR1 and MRP1, occur in human tumors with mutant p53. However, it was unknown if mutant p53 transcriptionally regulated both MDR1 and MRP1. We demonstrated that mutant p53 did not activate either the MRP1 promoter or the endogenous gene. In contrast, mutant p53 strongly up-regulated the MDR1 promoter and expression of the endogenous MDR1 gene. Notably, cells that expressed either a transcriptionally inactive mutant p53 or the empty vector showed no endogenous MDR1 up-regulation. Transcriptional activation of the MDR1 promoter by mutant p53 required an Ets binding site, and mutant p53 and Ets-1 synergistically activated MDR1 transcription. Biochemical analysis revealed that Ets-1 interacted exclusively with mutant p53s in vivo but not with wild-type p53. These findings are the first to demonstrate the induction of endogenous MDR1 by mutant p53 and provide insight into the mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2024195272,"Abstract The DSCR1(Adapt78) gene was independently discovered as a resident of the “Down syndrome candidate region”and as an “adaptive response”shock or stress gene that is transiently induced during oxidative stress. Recently the DSCR1 (Adapt78) gene product was discovered to be an inhibitor of the serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin, and its signaling pathways. We hypothesized thatDSCR1 (Adapt78) might also be involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease. To address this question we first studiedDSCR1 (Adapt78) in multiple human tissues and found significant expression in brain, spinal cord, kidney, liver, mammary gland, skeletal muscle, and heart. Within the brain DSCR1 (Adapt78) is predominantly expressed in neurons within the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, thalamus, and medulla oblongata. When we compared DSCR1 (Adapt78) mRNA expression in post-mortem brain samples from Alzheimer's disease patients and individuals who had died with no Alzheimer's diagnosis, we found that DSCR1 (Adapt78) mRNA levels were about twice as high in age-matched Alzheimer's patients as in controls.DSCR1 (Adapt78) mRNA levels were actually three times higher in patients with extensive neurofibrillary tangles (a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease) than in controls. In comparison, post-mortem brain samples from Down syndrome patients (who suffer Alzheimer's symptoms) also exhibited DSCR1 (Adapt78) mRNA levels two to three times higher than controls. Using a cell culture model we discovered that the amyloid β1–42 peptide, which is a major component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's, can directly induce increased expression of DSCR1 (Adapt78). Our findings associate DSCR1 (Adapt78) with such major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease as amyloid protein, senile plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles."
https://openalex.org/W2091090889,"Heterologous expression of the transient receptor potential-1 gene product (Trp1) encodes for a Ca2+ entry pathway, though it is unclear whether endogenous Trp1 contributes to a selective store-operated Ca2+ entry current. We examined the role of Trp1 in regulating both store-operated Ca2+ entry and a store-operated Ca2+ entry current, I(SOC), in A549 and endothelial cells. Twenty different 'chimeric' 2'-O-(2-methoxy)ethylphosphothioate antisense oligonucleotides were transfected separately using cationic lipids and screened for their ability to inhibit Trp1 mRNA. Two hypersensitive regions were identified, one at the 5' end of the coding region and the second in the 3' untranslated region beginning six nucleotides downstream of the stop codon. Antisense oligonucleotides stably decreased Trp1 at concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 nM, for up to 72 h. Thapsigargin increased global cytosolic Ca2+ and activated a I(SOC), which was small (-35 pA @ -80 mV), reversed near +40 mV, inhibited by 50 microM La3+, and exhibited anomalous mole fraction dependence. Inhibition of Trp1 reduced the global cytosolic Ca(2+) response to thapsigargin by 25% and similarly reduced I(SOC) by 50%. These data collectively support a role for endogenously expressed Trp1 in regulating a Ca2+-selective current activated upon Ca2+ store depletion."
https://openalex.org/W2135247786,"Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) are transcription factors whose activity is regulated by ligands and by coactivators or corepressors. We report the characterization of a new NR coregulator: proline-, glutamic acid-, leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1), a novel human protein that comprises 1,282 amino acids and is localized on chromosome 17. The primary structure of PELP1 consists of several motifs present in most transcriptional regulators including nine NR-interacting boxes (LXXLL motifs), a zinc finger, and glutamic acid- and proline-rich regions. We demonstrate that PELP1 is a coactivator of estrogen receptor α (ERα). PELP1 enhances 17β-estradiol-dependent transcriptional activation from the estrogen response element in a dose-dependent manner. PELP1 interacts with ERα and also with general transcriptional coactivators p300 and cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein. PELP1 was differentially expressed in various human and murine tissues with the highest expression levels in the testes, mammary glands, and brain. We also provide evidence supporting the developmental regulation of PELP1 expression in murine mammary glands, the detectable expression of PELP1 in human mammary cancer cell lines, and the enhanced expression of PELP1 in human breast tumors. These findings suggest that PELP1 is a novel coregulator of ERα and may have a role in breast cancer tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2122490109,"A fundamental difference between short-term and long-term forms of synaptic plasticity is the dependence on transcription and translation of new genes. Using organotypic cultures of hippocampal slices, we have investigated whether the modulation of synapses by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) also requires protein synthesis. Long-term treatment of hippocampal slice cultures with BDNF increased the number of docked vesicles, but not that of reserve pool vesicles, at CA1 excitatory synapses. BDNF also increased the levels of the vesicle proteins synaptophysin, synaptobrevin, and synaptotagmin, without affecting the presynaptic membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25, or the vesicle-binding protein synapsin-I. The increase in synaptophysin and synaptobrevin expression was moderate (2-fold) and occurred within 6 h after BDNF application. In contrast, synaptotagmin expression took 24 h to reach maximum levels (5-fold). The delayed increase in synaptotagmin was blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors, while the early increase in synaptophysin and synaptobrevin was not. Moreover, the BDNF-induced increase of synaptotagmin was blocked by inhibiting the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. However, BDNF did not activate PKA, and application of a PKA activator did not mimic the BDNF effect.

In the mammalian hippocampus, a single high-frequency stimulation of afferent fibers elicits an early phase of long-term potentiation (E-LTP)1 lasting for 2–3 h, while repeated (3–4 times) high-frequency stimulation results in long-lasting, late phase LTP (L-LTP) that lasts as long as the recordings can be maintained (1Frey U. Krug M. Reymann K.G. Matthies H. Brain Res. 1988; 452: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Similar short- and long-term forms of synaptic plasticity have been observed in the sea slugAplysia (2Bailey C.H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13445-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and the fruit fly Drosophila (3Dubnau J. Tully T. Annu. Rev.

A single application of the neuromodulator serotonin facilitates synaptic transmission at these synapses for a few hours. In contrast, 4–5 repeated applications of serotonin elicit a long-term facilitation that lasts for days. These forms of short- and long-term facilitation of synaptic transmission are thought to underlie short- and long-term sensitization, a simple form of learning and memory (2Bailey C.H. Bartsch D.

Serotonin has been identified as the neuromodulator that mediates both short- and long-term synaptic facilitation in Aplysia (2Bailey C.H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13445-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that neurotrophins, originally defined as a family of trophic factors for neuronal survival and differentiation, may serve as a new class of neuromodulators that regulate synaptic transmission, synapse development, and plasticity in vertebrates (6McAllister A.M. Katz L.C. Lo D.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Two major effects have been described at the neuromuscular synapses: (i)acute potentiation of transmitter release; (ii)long-term regulation of synapse development. Acute application of BDNF or neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) rapidly enhances synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (7Lohof A.M. Ip N.Y. Poo M.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The acute effect of neurotrophins is due strictly to an enhancement of transmitter release probability at presynaptic sites (7Lohof A.M. Ip N.Y. Poo M.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 8Stoop R. Poo M.M. Science. 1995; 267: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin or cycloheximide does not prevent the effects of neurotrophins, suggesting that acute potentiation of synaptic transmission by neurotrophins is completely independent of protein synthesis (8Stoop R. Poo M.M. Science. 1995; 267: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Chang S. Popov S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4095-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the long-term mode, treatment with BDNF or NT-3 (2–3 days) results in a sustained increase in quantal size as well as a more reliable impulse-evoked synaptic transmission (10Wang T. Xie K.W. Lu B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, BDNF or NT-3 enhances the expression of synaptic vesicle proteins such as synaptophysin and synapsin-I, and increases the number of synaptic varicosities in the presynaptic site (10Wang T. Xie K.W. Lu B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acute neurotrophic modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity has also been observed in the central nervous system (CNS). For example, application of BDNF or NT-3 to cultured hippocampal or cortical neurons rapidly enhances neuronal activity and synaptic transmission (11Kim H.G. Wang T. Olafsson P. Lu B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12341-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12Lessmann V. Gottmann K. Heumann R.

Application of exogenous BDNF facilitates tetanus-induced LTP at the CA1 synapses in neonatal hippocampal slices, in which the endogenous BDNF levels are low (15Figurov A. Pozzo-Miller L. Olafsson P. Wang T. Lu B. Nature. 1996; 381: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of endogenous BDNF activity, either by the BDNF scavenger TrkB-IgG, or by BDNF gene knockout, reduces the magnitude of tetanus-induced LTP in adult hippocampus, in which the endogenous BDNF levels are high (14Korte M. Carroll P. Wolf E. Brem G. Thoenen H. Bonhoeffer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8856-8860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 15Figurov A. Pozzo-Miller L. Olafsson P. Wang T.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 653-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Acute modulation of hippocampal LTP by BDNF may result from the BDNF-induced increase in the synaptic responses to high-frequency stimulation (15Figurov A. Pozzo-Miller L. Olafsson P. Wang T. Lu B. Nature. 1996; 381: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 18Gottschalk W. Pozzo-Miller L.D. Figurov A. Lu B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6830-6839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect requires activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and is insensitive to inhibitors of new protein synthesis (19Gottschalk W.A. Jiang H. Tartaglia N. Feng L. Figurov A. Lu B. Learn. Mem. 1999; 6: 243-256PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the hippocampal synapses in BDNF knockout mice reveals three major deficits: (i) a pronounced impairment in the synaptic responses to high frequency stimulation that correlates with a reduction in LTP; (ii) a selective decrease in synaptobrevin and synaptophysin in synaptosomes; and (iii) a marked reduction in the number of docked synaptic vesicles, without affecting the total number of vesicles (20Pozzo-Miller L. Gottschalk W.A. Zhang L. McDermott K. Du J. Gopalakrishnan R. Oho C. Shen Z. Lu B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The defects in LTP and synaptic responses to high frequency stimulation, as well as the reduction in the two vesicle proteins, can be rescued by treatment of the knockout slices with BDNF for a few hours (16Patterson S.L. Abel T. Deuel T.A. Martin K.C. Rose J.C. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 20Pozzo-Miller L. Gottschalk W.A. Zhang L. McDermott K. Du J. Gopalakrishnan R. Oho C. Shen Z. Lu B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, application of BDNF to cortical synaptosomes elicits a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin-I, leading to an increase in availability of synaptic vesicles for release (21Jovanovic J.N. Czernik A.J. Fienberg A.A. Greengard P. Sihra T.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). These results suggest that acute modulation of CNS synapses by BDNF is achieved by protein synthesis-independent modifications of existing presynaptic proteins. Neurotrophins are also involved in long-term modulation of CNS synapses. Substantial evidence suggests their role in the development of ocular dominance columns in cat and rodents in vivo (22Maffei L. Berardi N. Domenici L. Parisi V. Pizzorusso T. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4651-4662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Cabelli R.J. Horn A. Shatz C.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Long-term treatment of slices derived from the visual cortex with neurotrophins elicits profound effects on dendritic growth (24McAllister A.K. Lo D.C. Katz L.C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In dissociated cultures of hippocampal or cortical neurons, chronic application of BDNF results in complex effects on synaptic transmission (25Takei N. Sasaoka K. Inoue K. Takahashi M. Endo Y. Hatanaka H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Vicario-Abejon C. Collin C. McKay R.D. Segal M. J.

Pittman A.J. Lo D.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3221-3232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying long-term modulation of synaptic transmission in the CNS by BDNF are essentially unexplored. Using organotypic slice cultures as a model system, the present study shows that long-term BDNF treatment increases the number of synaptic vesicles docked at active zones of excitatory CA1 synapses. The expression of specific synaptic vesicle proteins synaptophysin, synaptobrevin, and synaptotagmin hippocampal slices is also enhanced by long-term treatment with BDNF. The delayed increase in synaptotagmin levels is prevented by inhibiting either protein synthesis, while the early increases in synaptophysin and synaptobrevin are not. Moreover, the effect of BDNF on synaptotagmin could be blocked by the inhibitor of cAMP-signaling cascade, but the activation of the cascade does not mimic the BDNF effect. These results suggest that BDNF exerts its actions on hippocampal synapses by two different mechanisms, a rapid protein synthesis-independent pathway, and a delayed cAMP- and protein synthesis-dependent cascade reminiscent of the late phase of LTP. Hippocampal slices (400 μm thick) were prepared from postnatal day 7 (P7) rats. The slices were cultured on Unlaminated Hydrophilic Fluoropore membranes (Millipore) placed on the inserts of 6-well plates (Fisher) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2, 99% humidity incubator. The slices were maintained for 5 days in horse serum-containing medium (50% minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, 25% HBSS, 10 mmHEPES, 0.5% GlutaMax II, glucose, pH 7.2, 25% horse serum), then for 3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium N1 biotin-containing medium plus 3% serum, and finally for 1 day in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium N1 biotin-containing medium. The medium was then replaced with the serum-free medium containing 6 nm BDNF (kindly provided by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals), and the cultures were treated with BDNF for 3–72 h. For some experiments, drugs such as PKA inhibitorRp-cAMPs or activatorSp-cAMPs (100 μm; Biolog Life Science Institute), or the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (20 μm; Sigma) were added to the medium. Slices were pretreated with drugs for 30 min before the BDNF treatment was initiated. All medium reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Three independent pairs of cultures (control and BDNF-treated), each contained multiple slices, were used for electron microscopy (EM) analysis. In each pair of cultures, sister slices were used for Western blot analysis of synaptotagmin to confirm the effectiveness of BDNF. The remaining sister slices from the pair of cultures were fixed and processed for EM using standard procedures (30Pozzo Miller L.D. Landis D.M. Synapse. 1993; 13: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, slices with the attached filter membrane were transferred to 35-mm plastic culture dishes and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.3), post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 msodium cacodylate, stained en bloc with 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated, and flat embedded in Epon (24 h at 60 °C). After curing, the Epon disc containing the slices was separated from the plastic dish. Semi-thin sections (0.5 μm) were cut, stained with toluidine blue, and used to locate and trim the CA1 region. Ultra-thin sections were cut at ∼80 nm, collected on grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then examined in a JEOL-100CX transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Asymmetric spine synapses within CA1 stratum radiatum were photographed at a final magnification of ×33,000. The EM negatives were then scanned at 300 dots per inch, converted to positive images, and saved as digital images. The area of the presynaptic terminals and the length of the active zones were measured using NIH Image directly from the digital images. Treatment with BDNF in general did not significantly affect the size of CA1 synapses. Preliminary results indicated that treatment of the slice cultures with BDNF for 5–9 days increased active zone length by only ∼11%. 2W. J. Tyler and L. Pozzo-Miller, unpublished observations. However, larger objects within the tissue block have a higher probability of being sectioned, and thus observed in the sections. To avoid the bias of selecting the larger synapses during sampling in single thin sections, only synapses having approximately equal area of presynaptic terminals and length of active zones were chosen for analysis. This approach also permitted the normalization of the vesicle number per length of active zone (in microns) and presynaptic terminal area (in squared microns), allowing unequivocal assessment of vesicle distributions within presynaptic terminals without the confounding effect of variable synapse size. A total of 84 synapses from three pairs of slices (control n = 43 synapses, N = 3; BDNFn = 41 synapses, N = 3) fitted the above criteria were used for analysis. Corrections for remaining biases, such as tissue shrinkage and section thickness, were not performed because it is expected that those biases would affect both treatment groups equally. The diameter of small, clear and round synaptic vesicles are fairly homogeneous of ∼50 nm, smaller than the thickness of ultra-thin sections. Thus, most vesicles can be observed within the thickness of the sections. We counted only the small, clear and round vesicles with at least one-half the circumference of their total plasma membrane clearly visible (30Pozzo Miller L.D. Landis D.M. Synapse. 1993; 13: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Docked vesicles were defined as those located within one vesicle diameter (∼50 nm) from presynaptic membrane (30Pozzo Miller L.D. Landis D.M. Synapse. 1993; 13: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), while reserve pool vesicles included the remaining set of vesicles within the presynaptic terminal profile. All analyses were performed in a blinded fashion; the observers acquiring the images and performing the measurements were not aware of the treatment groups. Slice cultures were harvested and homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholic acid, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4) using a Dounce tissue grinder at 4 °C. The homogenates were incubated on ice for 30 min. Insoluble materials were removed by high-speed centrifugation for 20 min (12,000 ×g). The supernatants were carefully taken into clean tubes, and protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein (3 μg per lane) in sample buffer (1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm Tris, 0.05% biphenyl blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) were denatured, separated on a 4–20% Tris glycine gel. The proteins on the gels were transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), and the membranes were incubated with blocking buffer (0.2 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 5% (w/v) nonfat milk, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, and then probed at 4 °C overnight with the following monoclonal antibodies from Chemicon: actin (1:20,000), synaptophysin (1:2,000), synapsin I (1:5,000), syntaxin (1:10,000), SNAP-25 (1:500), neuron-specific enolase (1:1,000); or the following antibodies from Dr. M. Takahashi synaptotagmin (monoclonal, 1:10,000), or antibody for synaptobrevin (polyclonal, 1:20,000). In most cases, two membranes were used. One membrane was cut to three pieces and reacted with synaptotagmin (65 kDa), synaptophysin (38 kDa), and SNAP-25 (25 kDa) antibodies, while the other membrane was cut to three pieces and reacted with synapsin I (85 kDa), actin (43 kDa), syntaxin (35 kDa), and synaptobrevin (18 kDa) antibodies. The membranes were rinsed with washing buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 0.2 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl) and incubated with secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by chemiluminescent detection (ECL; Pierce). In each experiment with multiple experiment conditions (control or drug-treatments), 3–5 slices for each condition were pooled and harvested. Protein samples from the same experimental conditions were run on an SDS gel in triplicate (n = 3). The blot was scanned and the intensities of the bands were quantified using NIH Image software. Signals from experimental conditions were normalized to the average signals in the control condition in the same blot. The same experiments (with multiple experiment conditions) were repeated 5–10 times (N = 5–10), and mean ± S.E. are presented. Slice cultures were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked and permeabilized with 10% horse serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100, all in phosphate-buffered saline. The cultures were incubated at 4 °C overnight in one of the following primary antibodies: anti-synaptophysin and anti-synaptobrevin (1:250, both polyclonal from Santa Cruz), and anti-synaptotagmin (1:10,000, monoclonal from Dr. Takahashi). After incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:250, Santa Cruz), the cultures were treated with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate or avidin-Thy3 (Vector Labs), mounted with Vectashield and imaged with a confocal microscope. Low magnification images were taken to include as much as the CA1 region as possible, mostly with a ×10 objective, and exported to NIH Image. For synaptophysin and synaptobrevin stainings, all the pixels were selected and their intensity was plotted in a frequency distribution histogram. Appropriate controls lacking primary antibodies were performed for each antibody used. Slices were cultured in the same way as described above. On the day of PKA assay, the cultures were incubated with nothing (control), forskolin (20 μm, positive control), or BDNF (4 nm) for 10 min at 37 °C and harvested in the following PKA lysis buffer: 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (Sigma). The lysates were homogenized using a Dounce glass homogenizer with pestle “B” and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. PKA assay (31Ganguly S. Gastel J.A. Weller J.L. Schwartz C. Jaffe H. Namboodiri M.A. Coon S.L. Hickman A.B. Rollag M. Obsil T. Beauverger P. Ferry G. Boutin J.A. Klein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8083-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 mm Na citrate (pH 7.2), 5 μg of PKA substrate peptide (PGRQRRHTLPANEFRC), 15 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6 μCi/nmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and either 5 μg of cytosolic extracts of the slice cultures or 1–30 units of recombinant catalytic subunit of PKA enzyme (Promega). After incubation 5-μl aliquots were spotted onto P81 Whatmman filter papers and the filers were washed 5 × 20 min in 75 mmphosphoric acid. The samples were air-dried and the radioactivity counted. A standard curve using different amounts of recombinant PKA was constructed and the PKA activities in slices treated with or without forskolin or BDNF were calculated using the standard curve. All parameters were analyzed using Student'st test, or ANOVA followed by Scheffé's procedure for multiple comparisons as post-hoc analysis; all data shown is presented as mean ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.). Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures prepared from P7 rats were used to determine the structural changes at the hippocampal synapses induced by long-term treatment with BDNF. After 9 days in vitro, the hippocampal slice cultures were treated with 6 nm BDNF for 48 h, before harvesting for quantitative electron microscopy (EM) analysis. The slices were fixed, stained, and embedded. The Epon blocks were trimmed, and the CA1 region identified. Excitatory synapses on CA1 dendritic spines were identified by the following criteria: (i) presynaptic profiles containing small (∼50 nm diameter), round and clear synaptic vesicles; (ii) prominent electron-dense postsynaptic densities, characteristic of type-I asymmetric synaptic junctions; and (iii) postsynaptic dendritic spines, identified by their lack of microtubules and mitochondria, continuity with a dendritic shaft, and overall size and shape. Synaptic junctions fulfilling the above criteria are well established to represent glutamatergic excitatory synapses (32Peters A. Palay S. Webster H. The Fine Structure of the Nervous System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991Google Scholar). To avoid the bias of selecting the larger synapses during sampling in single thin sections, only synapses having approximately equal area of presynaptic terminals and length of active zones were chosen for analysis. From three independent pairs of slices, we analyzed a total of 84 synapses (controln = 43; BDNF n = 41) that fitted the above criteria. On average, the terminal areas were 0.229 ± 0.009 μm2 in control and 0.233 ± 0.009 μm2in BDNF-treated slices, and the active zone lengths (L) were 0.251 ± 0.006 μm in control and 0.264 ± 0.006 μm in BDNF-treated slices. Small, round and clear synaptic vesicles were clearly observed in the CA1 spine synapses. The distribution of synaptic vesicles was measured in two distinct and mutually exclusive pools within presynaptic terminals at CA1 excitatory synapses. Docked vesicles are defined as those in close apposition to, or within 50 nm from the presynaptic active zone (33Dickinson-Nelson A. Reese T.S. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 42-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reserve pool vesicles are identified as those synaptic vesicles within the presynaptic terminals, but outside of the docked vesicle region (20Pozzo-Miller L. Gottschalk W.A. Zhang L. McDermott K. Du J. Gopalakrishnan R. Oho C. Shen Z. Lu B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Long-term BDNF treatment significantly increased the number of docked vesicles per unit length of active zone at these excitatory spine synapses in CA1 stratum radiatum(Fig. 1A). The number of docked vesicles per micron active zone (DV/μm) increased from 14.7 ± 0.7 in control, to 17.3 ± 0.8 after BDNF treatment (p = 0.0139; Fig. 1B). In contrast, there were no differences in the number of reserve pool vesicles per unit terminal area between control (304.4 ± 7.3 reserve vesicle/μm2 of presynaptic terminal area) and BDNF-treated slices (311.9 ± 9.2 reverse vesicle/μm2; p = 0.5269; Fig.1B). From the length of the active zone (L) and the number of docked vesicle counted in the two-dimensional electron micrographs, we estimated the total number of docked vesicles per active zone (TDV = 0.907 × (DV/μm)2 × L2(20Pozzo-Miller L. Gottschalk W.A. Zhang L. McDermott K. Du J. Gopalakrishnan R. Oho C. Shen Z. Lu B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TDV was 14.1 in control and 21.0 in BDNF-treated slices, a 50% increase. These results suggest that BDNF selectively increases the number of docked vesicles without affecting the reserve pool vesicles at excitatory CA3-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices.

To understand how GATA-4 functions under diverse conditions, we sought to identify its coactivators. We tested p300 as a coactivator in GATA-4-dependent transient transcription assays in NIH3T3 cells and found that p300 synergistically activated GATA-4-dependent transcription on both synthetic and natural promoters. Direct physical interactions between the N- and C-zinc finger domains of GATA-4 and the cysteine/histidine-rich region 3 (C/H3) of p300 were identified in immunoprecipitation and glutathioneS-transferase pull-down experiments. Deletion of the C/H3 region of p300 abolished its coactivator activity indicating that the physical interaction was required for functional synergy. Through the use of a series of GATA-4 zinc finger mutants, the amino acids WRR in the C finger were identified as critical to the interaction. The adenoviral E1A protein or a peptide encoding the C/H3 region of p300 could inhibit GATA-4-dependent transcription, presumably by competing for p300 binding. Furthermore, deletion of the region of p300 encoding the histone acetyltransferase activity abolished its effect on GATA-4-dependent transcriptional activity.

Since GATA-4 controls gene expression in many cellular environments, its activity is likely regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or acetylation as has been shown for GATA-1 (8Crossley M.

GATA-4 mRNA is present in the heart at embryonic day 8, is expressed throughout development and is readily detectable in the adult mouse heart (12Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In GATA-4 knockout mice the precardiac mesoderm fails to migrate to the ventral midline resulting in the formation of two aberrant heart tubes. Although cardiac myocytes form in GATA-4 null mouse embryos the role of GATA-4 in this process remains obscure because the level of GATA-6 mRNA is up-regulated in mutant embryos. In P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, inhibition of GATA-4 expression prevents the development of cardiac muscle cells while ectopic expression of GATA-4 accelerates cardiogenesis and increases the number of cardiac myocytes obtained by 10-fold (16Grepin C. Nemer G. Nemer M. Development. 1997; 124: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility remains that GATA-4 may participate in the cardiogenic process. GATA-4 has been shown to interact with the homeobox protein Nkx 2.5/Csx which also expressed early in the developing heart (11Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3120-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This interaction results in synergistic activation of the atrial natriuretic factor gene and activates cardiogenesis in P19 cells to a greater degree than GATA-4 alone (11Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3120-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 12Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that GATA-4 activity is involved in cardiac muscle hypertrophy associated with pressure overload. First, mutation of GATA-binding sites in the promoters of two hypertrophy responsive genes, encoding angiotensin receptor type 1a, and β-myosin heavy chain (MHC),1 diminish or ablate the pressure overload response (5Herzig T.C. Jobe S.M. Aoki H. Molkentin J.D. Cowley Jr., A.W. Izumo S. Markham B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7543-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 6Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12811-12818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Second, GATA-4 was detected in nuclear extracts from pressure overloaded hearts but not normal hearts by gel shift experiments (5Herzig T.C. Jobe S.M. Aoki H. Molkentin J.D. Cowley Jr., A.W. Izumo S. Markham B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7543-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Third, GATA-4 was shown to interact with NF-AT3 and overexpression of the calcineurin/NF-AT pathway was shown to initiate cardiac hypertrophy (7Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Fourth, GATA-4 regulates the expression of a number of hypertrophy responsive genes including those encoding ANF and brain natriuretic peptide (19Grepin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3115-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These results suggest that GATA-4, either by itself or in concert with other regulatory factors, is a regulator of the hypertrophic response. A potential GATA-4 co-activator is p300. p300−/− knockout mice die between 9 and 11.5 days of gestation from heart defects (20Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Mutant embryos have enlarged heart cavities, significantly reduced trabeculation, and pericardial effusion. Interestingly, the expression level of the β-MHC gene (the major contractile protein in the fetal heart) is reduced. This gene is also regulated by GATA-4 (6Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The adenovirus E1A protein, is known to interact with and inhibit the function of p300 and several other regulatory proteins. When overexpressed in cardiac myocytes, E1A has been shown to down-regulate many muscle-specific genes (21Kirshenbaum L.A. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 22Bishopric N.H. Zeng G.Q. Sato B. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20584-20594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). GATA proteins regulate a subset of these genes. These observations suggest a possible interaction between GATA proteins and p300. Furthermore, while this work was in preparation, it was reported that p300 and GATA-5 interact to regulate the ANF gene (23Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kaburagi S. Wada H. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34096-34102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which p300 coactivates GATA-5 was not determined. p300 has been shown to increase the activity of several transcription factors including cAMP-response element-binding protein, p53, signal transducers and activators of transcription, HNF4, MyoD, GATA-1, GATA-5, and GATA-6. p300 possesses an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity that can acetylate histones to modify chromatin structure as well as other transcription factors (24Grunstein M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12515-12520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, p300 has multiple activation domains and interacts directly with TATA-binding protein and transcription factor IIB (30Dallas P.B. Yaciuk P. Moran E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1726-1731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H.

In the present study, we investigate the potential interactions between GATA-4 and p300. p300 was found to synergistically enhance the transcriptional activity of GATA-4 on an artificial reporter containing regulatory GATA sites from both the ANF and α-MHC promoters in transient reporter assays. We mapped the regions in GATA-4 and p300 required for their interaction and demonstrate that mutations, which prevented the interaction, abolished the functional cooperation. Additionally, co-expression of either a peptide encoding the C/H3 domain of p300 or the adenoviral E1A protein with GATA-4 alone or in combination with p300 blocks GATA-4-dependent transcriptional activity. Finally, we show that the p300 HAT domain is required for coactivation of GATA-4 transcription. pMT-GATA-4 (2Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. David Wilson. CMV-p300HA, pGEM-E1A, and GST-E1A were obtained from Drs. D. Livingston, T. Leff, and D. Chakravarti, respectively. pFLAG-CMV-2 was from Sigma. Sequences encoding peptide fragments of GATA-4 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) (Gal4-GATA-4) were cloned into pM (CLONTECH). Clones encoding peptide fragments of GATA-4 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-GATA-4) were generated by subcloning GATA-4 PCR fragments from the appropriate Gal4-GATA-4 plasmids into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GATA-4 N-zinc finger-(1–284) and C-zinc finger-(253–441) constructs and mutants thereof were derived from the full-length GATA-4 wild type and mutants by PCR and cloned into pRSET (Invitrogen) vector (N-zinc finger) or pcDNA6-myc/his (C-zinc finger). pFLAG-GATA-4 was made by subcloning the EcoRI GATA-4 fragment from pMT2GATA-4 into pFLAG-CMV-2. pFLAG-CMV-2-BAP encoding a FLAG-tagged bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP) was from Sigma. DNA sequences encoding p300 N1 (AAs 1–597), N2 (AAs 598–1185), N3 (AAs 1186–1860), and C (AAs 1861–2414) were generated by PCR and cloned into pRSET. p300 (ΔC/H1) deleting sequences encoding of AAs 348 to 412 and p300 (ΔC/H3) encoding a full-length p300 except for a deletion of sequences encoding AAs 1737 to 1836 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. To construct the p300 HAT deletion mutant, p300 was cloned into pcDNA3.1 (NotI/HindIII fragment) and the 5′ end of p300 was excised on an XbaI fragment. The vector containing the 3′ sequence was religated and used for PCR-based mutagenesis (Stratagene). Sequences encoding AAs 1415–1436 of p300 were deleted. The 5′ XbaI fragment was then cloned back to the mutated 3′ end via the XbaI site. pCI-E1A was produced by subcloning E1A from pGEM-E1A into the pCI vector (Promega). E1A(Δ2–36) was constructed by deleting AAs 2–36 of E1A. The reporter plasmid pTATAluc was made by cloning an oligo containing the rat α-myosin heavy chain TATA sequence into the HindIII site of pGL2 basic (Promega). The sequence of the plus strand of the TATA oligo was 5′-AGCTTCGTGCAGTATAAAGGG-3′. pANFGATA6luc contains 6 GATA sites from the ANF promoter (at position −120) cloned into theKpnI site of pTATAluc. The sequence of the plus strand of the ANF GATA oligonucleotide is 5′-CTGATACTCTGATAACTCTGATAACTGGTAC-3′. The native ANF reporter plasmid (−638/Luc) was from Youngsook Lee (11Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3120-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The reporter containing the α-MHC GATA sites has 3 copies of the oligonucleotide PRED (33Molkentin J.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. Markham B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cloned into the SmaI site of pTATAluc. The β-MHC promoter was a gift from K. Ojama. The fragment containing the β-MHC promoter from the transcription start site to approximately −2200 was subcloned into pGL2 basic. The sequence of all clones was verified by DNA sequence analysis. COS7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged GATA-4, HA-p300, or both. After 72 h, cells were harvested and lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer A (1% Triton, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2) and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were incubated with FLAG-agarose for 2 h at room temperature, and the beads were washed 4 times with lysis buffer for 1 min at room temperature and eluted with SDS sample buffer. The samples were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and blotted with rat anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and detected with ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA-His-GATA-4, Gal-DBD-1–80, 80–214, 214–441, and CMV-p300. The cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (as above). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × gfor 10 min. The lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Gal4-DBD antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-T7 tag antibody (Novogen), followed by precipitation with 50 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. After 4 washes with lysis buffer B (described above), the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. The resulting immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on 4–20% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gels, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with rat anti-HA antibody. The blots were developed with ECL chemiluminescence reagents. All GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The bacterial cultures were induced by 1 mmisopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The bacteria were then lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (as above). The bacterial lysates were brought to 1% Triton and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was discarded and soluble extracts were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C before washing three times by inversion for 1 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors lysis buffer. The concentration of proteins immobilized on beads was quantified by SDS-PAGE and titrated against bovine serum albumin standards (Sigma) after Coomassie Blue staining. Binding assays were performed with radioactively labeled proteins synthesized in vitro using a TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal amounts of immobilized GST fusion proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of35S-labeled proteins in GST binding buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm Na acetate, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors, and 2 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml). After four 1-min washes at room temperature in GST binding buffer, beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, streptomycin (10 g/liter), and penicillin (10 g/liter). All transfections were performed in 6-well plates with LipofectAMINE Plus reagents from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of luciferase reporter constructs PREDluc, β-MHCluc, ANFluc, or G4-ANFluc, and 0.1 μg of pMT2-GATA-4 or pMT2-CAT, 0.6 μg of pcDNA3-p300 or pcDNA3-p300HAT mutant, 0.6 μg of E1A wild type or E1A Mutant(Δ2–36). CMV-β-gal (20 ng in each well) was used as internal control. Luciferase activity was measured in a microplate luminometer (LB96V; Berthold), normalized to β-Gal activity. Fold activation represents a comparison of the ratio of luciferase/β-Gal activity for each condition with that of the reporter vector control which was arbitrarily set at 1. Each value presented is the average of triplicate samples and is representative of multiple independent experiments (n greater than or equal to 3). The data were statistically analyzed with Student's ttest. It has been suggested that p300 can increase GATA-4 activity in reporter assays (34Blobel G.A. Nakajima T. Eckner R. Montminy M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To further characterize this functional interaction, we examined the ability of p300 to influence GATA-4 transcriptional activity in transient transfection assays in NIH 3T3 cells. We first investigated the activity of p300 and GATA-4 on a functional GATA site from the ANF promoter. This GATA site, located at position −120 in the ANF promoter, was recently shown to support both GATA-4 and GATA-6-dependent transcription (35Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). From a reporter containing 6 copies of this GATA site upstream of a TATA sequence, GATA-4 alone increased activity 15-fold while p300 alone increased activity about 7.5-fold (Fig.1A). Together they increased activity 70-fold over the basal promoter alone, a level that was much more than additive, indicating a functional synergy between these two regulatory proteins. This functional synergy was also observed when a reporter driven by the proximal ANF promoter (−637 to +10) was used (Fig. 1B). With this natural promoter, GATA-4 alone gave 5-fold activation while p300 alone gave a 40-fold activation, presumably due to coactivation of other proteins that regulate this promoter. In combination GATA-4 and p300 activated the ANF promoter 95-fold over basal, a much greater than additive effect. These results confirm that a functional interaction can occur between GATA-4 and p300 in the context of a natural promoter. We examined a second hypertrophy responsive promoter for activation by GATA-4 and p300. On the β-MHC promoter GATA-4 or p300 alone activated reporter activity 4-fold (Fig. 1D). In combination GATA-4 and p300 gave a 12-fold activation that was more than additive but less than multiplicative. These results indicate that p300 and GATA-4 functionally cooperate to activate transcription in a natural promoter context. Finally we were interested in determining whether or not p300 would activate GATA-4 on a GATA site from a promoter that is not responsive to hypertrophic stimuli. To this end we made a reporter plasmid, containing six GATA sites from the α-MHC promoter upstream of a TATA sequence, which was co-transfected with the GATA-4 expression vector with or without p300 expression (Fig. 1C). In this assay GATA-4 alone increased expression from the artificial promoter nearly 9-fold while p300 alone increased 3-fold. The combination of GATA-4 and p300 increased expression 115-fold over the control (luciferase reporter alone), which represents a 12-fold increase over GATA-4 alone. In addition, p300 did not measurably influence the amount of GATA-4 produced from the expression vector as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). Thus, p300 appears to supplement GATA-4 activity on sites from both hypertrophy responsive and non-responsive genes. These results also indicate that GATA-4 and p300 can functionally cooperate to increase GATA-4-dependent transcription from GATA sites in both artificial and natural promoter contexts. The adenovirus E1A protein interacts with p300 and this interaction has been shown to inhibit the HAT activity of p300 (36Stein R.W. Corrigan M. Yaciuk P. Whelan J. Moran E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To confirm that p300 acts as a coactivator of GATA-4, a clone encoding the E1A protein was co-transfected in selected assays with GATA-4 and p300 (Fig. 2). When E1A was present in these co-transfection assays, GATA-4/p300-dependent transcriptional activity was dramatically decreased (Fig. 2). Interestingly, E1A also inhibited the activity of GATA-4 alone indicating that endogenous p300 may play a role in the activation of GATA-4. To demonstrate that the decrease in GATA-4/p300 activity resulted from an interaction between p300 and E1A, we used a mutant of E1A (E1A(Δ2–36) from which AAs 2 to 36 were deleted. This E1A mutant is deficient in binding to p300 (36Stein R.W. Corrigan M. Yaciuk P. Whelan J. Moran E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, E1A(Δ2–36) was much less effective than wild type E1A in inhibiting the GATA-4/p300 functional cooperation. These results demonstrate that E1A can inhibit GATA-4/p300-dependent activity presumably by sequestration of p300. These results provide further evidence that GATA-4 and p300 can functionally cooperate to increase activity from GATA-dependent promoters. The functional synergy observed when these proteins were co-transfected into cells suggested that they physically interact. In order to determine if such an interaction could occur in vivo, we examined whether GATA-4 can form complexes with p300 in COS-7 cells. Lysates from cells transfected with FLAG-tagged GATA-4 and HA-tagged p300 were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.3A). The co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-HA antibody. HA-tagged p300 co-precipitated with GATA-4 in cells transfected with GATA-4 and p300 (Fig. 3A), but not in cells transfected with either GATA-4 or p300 alone. These results indicate that GATA-4 and p300 interact in vivo. To more precisely determine the region of GATA-4 that interacts with p300, NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding GATA-4 peptides fused to the Gal4-DNA-binding domain and HA-tagged p300. Complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Gal-DBD antibody and Western blotted with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3B). The result showed that GATA-4 AAs 1–80 and 80–214 were unable to precipitate p300 whereas AAs 214–441 bound p300. These results suggested that AAs 214–441 of GATA-4 contain the interaction domain for p300. In order to define the interacting domains of each protein, we prepared GST fusion proteins containing various peptides of GATA-4 and determined the ability of each of these to interact with peptides containing roughly equal portions of p300. GST-GATA-4 fusion proteins (shown schematically in Fig.4A) were expressed, purified, and coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. p300 N1 (AA 1–597), N2 (AA 598–1185), N3 (AA 1186–1860), and C (1861–2414) were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine. The in vitro translated fragments were run on a gel and compared to ensure equal input of protein (data not shown). Equal amounts of labeled p300 peptides were incubated with GST, GST-GATA-4, or GST-E1A coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After pelleting and washing the beads, the protein remaining was separated by electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The results are shown in Fig. 4, B and C. GATA-4 peptides 1–80, 80–214, and 294–441 did not significantly pull down any fragment of p300. These sequences encompass all of the GATA-4 protein except the zinc fingers. Peptides of GATA-4 containing the N-finger-(80–250) and C-finger-(241–378) interacted significantly with only the N3 fragment of p300. These results indicate that the N- and C-fingers of GATA-4 can interact with the N3 peptide of p300 independently. N3 contains AAs 1185–1860 that includes the cysteine/histidine-rich 3 (C/H3) region of p300. To further define sequences within the N3 region of p300 that interact with GATA-4, we generated in vitro translated peptides containing AAs 1200–1513, 1200–1587, and 1200–1817 of p300. After analysis to confirm equal input of protein, these peptides were used in GST pull-down assays with peptides of GATA-4 containing the N- and C-zinc fingers (Fig. 4D). p300 peptides containing AAs from 1200 to 1587 showed weak interactions with GATA-4, however, the interaction was greatly enhanced when the peptide included additional AAs from 1588 to 1817. Of the input p300 (1200–1817), ∼25% interacted with GATA-4 (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that AA 1587–1817 is the region that interacts with each zinc finger domain of GATA-4 with high affinity. This corresponds to the C/H3 region of p300. The C/H3 region is known to interact with the adenovirus E1A protein (36Stein R.W. Corrigan M. Yaciuk P. Whelan J. Moran E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that GATA-4 and E1A interact with the same region of p300 since we show above that E1A can block the GATA-4/p3"

To investigate the basis of liver-specific expression of OATP-C, we studied promoter function in the two hepatocyte-derived cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 and in nonhepatic HeLa cells. OATP-C promoter constructs containing from 66 to 950 nucleotides of 5′-regulatory sequence were active in HepG2 and Huh7 but not HeLa cells, indicating that determinants of hepatocyte-specific expression reside within the minimal promoter. Deoxyribonuclease I footprint analysis revealed a single region that was protected by HepG2 and Huh7 but not HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The liver-enriched transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) was shown by mobility shift assays to bind within this footprint. Coexpression of HNF1α stimulated OATP-C promoter activity 30-fold in HepG2 and 49-fold in HeLa cells. Mutation of the HNF1 site abolished promoter function, indicating that HNF1α is critical for hepatocyte-specificOATP-C gene expression. The human OATP8 (SLC21A8) and mouse Oatp4 (Slc21a6) promoters were also responsive to HNF1α coexpression in HepG2 cells.

Although no disease state that is associated with mutations in theOATP-C gene has been identified so far, OATP-C probably represents the chief Na+-independent bile salt and bilirubin uptake system of human liver. Reduced expression of OATP-C has been observed in the chronic cholestatic liver disease primary sclerosing cholangitis (7Oswald M. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Paumgartner G. Beuers U. Liver. 2001; 21: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The rat orthologue of OATP-C, called Oatp4 (Slc21a6), exhibits reduced mRNA levels after bile duct ligation or cecum ligation and puncture, two experimental models of cholestasis (8Kakyo M. Unno M. Tokui T. Nakagomi R. Nishio T. Iwasashi H. Nakai D. Seki M. Suzuki M. Naitoh T. Matsuno S. Yawo H. Abe T. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 770-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cecum ligation and puncture leads to bacteremia and consequent endotoxinemia, which causes intrahepatic cholestasis through decreased expression levels of hepatocellular bile salt and organic anion transporters (9Kullak-Ublick G.A. Meier P.J. Clin. Liver Dis. 2000; 4: 357-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In rats, endotoxinemia decreases nuclear activity of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1)1, a critical factor for basal expression of the Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp1 (Slc10a1)) (10Trauner M. Arrese M. Lee H. Boyer J.L. Karpen S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Whether reduced nuclear binding of HNF1 is also the cause of decreased hepatic Oatp4 expression in endotoxemic rats is unknown. Using oligonucleotide microchip expression analysis, mRNA levels of Ntcp (Slc10a1), Oatp1 (Slc21a1), Oatp2 (Slc21a5), and Oatp4 (Slc21a6) were found to be decreased or absent in the livers of Tcf1−/−(HNF1α−/−) mice with a null mutation in the HNF1α gene (11Shih D.Q. Bussen M. Sehayek E. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B.L. Suchy F.J. Shefer S. Bollileni J.S. Gonzalez F.J. Breslow J.L. Stoffel M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). These data together with the known dependence of ratNtcp (Slc10a1) gene expression upon HNF1α (12Karpen S.J. Sun A.-Q. Kudish B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15211-15221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggested a general role for HNF1α as a transcriptional activator of hepatic bile salt and bilirubin transporters. Although a direct role for HNF1α in regulating human liver OATP genes has not been shown, two lines of evidence suggested OATP-C as a likely candidate for regulation by HNF1 as follows. (i) OATP-C is expressed only in hepatocytes and binding sites for HNF1 have been shown in the promoters or enhancers of numerous genes expressed exclusively in the liver (13Hayashi Y. Wang W. Ninomiya T. Nagano H. Ohta K. Itoh H. Mol. Pathol. 1999; 52: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar); (ii) the phenotype of increased serum bile acid concentrations and a 3–10-fold elevation of serum bilirubin in HNF1α-deficient (Tcf1−/−) mice (11Shih D.Q.

In this study, we report the isolation of the human OATP-C promoter and demonstrate the critical role of HNF1α for liver-specificOATP gene expression. [γ-32P]Adenosine triphosphate (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Restriction enzymes and proteinase K were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, PfuTurbo DNA polymerase were from Life Technologies, Inc., and T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Stratagene (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Polyacrylamide was obtained from Bio-Rad. Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Total RNA was isolated from human liver by the acid guanidinium/phenol/chloroform procedure (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63169) Google Scholar). The 5′-end of the OATP-C mRNA was determined using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE1 system,Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the OATP-C-specific primer C-RT (see Table I). The 5′-end was subsequently amplified by PCR using primer C-PCRace and nested primer nC-PCRace as downstream primers (see Table I). The resulting 5′-RACE product was subcloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen BV, Groningen, Netherlands) and sequenced on an AlfExpress Sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Table IOligonucleotides used for 5′-RACE, chimeric plasmid construction, deoxyribonuclease footprinting, and mobility shift assaysOligonucleotideSequence (5′ to 3′)OATP-CC-RTCCCTATTCCACGAAGCATATTACCCC-PCRaceAGCAGTCAAAACACCTCCAATTCCCnC-PCRaceTCTCTGAAGGTTGTGCCTCTGCTGp-950AACCAAGAATAGAGCTCATCAATCAGATAACp-424TTATTCCAGGAGCTCTCTCCAGTCTCCp-128TGAGAAATATGAGCTCAAATATTGGCp-66GACTAGAGCTCTGACATAATAAGGp+21GAATCCTAGATCTACTGCAACAAGTCCACCCy3-p+30CCTACAGCAACAAGTCCACCOATP8p8–120GATAGGCTTCTGGGGTGAGCTCCTAGp8+38GAATGCTACAAGATCTGCAACAAGTCCATCmOatp4p4–137CCTACCTAGAGCTCTGTTTGCTTCTTTCp4+15CTCAGGCTTCTACAAGATCTGTGGCATGTCHNF1α consensus sequence GTTAATNATTAACwtHNF1TAAGGTGGTTAATCATCACTGGACTTGperHNF1TAAGGTGGTTAATCATTAACGGACTTGmutHNF1TAAGGTGGGCGATCAGCGCTGGACTTGBold type indicates differences in the sequence of the wild type HNF1 binding site (wtHNF1) compared with the perfect consensus sequence (per HNF1) and the mutated binding site (mutHNF1).

Four fragments of the 5′-region of theOATP-C gene were PCR-amplified using human genomic DNA as a template, upstream primers p-950, p-424, p-128, or p-66, downstream primer p+21 (see Table I), and PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. Human OATP8 (SLC21A8) and mouse Oatp4 (Slc21a6) promoter fragments were amplified from genomic DNA using primers p8–120/p8+38 and p4–137/p4+15, respectively (see Table I). The upstream primers contained an internal SacI restriction site, and the downstream primers contained an internal BglII site. The resulting PCR products were digested with BglII andSacI and ligated into the luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3-Basic (Promega Catalys AG, Wallisellen, Switzerland) that had been predigested with BglII and SacI, yielding the following promoter constructs: C-950, C-424, C-128, and C-66 for OATP-C, 8-120 for OATP8, and m4-137 for mouse Oatp4. Sequence identity of all constructs with the OATP-C, OATP8, andmOatp4 genes was verified by sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen system (Basel, Switzerland). An OATP-C-derived −128/+21 construct containing staggered nicks was generated by PCR using two complementary oligonucleotides mutated in the HNF1 binding site (sequence mutHNF1 in Table I) and PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The product was digested with DpnI to remove the parental DNA template and select for DNA containing the mutation. The mutated plasmid was termed mutC-128. HepG21, Huh71 and HeLa1 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were seeded at 90–95% density in 48-well plates. To normalize for transfection efficiency, pRL-TK plasmid (Promega Catalys AG) coding for Renilla luciferase under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter was cotransfected. For transient transfections, a DNA/liposome mix containing 1 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA/well was used. The DNA mix contained 50 ng of HNF1α expression vector (17Blumenfeld M. Maury M. Chouard T. Yaniv M. Condamine H. Development. 1991; 113: 589-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where indicated or 50 ng of empty pBluescript vector (pB-SKII,CLONTECH, Basel, Switzerland) as carrier DNA. For transfection of competitor oligonucleotides, 1–10 pmol of the dimerized oligonucleotides wtHNF1 and mutHNF1 (see Table I) were added to the transfection mix. Cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer (PLB, Promega Catalys AG) 24–36 h after transfection. Luciferase activities were assayed using the dual luciferase reporter system (Promega Catalys AG) and were quantified in a Lumat LB 9507–2 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9155) Google Scholar). DNase I protection assays were performed with a newly developed non-radioactive approach. A single end-labeled PCR fragment was generated using 5′-Cy3-conjugated primer Cy3-p+30 and primer p-424 (see Table I) and was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and QIAEX purification (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland). 1 ng of labeled PCR fragment was incubated on ice for 10 min with 10–20 μg of nuclear extract and 1 μg of poly(dI)poly(dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 μl of buffer (0.5 m saccharose, 15 mm Tris/HCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.125 mmEGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmCaCl2). After the addition of 1 volume of digestion buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmCaCl2), a 60-s digestion with 5 μl of freshly diluted DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was performed. Digestion was terminated by the addition of 1 volume of stop solution (50 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 150 μg/ml tRNA, 200 μg/ml proteinase K). DNase I-digested samples and a control sample digested in the absence of nuclear proteins were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated in ethanol. Resuspended DNA samples were loaded on a denaturating polyacrylamide gel alongside a sequencing reaction that had employed the Cy3-p+30 primer and the C-424 plasmid as template. Bands were detected and analyzed using the AlfExpress system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were obtained by hybridizing single-stranded complementary oligonucleotides (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). Dimers with the sense sequences shown in Table I were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Sequence wtHNF1 corresponded to the wild type HNF1α sequence found in the OATP-C gene promoter, perHNF1 corresponded to a perfect consensus sequence for HNF1, and mutHNF1 corresponded to the wild type sequence mutated within the HNF1 recognition site. For gel mobility shift assays, 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated on ice for 20 min with 2–5 fmol of γ-32P-end-labeled dimerized oligonucleotide and 1 μg of poly(dI)poly(dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For competition assays, a 10–500-fold excess of unlabeled dimerized oligonucleotides was added. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of antibody against HNF1α (17Blumenfeld M. Maury M. Chouard T. Yaniv M. Condamine H. Development. 1991; 113: 589-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 1 μl of antibody against HNF1β (19Coffinier C. Thepot D. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Barra J. Development. 1999; 126: 4785-4794PubMed Google Scholar), or 2 μl of antibody against HNF1 (H-205: sc-8986, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) was added to the reaction mix. Reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis through 3.4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris-borate EDTA buffer at 120V for 2 h. Reporter gene activities are expressed as the mean ± 1 S.D. of at least three individual transfection experiments. All data were reproduced at least once using two different preparations of plasmid DNA. To identify the promoter region of the OATP-C gene, the transcription initiation site was localized by a 5′-RACE approach. Using a downstream oligonucleotide that corresponded to nucleotides 163–186 of the OATP-C cDNA sequence as published by Hsiang et al. (accession numberAF205071) (4Hsiang B. Zhu Y. Wang Z. Wu Y.

Sequence analysis indicated that eight additional nucleotides (AAAGGGTG) are present in the 5′-untranslated region compared with the cDNA sequence reported by Hsiang et al. (4Hsiang B. Zhu Y. Wang Z.

These additional nucleotides were also present in the genomic SLC21A6 sequence derived from BAC clone RP11–125O5 (AC022335) and were consequently designated as the transcription start site (nt +1 in Fig.1B). Based on the genomicSLC21A6 sequence, an additional exon with a length of 39 bp (exon −1 in Fig. 1A) is separated by a 10277-bp intronic sequence from the 66-bp untranslated region of exon 1 (AJ400749) (5König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23161-23168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The transcription start site of the OATP-C cDNA is located 105 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon. The 5′-flanking region of the OATP-C gene was PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA and showed sequence identity with clone Homo sapiens 12p BAC RP11–125O5 (AC022335). Fig.1B displays the sequence from nt −950 to +40 relative to the transcription initiation site. Homologies to known gene regulatory elements were identified using the program Mat Inspector (Genomatix Software, Munich, Germany). Several potential transcription factor recognition sites were found including ubiquitously expressed factors such as the activator protein 1 (AP-1) at nt −58 to −68 and −557 to −567. A TATA motif was identified at nt −82 to −96 but not within the immediate 5′-flanking region of the transcriptional start site. Other more generally represented DNA elements included potential binding sites for the nuclear factor 1 (NF-1) at nt −15 to −32 and −111 to −125, a CAAT element at −199 to −206, and an octamer binding site (Oct-1) at −322 to −336. In addition, several liver-enriched transcription factor binding sites were detected, including two sites for HNF1 at −39 to −51 and −165 to −177, two CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (CEBP-β) binding sites at −188 to −202 and −473 to −486, and three HNF3β binding sites at −206 to −220, −639 to −653, and −829 to −842. Regarding the HNF1 binding sites, the element nearer the transcriptional start site (nt −39 to −51) showed a better match with the consensus sequence for HNF1 binding than the element located further upstream (nt −165 to −177). HumanOATP-C gene expression is limited strictly to hepatocytes (2König J. Cui Y. Nies A.T. Keppler D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G156-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the cis-acting elements in the OATP-C promoter that control liver-specific transcriptional regulation, the hepatocyte-derived cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 and the nonhepatic HeLa cell line were transfected with plasmids C-950, C-424, C-128, and C-66 that contained deletion fragments of the OATP-C promoter sequence (see Fig. 1B). In HepG2 and Huh7 cells, all four constructs conferred significant reporter gene activity as compared with the promoterless pGL3-Basic plasmid (Fig. 2). In contrast to the hepatocyte-derived cell lines HepG2 and Huh7, no luciferase activity was induced by any of the promoter constructs in HeLa cells. These data supported the notion that a liver-enriched factor present only in HepG2 and Huh7 but not in HeLa cells is required for function of the OATP-C promoter. Whereas the fragment from −66 to +21 was sufficient to confer residual promoter activity in HepG2 and Huh7 cells, maximum luciferase activity was induced by the fragment from −424 to +21 (Fig. 2), which likely contains all necessary regulatory elements for full human OATP-C promoter activity in hepatocyte-derived cells. To identify which factor is responsible for the hepatocyte-specific function of theOATP-C gene promoter, DNA-protein interaction in HepG2 and Huh7 cells was compared with that in HeLa cells by DNase I footprinting. A non-radioactive technique was developed using a 454-bp Cy3 single end-labeled PCR fragment spanning nt −424 to +30 of theOATP-C gene promoter. This fragment was chosen since the C-424 construct conferred maximum promoter activity in HepG2 and Huh7 cells (Fig. 2). DNase I digestion of the −424/+30 region, performed in the presence of nuclear extracts from HepG2, Huh7, or HeLa cells, revealed a single region from nt −37 to −59 that was protected by HepG2 and Huh7 but not HeLa cell nuclear proteins (Fig.3). This region contained the consensus recognition site for binding of HNF1. Thus, the footprint pattern discriminated between hepatocyte-derived and non-liver HeLa cells only with respect to the lack of HNF1 site protection by HeLa cell nuclear extracts. No other HepG2 or Huh7 specific footprints were visible in the −424 to +30 region of the OATP-C promoter. A second footprint from nt −111 to −125 contained the consensus recognition site for binding of nuclear factor 1 (NF-1) (Fig. 3). This sequence was protected by nuclear extracts from all three cell lines, indicating that the transcription factor binding within this region was not hepatocyte-specific. A third footprint localized in the −206 to −220 region was also protected by nuclear extracts from all three cell lines and corresponded to the consensus binding site for HNF3β (data not shown). The identity of the factor that was found to bind in the −37/−59 region by footprint analysis was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A32P-labeled dimerized oligonucleotide corresponding to nt −32 to −58 (wtHNF1) was incubated with nuclear proteins from HepG2, Huh7, and HeLa cells. Binding of nuclear proteins was only found with nuclear extracts from HepG2 and Huh7 cells, resulting in a shifted band (Fig. 4). No binding occurred with HeLa cell nuclear extracts. To study whether the bound protein exhibited the same electrophoretic migration pattern as HNF1, a32P-labeled dimerized oligonucleotide with a perfect palindromic HNF1 binding site (perHNF1) was incubated with HepG2, Huh7, and HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The binding pattern of the perfect HNF1 consensus oligonucleotide was identical to that of the OATP-C-derived oligonucleotide, strongly suggesting that the protein binding to the OATP-C sequence was HNF1. The DNA-protein complex was not formed in the presence of an excess of unlabeled perHNF1 oligonucleotide but was unaffected by the presence of excess mutHNF1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4) with a mutated HNF1 binding site (TableI). These competition experiments were repeated using increasing amounts of unlabeled wild type (wtHNF1) or mutated (mutHNF1) oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig.5A, reduced binding of HepG2 nuclear extracts to labeled wtHNF1 oligonucleotide was already seen in the presence of a 25-fold"

We investigated the potential involvement of ROS in the interaction of monocytes with cerebral endothelium, because this is likely to be an early event in the development of MS lesions. ROS are produced via two main pathways, one involving NADPH oxidase complex and the other involving xanthine oxidase (XO). We examined the effects of ROS, ROS scavengers, and ROS inhibitors of both pathways on the migration of monocytes across the blood-brain barrier in vitro. Scavengers and inhibitors of XO predominantly inhibited monocyte migration, whereas inhibitors and scavengers of the NADPH oxidase complex had no effect. Exposure of cerebral endothelial cells (CEC) to superoxide (O 2 - ) resulted in enhanced migration and adhesion of monocytes as well as disruption of the tight junctions, whereas hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide induced no significant effect on these parameters. Underlying mechanisms of the observed changes were found to reside in the phospholipase Cmediated signal transduction cascade, subsequent accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and mobilization of intracellular calcium. We conclude that O 2 - is a signaling molecule that is"

Plants, animals, and yeast each express two eIF4G homologs, which share only 30, 46, and 53% identity, respectively. We have examined the functional differences between plant eIF4G proteins, referred to as eIF4G and eIFiso4G, when present as subunits of eIF4F and eIFiso4F, respectively. The degree to which a 5′-cap stimulated translation was inversely correlated with the concentration of eIF4F or eIFiso4F and required the poly(A)-binding protein for optimal function. Although eIF4F and eIFiso4F directed translation of unstructured mRNAs, eIF4F supported translation of an mRNA containing 5′-proximal secondary structure substantially better than did eIFiso4F. Moreover, eIF4F stimulated translation from uncapped monocistronic or dicistronic mRNAs to a greater extent than did eIFiso4F. These data suggest that at least some functions of plant eIFiso4F and eIF4F have diverged in that eIFiso4F promotes translation preferentially from unstructured mRNAs, whereas eIF4F can promote translation also from mRNAs that contain a structured 5′-leader and that are uncapped or contain multiple cistrons. This ability may also enable eIF4F to promote translation from standard mRNAs under cellular conditions in which cap-dependent translation is inhibited.

The 5′-cap structure (m7GpppN, where N represents any nucleotide) serves as the binding site for the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the small subunit of eIF4F. eIF4G, the large subunit of eIF4F, interacts with several proteins in addition to eIF4E, including eIF4A (which is required to remove secondary structure within the 5′-leader sequence that would otherwise inhibit scanning of the 40 S ribosomal subunit), eIF3 (which promotes 40 S ribosomal subunit binding to the mRNA), and the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP; which stabilizes eIF4F binding to the 5′-cap) (1Lamphear B.J.

The N-terminal domain of eIF4G is responsible for binding eIF4E and PABP; the middle domain binds eIF3 and eIF4A; and in mammalian eIF4G, the C-terminal domain binds a second molecule of eIF4A as well as Mnk1, a MAPK-activated protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating eIF4E (6Imataka H.

Consequently, eIF4G functions as a scaffold protein that recruits many of the factors involved in stimulating 40 S ribosomal subunit binding to an mRNA. Two related but highly distinct eIF4G proteins were first identified in plants (9Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two plant eIF4G proteins, referred to as eIF4G and eIFiso4G, differ in size (165 and 86 kDa, respectively). Two forms of eIF4G are also observed in yeast and mammals (10Goyer C. Altmann M. Lee H.S. Blanc A. Deshmukh M. Woolford J.L. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

Mammalian eIF4GI and eIF4GII are 46% identical (11Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E. Raught B. Morino S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

Browning, unpublished data. Mammalian eIF4GII functionally complements eIF4GI to a significant extent (11Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E. Raught B. Morino S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and yeast can tolerate the deletion of either gene encoding eIF4G, although at least one gene is required for viability (10Goyer C.

Although these studies suggest that both eIF4G proteins in eukaryotic species are largely functionally similar, differences also have been reported. For example, deletion of the gene encoding yeast eIF4G1 leads to a synthetic lethal interaction with cdc33-1, an eIF4E temperature-sensitive mutant, whereas deletion of the gene encoding eIF4G2 does not (12Tarun S.Z. Wells S.E. Deardorff J.A. Sachs A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9046-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Moreover, yeast eIF4G2 supports translation of uncapped polyadenylated mRNA to a greater extent than does eIF4G1 (12Tarun S.Z. Wells S.E. Deardorff J.A. Sachs A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9046-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Whether this is due to functional differences or to the in vivo levels of each eIF4G is unknown. Cleavage of mammalian eIF4G occurs following infection with poliovirus or human rhinovirus, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis (13Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Proc.

Virol. 1999; 73: 3467-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For both viruses, cleavage of eIF4GI occurs prior to that of eIF4GII, and the cleavage of the latter correlates with the loss of protein synthesis following viral infection (13Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V.

Although wheat eIF4F and eIFiso4F support translation in vitro and exhibit RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity and ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity (17Abramson R.D. Browning K.S. Dever T.E.

Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the affinity of eIF4F for hypermethylated cap structures is lower than that of eIFiso4F (21Carberry S.E. Darzynkiewicz E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the ATPase activity of eIF4F is greater than that of eIFiso4F when mRNA is used to stimulate the RNA-dependent activity (20Lax S. Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, binding studies with oligonucleotides suggest that eIF4F binding is sensitive to the presence of secondary structure and that eIFiso4F exhibits a binding preference for linear structures (22Carberry S.E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4542-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Whether the two types of eIF4G present in eukaryotic cells exhibit specialization in determining which mRNAs are translated or whether they differ in the efficiency in which they support translation has not been investigated for any species. In this study, the functional differences of plant eIF4G and eIFiso4G were investigated during the translation of capped or uncapped mRNAs, mRNAs containing a structured 5′-leader, or dicistronic mRNAs. The addition of eIF4F or eIFiso4F (in which eIF4G and eIFiso4G are present as subunits, respectively) to lysates depleted of eIF4F and eIFiso4F supported the translation of an unstructured mRNA; however, only eIF4F significantly supported translation from an mRNA with a structured 5′-leader. eIF4F increased the translation of an uncapped mRNA and stimulated the translation from the second cistron of a dicistronic mRNA to a greater extent than did eIFiso4F, suggesting that eIF4F has evolved to promote translation from nonstandard mRNAs,i.e. those that lack a cap, contain a structured 5′-leader, or contain multiple cistrons, or has evolved to promote translation from standard mRNAs under cellular conditions in which cap-dependent translation is inhibited, whereas eIFiso4F may be largely limited to facilitating translation from standard mRNAs. Additionally, the concentration of eIF4F, eIFiso4F, and PABP determined the extent to which the cap stimulated translation: PABP was required for the cap to stimulate translation efficiently; however, increased levels of PABP, eIF4F, or eIFiso4F substantially reduced the competitive advantage that a cap conferred to an mRNA. These observations suggest that eIF4F and eIFiso4F have undergone functional specialization that allows them to discriminate between mRNAs. Moreover, these observations suggest that developmental changes in the cellular concentration of eIF4F, eIFiso4F, or PABP may influence the extent of cap-dependent translation. The T7-based monocistronic and dicistronic luciferase constructs have been described previously (23Gallie D.R. Ling J. Niepel M. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2943-2953Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DNA concentration was quantitated spectrophotometrically following linearization and brought to 0.5 mg/ml. In vitro transcription was carried out as described previously (24Yisraeli J.K. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.5 mm UTP, 0.5 mm GTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 units/μl RNasin (Promega), and 0.5 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase. The constructs used terminated in a A50 tail. Capped RNAs were synthesized using 3 μg of template in the same reaction mixture as described above, except that GTP was used at 160 μm, and 1 mm m7GpppG was included. Under these conditions, >95% of the mRNA is capped. The free energy of secondary structures used in this study was calculated at a temperature of 37 °C using MFOLD of GCG Software Package Version 10, which is based on the Zuker algorithm for determining multiple optimal and suboptimal secondary structures (25Zuker M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purified as described. The purification of eIF4G and eIF4E will be described elsewhere. Proteins from control and depleted wheat germ lysates were resolved using standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to 0.22 μm nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Following transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% milk and 0.01% thimerosal in TPBS (0.1% Tween 20, 13.7 mm NaCl, 0.27 mm KCl, 1 mmNa2HPO4, and 0.14 mmKH2PO4), followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted typically 1:1000 to 1:2000 in TPBS with 1% milk for 1.5 h. The blots were then washed twice with TPBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) diluted to 1:10,000 for 1 h. The blots were washed twice with TPBS, and the signal was detected typically between 1 and 15 min using chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 200 μl of wheat germ extract (Promega) was added to 300 μl of m7GTP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or 100 μl of poly(A)-agarose (Sigma) and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was collected by centrifugation (800 × g for 1 min) through a spin column (Promega) and used immediately. The extent of depletion of eIF4G, eIF4E, eIFiso4G, eIFiso4E, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF3, eEF2, PABP, or Hsp101 was determined by Western analysis following resolution of the extract by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. mRNA constructs were translated using complete or depleted wheat germ lysate as described by the manufacturer, except that all amino acids were unlabeled. The lysates were supplemented with recombinant initiation factors or factors purified from wheat germ extract as indicated. In wheat germ lysate, eIF4A is present in a >30-fold molar excess relative to eIF4G (31Browning K.S. Humphreys J. Hobbs W. Smith G.B. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17967-17973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, a similar ratio was used when lysates were supplemented with eIF4A. The ratio of eIF4B to eIF4G has not been measured; and therefore, the ratio used for supplementation was determined empirically. The reactions were incubated for 3 h, and 2-μl aliquots were assayed in a MonoLight 2010 luminometer for luciferase activity. Each mRNA construct was translated in triplicate, and the mean ± S.D. for each construct is reported. An alignment of eIF4G from wheat, human, and Saccharomyces cerevisiaerevealed that plant eIF4G and eIFiso4G are most conserved with eIF4G of other eukaryotes in the region responsible for interaction with eIF4A and eIF3 (Fig. 1) (1Lamphear B.J.

However, plant eIF4G and eIFiso4G do contain a domain near their C terminus that shares limited conservation with the human eIF4G proteins and is absent from the yeast orthologs. Plant eIFiso4G differs most from eIF4G in that it lacks an ∼700-amino acid-long N-terminal region present in eIF4G. In this respect, plant eIF4G is more similar to human eIF4G than is eIFiso4G. The yeast eIF4G proteins also contain an N-terminal region, although it is shorter than that present in plant eIF4G or in either mammalian eIF4G protein. Although the domain responsible for interaction with PABP is not conserved among eIF4G proteins, it is located within this N-terminal region of human and yeast eIF4G proteins. The PABP interaction domain within plant eIF4G has not been identified precisely, but the putative site in eIFiso4G has been mapped to its N-terminal region (33Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L.

To examine the function of eIF4G or eIFiso4G in vitro, it was necessary to generate an eIF4G- and eIFiso4G-dependent lysate. This was accomplished by depleting wheat germ lysate of eIF4F (composed of eIF4G and eIF4E) and eIFiso4F (composed of eIFiso4G and eIFiso4E) through their binding to m7GTP-Sepharose. Western analysis confirmed that the level of eIF4E and eIFiso4E was reduced by 90–95%, as was that of eIF4G and eIFiso4G (Fig.2). To examine whether the depleted lysate was eIF4F- or eIFiso4F-dependent, cappedluc-A50 mRNA was translated in a fractionated lysate supplemented with increasing amounts of purified eIF4F or eIFiso4F. The extent to which the reporter mRNA was translated was determined by measuring luciferase activity. A reduction in the level of eIF4F and eIFiso4F reduced translation by >95% (compare translation in complete and fractionated lysates) (Fig.3), as would be expected following a reduction in those initiation factors that are normally required for efficient translation. Residual translational activity of the fractionated lysate may be the result of the low level of either eIF4G and eIFiso4G remaining in the lysate (Fig. 2) or a result of PABP (see below). Supplementation with 16 nm eIF4F increased translation from the reporter mRNA nearly 10-fold in the fractionated lysate, but did not affect translation of the same mRNA in the unfractionated lysate (Fig. 3). Translation in the fractionated lysate was also dependent on eIFiso4F, whereas supplementation of the unfractionated lysate with eIFiso4F did not affect translation (Fig. 3). A comparison of their relative effects on translation reveals that eIF4F was more stimulatory than was eIFiso4F. Native eIF4F and recombinant eIF4F are equally active in supporting translation in vitro, as are native eIFiso4F and recombinant eIFiso4F (30van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 3K. S. Browning, unpublished data. suggesting that there is no significant difference in the fraction of each purified factor that is active. The stimulation afforded by eIFiso4F was more nonlinear at the highest concentration used for this factor than that observed for eIF4F, suggesting that even higher concentrations of eIFiso4F would not yield a level of translation comparable to that observed for eIF4F. The nonlinearity of the activity of these factors has been reported previously (34Fletcher L. Corbin S.D. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19582-19587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The greater nonlinearity of eIF4F at lower concentrations may indicate its higher affinity for RNA compared with eIFiso4F, a possibility that is supported by the observation that the eIFiso4F dose-response curve is slightly sigmoidal (Fig. 3; see Fig. 5C). These data suggest that the endogenous level of eIF4F and eIFiso4F in the unfractionated lysate is necessary for maximum translational activity and that their removal from the lysate renders the fractionated lysate dependent upon the addition of either eIF4F or eIFiso4F.Figure 3Reduction in eIF4F and eIFiso4F results in an eIF4F- and eIFiso4F-dependent lysate. Cappedluc-A50 mRNA (3.4 ng/μl) was translated in the unfractionated lysate (left panel) or in the eIF4F/eIFiso4F-dependent lysate (right panel). Each lysate was supplemented with the indicated amounts of eIF4F or eIFiso4F, and the amount of luciferase synthesized was measured in a luminometer. eIF4A was included at a ratio of 1:70 (for eIF4F assays) or 1:30 (for eIFiso4F assays).

Luc, luciferase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether eIF4F and eIFiso4F differ in the extent to which they support translation of an mRNA with a structured 5′-leader, it was first necessary to determine the translational characteristics of mRNAs with or without secondary structure in the eIF4F/eIFiso4F-dependent lysate. A stable stem-loop structure containing a 24-base pair stem of ΔG = −42.9 kcal/mol was introduced 4 nucleotides downstream of the 5′ terminus of the luc reporter mRNA (referred to as SL24-luc-A50). In addition, deletions were made within the 24-base pair stem-loop to generate less stable structures with 19-, 13-, and 7-base pair stems of ΔG = −31.8, −21.3, and −4.5 kcal/mol, respectively (referred to as SL19-luc-A50, SL13-luc-A50, and SL7-luc-A50, respectively). The presence of these structures was shown previously to inhibit translation in unfractionated lysate as a function of their stability (35Niepel M. Ling J. Gallie D.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the stem-loop on translation, each construct was synthesized in vitro as a capped mRNA containing a A50 tail and translated at three different concentrations in a lysate reduced in eIF4F and eIFiso4F. When the eIF4F/eIFiso4F-dependent lysate was programmed with a 9.6 ng/μl concentration of each construct, the presence of a 24-, 19-, 13-, or 7-base pair stem-loop (i.e.SL24-luc-A50, SL19-luc-A50, SL13-luc-A50, and SL7-luc-A50, respectively) inhibited translation to 15.7, 12.3, 16.3, and 61.5% of that of the control mRNA with an unstructured leader (Fig.4). As expected, decreasing the RNA concentration reduced the amount of luciferase produced (compare the absolute levels of expression in Fig. 4 and note the difference in scale on the x axis). However, the presence of the same stem-loop structures was progressively less inhibitory as the concentration of the input mRNA decreased (see the relative values to the right of each histogram in Fig. 4, which are relative to the expression from the control luc-A50 mRNA), and translation from the SL7-luc-A50and SL13-luc-A50 mRNAs was actually higher than that from the control mRNA at the lowest RNA concentration tested. Consequently, secondary structure of lower stability (e.g.SL7-luc-A50 and SL13-luc-A50 mRNAs) was inhibitory only at a high RNA concentration, whereas more stable secondary structure (e.g.SL19-luc-A50 and SL24-luc-A50 mRNAs) was inhibitory at all RNA concentrations tested, albeit less inhibitory at low RNA concentrations. These data suggest that the translational machinery, such as eIF4A, which functions as an RNA helicase and as a subunit of eIF4F (or eIFiso4F), is required during translation in direct proportion to the degree of secondary structure present in the 5′-leader of an mRNA (36Svitkin Y.V. Pause A. Haghighat A. Pyronnet S. Witherell G. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. RNA. 2001; 7: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), is sufficient to unwind moderately stable secondary structure when an mRNA is present at a low concentration. However, higher concentrations of mRNA may act to titrate the RNA helicase activity such that the structure cannot be removed from all of the input RNA, resulting in the inhibition of translation by secondary structure of even moderate stability. To examine the effect of eIF4F or eIFiso4F on the translation of a structured mRNA, the SL13-luc-A50 mRNA construct was selected as an mRNA with moderately stable secondary structure. This mRNA also exhibited the greatest potential range in expression as exemplified by the degree to which it was translated at high or low RNA concentrations (Fig. 4). Supplementation of the eIF4F/eIFiso4F-dependent lysate programmed with eIF4F increased translation from SL13-luc-A50 mRNA up to 14.7-fold (Fig. 5B), whereas supplementation with eIFiso4F did not increase translation from the same mRNA (Fig. 5D). In contrast, translation from the control (i.e. unstructured) mRNA increased when the lysate was supplemented with either eIF4F (Fig. 5A) or eIFiso4F (Fig. 5C). For the structured mRNA (Fig.5B), eIF4F was less stimulatory at high concentrations than at lower concentrations. This effect is also observed for unstructured mRNAs if eIF4F is added to the lysate to a level higher than was used for these studies (data not shown). An excess of eIF4F (i.e. a level of eIF4F that is in excess of the binding capacity of the input mRNA) may compete with the bound eIF4F for other factors needed for translation. The secondary structure present in the construct of Fig. 5B may reduce the amount of eIF4F that can bind the mRNA, which would result in a condition of excess eIF4F at a lower concentration than normally observed for an unstructured mRNA. Once in excess, free eIF4F may compete with the bound eIF4F for other necessary factors, resulting in an apparent lower level of stimulation. As eIF4F is considered to be present in limiting amounts in vivo in eukaryotes, such in vitroconditions of excess eIF4F are unlikely to be present in vivo. These data suggest that eIF4F and eIFiso4F differ considerably in their ability to promote translation from an mRNA containing a structured 5′-leader. The introduction of each stem-loop increases the length of the 5′-leader relative to the construct lacking the secondary structure, which could have an effect on translation efficiency. For example, introduction of SL24, SL19, SL13, or SL7 results in a leader length of 64, 53, 41, or 29 nucleotides, respectively. To determine whether the length of the 5′-leader influences the degree to which eIF4F or eIFiso4F increases translation, capped luc-A50 mRNAs containing a 17-, 72-, or 144-nucleotide unstructured 5′-leader were translated in the eIF4F/eIFiso4F-dependent lysate and supplemented with eIF4F or eIFiso4F. Expression was affected only to a small extent as a function of the 5′-leader length, with a 2-fold increase in translation as a function"

To investigate the interaction of MAGP-1 with tropoelastin and fibrillin-1, we expressed human MAGP-1 as a T7-tag fusion protein inEscherichia coli. Refolding of the purified protein produced a soluble form of MAGP-1 that displayed saturable binding to tropoelastin. Fragments of tropoelastin corresponding to the N-terminal, C-terminal, and central regions of the molecule were used to characterize the MAGP-1 binding site. Cleavage of tropoelastin with kallikrein, which cleaves after Arg515 in the central region of the molecule, disrupted the interaction, suggesting that the separated N- and C-terminal fragments were insufficient to determine MAGP-1 binding to intact tropoelastin. In addition, no evidence of an interaction was observed between MAGP-1 and a tropoelastin construct consisting of domains 17–27 that brackets the kallikrein cleavage site, suggesting a complex mechanism of interaction between the two molecules. Binding of MAGP-1 was also tested with overlapping recombinant fibrillin-1 fragments. MAGP-1 bound to a region at the N terminus of fibrillin-1 in a calcium-dependent manner.

During elastic fiber synthesis, the microfibrils appear before the amorphous core and are believed to act as a scaffold for the deposition of tropoelastin. The incorporation of tropoelastin into the nascent elastic fiber is likely to depend on its interactions with microfibrillar proteins and its ability to self-associate through the process of coacervation. Self-association through coacervation involves the hydrophobic domains of the tropoelastin molecule (1Urry D.W. Ultrastruct.

The C-terminal domain, which contains the only two cysteine residues of tropoelastin has been proposed as the site of interaction with the microfibrillar components through the formation of a basic, intramolecular disulfide-bonded loop (3Brown P.L.

Microfibrils appear ultrastructurally after rotary shadowing as beaded filaments with a periodicity of 50–55 nm (6Keene D.R. Maddox B.K. Kuo H.-J. Sakai L.Y. Glanville R.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The main structural protein of the microfibrils, fibrillin-1, is periodically arranged, with the N and C termini in or close to the beads (7Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E.

Another component of microfibrils, originally identified in nuchal ligaments, is a 31-kDa glycoprotein termed MAGP-1 (8Gibson M.A. Hughes J.L. Fanning J.C. Cleary E.G. J. Biol.

The interactive repertoire of microfibrillar and elastic fiber components determines the development and integrity of these functional entities in various tissues. Toward this end it has been documented that MAGP-1 can bind to the C-terminal portion of tropoelastin (4Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. Biochem.

A region near the N terminus of fibrillin-1, which encompasses the proline-rich region, downstream epidermal growth factor EGF-like domains and the second 8-Cys domain, has been shown to recognize tropoelastin (17Trask T.M.

Furthermore, indications for interaction between fibrillin and MAGP-1 were obtained by co-immunoprecipitation of these two microfibrillar proteins from the culture medium of fetal chondrocytes (18Trask B.C. Trask T.M. Broekelmann T. Mecham R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1499-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigated the interactions of MAGP-1 with tropoelastin and fibrillin-1. To facilitate these studies, we expressed human MAGP-1 as a T7-tag fusion in Escherichia coli. Refolding of the purified protein produced a soluble form of MAGP-1 that was used to define binding epitopes on tropoelastin and fibrillin-1. These results suggest a model for the interaction of elastin with the microfibrillar scaffold of the elastic fiber. Sequences corresponding to the mature form of MAGP-1 were amplified from the human melanocyte cDNA clone 291880 (Incyte Genomics Inc.) using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with the primers 5′-GGATCCCAGGGCCAGTATGAC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTTAGCAGCTCCCACAGCTCCT-3′. The PCR product was cloned using pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The 513-bpBamHI fragment containing the MAGP-1 sequence was then excised and ligated to BamHI-treated pET-3a (Novagen) to produce the plasmid pET-MAGP. DNA sequencing was used to confirm that the MAGP-1 sequence in pET-MAGP corresponded to the cDNA sequence described previously (Ref. 19Faraco J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Francke U. Genomics. 1995; 25: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, data not shown). Two mismatches were detected compared with the published human MAGP-1 gene sequence (19Faraco J. Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Francke U. Genomics. 1995; 25: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The first was a T to C transition at position 66 and the second was a C to T transition at position 432 of the coding sequence. Both of these mismatches were silent mutations at the third positions of the codons involved, and thus had no effect on the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein. 100 ml of 2TY medium containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with an overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing pET-MAGP and grown at 37 °C until A 600 was ∼0.8. IPTG was then added to 0.4 mm final concentration. After 2 h, the induced culture was harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml lysozyme). The mixture was immediately divided into 5-ml aliquots and frozen in liquid nitrogen for 5 min. After thawing, the freeze/thaw cycle was repeated 2–3 times. MgCl2 was added to 10 mm, then DNase I was added to 10 µg/ml, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 15 min with occasional stirring. Refolding conditions resembled those used for the protein extracted from bovine tissue (20Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the insoluble material was resuspended in 10 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1m guanidine hydrochloride, 25 mmdithiothreitol) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The insoluble material was again pelleted by centrifugation and dissolved in 20 ml of denaturing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 6m guanidine hydrochloride, 25 mmdithiothreitol). Residual insoluble material in the denaturing buffer solution was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble T7-MAGP remaining in the supernatant was allowed to refold by dialysis against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Recombinant human tropoelastin (SHEL) and a deletion construct lacking exon 26A (SHELΔ26A) were prepared as described previously (21Martin S.L. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S.

Anti T7-tag antibody (Novagen) was used as described by the manufacturer. The region of the SHEL gene corresponding to exons 17–27 of tropoelastin was amplified using the primers 5′-CCATGGGGCGTAGGTACTCCGG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTTAGTATTTCGCCGCTTTCG-3′, and the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). The reaction mixture included 50 ng of pSHELΔ26A (22Wu W.J. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21719-21724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), 200 µm dNTPs and primers at 0.15 µm. The reaction was made up to 100 µl with Milli-Q water and overlaid with 50 µl of paraffin oil. Before adding 2.5 units of polymerase, the mixture was heated to 97 °C for 3 min then cooled to 72 °C. The thermal cycler program used for the reaction was 3× (97 °C, 1 min; 45 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 45 s) followed by 29× (94 °C, 1 min; 45 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 45 s) with a final elongation period of 8.5 min at 72 °C. The 911-bp PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated to the plasmid pGEM-T (Promega). Transformants resulting from the electroporation of E. coli DH5α cells with the ligation mixture were screened for the presence of insert DNA byBamHI and NcoI digestion. Positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing using universal primers. BamHI and NcoI digestion of one of these clones released the 911-bp BamHI-NcoI fragment containing the SHEL17–27 sequence, which was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragment was ligated to BamHI- andNcoI-digested pET-3d to form the plasmid pSHEL17–27, which was used to transform E. coli DH5α. Expression of SHEL17–27 was identical to that described for SHEL (21Martin S.L. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S.

To modify rF6, a 4300-bp NotI-ApaI fragment was excised from the plasmid pBS-rF6 (7Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and subcloned intoNotI-ApaI-restricted pcDNA3.1. The resulting plasmid was termed pcDNA-rF6. To introduce the sequence for 6 histidine residues, a stop codon, and an ApaI restriction site to the 3′-end, template HFBN4 (24Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) was amplified with primers DR149 (5′-CTCCAGCTGTGAAGACGTGG-3′) and DR 150 (5′-ACTAGGGCCCTCACTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTTTGGGGTAGCCATTGATCTTAC-3′). The BsgI-ApaI 416-bp fragment from the amplification product was cloned intoBsgI-ApaI-restricted pcDNA-rF6 to produce the expression plasmid for rF6H (pcDNA-rF6H). Expression of pcDNA-rF6H in eukaryotic cells produces a secreted polypeptide (rF6H) with the sequence Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala-Asp1487-Lys2725-(His)6. To subclone the rF11H construct into pcDNA3.1 plasmid, a 4667-bpXbaI-NotI fragment from pCis-rF11H (7Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol.

The resulting plasmid was designated pDNSP-rF16 and produces a secreted polypeptide (rF16) with the sequence Ala-Pro-Pro-Leu-Ala-Ser19-Val1527-(His)6. Stable clones with these expression plasmids were obtained with human embryonic kidney cells (293) as described in detail (25Fox J.W. Mayer U. Nischt R. Aumailley M. Reinhardt D. Wiedemann H. Mann K.

Recombinant fibrillin-1 polypeptides used in this study are summarized in Fig. 1 b. N-terminal sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer by the Biomolecular Resource Facility at the Australian National University. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was carried out on a Perseptive Voyager DE STR spectrometer by the Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry Unit, University of New South Wales. Protein interactions were examined using the ligand overlay blotting technique described previously (20Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% w/v acrylamide) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Gelman) in transfer buffer (12 mm Tris, 96 mmglycine, pH 8.3, 20% methanol, 0.1% SDS) using a Hoefer Transblot apparatus. Dot blots were prepared by spotting 2 µl of protein solution (typically 0.5–1.0 mg/ml) directly onto nitrocellulose membranes (Gelman Sciences). After drying, membranes were blocked by incubating in 3% nonfat milk/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl) for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing 3 times in PBS, membranes were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h in a 10 µg/ml solution of T7-MAGP prepared in PBS containing 0.05% nonfat milk. Membranes were rinsed 3 more times and then incubated with anti-T7 tag antibody (Novagen, 1:5000). Blots were developed in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5 containing 0.8 mg/ml diaminobenzidine (Sigma), 0.01% H2O2, and 0.4 mg/ml NiCl2 until bands were clearly visible. Levels of T7-MAGP binding on dot blots were quantified by digital scanning and ImageQuant software (version 4.2a, Molecular Dynamics). Ligand overlay blots used to examine the interaction of T7-MAGP with the fibrillin-1 fragments were carried out similarly, except that Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) replaced the PBS, and the 10 µg/ml solution of T7-MAGP contained 2 mm CaCl2. For solid phase binding assays 6.5–10 µg/ml bovine MAGP-1 in TBS was coated onto multiwell plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, 96 wells) for 16 h at 4 °C. After 3 washes with TBS containing 2 mmCaCl2 and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (wash buffer), the nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2 (binding buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. The MAGP-1-coated wells were incubated with serial dilutions of recombinant fibrillin-1 subdomains for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times, and incubated with specific antisera against the fibrillin-1 subdomains (diluted 1:250 in binding buffer) for 1 h. After three washes, the wells were incubated with a peroxidase conjugate of a goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Bio-Rad, 1:800) for 1 h and washed again. Bound ligands were detected by a color reaction for 3–4 min with 1 mg/ml 5-aminosalicylic acid (Sigma) in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.05% H2O2 (100 µl of solution per well), which was terminated by the addition of 2m NaOH (100 µl per well). Color yields were determined at 490 nm. T7-MAGP expression in bacterial cultures was examined by SDS-PAGE, which revealed expression of a protein of an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa (Fig.2). This differed from the 20 kDa predicted from the amino acid sequence. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry were used to confirm the identity of the purified protein. The N-terminal sequence of the isolated protein (ASMTGGQQ) was identical to the sequence expected for T7-MAGP assuming the removal of the N-terminal methionine by endogenous E. coli methionine aminopeptidase. By MALDI-TOF analysis, the mass of T7-MAGP was found to be 20,281 ± 81 Da, which correlated well with the expected mass of 20,212 Da based on the amino acid sequence. This result confirmed that its performance in SDS-PAGE analysis was due to aberrant migration as described previously for the natural protein (27Gibson M.A. Sandberg L.B. Grosso L.E. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7596-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total E. coli cell lysates containing the overexpressed tropoelastin isoform SHELΔ26A were examined for the ability of the bacterially expressed T7-MAGP to bind to tropoelastin using a ligand blot assay (Fig.3). T7-MAGP bound specifically to SHELΔ26A. The specificity of T7-MAGP for SHELΔ26A was demonstrated by its lack of affinity for any of the E. coli host cell proteins (Fig. 3) and by its lack of binding to bovine serum albumin compared with equivalent amounts of tropoelastin (data not shown). Control experiments in which MAGP-1 was omitted from the overnight incubation confirmed that the T7-tag antibodies did not cross-react with tropoelastin (data not shown). Human plasma kallikrein and porcine pancreatic kallikrein have previously been shown to cleave tropoelastin after Arg515 at the end of domain 25, resulting in an N-terminal fragment of ∼45 kDa and a C-terminal fragment of ∼22 kDa (Fig. 1 a and Ref. 23Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry data confirmed that the C-terminal fragment resulting from these digests is intact and would be expected to behave similarly to the corresponding region of the full-length molecule (data not shown; Ref. 23Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Neither of the proteolytically derived tropoelastin fragments showed binding to T7-MAGP at levels comparable to or approaching those seen for the intact tropoelastin (Fig. 4a). In many cases, the only band to appear in the kallikrein digest lane of the ligand overlay blots corresponded to trace amounts of intact tropoelastin that had not been completely digested. Solid phase assays of the C-terminal fragment, isolated as described previously (23Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), showed that the lack of T7-MAGP binding to this fragment in the ligand overlay assays was not due to the denaturing effect of SDS during electrophoresis. This was under conditions where full-length tropoelastin clearly bound T7-MAGP (data not shown). These results suggested that either the major MAGP-1 binding site in tropoelastin is cleaved by kallikrein or that kallikrein digestion disrupts a conformational requirement for T7-MAGP binding. The recombinant tropoelastin polypeptide SHEL17–27 was designed to test whether MAGP-1 could bind to the central region of tropoelastin sequence encompassing the domain 25/26 kallikrein site. SHEL17–27 extends from the beginning of domain 17 to the end of domain 27, with an intact domain 25/26 region. Ligand overlay assays showed no evidence for an interaction with T7-MAGP, suggesting that this part of tropoelastin was insufficient for binding to MAGP-1 (Fig. 4 b). Combined with the kallikrein digestion data presented above, the results indicate that binding of MAGP-1 to tropoelastin in this system cannot be explained by the presence of a single defined MAGP-1 binding site on tropoelastin. Instead, the lack of binding to kallikrein digestion products comprising the N terminus to domain 25 and domain 26 to the C terminus, and to the fragment comprising domains 17–27 (SHEL17–27), reveals a complex interaction between MAGP-1 and the intact tropoelastin molecule. In ligand overlay blots with fibrillin-1 fragments, T7-MAGP showed saturable binding to the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 (rF16), but not to the central fragment (rF20) or the C-terminal half (rF6H) (Fig.5a). Further experiments showed that T7-MAGP was also able to recognize the N-terminal rF23 polypeptide, but not the subfragments rF38 or rF31 (Fig.5 b). Together, rF31 and rF38 span most of rF23, but do not contain the unique region of the N terminus or the first EGF domain (Fig. 1 b). Ligand overlay blots carried out in the presence or absence of calcium showed that the interaction between T7-MAGP and fibrillin-1 was calcium-dependent (Fig.6). This points to an involvement of one or both of the adjacent cbEGF domains of rF23 in the interaction. The lack of binding to rF31 and rF38 could be explained by a requirement for both of these domains.Figure 6Calcium dependence of the T7-MAGP/fibrillin-1 interaction. PVDF membranes with immobilized fibrillin-1 fragment rF23 (lane 1) and tropoelastin (lane 2) were used in ligand overlay assays in the presence or absence of 2 mmCaCl2. Note that binding of T7-MAGP to rF23 is calcium-dependent, while binding to tropoelastin is not dependent on calcium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To substantiate these results, MAGP-1 was purified from bovine tissue and tested for binding to recombinant human fibrillin-1 in solid phase assays (Fig. 7). Soluble fragments rF16 and rF23 bound strongly to immobilized MAGP-1, while fragments rF20 and rF6H did not show binding activity. These data clearly demonstrate that (i) recombinant fibrillin-1 interacts with authentic MAGP-1 (ii) binding activity is also maintained when MAGP-1 is used as an immobilized ligand, and (iii) the fibrillin-1/MAGP-1 interaction site is conserved between species (human fibrillin-1, bovine MAGP-1). This study was designed to shed light on the mechanism through which the amorphous elastin core of the elastic fiber is linked to microfibrils. MAGP-1 is known to bind tropoelastin, and recent immunoprecipitation studies indicated the possibility of binding to fibrillin (18Trask B.C. Trask T.M. Broekelmann T. Mecham R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1499-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recombinant human T7-MAGP was produced to study the interactions with these elastic fiber components. Previous forms of recombinant MAGP-1 had been produced in eukaryotic expression systems, which were chosen because the naturally occurring protein is likely to undergo post-translational modifications such as O-linked glycosylation (8Gibson M.A. Hughes J.L. Fanning J.C. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11429-11436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sulfation of tyrosine residues (28Tomasini-Johansson B.R. Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Matrix. 1993; 13: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The formation of specific intrachain disulfide bonds may also affect the ability of MAGP-1 to function. We sought to closely base a refolding protocol on that described for the natural protein. It was previously shown that MAGP-1 extracted from bovine tissue could be denatured, reduced, and then refolded so that its ability to bind type VI collagen was restored (20Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The type VI collagen binding site was localized to a region at the N terminus of MAGP-1 that lacks cysteine residues. As the binding site for tropoelastin on MAGP-1 overlaps the type VI collagen binding site (20Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we considered that a similar refolding procedure should be applicable to bacterially expressed MAGP-1. In this study, we have developed a recombinant MAGP-1 that demonstrates binding to tropoelastin. The T7-MAGP produced in this manner specifically and saturably bound tropoelastin in E. coli lysates but notE. coli proteins. The ability of T7-MAGP to bind tropoelastin, even in the absence of glycosylation and sulfation, reveals that these post-translational modifications are not required for its interaction with tropoelastin. Ligand overlay assays of recombinant MAGP-1 with fragments produced by kallikrein digestion of tropoelastin suggested that the boundary between domains 25 and 26 of tropoelastin might be involved in the interaction with MAGP-1. This region is in an exposed position on tropoelastin, and likely to be available to interact with other proteins (23Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The C-terminal fragment resulting from kallikrein digestion has previously been shown to have a C terminus identical to that found in the full-length protein (23Jensen S.A. Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28449-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since full-length tropoelastin and the truncated forms were treated in precisely the same manner during SDS-PAGE and blotting, the lack of binding to the C-terminal fragment was due neither to a loss of residues at this end of the molecule nor to denaturation during electrophoresis. In other studies, antibodies against the C-terminal end of tropoelastin reduced the binding of MAGP-1 to tropoelastin in a solid phase assay (12Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Mecham L. Mercer R. Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28443-28449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or abolished the assembly of elastic fibers in cell culture models (4Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,12Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Mecham L. Mercer R. Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28443-28449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, the binding site for MAGP-1 had been assigned to the C-terminal end of tropoelastin. It is possible that in those studies, binding of bulky antibodies to the C terminus of tropoelastin may have sterically interfered with the interaction between MAGP-1 and domains 25/26 of tropoelastin. Antibodies typically have a molecular mass of 150 kDa, in contrast to the smaller tropoelastin (60 kDa). Another explanation would be the requirement for both the C terminus and the regions between domains 25 and 26 for a fully functional MAGP-1 binding site on tropoelastin. This explanation would be consistent with our observation that T7-MAGP binding to tropoelastin is completely abolished by proteolytic cleavage between domains 25 and 26 combined with the absence of binding activity of SHEL17–27, which spans the region of tropoelastin cleaved by kallikrein. The fact that in solid phase binding assays with MAGP-1 and tropoelastin the interaction could be maximally reduced with antibodies against the C-terminal end of tropoelastin by about 50% (12Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Mecham L. Mercer R. Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28443-28449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) further supports the existence of other regions important for the binding site. No interaction between MAGP-1 and fibrillin was detected in earlier work involving reduced fibrillin-1 from bovine ligamentum nuchae (12Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Mecham L. Mercer R. Gibson M.A. Cleary E.G. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28443-28449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, however, the first pieces of evidence for binding between MAGP-1 and fibrillin emerged in co-immunoprecipitation studies in a cell culture system (18Trask B.C. Trask T.M. Broekelmann T. Mecham R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1499-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In our work, we directly tested binding of T7-MAGP to recombinant fragments of fibrillin-1, which were produced as soluble proteins through eukaryotic expression (7Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R.

Fairhurst M. Sussman M.D. Memoli V.A. Sakai L.Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1069-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). T7-MAGP bound saturably to fibrillin-1 fragment rF16 (N-terminal portion), but not to fragments rF20 (central part) or rF6H (C-terminal portion). Comparison of the structures of rF16 and rF20 suggested that T7-MAGP was likely to bind to a region within the first nine domains of fibrillin-1 (see Fig. 1 b). This was confirmed by the calcium-dependent binding of T7-MAGP to rF23 comprising these nine domains plus one additional C-terminal domain. Fragments rF31 and rF38 did not bind T7-MAGP. These two polypeptides span the length of rF23, except for the unique N-terminal domain and first EGF-like domain of fibrillin-1. The lack of binding to rF31 and rF38 suggests that T7-MAGP bound either within the first N-terminal two domains of fibrillin-1, and/or that the first two calcium-binding EGF-like (cbEGF) domains were involved in the interaction. Although the data presented do not eliminate the possibility that the unique N-terminal domain could be involved in binding MAGP-1, the calcium-dependent nature of the interaction favors a model for the involvement of the cbEGF domains 1 and 2. Calcium binding to T7-MAGP is unlikely since the secondary structure of T7-MAGP was not influenced by the presence of calcium (data not shown). The binding of MAGP-1 to the N-terminal region of fibrillin-1 is consistent with the (i) proposed arrangement of fibrillin molecules in which the N termini are located near the beaded structures of the beaded filaments (7Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and (ii) localization of MAGP-1 to the beads (9Henderson M. Polewski R. Fanning J.C. Gibson M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar binding properties to the N-terminal region of fibrillin-1 were observed for fibulin-2, which displayed calcium-dependent binding to fibrillin-1 fragments rF11 (similar to rF16) and rF23, but not to rF20 (16Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The authors concluded that fibulin-2 bound to the first two cbEGF modules of fibrillin-1. These results raise the question of whether the binding sites for MAGP-1 and fibulin-2 are similar or separate epitopes and whether these two proteins compete for binding to fibrillin-1, which may represent important mechanisms in the development and/or homeostasis of microfibrils. During the development of microfibrils and elastic fibers, fibrillins, MAGP-1 and elastin probably interact in complex multivalent patterns. Since microfibrils appear before the amorphous core of elastin, in initial steps it may be that the interaction of MAGP-1 with the N-terminal region of fibrillin-1 is required for the assembly process of microfibrils. Interactions of newly synthesized tropoelastin with N-terminal regions of fibrillin-1 or fibrillin-2 in microfibrils may then be necessary to align tropoelastin for cross-linking (17Trask T.M.

The minimal regions of MITF and PU.1 required for the interaction were the basic-helix-loop-helix zipper domain and the Ets DNA binding domain, respectively. Significantly, mice heterozygous for both the mutantmi allele and a PU.1 null allele developed osteopetrosis early in life which resolved with age. The size and number of osteoclasts were not altered in the double heterozygous mutant mice, indicating that the defect lies in mature osteoclast function.

In the rat, homozygous deletion of the MITF locus causes microphthalmia and pigment defects as well as an osteopetrosis that resolves with age (7Cielinski M.J. Marks S.C.

At least 18 different mutant alleles at the MITF locus have been characterized in the mouse, and these alleles affect, to varying extents, differentiation of melanocytes, pigmented retinal epithelial cells, mast cells, and osteoclasts (9Steingrimsson E.

Thus, MITF can selectively affect gene expression and differentiation of developmentally unrelated types of cells. A major interest of our laboratories is in understanding how MITF selectively activates target genes in osteoclasts as opposed to other cell types where the factor is expressed. Osteoclasts differentiate from a myeloid progenitor to become mature, multinuclear cells capable of resorbing bone (12Roodman G.D. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1229-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for the mutant mi allele develop severe osteopetrosis caused by a failure of mononuclear precursors to mature into multinuclear osteoclasts capable of bone resorption (13Holtrop M.E.

Bone. 1985; 6: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Bone marrow transplantation experiments demonstrate that the mi mutation acts in a cell-autonomous manner (15Walker D.G. Science. 1975; 190: 785-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Walker D.G. Science. 1975; 190: 784-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and in situhybridization studies confirm that MITF is expressed in osteoclasts beginning at the earliest stages of endochondrial ossification of long bones (17Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Understanding how MITF regulates gene expression in osteoclasts may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that control terminal differentiation of this specialized cell type. MITF and the related TFE factors form heterodimers and homodimers that bind to DNA sequences related to the E-box motif (CANNTG) shared by many helix-loop-helix transcription factors. In cell types affected by MITF mutations, MITF acts by binding to a cis-acting element, TCATGTG, located in the proximal promoters of lineage-specific genes. For example, genes encoding tyrosinase (melanocytes) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) (osteoclasts) require thiscis-element for cell type-specific regulation (17Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Aksan I. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6930-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These data indicate that MITF expression alone is likely insufficient to account for the regulation of selective targets in the different cell types. One hypothesis to account for MITF action is that in each cell type, MITF acts in concert with a unique combination of transcription factors to affect expression of target genes. Expression of the Ets family transcription factor PU.1 distinguishes osteoclasts from melanocytes. PU.1 expression is limited to hematopoietic lineages and is necessary for differentiation of a number of cell types, in particular B-cells, macrophages, and osteoclasts (19Simon M.C. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,20Singh H. DeKoter R.P. Walsh J.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Osteoclast differentiation fails at a very early stage in mice bearing a targeted disruption of the PU.1 gene, but PU.1 is expressed at all stages of osteoclast differentiation in wild-type cells, including in mature multinuclear cells (21Tondravi M.M. McKercher S.R. Anderson K. Erdmann J.M. Quiroz M. Maki R. Teitelbaum S.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In addition, direct interaction between MITF and PU.1 in vitro has been detected (22Sato M. Morii E. Takebayashi-Suzuki K. Yasui N. Ochi T. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this report we present molecular, biochemical, and genetic evidence showing that PU.1 and MITF physically and functionally interact. We conclude that the interaction with PU.1 is necessary for MITF to affect osteoclast differentiation and gene expression. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% newborn calf serum (NIH 3T3 and COS-7) or 10% fetal bovine serum (RAW264.7) at 37 °C in 7% CO2. Differentiation of RAW264.7 cells was optimized using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), 20 ng/ml soluble recombinant human RANKL/osteoclast differentiation factor (PeproTech, Inc.), and 104 units/ml recombinant human colony-stimulating factor-1 (a gift from Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA). For flow cytometry cells were grown over a period of 5 days, changing the medium on day 2 and day 4. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure as described previously (23Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van B.C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes 24 h before the transfections. Cells were transfected with Superfect reagent as described by the manufacturer. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. RAW264.7 cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (24Stacey K.J. Fowles L.F. Colman M.S. Ostrowski M.C. Hume D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3430-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for PU.1 and MITF and the TRAP luciferase reporter have been described previously (17Luchin A. Purdom G.

Hume D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed point mutations of PU.1 and MITF binding sites, indicated in Fig. 1, were introduced by PCR (17Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The S36T enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene-derived pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH) was fused to the TRAP proximal promoter (from −620 to +3, relative to the ATG codon). Under low light conditions, cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Resuspended cells were analyzed for GFP expression using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Data analysis was performed by analyzing 10,000 events for each assay using the CELLQuest software package (Becton Dickinson). The fluorescence intensity was divided into four regions, M1–4. M1 was set to encompass the background level of green autofluorescence exhibited by 99.9% of untransfected control cells, and M2, M3, and M4 represented logarithmic increments of fluorescence intensity (100-fold, 1,000-fold, and 10,000-fold above background, respectively). All events with fluorescence intensity greater than the M1 region were accepted as cellular GFP fluorescence events. The data are presented as follows. %GFP­expressing cells=(M4)(M2+M3+M4)Equation 1 COS-7 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 3 h. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase (1 mm EGTA, 10 mmNaF, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaVO3) inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged, precleared with 20 μl of protein G Gamma Bind Plus Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 45 min at 4 °C, and incubated with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Babco) or polyclonal anti-MITF serum (raised against amino acids 1–111) overnight. Beads were precipitated and washed four times with lysis buffer and once with a low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40). Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. The various DNA constructs encoding bacterial fusion proteins were generated by PCR amplification of PU.1 and MITF cDNAs with PCR primers defining the boundaries shown in Fig. 5. Both GST vectors (pGEX, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and His6-tagged vectors (pET15b and pET32, Novagen) were used to make fusion proteins. Recombinant fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography following protocols supplied by the vector manufacturers. 1 μg of the recombinant GST or GST fusion bait protein was incubated with 20-μl glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) in 300 μl for 1 h at 4 °C. 1 μg of the His6-tagged test protein was then added to the reaction and incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were precipitated and washed five times with binding buffer. Reaction products were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-His6 antibody (Santa Cruz). EMSAs were performed as described previously using His6-tagged versions of MITF and PU.1 (17Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The sense strand oligonucleotide, representing the mouse TRAP proximal sequences, was CAGTTCTGGGGAAGTCCAGTGCTCACATGACCCA. The core of the PU.1 site (GGA to TTA) or of the E-box (CACAGT to CTCGAG) was mutated singly or in combination. The sense stands of the TRAP promoter and SV40 enhancer oligonucleotides used in Fig. 1Cwere CCAGTTCTGGGGAAGTCCAGTGCTC and CTGAAAGAGGAACTTGGTTAGGTA, respectively. Themi mutation was maintained on a B6C3Fe hybrid background as originally obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The PU.1 knockout model was generously provided by Dr. Harinder Singh (University of Chicago) and was supplied in the 127J background (26Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Mice heterozygous for both PU.1 and mi alleles were produced and then crossed to supply all combinations of the two alleles. The PU.1 null allele was genotyped by PCR as described (27DeKoter R.P. Walsh J.C. Singh H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4456-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Themi allele was genotyped by PCR with primers that allowed the 3-base pair difference between wild-type and mi allele to be distinguished by gel electrophoresis. There was a 100% correspondence between eye pigment phenotype and genotype determined by this PCR method. Newborn animals were euthanized and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 48 h at 4 °C, then transferred to 70% ethanol. Radiological analysis was performed on Faxitron x-ray machine (Hewlett Packard model 43855A) for 1–2 min at 35–45 kV using X-Omat V film (Kodak). Procedures for histological staining have been described previously (28Luna L.G. Manual of Histologic Staining Methods of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. McGraw-Hill, Blakiston Division, New York1968Google Scholar). For TRAP histochemical staining newborn femurs were embedded in plastic resin using a JB-4 embedding kit (Polysciences, Inc.) as described by manufacturer, and 5-μm sections were cut using the LKB Ultratome (LKB Instruments Inc., Rockville, MD). Samples were stained for TRAP activity using a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (Sigma) as described by the manufacturer. The proximal promoter of the mouse TRAP gene contains a conserved binding site for MITF which is necessary for the transcription of the gene during terminal osteoclast differentiation (17Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A putative binding site for the Ets family transcription factor PU.1 (GGAA) is located around 10 base pairs upstream of the MITF binding site in the human, mouse, and pig TRAP genes (Fig.1A). EMSAs were performed with this site using purified recombinant PU.1 (Fig. 1B). These experiments demonstrated that PU.1 specifically recognized the TRAP promoter probe containing the wild-type binding site, but not a probe with a mutated binding site (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and2). Additionally, PU.1 binding was competed efficiently by increasing amounts of unlabeled TRAP competitor DNA representing the wild-type binding site, but not the mutant site (Fig. 1B,lanes 3–8 versus 9–14). To confirm that this site is bound by native PU.1, we examined RAW264.7 macrophage nuclear extracts by EMSA (Fig. 1C). PU.1 is the only macrophage nuclear protein that recognizes the high affinity PU.1 site from SV40 (25Ross I.L. Dunn T.L. Yue X. Roy S. Barnett C.J. Hume D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 121-132PubMed Google Scholar). When the TRAP sequence was used in EMSA a complex was detected which comigrated with the SV40 PU-box complex (Fig.1C, lanes 1 and 2). Addition of anti-PU.1 polyclonal antibody, but not preimmune serum, could block formation of this complex (Fig. 1C, lane 4 versus lane 3). By comparison with the SV40 PU-box, the TRAP site was a substantially lower affinity site as judged by relative cold competition (Fig. 1C, lanes 6–9 compared withlanes 10–13). The ability of PU.1 to transactivate the TRAP promoter through this binding site was examined using transient transfection assays (Fig.2A). In NIH 3T3 cells, which do not express PU.1, cotransfection of a PU.1 expression vector was able to activate the TRAP promoter by 4-fold (Fig. 2A,left panel). When the conserved binding site was mutated, activation by PU.1 was abrogated (Fig. 2A, left panel). Similar results were seen when transient assays were performed in RAW264.7 cells that express endogenous PU.1, and basal activity of the TRAP promoter was decreased about 2-fold in this cell type as well (Fig. 2A, right panel). Incubation of RAW264.7 cells with colony-stimulating factor-1 and RANKL can promote the differentiation of osteoclast-like cells (29Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). We used this in vitro differentiation system to examine the role of the conserved PU.1 binding site in regulating TRAP expression during differentiation of RAW264.7 cells (Fig.2B). RAW264.7 cells were stably transfected with either a wild-type TRAP promoter linked to GFP or promoters with the PU.1 binding site or MITF binding site mutated. Pooled clones containing each construct were selected and subsequently induced to differentiate for 5 days with colony-stimulating factor-1 and soluble RANKL. Following this treatment, about 10% of cells in RAW264.7 cultures were multinuclear osteoclast-like cells (data not shown). Flow cytometry was used to study GFP expression in aspirated cells from these cultures (see “Experimental Procedures”). The analysis indicated that the percentage of highly fluorescent GFP cells increased ∼3-fold following treatment of cultures with RANKL compared with untreated cultures. Mutation of the PU.1 site in the proximal promoter reduced GFP reporter activity in RANKL-treated cells by 3-fold to the level found in untreated cultures (Fig. 2B,TRAPΔPU.1, right panel). The PU.1 mutation also had a smaller effect on reporter activity in untreated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2B, left panel). As a positive control, we reproduced the observation that mutation of the MITF site resulted in significantly reduced TRAP promoter activity following osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 2B, TRAPΔE,+RANKL, 17). To test the hypothesis that interaction with PU.1 might account for the ability of MITF to regulate gene expression in osteoclasts, the combined ability of the two factors to activate the TRAP promoter was studied using transient transfection assays. Expression vectors for PU.1 or MITF alone activated the TRAP reporter 4–5-fold, but the combination of the two factors activated the TRAP reporter 20-fold (Fig. 3). When either the E-box or the PU.1 binding site in the TRAP promoter was mutated, the combination of MITF and PU.1 failed to superactivate the reporter (Fig. 3). The MITF/mi mutation, which encodes a protein lacking the ability to bind to the conserved TRAP E-box (17Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), failed to superactivate the TRAP reporter in combination with PU.1 (Fig. 3). These results imply a functional interaction between MITF and PU.1 which is dependent on DNA binding of both transcription factors to the TRAP promoter. Sato and co-workers (22Sato M. Morii E. Takebayashi-Suzuki K. Yasui N. Ochi T. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously that MITF and PU.1 can physically interact in vitro when bound to DNA. To confirm and extend these results, biochemical assays were used to study the physical interaction of the two factors in the absence of DNA (Figs.4 and 5). Coimmunoprecipitation of PU.1 and MITF in COS-7 cells was studied (Fig.4A). Expression vectors encoding HA-tagged PU.1 and wild-type MITF were cotransfected into COS-7 cells. HA-PU.1 was immunoprecipitated from cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and the immunoprecipitates were examined by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The experiments demonstrated that a protein with the same mobility as MITF was coprecipitated with PU.1 (Fig. 4A, arrow). This protein was absent from precipitates obtained either from cells expressing only HA-PU.1 (Fig.4A) or in mock-transfected cells that expressed neither protein (data not shown). In addition, if preimmune serum was used, or if the primary antibody was not included in the immunoprecipitation reaction, neither MITF nor PU.1 was detected (data not shown). In a complementary set of experiments, full-length recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. His6-tagged MITF and GST-PU.1 were separately expressed and purified. GST-PU.1 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was used in “pull-down” assays with His6-tagged MITF (Fig. 4B). These experiments demonstrated that His6-tagged MITF could bind to GST-PU.1 Sepharose beads but not to GST-alone beads (Fig.4B). To map the domain of MITF involved in the interaction with PU.1, a series of MITF deletion mutations fused to GST was tested in pull-down assays using His6-thioredoxin-tagged PU.1 (Fig. 5). The fragment of MITF containing amino acids 199–298, which included the bHLH-zip domains (Fig. 5A), was able to interact with PU.1 as efficiently as the full-length protein (Fig. 5C,top panel). The protein encoded by the MITF/miallele was also bound as efficiently as wild-type protein (Fig.5C, top panel, last two lanes). Neither the N-terminal region including the basic domain (amino acids 1–217) nor the C-terminal portion that included the HLH-zip domain (amino acids 217–419) was able to bind PU.1 above the background level observed with GST alone (Fig. 5C, top panel). In control experiments the MITF deletion proteins did not bind to His6-thioredoxin alone (Fig. 5C, bottom panel). Therefore, both basic and HLH-zip domains of MITF are necessary for efficient PU.1 binding. PU.1 is a 272-amino acid protein that consists of the N-terminal activation domain, PEST domain, and C-terminal DNA binding domain (Fig.5B; 20). To map the MITF interacting domain of PU.1 a series of deletions fused to His6-thioredoxin was constructed and tested in pull-down binding assays using GST-MITF (amino acids 199–298) as bait (Fig. 5D). Recombinant PU.1 proteins lacking either the activation domain (Δ33–100) or the PEST domain (ΔPEST) were able to interact with MITF, but the protein without the DNA binding domain (Δ201–272) lost the ability to bind MITF (Fig.5D). To confirm the minimal regions of MITF and PU.1 required for the interaction, the in vitro binding assay was performed using amino acids 199–298 of MITF fused to GST (Fig. 5A) and amino acids 161–272 of PU.1 fused to His6-thioredoxin (Fig. 5B). These experiments demonstrated that the DNA binding domain of PU.1 was able to bind GST-MITF 199–298 fusion protein, but not GST (Fig. 5E). Inclusion of ethidium bromide in these reactions had no effect on the pull-down results, consistent with the conclusion that interaction between free proteins in solution, and not protein bacterial DNA complexes, is being measured in these assays (data not shown). A possible explanation for the cooperation between MITF and PU.1 is that the two factors bind in a cooperative fashion to target genes like TRAP. To investigate the mechanism of cooperation between PU.1 and MITF, we performed an EMSA using a TRAP promoter probe containing binding sites for both PU.1 and MITF. When both PU.1 and MITF were present in the reaction, we observed that a new band with lower electrophoretic mobility was detected, representing a ternary complex containing PU.1, MITF, and TRAP promoter sequences. Mutation of the binding site for either transcription factor abolished the formation of the complex containing both MITF and PU.1 (Fig.6A). Cold competition experiments to measure off time rates of the complexes were also performed (Fig. 6B). Consistent with the data presented above, the PU.1 complex had a very rapid off rate of less than 30 s. The MITF complex was very stable, with little competition observed even after 30 min. The complex containing both factors behaved the same as the PU.1 complex, with a very rapid off rate (Fig. 6B). Taken together, the data indicate that the presence of MITF, which binds stably and with high affinity, does not alter the low affinity binding of PU.1 to the adjacent site. Ultimately, the relevance of interactions between MITF and PU.1 can only be assessed by examining interactions at the genetic level in intact animals, where both the target cell population and the levels of expression of the gene products are appropriate. Mice heterozygous for either themi allele (MITF/mi) or for a PU.1 knockout allele do not develop an apparent bone phenotype. To test for the possibility of genetic interaction between MITF and PU.1 we crossed heterozygous MITF/mi mice with heterozygous PU.1+/− mice to obtain double heterozygous MITF/mi/PU.1+/− animals. The resulting mice were analyzed for bone density and morphology by radiological techniques and hematoxylin and eosin staining (Figs.7, A and B, respectively). Approximately 25% of the double heterozygous MITF/mi/PU.1+/− mice were clearly osteopetrotic compared with 0% of PU.1+/− and 5% of MITF/mi single heterozygotes, respectively (Table I). Although the osteopetrosis in the double heterozygote mice was detected readily at birth, it resolved with age so that eruption of teeth occurred, and by sexual maturity bone density as assayed by radiography appeared normal (data not shown).Table IGenotypes and phenotypes of mice carrying mi and PU.1 null allelesPU.1aMITF/mi/PU.1+/− double heterozygous mice were crossed, and offspring were genotyped as described under “Experimental Procedures.”genotypeMITFaMITF/mi/PU.1+/− double heterozygous mice were crossed, and offspring were genotyped as described under “Experimental Procedures.” genotypeActual no. of micePredictedbPredicted numbers are based on a Mendelian inheritance of unlinked genes and a total of 148 mice analyzed. no. of miceNo. of op mice% op mice+/+MITF/MITF19 (12.8%)9.25 (6.25%)00+/−MITF/MITF29 (19.5%)18.5 (12.5%)00+/−MITF/mi42 (28.3%)37 (25%)1024+/+MITF/mi21 (14.1%)18.5 (12.5%)15+/+mi/mi5 (3.3%)9.25 (6.25%)5100+/−mi/mi16 (10.8%)18.5 (12.5%)16100−/−mi/mi1 (0.6%)9.25 (6.25%)1100−/−MITF/MITF6 (4.5%)9.25 (6.25%)6100−/−MITF/mi9 (6.1%)18.5 (12.5%)9100a MITF/mi/PU.1+/− double heterozygous mice were crossed, and offspring were genotyped as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Predicted numbers are based on a Mendelian inheritance of unlinked genes and a total of 148 mice analyzed.

https://openalex.org/W2128268504,"Abstract The BH3 domain is essential for the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria by pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins during apoptosis. This study tested the hypothesis that a Bax peptide that includes the BH3 domain can permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane and release cytochrome c in the absence of a permeability transition at the mitochondrial inner membrane. BH3 peptide (0.1–60 μm) released cytochromec from mitochondria in the presence of physiological concentrations of ions in a cell type-selective manner, whereas a BH3 peptide with a single amino acid substitution was ineffective. The release of cytochrome c by BH3 peptide correlated with the presence of endogenous Bax at the mitochondria and its integral membrane insertion. Cytochrome c release was accompanied by adenylate kinase release, was not associated with mitochondrial swelling or substantial loss of electrical potential across the inner membrane, and was unaffected by inhibitors of the permeability transition pore. Cytochrome c release was, however, inhibited by Bcl-2. Although energy-coupled respiration was inhibited after the release of cytochrome c, mitochondria maintained membrane potential in the presence of ATP due to the reversal of the ATP synthase. Overall, results support the hypothesis that BH3 peptide releases cytochrome c by a Bax-dependent process that is independent of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore but regulated by Bcl-2."

Despite its key role as an upstream activator of enzymes such as protein kinase B and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase, the regulatory mechanisms controlling PDK1 activity are poorly understood. PDK1 has been reported to be constitutively active in resting cells and not further activated by growth factor stimulation (Casamayor, A., Morrice, N. A., and Alessi, D. R. (1999) Biochem. J. 342, 287–292). Here, we report that PDK1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocates to the plasma membrane in response to pervanadate and insulin. Following pervanadate treatment, PDK1 kinase activity increased 1.5- to 3-fold whereas the activity of PDK1 associated with the plasma membrane increased ∼6-fold. The activity of PDK1 localized to the plasma membrane was also increased by insulin treatment. Three tyrosine phosphorylation sites of PDK1 (Tyr-9 and Tyr-373/376) were identified using in vivo labeling and mass spectrometry. Using site-directed mutants, we show that, although phosphorylation on Tyr-373/376 is important for PDK1 activity, phosphorylation on Tyr-9 has no effect on the activity of the kinase. Both of these residues can be phosphorylated by v-Src tyrosine kinasein vitro, and co-expression of v-Src leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PDK1. Thus, these data suggest that PDK1 activity is regulated by reversible phosphorylation, possibly by a member of the Src kinase family. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) plays a central role in signal transduction pathways that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase.

However, most of these putative PDK1 substrates were identified usingin vitro phosphorylation experiments, and not all the substrate proteins appear to be physiological targets for PDK1 in vivo. Experiments with embryonic stem (ES) cells ablated for both alleles of PDK1 revealed that PKB, p70S6K, and RSK are no longer phosphorylated or activated by agonists that are potent stimuli in normal ES cells, providing in vivo evidence that these three enzymes are dependent on PDK1 for activation (32Williams M.R.

The regulation of the other potential substrates of PDK1 is apparently unaffected in the knock-out cell line (32Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). PKB, p70S6K, RSK, and SGK, members of the AGC family of protein kinases, are apparently maintained in the cytoplasm in an inactive state. Upon stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) becomes activated, generating the phospholipid second messengers, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2. These lipids then mediate the phosphorylation and activation of PDK1 targets through diverse mechanisms (1Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

In the case of PKB, this activation appears to be facilitated by lipid binding to pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that mediate the recruitment of both PKB and PDK1 to the plasma membrane, thereby promoting phosphorylation of PKB by PDK1 and the as-yet-unidentified Ser-473 kinase (34Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 35Frech M.

In the case of SGK/RSK/p70S6K, the precise mechanism for stimulatory phosphorylation of the activation loop by PDK1 is less well understood. It is possible that there is a mechanism for inducing transient association of PDK1 and SGK/RSK/p70S6K. Indeed, PDK1 and SGK are able to form a stable complex (27Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of a hydrophobic motif on RSK serves as a docking site for PDK1 (47Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although a role for PDK1 in insulin signaling is well established, the mechanism of regulation of PDK1 activity remains controversial. Previously, it was thought that PDK1 is constitutively active in resting cells and not further activated by growth factor stimulation (48Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition, the subcellular localization of PDK1 also appears to be growth factor-insensitive (49Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak M. Casamayor A. Downes C.P. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), although others have reported growth factor-dependent translocation of PDK1 to the plasma membrane (42Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 50Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Casamayor A. Alessi D.R. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6642-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Several serine sites (Ser-25, Ser-241, Ser-393/396, Ser-410) are phosphorylated on PDK1 in unstimulated human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, as well as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-stimulated cells (48Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, only phosphorylation on the activation loop Ser-241 (equivalent to Thr-308 of PKB) is necessary for PDK1 activity (48Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this study examined the effect of IGF-1 stimulation on PDK1 activity and was unable to find any activation (48Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Although physiologically relevant, signal transduction events elicited by IGF-1 may be transient, and/or too small in magnitude for detection in this experimental paradigm. To further probe the regulation of PDK1, we have utilized pervanadate, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases that apparently mimics insulin action, to stimulate cells (51Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pervanadate stimulates PKB activity to a much higher extent than insulin or IGF-1 (52Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and through this amplification of signal intensity, we hoped to observe changes in PDK1 activity and/or subcellular localization previously not detectable with insulin stimulation. Indeed, stimulation of cells with pervanadate resulted in a significant increase in PDK1 activity and translocation to the plasma membrane, together with an induction of tyrosine phosphorylation. During the course of our experiments, work from two independent groups (50Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Casamayor A. Alessi D.R. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6642-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 53Prasad N. Topping R.S. Zhou D. Decker S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6929-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) also reported that PDK1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation with pervanadate or hydrogen peroxide in adipocytes, HEK 293 cells, and A20 lymphoma cells. In this report, we identify three tyrosine phosphorylation sites on PDK1 using in vivo labeling and mass spectrometry: Tyr-9 and Tyr-373/376. Using site-directed mutants, we show that although phosphorylation on Tyr-373/376 is important for PDK1 activity, phosphorylation on Tyr-9 has no effect on the activity of the kinase. Both sites can be phosphorylated by v-Src tyrosine kinase in vitro, and co-expression of v-Src leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PDK1. Thus, these data show that PDK1 activity is regulated by reversible phosphorylation, possibly by a Src family kinase. Purified recombinant T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP (54Tiganis T.

Anti-Myc 9E10 and anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 monoclonal antibody were from commercial sources.

The PH domain deletion mutant of PDK1 was generated by a standard PCR-cloning strategy (Myc-ΔPH-PDK1). The mutants at Tyr-9 (Myc-PDK1 Y9F), Tyr-373/376 (Myc-PDK1 Y373/376F), and both Tyr-9 and Tyr-373/376 (Myc-PDK1 FFF) were created by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer with pCMV5 Myc-PDK1 as template. v-Src and kinase-dead mutants of v-Src constructs in pcDNA3.1 (v-Src and v-Src-KD) were a gift from Dr. Monilola Olayioye (FMI, Switzerland).

The transfection mixture was removed after 16-h incubation, and cells were serum-starved for 24 h before stimulation for 15 min with 100 nm insulin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 50 ng/ml IGF-1 (Life Technologies), 100 nmcalyculin-A (Alexis), or 100 μm pervanadate prepared with 0.2 mm H2O2 (51Posner B.I.

Pretreatment with 50 μm LY294002 (Alexis) or 10 μm4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP1, Alexis) was for 15 or 30 min before cell stimulation, respectively. HEK 293 cells were placed on ice and extracted with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 μm microcystin-LR. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g and the Myc-PDK1 protein was immunoprecipitated from 200–400 μg of cell-free extracts with the anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody immobilized on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immune complexes were washed once with lysis buffer containing 0.5m NaCl, followed by lysis buffer and finally with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol). In vitro kinase assays were performed for 60 min at 30 °C in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 30 μl of immunoprecipitates in kinase buffer, 100 μm Suntide (RRKDGATMKTFCGTPE) as substrate, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (Bachem), and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1000–2000 cpm/pmol).

Polyclonal antisera that recognize specific phosphorylation sites were raised against the following peptides: RTTSQLYDAVPIQS (Tyr-9; 3–16 aa), VLCSCPSPSMVRTQ (Ser-25; 19–32 aa), KQARANSFVGTAQY (Ser-241; 235–248 aa), EDDEDCYGNYDNLLSQF (Tyr-373/376; 367–383 aa), VSSSSSSHSLSASDTG (Ser-393/396; 388–403 aa), LPQRSGSNIEQYIH (Ser-410; 404–417 aa), where the phosphorylated amino acids are underlined. An antisera against the C-terminal region of PDK1 was generated by injecting with the following peptide: KIQEVWRQRYQSHPDAAVQ (538–556 aa). In addition, antisera were prepared by simultaneously immunizing with the four phosphoserine peptides and the C-terminal peptide. All peptides were coupled with Keyhole-Limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits. After purification by Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography, some antibodies were affinity-purified using antigenic peptides coupled to Affi-Gel 10 or 15 (Bio-Rad). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. For protein phosphatase treatment, immunoprecipitates of Myc-PDK1 from the pervanadate-treated HEK 293 cells were incubated with 25 ng of purified recombinant TC-PTP (54Tiganis T. Flint A.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) in 45 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, or 25 ng of purified recombinant protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) purified from the baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells (57Myles T. Schmidt K. Evans D.R.H. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 225-232Crossref Google Scholar) in 45 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm PMSF, or 400 units of recombinant Lambda protein phosphatase (Lambda-PP, New England BioLabs) in 45 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mmNa2EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.01% Brij 35, and 2 mm MnCl2 for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate for TC-PTP and Lambda-PP or 1 μm okadaic acid for PP2Ac. The immune complexes were washed three times with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 μm okadaic acid, and then analyzed for PDK1 activity, or by immunoblot analysis. For protein-tyrosine kinase treatment, immunoprecipitated Myc-PDK1 from untreated HEK 293 cells was prepared as above. In vitrophosphorylation of PDK1 were performed with 250 ng of purified v-Src in 100 μl of Src kinase buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 60 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (Bachem), and 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1000–2000 cpm/pmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 60 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer, and PDK1 was purified by 12% preparative SDS-PAGE. HEK 293 cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were resolved by 7.8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The filters were blocked for 30 min in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·2H2O, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4), containing 5% skimmed milk, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Tween 20, followed by a 2-h incubation with the anti-Myc 9E10 or anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 monoclonal antibody diluted 1000-fold, or the anti-phospho-site-specific polyclonal antisera in the same blocking solution. The secondary antibody was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma Chemical Co.), diluted 2500-fold in the blocking buffer. The detection and quantitation of PDK1 expression was carried out by using the alkaline phosphatase color development reagents from Bio-Rad. HEK 293 cells were treated as described, and then placed on ice. After washing once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were scraped in 500 μl of ice-cold fractionation buffer containing 20 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 25 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μm microcystin LR, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm benzamidine and then homogenized by passing through a 26-gauge needle 10 times. Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to separate the cytosolic fraction (supernatant) from organelles (pellet). The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of fractionation buffer and layered onto 10 ml of sucrose cushion (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1.15 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 77,000 ×g for 60 min in a Beckman SW41 rotor. The diffuse band at the interface of the sucrose solutions was collected (1 ml), mixed with 1 ml of fractionation buffer, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min to pellet crude plasma membrane fraction. The pellet was resuspended in fractionation buffer, and the protein concentration was determined. HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with wild type Myc-PDK1 were serum-starved for 24 h, and then incubated for 4 h with 32Pi (1 mCi/10-cm plate, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were stimulated with buffer or 100 μm pervanadate for 15 min (4 × 10-cm plates per each condition). Lysates were prepared and Myc-PDK1-immunoprecipitated as described above, and then resolved by 12% preparative SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie Blue and autoradiography, the32P-labeled band corresponding to Myc-PDK1 were excised from the gel, reduced with 10 mm DTT, alkylated with 100 mm iodoacetamide, and cleaved with 1 μg of trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade). After the trypsin cleavage the gel pieces were dried and 1 μg of Asp-N (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, sequencing grade) was added in 40 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10% acetonitrile and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. The peptides were then extracted (58Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7735) Google Scholar) and processed as described below. Phosphoamino acids were identified following hydrolysis in 6 m HCl containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 110 °C for 60 min. The hydrolysate was separated by thin-layer electrophoresis at pH 3.5 to resolve phosphoserine (pS), phosphothreonine (pT), and phosphotyrosine (pY) (59Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and radioactivity was detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Peptides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) interfaced with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) using a Rheos 4000 chromatograph. This chromatograph was equipped with a 1- x 250-mm Vydac (Hesperia, CA) C18 column and interfaced with a Sciex API 300 mass spectrometer (PE Sciex, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) operated in the single quadrupole. The mass range from 300 to 2400 Da was scanned with a step size of 0.3 Da and a dwell time of 3.6 s per scan. The HPLC column was equilibrated in 95% solvent A (2% CH3CN, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O), 5% solve"

Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 755-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Rab proteins have been proposed to mediate a variety of functions, including vesicle translocation and docking at specific fusion sites. Like all small GTPases, Rabs cycle between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) conformations (2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). In the GTP-bound state, Rab proteins can bind a variety of downstream effector proteins, while GTP hydrolysis leads to a conformational change in the switch region that renders the Rab GTPase unrecognizable to its effector proteins (3Dumas J.J. Zhu Z. Connolly J.L. Lambright D.G. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 413-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 4Esters H. Alexandrov K. Constantinescu A.T. Goody R.S. Scheidig A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A key question in understanding the interactions between Rabs and their effectors concerns the mechanisms by which Rab GTPases specifically bind a diverse spectrum of effectors and how this is regulated by the common structural motif used as a GTP switch. Biochemical and genetic studies have identified several hypervariable regions that might be involved in determining Rab specificity, including N and C termini, as well as the α3/β5 loop (5Stenmark H. Valencia A. Martinez O. Ullrich O. Goud B. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 6Merithew E. Hatherly S. Dumas J.J. Lawe D.C. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13982-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Indeed, the recently reported structure of Rab3a bound to a putative effector, rabphilin-3a, revealed that the Rab3a-rabphilin-3a complex interacts through two main regions (7Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The first consists of conformationally sensitive switch regions of Rab3a bound to the a1 helix and the C-terminal part of rabphilin-3a. The second involves the SGAWFF domain of rabphilin-3a, which fits into a pocket formed by the three hypervariable complementary determining regions (CDRs)1 of Rab3a, corresponding to the N and C termini and the α3/β5 loop. Thus, it appears that the hypervariable RabCDR is involved in determining the specificity of effector binding, while the conserved switch regions impart GTP dependence and binding. It remains to be determined, however, whether this paradigm also applies to other Rab-effector complexes. Rab11a, 11b, and 25 are closely related members of Rab GTPase family that have been implicated in regulating a variety of different post-Golgi trafficking pathways, such as protein recycling (8Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar), phagocytosis (9Cox D. Lee D.J. Dale B.M. Calafat J. Greenberg S. Proc. Natl.

Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). During the last few years several Rab11/25-interacting proteins have been identified, including Rab11BP/rabphilin-11, Rip11, nRip11, and myosin Vb (12Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J.

However, the mechanisms of their function, as well as molecular aspects of their interactions with Rab11, remain to be fully understood. In the present study, we report the identification of EF-hands-containingRab11/25-interacting protein (Eferin). Furthermore, we characterized a Rab binding domain (RBD11) that is present at the C terminus of Eferin as well as other Rab11/25-binding proteins, such as Rip11 and nRip11. Using biochemical techniques, we demonstrated that RBD11 is the region that encodes the specificity for Rab11/25 but is distinct from the region interacting with the Rab switch domain, since its interactions with the Rab11/25 are not GTP-dependent. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. unless otherwise specified. Miscellaneous chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Actin-rhodamine conjugates were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK II) cells were cultured, and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (16Steegmaier M. Lee K. Prekeris R. Scheller R. Traffic. 2000; 1: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were then permeabilized in 0.4% saponin and nonspecific sites blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% BSA, 0.4% saponin, and 1% bovine serum. Following incubation with antibodies, samples were extensively washed and mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence localization was performed using a Molecular Dynamics laser confocal imaging system (Beckman Center Imaging Facility, Stanford University, Stanford, CA). MDCK cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE 2000 system (Life Technologies Inc.). At 24-h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in low Ca2+ (5 µm) minimum Eagle's medium with Earle's salts. 1.6 × 105cells were seeded into one well of a 24-well collagen-coated Transwell filter (6.5-mm diameter, 0.4-mm pore size; Corning-Costar Corp., Corning, NY). After 5 h, the low Ca2+ medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultivated for 2–3 days to grow a confluent and fully polarized cell layer before imaging them with a Bio-Rad laser confocal imaging system (Beckman Center Imaging Facility, Stanford University). X-Z views were obtained by averaging sections over a line at each z position in 0.5 mm steps. For pull-down assays, Rab11a or RBD11 expressed as GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose beads by incubating at room temperature for 1 h. Where indicated, BSA-RBD11 conjugates were bound to Affi-Gel beads (Bio-Rad) and used for the pull-down assays. Beads were extensively washed, resuspended in reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and incubated either with recombinant proteins or with HeLa cell Triton X-100 extracts (13Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Beads were then extensively washed and binding proteins eluted with 1% SDS. Samples were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed either by Western blotting or Coomassie Blue staining. The bait construct was prepared by sub-cloning full-length Rab25 into the pGBKT7 plasmid. The construct was used to transform AH109 yeast cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). A human kidney cDNA library was screened by mating Y187 yeast cells with AH109 cells expressing Rab25. After incubation for at least 48 h at 30 °C, prominent colonies were spotted onto fresh double (synthetic dropout media-Trp/-Leu), triple (synthetic dropout media-Trp/-Leu/-His), and quadruple (synthetic dropout media-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade) dropout media and checked for β-galactosidase expression by the X-gal filter assay. DNA from each positive clone was extracted and sequenced. As a further test to eliminate false positives, isolated prey vectors were co-transformed with bait plasmids and checked again for reporter gene expression. For protein interaction studies, a series of bait constructs was prepared using the following cDNA: Rab11 wild-type, Rab11-S25N, Rab17, Rab25, and Sec8. For prey constructs, the following cDNA were inserted into pAct2: Rip11-(566–653), nRip11-(425–511), and Eferin-(665–756). AH109 yeast was pairwise co-transformed with bait and prey constructs and grown on double dropout media. Clones were transferred to increasingly stringent selection media as described above. Images of colony growth were obtained using a Linotype-Hell transparency scanner in conjunction with Adobe Photoshop. Despite the accumulating evidence implicating Rab11/25 GTPases in regulating multiple membrane trafficking pathways, we still know very little about the mechanism of their function. In an attempt to isolate additional Rab11/25 effectors we screened a human kidney cDNA library using Rab25 as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. This screen resulted in the isolation of 25 cDNA clones that specifically interacted with Rab11 and Rab25. 15 out of 25 clones were identified as KIAA0665, a 759-amino acid open reading frame of unknown function (17Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis using PROSITE and PFAM revealed that KIAA0665 contains an N-terminal proline-rich region, as well as two EF-hand motifs (Fig.1B). Thus, we will be referring to KIAA0665 as Eferin (AF395731), anEF-hands-containingRab11/25-interacting protein. All Eferin clones isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen encoded the C terminus of Eferin with the smallest clone spanning amino acid residues 665–756. The Eferin-(665–756) motif was sufficient to exhibit specific binding to Rab11 and Rab25 but not Rab17 and Sec8 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, binding to Rab11 was GTP-dependent since Eferin-(665–756) failed to bind Rab11-S25N (Fig. 1A). Eferin and Rab11/25 interactions were not restricted to the yeast two-hybrid system because Myc-Eferin co-precipitated with Rab25-GFP in a GTP-dependent manner from transiently transfected COS cells (see Fig. 3D). In addition, Rab11b but not Rab1, Rab2, or Rab3a could be precipitated using agarose beads coated with GST-Eferin-(665–756) (data not shown). To determine whether Eferin co-localizes with Rab11 in living cells, we transiently co-transfected normal rat kidney (NRK) cells with Eferin-GFP and Myc-Rab11a cDNAs. As shown in Fig. 1, Cand D, Eferin-GFP shows a predominately perinuclear staining, reminiscent of recycling endosomes and thetrans-Golgi network (Fig. 1C) and largely overlapping with Myc-Rab11a (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, immunofluorescence studies using transiently transfected MDCK cells showed that, similarly to Rab11, in epithelial cells Eferin-GFP is localized to the apical pole (Fig. 1E). In addition to Eferin, the yeast two-hybrid screen yielded 10 other clones that specifically interacted with Rab11 and Rab25. Seven of these clones encode fragments of Rip11 (AF334812), while the other three were identified as nRip11 (AY037299). Rip11 (13Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and nRip11 2R. Prekeris and R. H. Scheller, unpublished data. are previously identified related Rab11/25-binding proteins. The data from the yeast two-hybrid screens (Fig. 1, A and B) demonstrate that the information necessary to ensure Rab specificity and GTP dependence is encoded within the last C-terminal 86 amino acids of Rip proteins. This result was somewhat unexpected, since we have previously reported that Rip11 also binds to Rab11a through the middle region of the protein (Rip11-(200–507)) (13Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To test whether both regions of Rip11 are involved in association with Rab11, we performed GST-Rab11a pull-down assays using in vitro translated fragments of Rip11 and nRip11. As shown in Fig.2C, the binding of Rip11-(200–507) is much weaker compared with that of Rip11-(507–653). Furthermore, the region in nRip11 equivalent to Rip11-(200–507) failed to bind to GST-Rab11a (Fig. 2C), indicating that the primary Rab11/25 binding domain is likely located within the C-terminal domains of Rip11 and nRip11. Further experiments, however, will be necessary to determine the role of Rip11-(200–507) in Rab11/25 binding to Rip11. Despite the fact that Eferin and Rips are not related proteins, the alignment of Rab11/25-interacting domains revealed that Eferin, Rip11, and nRip11 contain a highly conserved domain of 20 amino acids at the very C terminus of the protein (Fig.3A). Deletion of these residues in Rip11 and Eferin resulted in loss of binding to Rab11 (Figs. 2C and 3B), suggesting that these amino acid residues might directly participate in Rab11/25 binding. To address that possibility we synthesized the peptide corresponding to Rip11-(628–645) (Rab11/25 bindingdomain, RBD11) and used it in competition assays. As shown in Fig. 3C, while the Rip11 N-terminal peptide (amino acids 1–17) had no effect on Rip11 binding to GST-Rab11a, the addition of RBD11 partially inhibited Rip11/Rab11 interaction. Furthermore, RBD11 also plays a role in Eferin binding to Rab11/25 since it inhibits Myc-Eferin co-precipitation with Rab25-GFP (Fig. 3D). While our data suggest that RBD11 is involved in Rab11/25 bindingin vitro, it remains to be determined whether it is involved in Rip11 trafficking in living cells. To address that issue we transiently transfected MDCK cells with GFP fused to either full-length Rip11 (Rip11-GFP), or Rip11 lacking the RBD11 domain (Rip11ΔRBD11-GFP) (Fig. 4). As previously reported (13Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), in non-polarized MDCK cells Rip11-GFP was localized to perinuclear endosomes, which also contained Rab11a (Fig.4, A–C). Furthermore, in polarized MDCK cells, Rip11-GFP was present at the apical pole of the cell, suggesting that GFP tagging did not affect the Rip11 subcellular distribution (Fig. 4,G–I). Deletion of RBD11, on the other hand, dramatically affected the subcellular distribution of Rip11-GFP. As shown in Fig. 4, D–F, in non-polarized cells Rip11ΔRBD11-GFP is present predominately on the plasma membrane and shows no co-localization with Rab11a-containing endosomes. Furthermore, in polarized cells Rip11ΔRBD11-GFP has lost its polarized distribution and is present throughout the entire cell (Fig. 4,J--L). As in non-polarized cells, a large portion of Rip11ΔRBD11-GFP is present on the plasma membrane, although some Rip11ΔRBD11-GFP also shows cytosolic staining (Fig.4J). The data presented above demonstrate that RBD11 is necessary for Rab11/25 binding to Eferin and Rip proteins. To determine whether RBD11 is sufficient for Rab-specific and GTP-dependent Rab11/25 binding, the peptides corresponding to either Rip11-RBD11 or Rip11-(1–17) (Fig. 5A,N pept) were conjugated to BSA-coated agarose beads and used in Rab11 pull-down assays. As shown in Fig.5A, while Rab11 did not co-sediment with BSA alone or BSA-N pept, it bound to BSA-RBD11. The binding was specific since it was observed only with Rab11a (Fig.5B) and Rab11b (data not shown) but not Rab1a and Rab3a. Furthermore, the BSA-RBD11/Rab11a interactions could be inhibited with soluble RBD11 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.5C). To test whether full-length RBD11 is necessary for Rab11/25 interactions, we expressed RBD11 as a GST fusion protein. In agreement with data reported above, Rab11a also interacted with GST-RBD11. Truncations of the RBD11 motif resulted in decreased Rab11a binding, suggesting that intact RBD11 is necessary for binding to Rab GTPases (Fig. 5E). Surprisingly, while BSA-RBD11 specifically interacted with Rab11/25 proteins, it showed no GTP dependence (Fig. 5D). Perhaps, RBD11 determines Rab specificity by interacting with RabCDR, while additional motifs interacting with Rab switch I/II domains are responsible for the GTP-dependent component. Rab11 is a small GTPase that was implicated in regulating a variety of distinct membrane trafficking steps (8Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 9Cox D. Lee D.J. Dale B.M. Calafat J. Greenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10Kessler A. Tomas E. Immler D. Meyer H.E. Zorzano A. Eckel J. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1518-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation and determining the specificity of Rab11 functions remain to be understood. The ever growing number of Rab11-binding proteins suggests that sequential or competitive interactions of Rab11 with different effector proteins might account for the diversity of Rab11 functions. In this study, we have identified a novel Rab11/25-interacting protein and named it Eferin. Several lines of evidence suggest that Eferin is an effector for Rab11/25 GTPases. First, Eferin binds specifically to Rab11/25 but not other Rabs. Second, Eferin preferentially associates with the GTP-bound, thus active, form of Rab11. Third, Eferin co-localizes with Rab11 and Rab25 (data not shown). Thus, our data suggest that Eferin is an effector protein for Rab11/25 GTPases, although its role in membrane trafficking remains to be elucidated. Immunofluorescence studies using transiently transfected MDCK cells showed that Eferin-GFP is localized exclusively to the apical plasma membrane, suggesting that Eferin might be involved in regulation of apical targeting. Interestingly, besides EF-hands, Eferin also contains a region resembling the C-terminal domain of the ezrin/radixin/moesin protein family, also known as ERM proteins, which also localize near the apical plasma membrane in actin-rich cytoskeletal structures (18Sato N. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 131-143PubMed Google Scholar, 19Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Sato N. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Bretscher A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). ERM proteins can form homo- and heterodimers via C-terminal interactions with the N-terminal FERM domain (21Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The FERM/C-terminal interaction masks the binding sites for other molecules, in this way regulating ERM protein association with the cytoskeleton (22Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the Rab11-Eferin complex might interact with the FERM domain of the ERM proteins, in this way regulating ERM protein activity and cross-linking membranes to the cytoskeleton. The ever growing Rab11 binding protein family already includes five members. The ability to interact with several effector proteins seems to be a common feature of many Rab GTPases (23Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The main challenge of future studies will be to determine the functions of all of these proteins, as well as to understand the mechanisms of their interactions with Rab proteins. Indeed, it remains unclear whether the effector proteins compete with each other for binding to Rabs or work in a consecutive fashion. The work presented here suggests that Rips and Eferin compete for interactions with Rab11/25. Indeed, identification of a common Rab11/25 binding domain indicates that Eferin and Rips use the same binding site on Rab11/25. Interestingly, RBD11 is not present in the other known Rab11/25 effector proteins, such as myosin Vb and Rab11BP/rabphilin-11 (12Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25517-25524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether these proteins can actually co-bind to Rab11/25 with either Eferin or Rips, perhaps forming signaling complexes that regulate transport vesicle trafficking. While RBD11 appears to be involved in determining the specificity of interactions with Rab GTPases, its binding is independent of GTP. Perhaps, RBD11 is an equivalent of a SGAWFF motif in rabphilin-3a, which interacts with Rab3a CDRs (7Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). If this is the case additional motifs will be required to interact with Rab switch I/II domains to provide the GTP-dependent component of binding. Thus, it is likely that Eferin and Rip proteins interact with Rab11/25 via several motifs. At least some of the GTP-sensing motifs are encoded within the 60-amino acid domain located upstream of RBD11. Interestingly, while the putative GTP-sensing regions in Rip11 and nRip11 are very highly conserved, they have no apparent homology to Eferin. Thus Rip and Eferin proteins share the common motif involved in Rab11/25 recognition but may use different mechanisms for mediating the GTP-dependent component of Rab11/25 binding. The functional significance of the differences in Rip and Eferin interactions with Rab11/25 remains to be determined. One possibility is that additional cellular factors can regulate the affinity of Rab11/25 binding to its effectors. Indeed, the recombinant full-length Rip11 binds poorly to Rab11a in pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays as compared with full-length endogenous Rip11 from cellular TX-100 extracts (data not shown). Furthermore, it has been previously shown that Rip11 can also interact with γSNAP and cytoskeleton (13Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar,24Chen D. Xu W. He P. Medrano E.E. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13127-13135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the interactions of Rips and Eferin with different factors could be used as a means of differentially regulating Rab11/25 binding. Alternatively, the Rab11/25 binding motif in Eferin and Rip11 might be conformationally hidden and require activation before binding to Rab11/25. We have previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of Rip11 plays an important role in its trafficking (13Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, differential phosphorylation on Rab11/25 binding motifs could also play a role in regulating the binding of Rip11 and Eferin to Rab GTPases. Despite the recent progress in understanding the roles of Rabs and their effectors in regulating membrane trafficking, we are only beginning to unravel the structural determinants of their function. Identification and characterization of the Rab11/25 binding regions in Rip and Eferin proteins will be of crucial importance in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in differential regulation of the variety of Rab11-dependent trafficking pathways.

In the present study, VSM in culture express endogenous HDGF only in the nucleus and target a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-HDGF fusion to the nucleus. To define the features of the HDGF molecule that are essential for nuclear localization and mitogenic function, deletion and site-directed mutagenesis were performed. Deletion analysis identified the carboxyl-terminal half of HDGF to be responsible for nuclear targeting in VSM. Overexpression of tagged HDGF proteins with point mutations in the putative bipartite nuclear localization sequence in the carboxyl terminus demonstrated that single Lys → Asn mutations randomized HDGF expression to both the nucleus and cytoplasm similar to the empty vector. Importantly, the Lys → Asn mutation of all three lysines blocked nuclear entry. Point mutation of a p34cdc2 kinase consensus motif within the nuclear localization sequence had no effect on nuclear targeting. Moreover, nuclear entry was essential for the HDGF mitogenic effect, as transfection with the triple Lys → Asn mutant HA-HDGF significantly attenuated bromodeoxyuridine uptake when compared with transfection with wild type HA-HDGF. We conclude that HDGF contains a true bipartite nuclear localization sequence with all three lysines necessary for nuclear targeting.

However, the mechanisms of growth factor-stimulated VSM proliferation are still not fully understood. After binding and receptor activation, most receptor-growth factor complexes are thought to be internalized, transported to lysosomes, and degraded (5Honegger A.M. Dull T.J. Felder S.

However examples have emerged where growth factors exert their effect directly on the nucleus. For example, exogenously applied PDGF and bFGF accumulate in the nucleus of endothelial and mesenchymal cells (6Rabowcz-Szulczynska E.M. Rodeck U. Herlyn M. Koprowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3728-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 7Baldin V. Roman A.M. Bosc-Bierne I. Amalric F. Bouche G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1511-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and bFGF can regulate gene transcription in a cell-free system (8Nakanishi Y. Kihara K. Mizuno K. Masamune Y. Yoshitake Y. Nishikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5216-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that growth factors may function within the nucleus (9Jans D.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Nuclear targeting has a structural basis as exemplified by the well characterized basic cluster of seven amino acids that comprise the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the SV40 large T antigen. The SV40 sequence has served as a NLS consensus and has allowed the identification of a more complex NLS in vertebrate nuclear targeted proteins (reviewed in Ref. 10Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Studies of nucleoplasmin, a majorXenopus nuclear protein, revealed that the NLS was bipartite, containing two required basic amino acid clusters of lysines separated by a variable spacer of 8–10 amino acids (11Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Mutation and deletion studies of nucleoplasmin have demonstrated that the basic amino acid cluster is necessary for nuclear targeting whereas the composition and spacer length appeared unimportant. This bipartite NLS structure is common to many nuclear targeted proteins including the growth factors PDGF and bFGF, glucocorticoid receptors, the transcription factors Jun and Fos, and the cell cycle control protein p53 (10Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 11Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). The importance of nuclear targeting in the regulation of growth factor function is supported by the evidence that deletion of a putative NLS in bFGF or schwannoma-derived growth factor was no longer mitogenic (12Imamura T.

U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2165-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) but continued to demonstrate cell membrane-associated signaling. HDGF is a heparin-binding growth factor originally purified from media conditioned by the human hepatoma-derived cell line, HuH-7 (14Nakamura H. Izumoto Y. Kambe H. Kuroda T. Mori T. Kawamura K. Yamamoto H. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25143-25149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDGF fits the definition of a true growth factor as exogenous HDGF is mitogenic for fibroblasts, HuH-7 cells (14Nakamura H. Izumoto Y. Kambe H. Kuroda T. Mori T. Kawamura K. Yamamoto H. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25143-25149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), aortic endothelial cells (15Oliver J.A. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1208-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and VSM (16Everett A.D. Lobe D.R. Matsumura M.E. Nakamura H. McNamara C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). HDGF represents a new family of growth factors as the nearest sequence homology (32%) is to high mobility group-1 (HMG-1), a DNA-binding protein (14Nakamura H. Izumoto Y. Kambe H. Kuroda T. Mori T. Kawamura K. Yamamoto H. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25143-25149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly HDGF lacks many of the specific features characteristic of an HMG protein, especially an “HMG box,” responsible for DNA binding of these proteins. HDGF appears to be a secreted protein present in the conditioned media of HuH-7 cells, mesenchymal kidney cells, and COS-7 cells expressing recombinant HDGF; however, its sequence lacks a secretory leader sequence and contains a putative bipartite nuclear localization cassette (14Nakamura H. Izumoto Y. Kambe H. Kuroda T. Mori T. Kawamura K. Yamamoto H. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25143-25149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDGF is the first member of a new family of proteins (17Izumoto Y. Kuroda T. Harada H. Kishimoto T. Nakamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although the specific function of HDGF is unknown, recent studies suggest a role for HDGF in renal vascular development (15Oliver J.A. Al-Awqati Q. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1208-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and in vascular lesion formation (16Everett A.D. Lobe D.R. Matsumura M.E. Nakamura H. McNamara C.A. J. Clin.

Lobe D.R. Matsumura M.E. Nakamura H. McNamara C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A10 cells derived from fetal rat aortic smooth muscle cells (American Type Tissue Culture) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown to 50–60% confluency on sterile glass coverslips and transfected for 20 h using FuGene 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For DNA synthesis analysis cells were pulsed with 10 mm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 12 h. Transfected VSM on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Coverslips were blocked for 1 h in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline (Roche Diagnostics) and incubated with a monoclonal anti-BrdUrd alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (1:500) (Roche Diagnostics) and a polyclonal anti-HA epitope tag antibody (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a red alkaline phosphatase substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were used for visualization. For endogenous HDGF non-transfected VSM were stained with a polyclonal anti-HDGF antibody (1:1000) (16Everett A.D. Lobe D.R. Matsumura M.E. Nakamura H. McNamara C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) using the ABC staining method for alkaline phosphatase (Vector). The coverslips were subsequently rinsed with tap water and inverted onto microscope slides containing a drop of mounting media (Vectashield, Vector) for visual inspection with an Olympus BX5OWI Fluoview confocal microscope. Endogenous HDGF is expressed in the nucleus of fetal aortic VSM and by VSM in the neointima after carotid injury (16Everett A.D. Lobe D.R. Matsumura M.E. Nakamura H. McNamara C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To examine the expression of endogenous HDGF in cultured rat VSM, VSM were grown to 75% confluency on glass coverslips, fixed, and stained for HDGF using a carboxyl-terminal affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (16Everett A.D. Lobe D.R. Matsumura M.E. Nakamura H. McNamara C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In these subconfluent cells, HDGF was expressed by less than 10% of cells in an exclusive nuclear pattern (Fig.1A). Similarly, when wild type rat HDGF was expressed as an amino GFP fusion, HDGF localized exclusively to the nucleus using double labeling with the DNA stainH33342 (Fig. 1B). HDGF has a highly conserved negatively charged amino terminus of 98 amino acids that is characteristic of the HDGF family of proteins (Fig.2A, underlined). This conserved amino portion of the protein is termed the “hath” region for homologous at the aminoterminus of HDGF (17Izumoto Y. Kuroda T. Harada H. Kishimoto T. Nakamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-half of the protein is not homologous among family members and by sequence similarities contains a bipartite domain homologous to the NLS found inXenopus nucleoplasmin (11Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). To determine whether the conserved hath region or carboxyl-half of HDGF containing a putative NLS is responsible for HDGF nuclear targeting, two HDGF deletions were produced: HDGF-(1–110) containing the intact hath region without the putative NLS and HDGF-(111–237) containing the NLS and carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein. As shown in Fig.2B, when these HDGF deletions are expressed as GFP fusions in VSM nuclear targeting is altered. Like wild type HDGF (Fig.2B), HDGF-(111–237) containing the putative NLS is only expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 2B). However, HDGF-(1–110) containing the hath domain only is expressed diffusely within the cytoplasm of the cell and is excluded from the nucleus (Fig.2B). As the carboxyl-terminal portion of HDGF containing the putative bipartite NLS alone can direct HDGF to the nucleus of VSM, we determined if the putative bipartite NLS domain was responsible for HDGF nuclear targeting. InXenopus nucleoplasmin it was found that two basic domains containing lysines flanking a variable length spacer were important to NLS function. Using the scheme shown in Fig.3A, we subsequently performed single-residue point mutations in the basic domains that resulted in a substitution of lysine for asparagine (Lys → Asn) to test the effect on HDGF nuclear targeting. As shown in Fig. 3B, transfection of cells with the empty GFP vector (pK7-GFP) resulted in a diffuse distribution of GFP throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in both VSM and A10 cells with wild type HDGF localized only to the nucleus. However when lysine 156 in the first basic domain is substituted for asparagine (K155N), HDGF is now expressed in a diffuse pattern similar to the empty vector (Fig. 3B). Similarly when lysines 167 and 170 in the second basic domain were substituted for asparagines (K167N/K170N) HDGF was again diffusely redistributed in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 3B). When all three lysines in both basic domains were substituted for asparagine (K155N/K167N/K170N)(Fig. 3B) HDGF was diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus in both VSM and A10 cells. The HDGF spacer region between the two basic domains of the NLS contains a consensus sequence (165SPKR169)that is phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase (11Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 20Moreno S. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 61: 549-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). As phosphorylation of this consensus motif increases the rate of nuclear targeting for p53 and SV40 large T antigen (21McVey D. Brizuela L. Mohr I. Marshak D.R. Gluzman Y. Beach D. Nature. 1989; 341: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) we examined the importance of this motif on HDGF nuclear targeting. The target serine in the p34cdc2 kinase consensus motif was point-mutated to result in a S165A substitution (cdc2-HDGF). As shown in Fig. 4, cdc2-HDGF continues to exclusively target the nucleus. The rate of nuclear targeting was also not affected as cdc2-HDGF was never observed in the cytoplasm even at early time points (16, 20, and 24 h after transfection). VSM in the neointima after carotid injury (16Everett A.D. Lobe D.R. Matsumura M.E. Nakamura H. McNamara C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) or in culture express HDGF exclusively in the nucleus. To determine whether HDGF nuclear targeting is essential for the mitogenic effect of HDGF, VSM were transfected with empty vector as a control, wild type HDGF, or triple NLS mutant HDGF (K155N/K167N/K170N, 3N-HDGF) containing a HA epitope tag. The cells were assayed for BrdUrd incorporation as a marker of DNA synthesis. As shown Fig.5A, expression of wild type HDGF in VSM and A10 cells stimulated BrdUrd incorporation indicating increased DNA synthesis, whereas cells expressing the NLS mutant HDGF demonstrated a cytoplasmic expression pattern of HDGF without a stimulation of BrdUrd incorporation. When cells were counted, >90% (p ≤ 0.05) of cells transfected with wild type HDGF were positive for BrdUrd, whereas 7% of cells transfected with NLS mutant HDGF were BrdUrd-positive (Fig. 5B). Mutation of the p34cdc2 kinase consensus (S166A, cdc2-HDGF) did not affect BrdUrd uptake with 93% of transfected cells BrdUrd-positive (Fig.5B). Growth factors produced by the vascular wall after balloon injury play an important role in the pathologic proliferation of VSM. The paradigm of growth factor function involves interaction of a growth factor with a surface receptor, triggering an intracellular signaling event leading to increased proliferation of VSM. This paradigm has been challenged recently by the identification of growth factors within the nucleus of cells (6Rabowcz-Szulczynska E.M. Rodeck U. Herlyn M. Koprowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3728-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9Jans D.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 12Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y.

A. 1993; 90: 2165-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). At least in the circumstances of bFGF, nuclear targeting and not cell surface receptor signaling appears responsible for mediating bFGF cell proliferation (12Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier J.A.M. Hla T. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although HDGF was originally identified from conditioned media, HDGF when observed in cells in vitro or in cells in intact tissues is only found in the nucleus. Similarly HDGF is expressed in a nuclear pattern in cells of the neointima after balloon injury (16Everett A.D. Lobe D.R. Matsumura M.E. Nakamura H. McNamara C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that the basic amino acids in the putative bipartite NLS domain in the carboxyl-terminal half of the HDGF protein are required for nuclear targeting as substitution of a single lysine is sufficient to perturb nuclear targeting. As was shown in nucleoplasmin (11Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar) these basic domains are interdependent and require both for full function. When all three lysines were mutated in these basic domains HDGF was functionally excluded from the nucleus. Nuclear targeting is likely to be an important mechanism of function for the HDGF family of proteins as all identified members of the HDGF family of related proteins (HRP1–HRP3) and p52/p75 contain a highly conserved bipartite NLS domain (17Izumoto Y. Kuroda T. Harada H. Kishimoto T. Nakamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Ikegame K. Yamamoto M. Kishima Y. Enomoto H. Yoshida K.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Furthermore, like HDGF, p52/p75, HRP-1, and HRP-3 all traffic to the nucleus (18Ikegame K. Yamamoto M. Kishima Y. Enomoto H. Yoshida K. Suemura M. Kishimoto T. Nakamura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Ge H. Yuanzheng S. Roeder R.G.

Commun. 1999; 262: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). HDGF is a growth factor for VSM as overexpression results in DNA synthesis and increased cell number (16Everett A.D. Lobe D.R. Matsumura M.E. Nakamura H. McNamara C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that the NLS triple lysine mutant of HDGF (3N-HDGF) that does not enter the nucleus did not stimulate BrdUrd incorporation. Therefore the bipartite NLS is not only required for the delivery of HDGF to the nucleus but is also necessary for HDGF-induced mitogenesis. Similarly, bFGF, which has been thought to function exclusively by signaling through a cell surface receptor, also requires nuclear entry to stimulate mitogenesis (12Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier J.A.M. Hla T. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Mutation of a nuclear localization signal in bFGF did not interfere with receptor binding or activation of early growth response genes but did significantly prevent cell proliferation. Therefore nuclear targeting of growth factors may represent a conserved pathway of cell growth regulation. The efficiency of nuclear targeting may not always be related only to the presence of a NLS. Modulation of nuclear targeting can also be accomplished by phosphorylation of flanking sequences (10Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). For example, SV40 large T antigen contains a p34cdc2 kinase substrate motif (S/T)PX(K/R) flanking the basic clusters of the NLS (11Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 20Moreno S. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 61: 549-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and p34cdc2 kinase phosphorylation of the SV40 large T antigen regulates the rate of nuclear entry (21McVey D. Brizuela L. Mohr I. Marshak D.R. Gluzman Y. Beach D. Nature. 1989; 341: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The p34cdc2 kinase motif is not necessary for nuclear targeting or mitogenic function of HDGF in VSM. Overexpression of HDGF with substitution of the serine for an alanine in the consensus motif did not block nuclear targeting or DNA synthesis. Therefore in HDGF the overall function of this motif is unclear. Presently the nuclear function of HDGF or any growth factor is unknown. It is intriguing that one member of the HDGF family of proteins, p52, is a transcription coactivator protein (19Ge H. Yuanzheng S. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). p52 has been shown to modulate the transcriptional activation of class II genes in vitro and serves as a general transcription coactivator enhancing activated transcription through direct interactions with the general transcription factor TFIIF and RNA polymerase II (23Ge H. Si Y. Wolfe A.P. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 751-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly p52 also specifically interacts with the binding domains of the splicing factor alternative/essential splicing factor 2 to increase pre-mRNA splicing activity (23Ge H. Si Y. Wolfe A.P. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 751-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Whether the nuclear function of HDGF and the other related proteins is the specific regulation of target gene transcription by enhancing/inhibiting the general transcription apparatus is yet to be explored."

PDC catalyzes the irreversible conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (1Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), which then proceeds to oxidation through the tricarboxylic acid cycle or conversion to fatty acids for storage (2Randle P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The flux through this complex is controlled by the phosphorylation state of three serine residues on the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1). When glucose and insulin levels are high, the serine residues are dephosphorylated by an active pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, which results in an active complex and the flow of energy from glycolysis to oxidation or storage. In fasting or diabetes, the kinase associated with the complex (3Stepp L.R. Pettit F.H. Yeaman S.J. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is activated and also induced, resulting in phosphorylation and inactivation of the E1 enzyme. This serves to preserve the three-carbon skeleton of the pyruvate for gluconeogenesis, which maintains serum glucose levels during fasting but also contributes to pathologic hyperglycemia in diabetes (1Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar).The activity of the kinase is, in part, regulated by the substrates and products of the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. The substrates (pyruvate, NAD+, and CoA) inhibit kinase activity, whereas the products (NADH and acetyl-CoA) stimulate kinase activity. It is generally believed that only pyruvate directly regulates the kinase activity through a dedicated allosteric site. The effects of NAD+/NADH and CoA/acetyl-CoA are mediated by the oxidation, reduction, and acetylation state of the lipoyl group (4Radke G.A. Ono K. Ravindran S. Roche T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 982-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Structurally, this domain is an 80-amino acid, free-folding domain in the N-terminal region of E2. It is connected to the globular C-terminal E2 domain, which forms the icosahedral core of the PDC, by an extended, unstructured linker sequence (5Green J.D. Laue E.D. Perham R.N. Ali S.T. Guest J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 328-343PubMed Google Scholar). Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) binds to the lipoyl domain, where it monitors changes in the reduced and acetylated states of the lipoic acid ligand and adjusts its activity accordingly.Based on its substrate specificity, PDK2 is a strictly serine-specific protein kinase. Structurally, all serine/threonine kinases identified to date can be classified as one large superfamily (6Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar). However, sequence determination of PDK showed that it lacked the characteristic structural elements of serine/threonine kinases (7Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) explicitly described by Hanks and Hunter (6Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has resulted in the identification of ∼25 genes in the PDK family. Four of these PDKs are expressed in mammalian cells. PDK2, the subject of this study, appears to be the most abundantly expressed isozyme (8Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Comparison of these sequences shows that these proteins typically consist of two almost equal parts: a poorly conserved N-terminal half and a highly conserved C-terminal half. Within the C-terminal domain, there are four uniformly conserved subdomains, the N box (Glu-X-X-Lys-Asn-X-X-X-Ala), the G1 box (Asp-X-Gly-X-Gly), and the G2 box (Gly-X-Gly-X-Gly), which are analogous to the motifs found in bacterial histidine kinases (their occurrence in the topology of PDK2 is shown in Fig. 1d). The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that the nucleotide-binding domain is in the C-terminal half of PDK2, and that the G subdomains are important in nucleotide binding (9Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This x-ray crystallographic study was undertaken to determine the protein fold and the catalytic mechanism of unusual serine-specific kinase, as well as to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulation of the kinase activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSPDK2 from Rattus novegicus was cloned into a Novagen Pet28a vector and co-expressed in BL21[DE3] cells with the GroESL plasmid. Induction and purification using the N-terminal His6 tag were performed as described by Popov et al. (10Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with an approximate yield of 40 mg of PDK2 from 1 liter of cells. After passage through a MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) anion exchange column, the protein was concentrated (Millipore, Centricon 10) to 10 mg/ml and crystallized via vapor diffusion from a solution of either 100 mm imidazole or 100 mm MES, pH 6.5–7.0, 500 mm KCl, 3.5 mm 3-iodopropionic acid, 3.5 mm ADP, 7 mm MgCl2, 6.5% polyethylene glycol 6000, and 1.0% ethylene glycol. The crystals grew in 1 week to ∼0.3 × 0.3 × 0.1 mm. Cryoprotection was achieved with the well solution + 25% glycerol in stepped (5, 12.5, and 25%) increments. Selenium protein was produced (11Doublie S. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 523-530Google Scholar) and purified in the same fashion, substituting a host bacterium auxotrophic for methionine (Novagen B834) and providing selenomethionine in a defined growth medium. Crystallizations in the case of the selenomethionine protein were carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere but were otherwise identical to the native conditions.A three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (12Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) experiment was conducted on the selenomethionine protein crystals at 110 °K at the X12C beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. These crystals diffracted to 2.8 Å and were collected in a highly redundant fashion. The data were processed utilizing DENZO (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part B. 277. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) with the statistics listed in Table I, and care was taken to keep the Freidel pairs independent. A Patterson self-rotation function performed on the selenomethionine data in X-PLOR (14Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) identified a strong non-crystallographic symmetry axis in the PDK2 data, with a peak height 94% of that of the crystallographic 2-fold axis. The program SOLVE (version 1.0) (15Terwilliger T.C. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 530-537Google Scholar) was used to locate the positions of the selenium diffractors, utilizing the MAD experiment as a special case of multiple isomorphous replacement (16Ramakrishnan V. Biou V. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 538-557Google Scholar). 21 of the 36 anticipated selenium sites were located and used in the initial estimation of phases. From the selenium positions, the exact positioning of the non-crystallographic symmetry axis with respect to the unit cell was identified. An initial electron density map showed the outline of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit cell predicted by analysis of the cell dimensions using the Mathews equation. The map was improved with density modification and 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19706) Google Scholar). In this map, α-helical and β-strand secondary structural elements were clearly visible. Approximately 40% of the structure could be built from this map with O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) using the selenium positions to identify methionine residues and so help set the register of the model. Phase improvement was accomplished by incorporating the experimental and model phases in a Sigma A weighted protocol (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19706) Google Scholar). More of the model was built as it became evident with the improved phases. Phase refinement was initially done in X-PLOR (14Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) to an Rfree of ∼32%, after which no improvement was achieved. Reexamination of the data indicated that the crystals were pseudomerohedrally twinned along the b axis, with a statistically estimated twin fraction of 45% (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstlever R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). Reexploration of crystallization space yielded native crystals diffracting to >2.5 Å, but the twinning remained. With the added resolution, phase refinement of the model could be shifted to SHELXL, which was capable of refining the pseudomerohedrally twinned x-ray diffraction data (19Yang F. Dauter Z. Wlodawer A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Final rounds of model building and phase improvement were accomplished with building in O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) and refinement in SHELXL (21Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M.

The missing sections of the molecule are two loops between N-terminal helices (residues 34–39 and 130–135), a loop between domains (residues 172–176), the “lid” over the nucleotide-binding site (residues 290–307), and the C terminus of the molecule after residue 365. The Ramachandran plot shows good geometry in the model, with 86.0% of the amino acid residues in the most favored region and 14.0% in the additionally allowed regions (PROCHECK (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr.

Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) explicitly described by Hanks and Hunter (6Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has resulted in the identification of ∼25 genes in the PDK family. Four of these PDKs are expressed in mammalian cells. PDK2, the subject of this study, appears to be the most abundantly expressed isozyme (8Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Comparison of these sequences shows that these proteins typically consist of two almost equal parts: a poorly conserved N-terminal half and a highly conserved C-terminal half. Within the C-terminal domain, there are four uniformly conserved subdomains, the N box (Glu-X-X-Lys-Asn-X-X-X-Ala), the G1 box (Asp-X-Gly-X-Gly), and the G2 box (Gly-X-Gly-X-Gly), which are analogous to the motifs found in bacterial histidine kinases (their occurrence in the topology of PDK2 is shown in Fig. 1d). The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that the nucleotide-binding domain is in the C-terminal half of PDK2, and that the G subdomains are important in nucleotide binding (9Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This x-ray crystallographic study was undertaken to determine the protein fold and the catalytic mechanism of unusual serine-specific kinase, as well as to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulation of the kinase activity. MATERIALS AND METHODSPDK2 from Rattus novegicus was cloned into a Novagen Pet28a vector and co-expressed in BL21[DE3] cells with the GroESL plasmid. Induction and purification using the N-terminal His6 tag were performed as described by Popov et al. (10Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with an approximate yield of 40 mg of PDK2 from 1 liter of cells. After passage through a MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) anion exchange column, the protein was concentrated (Millipore, Centricon 10) to 10 mg/ml and crystallized via vapor diffusion from a solution of either 100 mm imidazole or 100 mm MES, pH 6.5–7.0, 500 mm KCl, 3.5 mm 3-iodopropionic acid, 3.5 mm ADP, 7 mm MgCl2, 6.5% polyethylene glycol 6000, and 1.0% ethylene glycol. The crystals grew in 1 week to ∼0.3 × 0.3 × 0.1 mm. Cryoprotection was achieved with the well solution + 25% glycerol in stepped (5, 12.5, and 25%) increments. Selenium protein was produced (11Doublie S. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 523-530Google Scholar) and purified in the same fashion, substituting a host bacterium auxotrophic for methionine (Novagen B834) and providing selenomethionine in a defined growth medium. Crystallizations in the case of the selenomethionine protein were carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere but were otherwise identical to the native conditions.A three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (12Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) experiment was conducted on the selenomethionine protein crystals at 110 °K at the X12C beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. These crystals diffracted to 2.8 Å and were collected in a highly redundant fashion. The data were processed utilizing DENZO (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part B. 277. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) with the statistics listed in Table I, and care was taken to keep the Freidel pairs independent. A Patterson self-rotation function performed on the selenomethionine data in X-PLOR (14Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) identified a strong non-crystallographic symmetry axis in the PDK2 data, with a peak height 94% of that of the crystallographic 2-fold axis. The program SOLVE (version 1.0) (15Terwilliger T.C. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 530-537Google Scholar) was used to locate the positions of the selenium diffractors, utilizing the MAD experiment as a special case of multiple isomorphous replacement (16Ramakrishnan V. Biou V. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 538-557Google Scholar). 21 of the 36 anticipated selenium sites were located and used in the initial estimation of phases. From the selenium positions, the exact positioning of the non-crystallographic symmetry axis with respect to the unit cell was identified. An initial electron density map showed the outline of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit cell predicted by analysis of the cell dimensions using the Mathews equation. The map was improved with density modification and 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19706) Google Scholar). In this map, α-helical and β-strand secondary structural elements were clearly visible. Approximately 40% of the structure could be built from this map with O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) using the selenium positions to identify methionine residues and so help set the register of the model. Phase improvement was accomplished by incorporating the experimental and model phases in a Sigma A weighted protocol (17Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19706) Google Scholar). More of the model was built as it became evident with the improved phases. Phase refinement was initially done in X-PLOR (14Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) to an Rfree of ∼32%, after which no improvement was achieved. Reexamination of the data indicated that the crystals were pseudomerohedrally twinned along the b axis, with a statistically estimated twin fraction of 45% (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstlever R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

With the added resolution, phase refinement of the model could be shifted to SHELXL, which was capable of refining the pseudomerohedrally twinned x-ray diffraction data (19Yang F. Dauter Z.

https://openalex.org/W1573189660,"Platelet-vascular endothelial cell interactions are central to the maintenance of vascular homeostasis. Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostacyclin (prostaglandin (PG)I2) are the major products of cyclooxygenase (COX) metabolism by platelets and the vascular endothelium, respectively. Here we report the effects of platelet-endothelial interactions on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) COX-2 expression and prostanoid synthesis. Co-incubation of platelets with HUVECs resulted in a dose-dependent induction in COX-2 expression. This was accompanied by a relatively small increase in thromboxane B2 synthesis (2 ng) by comparison to the production of 6-keto-PGF1alpha and PGE2, which increased by approximately 14 and 12 ng, respectively. Abrogation of platelet-HUVEC interactions excluded direct cell-cell contact as a required event. Preincubation of HUVECs with SQ29548, a TXA2 receptor antagonist, dose-dependently inhibited platelet-induced COX-2 expression and prostanoid synthesis. Similarly, if platelet TXA2 synthesis was inhibited no induction of COX-2 was observed. Furthermore, a TXA2 analog, carbocyclic TXA2, induced HUVEC COX-2 expression and the synthesis of 6-keto-PGF1alpha and PGE2. This was also associated with an increase in the expression and activity of PGI synthase and PGE synthase but not TX synthase. Platelet co-incubation (or TXA2) also selectively activated the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to regulate HUVEC COX-2 expression. Thus it seems that platelet-derived TXA2 can act in a paracrine manner to up-regulate endothelial COX-2 expression and PGI2 synthesis. These observations are of particular importance given the recent observations regarding selective COX-2 inhibitors and the suppression of PGI2 synthesis."

Why the heart would express these “lipoprotein assembly” genes has been unclear. Here we demonstrate that the beating mouse heart actually secretes spherical lipoproteins. Moreover, increased cardiac production of lipoproteins (e.g., in mice that express a human apolipoprotein B transgene) was associated with increased triglyceride secretion from the heart and decreased stores of triglycerides within the heart. Increased cardiac production of lipoproteins also reduced the pathological accumulation of triglycerides that occurs in the hearts of mice lacking long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase. In contrast, blocking heart lipoprotein secretion (e.g., in heart-specific microsomal triglyceride transfer protein knockout mice) increased cardiac triglyceride stores.

We recently reported that apoB and MTP are also expressed in the mouse heart, and that the full-length apoB protein, apoB100, is translated by minced-up pieces of mouse hearts (7Borén J.

Substantially more apoB100 is synthesized by the hearts of human apoB transgenic mice (HuBTg+/o) created with large fragments of human genomic DNA (7Borén J. Véniant M.M. Young S.G. J. Clin.

Not surprisingly, apoB sequences have been encountered during the sequencing of clones in human heart cDNA libraries (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST). The expression of “lipoprotein assembly” genes in the heart led us to hypothesize that the heart actually synthesizes and secretes lipoproteins (7Borén J. Véniant M.M. Young S.G. J. Clin.

Young S.G. Circulation. 1998; 98: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The concept that the heart might export lipids was remarkable because the heart has always been viewed as a prodigious importer of lipids from the plasma lipoproteins produced in the liver and intestine (4Havel R.J.

A mechanism for exporting surplus lipids would make teleological sense, given that elevated levels of fatty acids and fatty acid intermediates can have deleterious effects on cardiac function (11Tripp M.E.

In the current study, we sought to determine whether the beating heart actually secretes spherical lipoproteins containing a core of neutral lipids and, if so, to assess the effect of lipoprotein secretion on myocardial lipid homeostasis. To address the possibility that lipoproteins are synthesized by the heart, we used a Langendorff apparatus to perfuse mouse hearts and then examined the perfusion medium for secreted lipoproteins and lipids. To assess the impact of lipoprotein secretion on cardiac lipid homeostasis in vivo, we measured cardiac triglyceride stores in genetically modified mice that had increased levels of cardiac lipoprotein production and in mice with a blockade of cardiac lipoprotein production. Hemizygous human apoB transgenic mice (HuBTg+/o) generated with an 80-kb human genomic clone (p158) have been described (16Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E.

Transgenic mice expressing Cre under the control of an α-myosin heavy chain promoter (αMHC-Cre; Ref. 19Agah R. Frenkel P.A. French B.A. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. J. Clin.

Mice homozygous for a conditional allele of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene (Mttpflox/flox) were described previously (5Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J.

The mice were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed rodent chow containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). Genotypes were determined by Southern blot analysis or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Heart-specific Mttp knockout mice (Mttpflox/floxαMHC-Cre+/o) were generated by breeding Mttpflox/flox mice with αMHC-Cre transgenic mice. Recombination withinMttp was assessed by Southern blot analysis ofSacI-cleaved genomic DNA (5Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Mttp mRNA levels in the hearts ofMttpflox/floxαMHC-Cre+/οmice were assessed by real-time, quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. In brief, 25 ng of total heart RNA and 10 mm of oligonucleotide probes and primers were mixed, and real-time RT-PCR was carried out with the platinum quantitative RT-PCR thermoscript one-step system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The Mttp oligonucleotide primers were 5′-CACTCTTGGAGAAACGGTCATAATT-3′ and 5′-CACTCTTGGAGAAACGGTCATAATT-3′, and the probe was 5′-CGTCGAGTTCTCAAGGAGATGGCTGTTC-3′ (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For normalization of heart Mttp mRNA levels, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control RT-PCR kit was used (Taqman; PE Applied Biosystems). The RT-PCR reaction was performed for 30 min at 60 °C, followed by a heat inactivation step (10 min at 95 °C) and then real-time PCR (40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s) on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems). Adult mice (27 ± 3 g;n = 30) were anesthetized with phenobarbital (10 mg of intraperitoneal) and heparinized (100 units of intraperitoneal) 20 min before the excision of the hearts. After removal, hearts (0.165 ± 0.02 g; n = 30) were placed in an ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate (KHB) medium (120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 11 mmglucose). All noncardiac tissues (lung, thymus, trachea, and external fat deposits) were dissected away from the heart, and the aorta was cannulated with an 18-gauge plastic cannula. The hearts were subjected to retrograde perfusions in a Langendorff apparatus at 80 cm H2O pressure with continuously oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) KHB medium. A modified KHB medium containing 1.2 mm oleate bound to 3% albumin was prepared as described previously (20Belke D.D. Larsen T.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Severson D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: R1210-R1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heart rate (n = 30 hearts) was 303 ± 47 beats/min (mean ± S.D.), and the coronary flow was 5.1 ± 1.6 ml/min. In 10 experiments, an MTP inhibitor (BMS-197636; Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Princeton, NJ) was added to the perfusion medium at a final concentration of 2 µm. Fresh plasma samples (0.5 ml) and heart perfusion medium samples (9 ml) were adjusted to d 1.10 g/ml with KBr and overlaid with 3 ml of a d 1.063 g/ml KBr solution. The samples were then ultracentrifuged in an SW40 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 40,000 rpm for 18 h at 12 °C. The top 0.5 ml from the ultracentrifugation tubes was removed and adjusted to d 1.10 g/ml and a volume of 3 ml. The samples were again overlaid with 3 ml of a d 1.063-g/ml solution and ultracentrifuged in an SW55 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 18 h at 12 °C. A carbon grid was placed on the liquid surface and then examined for lipoproteins by negative-staining electron microscopy (21Hamilton R.L. Cowgill G. Estrich D.L. Wood P.D.

Nichols A.V. Adv. Lipid Res. 1972; 10: 1-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess cardiac triglyceride secretion, hearts were perfused with continuously circulating KHB medium containing 1.2 mm[3H]oleate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) bound to 3% albumin (specific activity, 5 mCi/liter). Samples of the perfusate were collected at baseline and at 15, 30, and 60 min. After lyophilization, lipids were extracted with 2:1 choloroform/methanol (v/v) and separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The fatty acid and triglyceride radioactivities were quantified in a scintillation counter. The sample activity of 3H-triglycerides was normalized to the dry weight of the heart and to the sample activity of [3H]oleate, the latter to compensate for differences in recovery between samples. The d 1.063-g/ml fractions of perfusion medium samples obtained at 60 min were prepared as described above for the electron microscopy studies. At the end of the second ultracentrifugation, lipids within the top 0.5 ml of the density gradient were extracted with 3:2 hexane/isopropanol (v/v) and separated by TLC, and the triglyceride radioactivity was quantified in a scintillation counter. Cardiac myocytes were prepared from 1–5-day-old neonatal HuBTg+/o and nontransgenic hearts by serial trypsinization of pieces of heart tissue as described (23Simpson P. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The cells were preplated for 90 min at 37 °C in minimum essential medium with Hank's basic salt solution, 50 units/ml penicillin (Sigma), vitamin B12 (Sigma), and 5% bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). This preplating step allowed the noncardiac myocytes to adhere to the plastic dish. Cardiac myocytes were plated at a density of 400 cells/mm2 in dishes coated with collagen I (Biocoat Collagen I Cellware; Becton Dickinson Laboratories, Bedford, MA). The medium was changed daily for 4 days. The expression of human apoB in cardiac myocytes from HuBTg+/o mice was assessed by RT-PCR (Prostar RT-PCR kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The human apoB oligonucleotide primers were 5′-GAAGAACTTCCGGAGAGTTGCAAT-3′ and 5′-CTCTTAGCCCCATTCAGCTCTGAC-3′. Cardiac myocytes were incubated for 5 or 24 h with 1.0 ml of medium containing 10 mm [14C]oleate (0.40 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) bound to 10% albumin. The medium was then removed, and the cells were quickly washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (0.2%) and then washed twice for 10 min with the same buffer. Cardiac myocytes were washed two more times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After the addition of 10 ml of an internal triglyceride standard, glycerol tri-[3H]oleic acids (20 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), lipids were extracted from the cells and the medium with 3:2 hexane/isopropanol (v/v). Triglycerides were identified by TLC, and the triglyceride radioactivity was quantified in a scintillation counter. Total cell protein was extracted by adding 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH to each well for 10 min and assayed by a colorimetric assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).14C-triglycerides were normalized to the recovery of the 3H-triglyceride standard and expressed as disintegrations per minute per milligram of cell protein. Heart and liver triglyceride stores were determined in mice that had been fasted for 18 h. All comparisons were performed on age- and sex-matched littermates. Hearts (dissected free of all vessels and pericardial fat) and ∼100-mg liver pieces were homogenized (Ultra-Turbax T8; VWR) in the presence of a known amount of tripentadecanoic acid (Sigma) as an internal standard (24Leung G.K.

Lipids were extracted with 3.0 ml of 2:1 chloroform/methanol. Triglycerides were identified by TLC, transesterified with methanolic HCl, and quantified by gas chromatography using the internal standard (24Leung G.K. Véniant M.M. Kim S.K. Zlot C.H. Raabe M.

Triglyceride measurements were normalized to the weight of each tissue (millimoles of triglycerides per gram of tissue).

To limit the peroxidation of lipids during the procedure, hearts were homogenized in 1.15% KCl solution containing 50 mmdesferrioxamine (Sigma). Plasma concentrations of cholesterol, free fatty acids, and triglycerides after an 18-h fast were determined by colorimetric assays (Spectrum Cholesterol Assay; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL; free fatty acids, half micro test; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN; and triglycerides, Roche Diagnostics). Whole-blood glucose levels were determined by a colorimetric assay on a test strip (One Touch basic blood glucose monitoring system; Lifespan, Milpitas, CA). HuBTg+/o and HuBTg+/oAcadl−/− mice were fasted for 18 h, and the hearts were excised and labeled with [35S]Promix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Ref. 27Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, three mouse hearts (∼300 mg) were minced with a razor blade into ∼0.5-mm3 pieces, placed in a 1.6-ml Eppendorf tube, and washed twice with 1.0 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D-0422; Sigma) supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum, 1.6 mm glutamate, and 1.6 mm sodium pyruvate. The heart tissue was then incubated with 0.715 mCi of [35S]Promix and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. After addition of protease inhibitors, the medium from three tubes was pooled, and any debris was pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 1 min). The [35S]Promix labeling medium was subjected to discontinuous sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (7Borén J. Véniant M.M. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gradients were ultracentrifuged in an SW55 Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm for 65 h at 12 °C; the bottom of the tube was pierced, and the gradient was unloaded into five fractions. Human apoB was immunoprecipitated from each of the fractions and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The densities of the fractions were determined by refractometry. Hearts from HuBTg+/o mice and nontransgenic littermate controls were perfused in a Langendorff apparatus, and the perfusate was examined for lipoproteins by electron microscopy. Each mouse heart was first perfused exhaustively in a noncirculating fashion with KHB perfusion medium (retrograde coronary perfusion of 5 ml/min for 60 min) to remove any plasma lipoproteins. The hearts were then perfused with KHB perfusion medium containing 1.2 mm oleate, and the buffer was circulated. After 5 min, virtually no lipoproteins were detectable in the perfusion medium (Fig. 1,A and B), indicating that most plasma lipoproteins had been washed away. After 60 min, the perfusion medium from both HuBTg+/o and nontransgenic mice contained spherical lipoproteins (Fig. 1, C and D). Most of these lipoproteins in the perfusates from HuBTg+/o mouse hearts were in the low density lipoprotein size range (18.3 ± 5.7 nm in diameter (mean ± S.D.); n = 200 particles). The same was true for the lipoproteins in the perfusates of the nontransgenic hearts (18.5 ± 6.9 nm; n = 200). The lipoproteins in the plasma of the nontransgenic mice were larger and more variable in size (22.9 ± 17 nm; range, 12–106 nm;n = 200; Fig. 1E). The lipoproteins in the plasma of the HuBTg+/o mice were skewed toward smaller particles (17.5 ± 4.3 nm; n = 200), reflecting the larger numbers of low density lipoprotein particles in the plasma of those mice (Ref. 16Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar and Fig. 1F). The heart perfusion experiments suggested that the beating heart secretes lipoproteins. The fact that the lipoproteins were spherical suggested that the heart must secrete core lipids (e.g., triglycerides). To address the issue of triglyceride secretion by the heart, we perfused mouse hearts for 60 min with continuously circulating medium containing 1.2 mm[3H]oleate. 3H-triglycerides were detected in the perfusates of nontransgenic hearts, and the amounts increased with time (Fig. 2A). Significantly more 3H-triglycerides were present in the perfusates of the hearts of the HuBTg+/o mice at 60 min (Fig. 2A). Adding an MTP inhibitor to the medium reduced the amount of3H-triglycerides secreted from the HuBTg+/omouse hearts (Fig. 2A). The difference in the amounts of triglycerides in the perfusates of HuBTg+/o and nontransgenic hearts reflected, in large part, the different amounts of 3H-triglycerides in thed < 1.063-g/ml fraction. At 60 min, the amount of3H-triglycerides in the d < 1.063-g/ml fraction was significantly greater for the HuBTg+/o mice than for the nontransgenic mice (Fig. 2B). We suspected that lipoproteins are produced by cardiac myocytes. This conclusion was bolstered by experiments with cardiac myocytes from newborn HuBTg+/o mice. HuBTg+/o myocytes expressed the apoB gene, as judged by RT-PCR (Fig.3A). After incubating the myocytes with [14C]oleate, HuBTg+/o myocytes secreted ∼2-fold more 14C-triglycerides than the nontransgenic cardiac myocytes (2.9-, 1.6-, 1.3-, 2.0-, and 2.1-fold more in five experiments). An example of one such experiment is shown in Fig. 3B. Gene defects that block lipoprotein secretion are associated with increased intracellular lipid stores in the liver and intestine (2Kane J.P. Havel R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.

We hypothesized that interfering with lipid and lipoprotein secretion in the heart might also increase triglyceride stores in the heart. We compared heart triglyceride stores in heart-specific MTP knockout mice (Mttpflox/floxmice carrying an MHC-Cre transgene) and littermate controls (nontransgenic Mttpflox/flox mice;n = 20 in each group). Heart-specific recombination occurred as predicted in mice carrying the αMHC-Cretransgene (Fig. 4A), andMttp mRNA levels were reduced by ∼90% (Fig.4B). Although there was no difference in liver triglyceride stores in the two groups of mice (Fig. 4C;p = 0.77), the triglyceride stores in hearts of theMttpflox/flox/αMHC-Cre mice were almost 2-fold higher than in controls (p < 0.0005; Fig. 4C). The increase in cardiac triglyceride stores was almost certainly attributable to the Mttp gene excision and not simply to the expression of the αMHC-Cretransgene. In a control experiment, there was no difference in cardiac triglyceride stores in αMHC-Cre transgenic mice and littermate control mice that were homozygous for a wild-typeMttp allele (2.40 ± 0.40 µmol/g in αMHC-Cre transgenic mice (n = 4)versus 2.75 ± 0.80 µmol/g in the nontransgenic mice (n = 5); p = 0.45). To investigate whether increased heart lipoprotein production reduces cardiac triglyceride stores, we assessed heart triglyceride stores in C57BL/6 HuBTg+/o mice (n = 30 females) and nontransgenic littermate controls (n = 29 females). The plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels were higher in the HuBTg+/o mice than in nontransgenic controls (Fig.5A), but there were no differences in plasma glucose or free fatty acid levels (Fig.5B). Cardiac triglyceride stores were reduced by ∼75% in the HuBTg+/o mice (p < 0.0001; Fig.5C). There was no difference in liver triglyceride stores (Fig. 5C). Long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (Acadl) is required for the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids within mitochondria. Homozygous Acadl−/− mice have elevated plasma fatty acid levels and accumulate pathological levels of triglycerides in both heart and liver in response to fasting (18Kurtz D.M. Rinaldo P. Rhead W.J. Tian L. Millington D.S. Vockley J. Hamm D.A. Brix A.E. Lindsey J.R. Pinkert C.A. O'Brien W.E. Wood P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15592-15597Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine whether increased heart lipoprotein production from the human apoB transgene affects heart triglyceride stores inAcadl−/− mice, we measured heart triglyceride stores in Acadl-deficient mice that carried the human apoB transgene (Acadl−/−HuBTg+/o) and in nontransgenic Acadl−/− littermate control mice. As before, the plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher in the Acadl−/−HuBTg+/othan in the Acadl−/− mice (Fig.6A), but there were no differences in glucose or fatty acid levels (Fig. 6B). Heart triglyceride stores were significantly lower inAcadl−/−HuBTg+/o mice than in theAcadl−/− controls (p < 0.01; Fig. 6C). Once again, however, the human apoB transgene did not affect triglyceride stores in the liver (Fig. 6C). We suspected that the increased triglyceride stores within the hearts of Acadl-deficient mice might be associated with the secretion of more buoyant lipoproteins from the heart. However, this did not appear to be the case. The buoyant density of the apoB100-containing lipoproteins produced by minced-up pieces of hearts from Acadl−/−HuBTg+/o mice was the same as that of lipoproteins produced by pieces of HuBTg+/ohearts (Fig. 6D). The lower cardiac levels of lipids inAcadl−/−HuBTg+/o mice than inAcadl−/− mice raised the possibility that the hearts of those two groups of mice might contain d"
https://openalex.org/W2020339838,"Transcriptional control of gene expression contributes to the regulation of diverse cellular processes including cell cycle progression and the cellular response to DNA damage. Global gene expression profiling was performed using p53-deficient human cells to identify genes with G2/M-specific and DNA damage-responsive expression. Numerous cell cycle-regulated genes were identified, but surprisingly the analysis failed to identify genes activated by ionizing radiation. Instead, significant delays in expression of G2/M-specific genes, including known mitotic regulators, were observed following DNA damage. Thus, in the absence of p53, gene induction does not contribute to the G2 arrest following DNA damage. Rather, the DNA damage checkpoint elicits a G2 cell cycle arrest, in part, by delaying accumulation of proteins required in mitosis."

DAPK's multiple domains include ankyrin repeats, P-loops, cytoskeleton binding motifs, a death domain, and a catalytic domain that has high sequence similarity to vertebrate myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). The protein kinase and death domains of DAPK have been directly implicated in cellular functions through the use of cultured cells transfected with DNA constructs encoding DAPK or mutated DAPK (1Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 2Raveh T. Berissi H. Eisenstein M. Spivak T. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although an intact kinase domain is required for many of these cellular functions, endogenous protein substrates for DAPK have yet to be identified, and an efficient peptide or protein substrate for the characterization of enzyme activity or development of inhibitors is not available. The lack of known substrates for DAPK is reflective of an important challenge in the post-genomic sequence era (12Lander ES et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17981) Google Scholar). Complete genome sequences provide open reading frames (ORFs) that encode potential PKs, and functional genetics screens allow correlations of PKs with cell function with only a limited knowledge of downstream pathway components or enzyme mechanism. Characterization of the catalytic properties of the newly discovered PKs, linkage of quantitative changes in their enzyme activity to cellular responses, and discovery of ligands capable of modulating enzyme activity require the discovery of both peptide and protein substrates. These enzymes without known substrates are molecular orphans, and the rather strict substrate requirements of some can be an impediment to further research. DAPK is one such PK that has resisted identification of endogenous protein targets or useful peptide substrates with standard approaches (13Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In turn, the lack of established DAPK protein substrates or an efficient peptide substrate has precluded the investigation of DAPK as an enzyme, impaired mechanistic investigations into the role of this interesting family of protein kinases in cell function, and hindered the search for selective inhibitors of DAPK. Quantitative phosphorylation of substrates is required for the analysis of the catalytic properties of DAPK, such as kinetic constants and substrate sequence preferences, and for investigations that require the determination of changes in enzyme activity. This is especially true when such activity changes occur without a corresponding change in the protein levels of the enzyme, as is often the case with intracellular signal transduction pathways (14Lukas T.J. Mirzoeva S. Watterson D.M. Van Eldik L. Watterson D.M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York1998: 65-168Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, a void exists in our knowledge about the catalytic and substrate recognition properties of DAPK and related death-associated PKs, and future research is impeded by the lack of this critical knowledge and key research tools. As part of an attempt to fill this void and provide a proof of principle for an integrated approach to kinase substrate discovery, we investigated DAPK using an approach that includes the interface of very high resolution macromolecular crystallography and positional scanning substrate library synthesis linked to enzymology. We report the discovery of useful peptide substrates for DAPK that allows characterization of its catalytic properties. The final substrates have Km values in the target range of 10 µm, which is needed for the measurement of a kinase activity in biological samples. This allowed us to monitor DAPK catalytic activity in extracts of adult brain and to measure an enrichment in specific activity that correlated with protein purification detected by Western blot analysis with antisera against the catalytic domain. The insight into phosphorylation site preferences emanating from knowledge of catalytic domain activity and structure should be useful in future searches for endogenous protein substrates and the development of selective inhibitors. The results also provide a proof of principle for an approach that can potentially be applied to any ORF encoding a protein kinase. The DAPK catalytic domain was produced by polymerase chain reaction-assisted subcloning (15Watterson D.M. Schavocky J.P. Guo L. Weiss C. Chlenski A. Shirinsky V.P. Van Eldik L.J. Haiech J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) from the DAPK cDNA, kindly provided by A. Kimchi (1Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), using the primers 5′-GGG GGG GGT CTC AGC GCT CTT GAT CCA GGG ATG CTG CAA-3′ and 5′-GGG GGG GGT CTC AGC GCT ACT AAG TGC CTG TTG TGT ATC-3′, which contained flanking BsaI sites and amplified the portion of the cDNA from nucleotides 337–1191 (GenBankTM accession number NM_004938). Briefly, the region of the DAPK cDNA that encodes amino acids 1–274, corresponding to the similar catalytic region produced from MLCK (16Shoemaker M.O. Lau W. Shattuck R.L. Kwiatkowski A.P. Matrisian P.E. Guerra-Santos L. Wilson E. Lukas T.J. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. J.

Protein was produced and purified from Escherichia coli essentially as described previously (16Shoemaker M.O. Lau W. Shattuck R.L. Kwiatkowski A.P. Matrisian P.E. Guerra-Santos L. Wilson E. Lukas T.J. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1107-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) except with the additional use of the streptavidin tag following the manufacturer's recommendations. The protein was homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and gave the expected molecular weight. DAPK was enriched from bovine brain extracts using a modification of the first few steps of MLCK purification (16Shoemaker M.O. Lau W. Shattuck R.L. Kwiatkowski A.P. Matrisian P.E. Guerra-Santos L. Wilson E. Lukas T.J. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1107-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), with all purification steps carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, bovine brain was homogenized in 2 volumes of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/liter pepstatin and leupeptin, 40 mm1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone) in a Waring blender at low speed, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min in a Sorvall SLA-3000 rotor, and the supernatant subjected to a 55% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation. The 55% ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 1 volume of buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and its conductivity was adjusted to that of buffer B. The redissolved fraction was adsorbed to a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with buffer B, washed with 5 column volumes of buffer B, and DAPK eluted with buffer B containing 0.2 m NaCl. All chromatography fractions were assayed immediately for DAPK enzyme activity using peptide 38 described in this report, and aliquots were prepared in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for subsequent Western blot analysis. Western blot analyses were done as described (17Watterson D.M. Collinge M. Lukas T.J. Van Eldik L.J. Birukov K.G. Stepanova O.V. Shirinsky V.P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with a site-directed polyclonal rabbit antisera (number 7315) made against the synthetic peptide KPKDTQQALSRK using a protocol described previously for antibody production (18Van Eldik L.J.

This amino acid sequence corresponds to a region of the DAPK ORF that encodes the proposed catalytic domain. Enzyme assays and kinetic analyses were done essentially as described previously (16Shoemaker M.O. Lau W. Shattuck R.L. Kwiatkowski A.P. Matrisian P.E. Guerra-Santos L. Wilson E. Lukas T.J.

Peptide substrate phosphorylation by DAPK was linear under the conditions used, and less than 10% of the peptide was consumed in each reaction. Kinetic data were analyzed by double-reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burk) plots using Prism version 2.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Autophosphorylation of endogenous DAPK was examined in vitro as described previously for calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (19Zhou Z.H. Ando S. Furutsuka D. Ikebe M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, enriched fractions from the DEAE-cellulose chromatography purification step of endogenous DAPK from bovine brain (described here), or commercially available calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II as a control, were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by addition of SDS-containing sample buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. 32P-Labeled proteins were visualized by STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) after 1 and 14 h of exposure. Peptide synthesis was done by solid phase synthesis, as described previously (20Lukas T.J. Mirzoeva S. Slomczynska U. Watterson D.M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 910-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using a parallel synthesis of each peptide, except that the guanyl group of Arg was protected with 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl, and 30 mg of Rink-amide resin (0.8 mmol of mitrogen/g) from Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, KY) was used. Peptides were cleaved from the resin by treatment for 3 h using a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/anisole/dithioethanol (90:5:5 v/v/v) at room temperature. Peptides were precipitated with ethyl ether, washed, and extracted with 5% (v/v) acetic acid, lyophilized, and then purified by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography on a preparative Chromosorb (Rainin Instruments, Woburn, MA) C18 column using gradients of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water and 60% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. Purified peptides were characterized by matrix-assisted laser-desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using a Perspectives (Foster City, CA) Voyager DE-Pro system and by amino acid composition analysis of acid hydrolysates on a Waters (Bedford, MA) Alliance 2690 separations system equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector as described previously (20Lukas T.J. Mirzoeva S. Slomczynska U. Watterson D.M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 910-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The DAPK catalytic domain structure was determined to a resolution of 1.5 Å, and structural information was deposited with the protein data bank (PDB) as file 1IG1. Details of crystallographic data collections and statistics of refinement for the DAPK catalytic domain alone (apoI and apoII), the binary complex with the ATP analog, AMPPNP, and the ternary complexes with AMPPNP/Mg2+ or AMPPNP/Mn2+ will be presented elsewhere. 2Tereshko, V., Teplova, M., Brunzelle, J., Watterson, D., and Egli, M. (2001) Nature Struct. Biol., in press. For the purpose of peptide substrate discovery research reported here, orthorhombic crystals were grown from gradients of ammonium sulfate by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, and diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL. Crystals used for data collection contained one protein molecule per crystallographic asymmetric unit and diffracted to 1.5 Å. The structure of the high resolution orthorhombic crystals was determined by the single wavelength anomalous diffraction technique and used methyl mercury chloride soaks. Orthorhombic crystals of the binary complex with AMPPNP were obtained by co-crystallization, and orthorhombic crystals of the ternary complex were obtained by soaks of the binary complex crystals in metal ion solutions. The structures of ternary complexes in the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions were found similarly. The r.m.s. deviation between apoI and binary complex is 0.68 Å. The r.m.s. deviations between apoI and the ternary complexes do not exceed 0.7 Å. For homology modeling of a bound peptide substrate docked into the DAPK active site, the structure for the phosphorylase kinase (PHK) heptapeptide substrate RQMSFRL bound in the active site of the phosphorylase kinase catalytic domain was obtained from the protein data bank (code 2PHK). The phosphorylase kinase structure was that determined previously by Lowe et al. (21Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Skamnaki V.T. Oikonomakos N.G. Owen D.J. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6646-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) to a resolution of 2.6 Å. The Biopolymer and Homology modules of Insight II (MSI; San Diego, CA) were used to align and superimpose the DAPK catalytic domain and that of phosphorylase kinase and its bound substrate found in code2PHK. The two catalytic domain amino acid sequences were aligned for maximum sequence similarity, and the two catalytic domain crystal structures were superimposed by use of automatic structural alignment within the Homology module. The r.m.s. of the superimposed structures was 0.9. As summarized in Fig.1, the catalytic domain of DAPK has amino acid sequence similarity to the corresponding region of the MLCK catalytic domain (∼44% identity) and the phosphorylase kinase catalytic domain (33% identity). However, a crystal structure of the MLCK catalytic domain is not available, whereas a high resolution crystal structure of phosphorylase kinase is available. In addition, phosphorylase kinase is one of the few serine/threonine PKs for which there is a three-dimensional structure of a kinase domain containing a bound peptide substrate (21Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Skamnaki V.T. Oikonomakos N.G. Owen D.J. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6646-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, the corresponding catalytic domain region of DAPK (Fig. 1) was made by polymerase chain reaction-based subcloning of the appropriate region of the cDNA into a protein expression vector, and protein made in E. coli was described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein was purified based on the predicted properties of the ORF for the catalytic domain and utilization of an expressed affinity tag at the carboxyl terminus. The catalytic domain and protein production inE. coli were used for structure determination by high resolution x-ray crystallography, peptide substrate discovery by positional scanning substrate library synthesis, kinetic analysis of DAPK catalytic properties, and probing of the linkage between DAPK structure and activity by site-directed mutagenesis. This provided the knowledge and tools required for subsequent comparative analysis of the enzyme properties of DAPK from vertebrate tissue. In order to gain insight into structural features of DAPK, the high resolution (1.5 Å) crystal structure of DAPK was determined. The structure is available from the PDB as code 1IG1. The DAPK catalytic domain is in the active closed conformation (Fig.2A) and is the highest resolution crystallographic structure available for a protein kinase. The phylogenetically conserved amino acid residues involved in protein kinase interactions with ATP substrate and the conserved lysine important for catalysis (indicated in Fig. 1) are found in the corresponding positions of the DAPK structure, which contains a standard non-hydrolyzable ATP analog in its structure. In addition to the various conserved features of serine/threonine protein kinases in the ATP substrate site, the high resolution structure of DAPK reveals several novel features. For example, there is a methionine (Met-145) in close proximity to the ATP analog in the DAPK structure. Leucine is a more common amino acid found at this position in other serine/threonine protein kinases for which crystal structures have been solved. The DAPK structure also has novel features outside of the ATP recognition region. For example, a basic loop structure that includes a cluster of lysine and arginine residues in the sequence from Lys-44 to Val-55 (indicated in Fig. 1) is found in a region close to the potential peptide substrate recognition region of the catalytic domain, based on homology with other kinases. This basic loop is found only in the DAPK structure. However, the amino acid sequences of other serine/threonine protein kinases, such as Dlk (22Kogel D. Plottner O. Landsberg G. Christian S. Scheidtmann K.H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2645-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), DRP-1 (4Inbal B. Shani G. Cohen O. Kissil J.L. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1044-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), DAPK2 (23Kawai T. Nomura F. Hoshino K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Akira S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), DRAKs (24Sanjo H. Kawai T. Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29066-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and ZIP kinase (25Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), have a similar cluster of basic amino acids. Because most of these enzymes have been implicated in regulation of cell death and DAPK is the first structure available for this family of serine/threonine protein kinases, the possible importance of this basic loop structure in substrate recognition was addressed by site-directed mutagenesis after an efficient substrate was discovered (see below). The remarkable similarity between the structure of DAPK determined as part of this investigation and that previously reported (21Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Skamnaki V.T. Oikonomakos N.G. Owen D.J. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6646-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) for phosphorylase kinase containing a bound peptide substrate provided insight into what regions of DAPK are potentially important for recognition of a peptide substrate core phosphorylation sequence, composed of an RXXSX motif. Therefore, the DAPK catalytic domain (amino acids 1–274) and that of the corresponding region from phosphorylase kinase (amino acids 7–287) were aligned for maximum sequence similarity, and the two structures were superimposed with an excellent fit (r.m.s. 0.9) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The excellent superimposition of the two catalytic domains allowed the use of the bound peptide substrate from the phosphorylase kinase structure as a model for DAPK peptide substrate discovery. The superimposed structures revealed that the phosphorylase kinase peptide substrate docks with the DAPK structure (Fig.2B) such that discrete amino acids in DAPK in close proximity to the docked substrate can be compared with their corresponding amino acids in phosphorylase kinase (TableI and Fig. 1). Although peptide analogs of the phosphorylase kinase substrate do not serve as in vitro substrates for the DAPK catalytic domain, the comparison of common and unique residues in the two kinases can provide a focal point for initiation of peptide substrate discovery for DAPK.Table IAmino acids in DAPK structure proximal to docked substratePeptide substrate positionAmino acid in DAPKAmino acid in PHKP − 3Glu-99Glu-110Phe-101Phe-112Glu-142Glu-153P − 2Glu-181Ser-188Lys-140Lys-151Glu-142Glu-153Phe-182Tyr-189P − 1Ser-20Arg-27Gly-21Gly-28Gln-22Val-29Lys-140Lys-151P0Gln-22Val-29Asp-138Asp-149Lys-140Lys-151Asp-160Asp-167Leu-163Phe-170Gly-178Gly-185Thr-179Thr-186P1Gln-22Val-29Ile-176Val-183Pro-180Pro-187Gly-178Gly-185Val-183Leu-190Proximal is defined as an average distance of 5 Å between amino acids of DAPK and β-carbon atoms of substrate amino acids. Substrate is the docked PHK substrate from PDB code 2PHK as described in the text. Open table in a new tab Proximal is defined as an average distance of 5 Å between amino acids of DAPK and β-carbon atoms of substrate amino acids. Substrate is the docked PHK substrate from PDB code 2PHK as described in the text. Close inspection reveals that the amino acids from DAPK that are in close proximity to each position of the modeled peptide substrate are conserved compared with phosphorylase kinase, as is the spacing between these residues. For example, P −3 of the peptide substrate interacts with Glu-110, Phe-112, and Glu-153 of phosphorylase kinase, and the equivalent positions of DAPK are Glu-99, Phe-101, and Glu-142. Selected examples are given in Table I. These comparisons provide structural insight into the known preference for an arginine residue at P −3 and suggested that this position should be held constant for initial positional scanning substrate library syntheses. The docked model substrate is also consistent with established preference of serine/threonine protein kinases for a serine or threonine side chain versus a tyrosine side chain as the phospho-acceptor in the kinase reaction. For example, examination of this position of the homology model peptide substrate reveals that there is sufficient volume in the DAPK structure to accommodate a serine or threonine side chain but not a tyrosine side chain. Again, the structural comparisons provided insight into substrate preferences at this position and suggested that P0 should be held constant with a serine or threonine for initial positional scanning substrate library syntheses. In contrast to the remarkable level of conservation of the DAPK structure around the P −3 and P0 interacting regions, key differences between DAPK and phosphorylase kinase are found at positions interacting with the core phosphorylation site of the docked substrate. For example, P −2 proximal amino acids of phosphorylase kinase are Ser-188, Tyr-189, and Gln-234, but residues at the corresponding positions of the DAPK structure are Glu-181, Phe-182, and Lys-221. Other examples, including structural conservations between the two kinases at these positions, are provided in Table I. Overall, the comparative analyses suggested that variations at substrate positions P −2, P −1, and P1 might be important points for discovery of useful substrates for DAPK and might provide a basis for selective substrate utilization among DAPK, phosphorylase kinase, MLCK, and other closely related kinases. The DAPK structure also suggests features of substrates outside of the core phosphorylation site that should be considered. For example, upstream of the region of DAPK implicated by the docked peptide model in core phosphorylation sequence recognition, there are two clusters of acidic amino acids (Glu-112, Glu-113, Glu-114, Glu-117 and Glu-234, Glu-236, Glu-238) and a single acidic amino acid (Glu-106) that might contribute a charge complementarity to basic amino acids in a substrate sequence upstream of the substrate core phosphorylation site. In other words, basic amino acids in the P −6 through P −8 of a DAPK substrate might contribute to the substrate recognition features. Overall, analysis of the DAPK structure suggests specific sets of amino acids in DAPK that are 1) conserved and potentially interact with the strictly conserved substrate positions P −3 and P0; 2) are variable and potentially contribute to interactions at positions P −2, P −1, and P1; and 3) are part of topological features of DAPK that may contribute to interactions with basic amino acids in the substrate that are upstream of the core phosphorylation site sequence. It is hypothesized that the combination of common and unique features are major contributors to the ability of DAPK to discriminate among closely related substrate sequences in the area around the phosphorylation site. This combination of structural comparisons and peptide substrate docking suggested a peptide substrate with the pattern of (R/K)(R/K)(R/K)XXRXXSX, whereX is any amino acid and ("

The AADAgenes in the rat and mouse consist of five exons and have 2.4 kilobases of homologous promoter sequence upstream of the initiating ATG codon. AADA mRNA is expressed in hepatocytes, intestinal mucosal cells (probably enterocytes), the pancreas and also the adrenal gland. In mice, there is a diurnal rhythm in hepatic AADA mRNA concentration, with a maximum 10 h into the light (post-absorptive) phase. This diurnal regulation is attenuated in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α knockout mice. Intestinal but not hepatic AADA mRNA was increased following oral administration of the fibrate, Wy-14,643. The homology of AADA with hormone-sensitive lipase and the tissue distribution of AADA are consistent with the view that AADA plays a role in promoting the mobilization of lipids from intracellular stores and in the liver for assembling VLDL. This hypothesis is supported by parallel changes inAADA gene expression in animals with insulin-deficient diabetes and following treatment with orotic acid.

A large proportion of the VLDL-TAG secreted is derived from the cytosolic TAG storage pool in hepatocytes (1Duerden J.M. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This pool enables short term storage of TAG in the immediate post-prandial period and its subsequent secretion as VLDL-TAG when the level of circulating chylomicrons falls. Thus the store may act as a buffer to prevent post-prandial hyperlipidemia (for review see Ref. 2Gibbons G.F. Islam K. Pease R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by re-esterification to TAG (3Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 4Yang L.Y. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Steiner G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the mobilization of stored TAG, there is also evidence that the lipids associated with nascent VLDL in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen undergo remodeling prior to secretion (5Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this may also involve the action of the same or of a distinct lipase. The identities of the relevant lipases have not been established. Lehner et al. (6Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have proposed that both triglyceride hydrolase (TGH, an endoplasmic reticulum luminal carboxylesterase) and other lipases together play a role in the mobilization of stored lipid for secretion. Of particular interest, they have shown that TGH is not expressed during the suckling period of life and have suggested that this results in decreased VLDL secretion during this phase (7Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Arylacetamide deacetylase (AADA) is a 45-kDa esterase with an uncleaved amino-terminal signal anchor sequence. The enzyme was purified from human liver (9Probst M.R. Jeno P. Meyer U.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the human cDNA cloned by Probst et al. (10Probst M.R. Beer M. Beer D. Jeno P. Meyer U.A. Gasser R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) during studies of carcinogen metabolism. Immunoblotting of human tissues led Probst et al. (10Probst M.R. Beer M. Beer D. Jeno P. Meyer U.A. Gasser R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to conclude that the enzyme is expressed in liver and small intestine but not in the bladder, which is particularly susceptible to arylamine induced carcinogenesis. The presumed active site domain of AADA shows considerable homology to that present in hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), so that the enzyme has been classified as a lipase (10Probst M.R. Beer M. Beer D. Jeno P. Meyer U.A. Gasser R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). We have proposed that AADA, also, may function as a lipase during the process of lipoprotein secretion, and preliminary transfection evidence has supported the possibility that AADA promotes TAG secretion from hepatoma cells (2Gibbons G.F. Islam K. Pease R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 37-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have determined the cDNA and the genomic sequences of the AADA gene in mice and rats. This has enabled the development of an RT-PCR assay and has indicated that transcription varies throughout the diurnal cycle in a manner consistent with its proposed role and also changes under certain regimes associated with altered hepatic lipid secretion. Mouse AADA EST clone AA419661 was identified by homology with the published human cDNA sequence (10Probst M.R. Beer M. Beer D. Jeno P. Meyer U.A. Gasser R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was obtained from the Medical Research Council Human Genome Mapping Project (Cambridge, UK). A mouse cDNA probe was obtained by PCR amplification of AA419661with Taq polymerase of a 405-bp fragment using the forward oligonucleotide ATCTCTGTGGTCCTTGTA and reverse oligonucleotide GCCTCCATCATGAATGTAAAACA. The product was labeled with [32P]dCTP (Rediprime II, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK), purified on a Sephadex G50 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and was then used to screen a rat liver λ triplex cDNA library (CLONTECH) plated at 25,000 plaques/dish. Positive plaques were identified by hybridization at medium stringency (3 sequential 0.4× SSC washes at 62 °C) to duplicate Hybond N filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were purified by secondary and tertiary plating. To analyze the cDNA inserts, bacteriophage were converted to ampicillin resistance-conferring plasmids using the cre-lox excision sites present in λ triplex. Plasmid DNA was purified on anion exchange columns (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) and then sequenced using the ABI Prism (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) Big Dye cycle sequencing kit, and the products were analyzed on an ABI model 377 automated sequencer. 5′-RACE was carried out using Marathon RACE-ready rat liver cDNA exactly as described by the manufacturers (CLONTECH). Total cDNA was PCR-amplified with the Advantage 2 polymerase mix using a primer to the 5′ tag sequence and a gene-specific primer (CAGCACTCCCCAAACACCAGCCAC) derived from the cDNA sequence. Bands approximating the predicted size of the desired product were excised from the gel and reamplified usingTaq DNA polymerase. Southern blotting confirmed the presence of AADA-related sequences among the reamplified products. The reamplified fragments were gel-purified and subcloned into T-vector (Promega, Southampton, UK), positive subclones were detected by colony hybridization, and the recombinant plasmids were sequenced. Rat cDNA inserts and the mouse 405-bp PCR product (above) were next used to screen gridded filters representing mouse and rat PAC genomic libraries (constructed by Kazutoya Osoegawa and Pieter de Jong and supplied by the Medical Research Council Human Genome Mapping Project). Hybridizing clones were grown to an optical density of 0.15 units in 400 ml of 2× YT medium (bacto-tryptone 16 g/liter, bacto-yeast extract 10 g/liter, NaCl 5 g/liter) and induced with 0.15 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to promote P element replication. Plasmid DNA was purified on silica-based columns (Qiagen), and elution was performed at 65 °C to enhance recovery of large DNA molecules. The large insert size of the PAC clones (130–150 kb) precluded direct analysis, and therefore restriction fragments were shotgun subcloned into BamHI-,EcoRI-, or HindIII-digested and dephosphorylated pUC 18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subclones containing AADA exonic sequences were identified by hybridization of 32P-labeled cDNA to denatured bacterial colonies immobilized on Hybond N filters. To obtain internal sequence within subclones, either high pressure liquid chromatography-purified gene specific oligonucleotides (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as primers, or deletions were made between suitably positioned internal restriction sites and polylinker sites; where necessary, blunt ends were generated with T4 DNA polymerase. The pUC subclones mH4 and mE1, which do not span exonic sequences, were obtained by screening with fragments of intronic sequence derived from the subclones mB1 (see Fig. 3) (following amplification with oligonucleotides GATTGGATTGGGTAGGCGCTG and AGTGCCTTTGAAACAGTG) and mH1 (following isolation of a 646-bpHindIII-EcoRI fragment). Sequences (2180, 1679, 941, and 66 bp) spanning the putative mouse promoter region and extending into the 5′UTR were PCR-amplified with Taq polymerase using the following forward gene-specific oligonucleotides: 5′-GCAGTAAGTGGTACCGTAGTTCT-3′, 5′-GACTCTCATTTTCTTTCATAG-3′, 5′-AGATCTAAATTCAACATCCAA-3′, and a common reverse oligonucleotide, 5′-TAACCTGCCAAAAGCAGATCTAAGCTTAGG-3′. Products were isolated from agarose gels and subcloned into T-vector (Promega). Fragments were excised by digestion in each case at the introducedHindIII (underlined) site, together with either the introduced KpnI (underlined) site or the naturalBamHI or SacI sites, and were transferred to suitably digested pGL3 basic vector (Promega). The recombinant plasmids (1 µg) were cotransfected with pSV-βgal (0.5 µg, Promega) into subconfluent HepG2 cells (0.5 × 106/well) using the Lipofectin procedure as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested after 48 h and assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity as described previously (11Patel D.D. Knight B.L. Soutar A.K. Gibbons G.F. Wade D.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For Northern blotting, total RNA was purified using a column binding protocol (RNeasy) as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Approximately 30 mg of rat male adult liver (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, 200 g), fetal liver (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, embryonic day 19), neonate liver (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, 14 days post-natal), or mouse liver (ex-breeder female C57/black 6) was ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle under liquid N2. RNA was also prepared from 2 × 107 HepG2 cells (a gift from Dr. Philippa Talmud, the Rayne Institute, University College London) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Glutamax (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Total RNA was eluted in a volume of 50 µl of RNase-free water. The integrity of the total RNA preparation was checked by electrophoresis of 5 µl of eluate (prestained with 10 ng of ethidium bromide) onto a 1% MOPS-formaldehyde-agarose gel (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1987Google Scholar) and visualization of the 28- and 18-S rRNA bands. Resolved RNA was transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer in 10× SSC (1.5m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate) and the membranes probed with 32P cDNA as described. Additionally, these blots were probed with a 203-nucleotide fragment of mouse triglyceride hydrolase (EST AA245304) amplified with the forward oligonucleotide AGTCCTGGGGAAGTACGTC and the reverse oligonucleotide ATCTTGGGAGCACATAGG or with a full-length human lysosomal lipase cDNA (13Anderson R.A. Sando G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22479-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a kind gift from Dr. Richard Anderson (Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC) or with β-actin cDNA (CLONTECH). A human multiple tissue RNA dot blot and human multiple tissue Northern blots were obtained from CLONTECH and were probed initially with a human AADA full-length cDNA probe derived by ligating fragments from EST clones N76660, H71389, T83264, H71337, andH65969. Hybridization and washing conditions were exactly as described by the manufacturers. Subsequently the blots were stripped and reprobed with the HSL cDNA (14Holm C. Davis R.C. Osterlund T. Schotz M.C. Fredrikson G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a kind gift from Dr. Cecilia Holm (Lund University, Sweden) and β-actin cDNA. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (220 g starting weight) were rendered diabetic by subcutaneous injection of streptozotocin (80 mg/kg body weight of a freshly prepared 80 mg/ml solution in 25 mm sodium citrate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 4.5). A control group was injected with citrate-buffered saline alone. Both groups were maintained on a standard laboratory chow dietad libitum and additionally were given access to a 10%d-glucose solution overnight following injection to offset acute hypoglycemia. In some cases, diabetic animals were treated with 3 units of soluble insulin and 4 units of Zn2+ insulin complex 24 h before killing as described (15Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Animals from the control and diabetic groups were killed after 7 days, and tissues were frozen immediately in liquid N2. Glycosuria (>10 mm) was verified in each of the diabetic animals but was excluded in the controls by withdrawal of urine from the bladder for a Clinistix test (Bayer PLC, Newbury, UK). The establishment of diabetes was also apparent from changes in body weight. An average 38 ± 3.44 g (S.E.) increase was apparent in the control animals, whereas a 28 ± 6.7 g (S.E.) decrease in body weight was observed in the treated animals. In other experiments, male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with fish oil, orotic acid, or fructose for 14 days essentially as described previously (16Baker P.W. Gibbons G.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 719-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hebbachi A.M. Seelaender M.C. Baker B.W. Gibbons G.F. Biochem.

Powdered low-fat laboratory chow (breeding diet no. 3, Special Diet Service, Witham, Essex, UK) was reconstituted after mixing either with 8 g/800 g of orotic acid (mixed as an aqueous solution) or with 18% (w/w) fish oil (Max EPA, containing 18% C20:5 and 12% C22:6 Seven Seas Ltd., Kingston-upon-Hull, UK). The modified diets were reformed into pellets and then dried with the appropriate antioxidants as described (16Baker P.W. Gibbons G.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 719-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hebbachi A.M. Seelaender M.C. Baker B.W. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For fructose administration, 10% (w/v) fructose was present in the drinking water throughout (18Wiggins D. Hems R. Gibbons G.F. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 841-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The diurnal regulation of AADA transcription was investigated in male PPARα knockout mice bred onto a SV/129 genetic background and using wild type SV/129 mice as a control. Mice were maintained in temperature-controlled rooms (22–24 °C) on a 12 h-light/12-h dark cycle. Food (low-fat pellets as above) was available ad libitum. Mice were used between the ages of 14 and 20 weeks as described (19Patel D.D. Knight B.L. Wiggins D. Humphreys S.M. Gibbons G.F. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 328-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Food consumption for both genotypes was similar between the groups and in each case was ∼4-fold higher in the dark than the light phase (p < 0.001 in each case). The livers were removed, frozen, ground to a powder under liquid N2, and then used to prepare total RNA by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate method (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). In other experiments, control and PPARα knockout mice were fed ad libitum for 14 days on a diet reconstituted with Wy-14,643 (0.1%, Chemsin Laboratories, Lenexa, KS) (21Rose M.L. Germolec D. Arteel G.E. Schoonhoven R. Thurman R.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Animals were killed either at the midpoint of the dark (D6) or light (L6) phases. Adipocytes were obtained from rat epidydimal fat pads essentially as described (22Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by digesting finely chopped pieces in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (containing 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml collagenase (type II, 210 units/mg, Worthington), and 5 mm glucose) with vigorous shaking and aeration (O2/CO2 (95:5)) at 37 °C. Following filtration through nylon gauze, the cell mass was centrifuged for 20 s at low speed, and the floating adipocyte layer was aspirated and rewashed in fresh buffer plus albumin and glucose. Total RNA was prepared by the RNeasy protocol (Qiagen) from ∼4 ml of packed adipocytes. Intestinal cells enriched in enterocytes were obtained by immersing and flushing rat small intestine in ice-cold Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution, everting the intestine over a glass rod, and scraping the mucosal cells into plastic tubes precooled with liquid N2.Total RNA was prepared by the Qiagen protocol from ∼30 mg of tissue. Samples of whole intestine tissue were also flash-frozen in liquid N2 and ground to a fine powder prior to isolation of total RNA. J774 cultured mouse macrophages were a kind gift from Dr. Lisa O'Rourke (Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College London). Total RNA was prepared by the Qiagen protocol from ∼5 × 107 cells. AADA mRNA was assayed by reverse transcription (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1987Google Scholar) followed by real-time PCR using an ABI Prism sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) essentially as described by the manufacturer. PCR oligonucleotides and dually modified probe oligonucleotides containing TAMRA (N′N′N′N′-tetramethyl-6-rhodamine) and either FAM (carboxyfluorescein) or VICTMwere manufactured by PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and are shown in Table I.Table IOligonucleotides used for RNA quantitation by RT-PCRMouse AADAForward5′-GATTTGGCTTCATTTGGTGAACT-3′Reverse5′-TGGGTGGGACTTGAAAACT-3′Probe5′-FAM-CTGTATCGTTTCCATGAAATGACTGATTCCCA-TAMRA-3′Rat AADAForward5′-GAAATACACTTCTAAAACTTGGAGGAGAT-3′Reverse5′-ACTGTACCGTGTCCATGAAATGAT-3′Probe5′-FAM-GAGTCCCAAAAGTTCACCAAAAGAAGCCA-TAMRA-3′Mouse/rat β-actinForward5′-GAGCTATGAGCTGCCTGACG-3′Reverse5′-AGTTTCATGGATGCCACAGGA-3′Probe5′-VIC-CATCACTATTGGCAACGAGCGGTTCC-TAMRA-3′Mouse acyl-CoA oxidaseForward5′-GCTCTGGCTCGCTTCTCTTG-3′Reverse5′-TGCACCATTGCCATTCGATA-3′Probe5′-FAM-TTTCAGACTGGCGCCTCACAGCACT-TAMRA-3′ Open table in a new tab AADA mRNA assays were carried out in 30 µl of TaqMan Universal PCR master mix containing 300 nm of each primer and 200 nm probe under the standard conditions recommended by the manufacturers. Primers (67 nm) and probe (85 nm) for β-actin were included in each sample to act as an internal standard to correct for assay variation. Amplifications of 18-S rRNA were carried out with the primers supplied as a standard kit by Applied Biosystems in triplicate reactions. All values were related to a curve generated by a standard liver preparation. Nuclei were prepared as described previously (23Schibler U. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Pittet A.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) from diabetic, orotic-acid treated, and diabetic rats treated with insulin (as above). Nuclear run-on was performed essentially as described (24Manjeshwar S. Rao P.M. Rajalakshmi S. Sarma D.S. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 24: 188-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Greenberg M.E. Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 4.10.1-4.10.11Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled RNA was hybridized to AADA or GAPDH cDNA that had been spotted onto Hybond N membranes. After extensive washing the spots were excised and the radioactivity assayed by scintillation counting. Nucleotide and peptide alignments and searches were carried out using the programs Multalin (26Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4345) Google Scholar), GCG (27Womble D.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 3-22PubMed Google Scholar),and BLAST (28Tatusova T.A. Madden T.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 247-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows alignments of the predicted peptide sequences of human (10Probst M.R. Beer M. Beer D. Jeno P. Meyer U.A. Gasser R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat, and mouse arylacetamide deacetylase. The rat cDNA sequence was determined by comparison of 21 independent cDNA clones derived from a liver cDNA library. The mouse peptide sequence was deduced from the sequences of the relevant EST clones (AI182380 and AI574013) and was subsequently confirmed by determining exonic sequences from the mouse gene (see below). The predicted rat and mouse sequences are each one amino acid residue shorter than the human sequence within the amino-terminal signal anchor domain. As previously described (10Probst M.R. Beer M. Beer D. Jeno P. Meyer U.A. Gasser R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), homology is apparent with HSL particularly over a region spanning an upstream HGGG box characteristic of lipases and the active site motif, GXSXG. In addition, a further segment of homology between AADA and HSL includes an aspartic acid and histidine residue known to comprise the catalytic triad of HSL (29Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Osterlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows alignments of the 3′ region of the AADA cDNAs. The 3′UTR of the available mouse EST clones is shorter than the human 3′ region because of the presence of a polyadenylation signal 47 nucleotides from the termination codon. The rat 3′UTR of three independent rat clones was similar in length to the human 3′UTR. Although a cryptic polyadenylation signal was present in the rat sequence at a similar point to the polyadenylation signal in the mouse (underlined in Fig. 2 A), the 3′UTR extended instead to a downstream polyadenylation signal. Preferential use of the second polyadenylation signal in the rat is apparent on Northern blots of mouse and rat liver RNA (Fig. 2 B) in which the rat transcript appears ∼300 bp longer. Sequencing of the cDNA clones did not allow us to define the extent of the 5′UTR in the rat nor were the available mouse EST clones fully informative. It was anticipated that the identification of potential promoter elements in the rat and mouse genomic sequences would clarify the situation. The genomic sequencing strategy (Fig. 3) revealed that the rodent AADA gene comprises five exons with intron-exon boundaries that were clearly identifiable by consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences (TableII). The active site motif is encoded in exon 4. There was extensive homology between the rat and mouse sequences, which extended across both introns and exons (not shown). Additionally, a 6.4-kb retroposon (LINE1 element) had integrated into intron 2 of the mouse gene, whereas a partial retroposon sequence (1.1 kb) was present in intron 4 of the rat gene.Table IIOrganization of the AADA genespeciesExonLength3′ Splice site5′ Splice siteIntron lengthRat1160NACTTGGAGGAGATTTGgtaagttttgatttt3,855Mouse1154NAATAGGAACAGATTTGgtaagtttttgattt3,834Rat2223ttcttctccacatagGCTTCTTTTGGTGAAGTCTGGGGAGTGCTGgtatgtcccattggg1,210Mouse2223attctgtctactcagGCTTCATTTGGTGAAGTTTGGGGAGTGCTGgtatgtcacagtggc7,6382-a6,375 andRat370ttttcttgatttcagCTTACTTCATGTATGTGTTGTGTCAACTGAgtaagaccatggttt1,014Mouse370ttttcttgatttcagCTCACTTCTCCTATGTGTTGTGTCAACTGAgtaagaccacggttt1,014Rat4172ttattcctcacacagCTATGGCTTAGCCCCGCTGTGACACAACAGgtaggcttcacagtc3,4942-b1,123 bp of retroposon sequence.

Many but not all eukaryotic genes have a TATA box ∼25 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start (30Lewin B. Genes. VII. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2000: 617-648Google Scholar). A search of the TRANSFAC data base with the mouse and rat genomic sequences using the Matinspector program (31Heinemeyer T. Chen X. Karas H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Liebich I. Meinhardt T. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) led to the detection of a strongly predicted TATA box (32Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) (TATAAACAGAACA) ∼500 nucleotides upstream of the translational start codon (Fig. 4). No TATA boxes were identified closer to the initiation codon. An alternative initiator sequence (Inr) is present in certain TATA-less genes, which causes initiation at an adenine nucleotide (A+1) through the sequence Pyd-Pyd-(A+1)-N-(T/A)-Pyd-Pyd (33Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A single potential Inr sequence was detected at position −79 in the rat (shown in bold, Fig. 4), which was not present in the mouse or human. Certain genes, lacking either TATA boxes or Inr sites, have multiple transcriptional start sites, causing heterogeneous 5′-ends to be present on the transcripts (33Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W1514864149,"The CYBB and NCF2 genes encode the phagocyte respiratory burst oxidase proteins, gp91PHOX and p67PHOX. Previously, we identified homologous CYBB and NCF2 cis elements that are necessary for lineage-specific transcription during late myeloid differentiation. We determined that these homologous cis elements are activated by PU.1, IRF1, interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP), and the CREB-binding protein (CBP). Since expression of PU.1 and ICSBP is lineage-restricted, our investigations identified a mechanism of lineage-specific CYBB and NCF2transcription. Since PU.1, IRF1, ICSBP, and CBP are expressed in undifferentiated myeloid cells, our investigations did not determine the mechanism of differentiation stage-specific CYBB andNCF2 transcription. In the current investigations, we determine that SHP1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase (SHP1-PTP) inhibits gp91PHOX and p67PHOX expression, in undifferentiated myeloid cell lines, by decreasing interaction of PU.1, IRF1, ICSBP, and CBP with the CYBB and NCF2genes. We also determine that IRF1 and ICSBP are tyrosine-phosphorylated during interferon γ differentiation of myeloid cell lines, and we identify IRF1 and ICSBP tyrosine residues that are necessary for CYBB and NCF2transcription. Therefore, these investigations identify a novel mechanism by which SHP1-PTP antagonizes myeloid differentiation and determine that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRF1 and ICSPB mediates stage-specific transcriptional activation in differentiating myeloid cells."

Here we introduce a general NMR-based method to quantify the stoichiometry of binding of hydrophobic cofactors to membrane proteins to resolve a central controversy about the number of ubiquinone binding sites in mitochondrial cytochromebc1 complex. The cytochromebc1 complex plays a crucial role in oxidative phosphorylation, a universal process that converts most of the energy provided by foodstuffs into the general energy source adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP). Within this process, the cytochromebc1 complex connects hydrophobic ubiquinol and water-soluble cytochrome c, transferring electrons between these two freely diffusible intermediates and thereby linking the exergonic reaction to a vectorial proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Molecular structures of the cytochromebc1 complex from different sources (1Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H.

The reaction most critical for energy conservation is an obligatory bifurcation of the electron path linked to the two-electron oxidation of ubiquinol (Fig.1). Molecular structures indicate that this unique reaction occurs in a rather spacious (Qo or QP)1 pocket formed mostly by transmembrane cytochrome b and the tip of the mobile hydrophilic domain of the “Rieske” iron-sulfur protein (1Zhang Z.

Chem. 1991; 266: 19958-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), methoxyacrylate-type inhibitors like myxothiazol and the chromone-type inhibitor stigmatellin were found to bind with very high affinity to different but overlapping sites within this pocket (9Kim H. Xia D., Yu, C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In crystal structures, bound ubiquinone could only be seen in the ubiquinone reduction (Qi or QN) center facing the opposite side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (2Xia D., Yu, C.-A. Kim H.

Presumably because of very weak binding of the substrate, no corresponding electron density could be identified in the ubiquinol oxidation pocket. It is still a controversial issue whether ubiquinol oxidation in the cytochrome bc1 complex involves just a single quinone that may have to move to transfer the second electron (6Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 10Crofts A.R. Guergova-Kuras M. Kuras R. Ugulava N.B. Li J. Hong S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or whether two quinone molecules occupy this binding pocket simultaneously (11Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15979-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and facilitate bifurcated electron flow (12Brandt U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Double occupancy of the ubiquinol oxidation pocket was proposed by Ding et al. (11Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15979-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) based on specific line shape changes in the EPR spectrum of the reduced Rieske iron-sulfur cluster of bacterial cytochrome bc1complex. However, Crofts et al. (10Crofts A.R. Guergova-Kuras M. Kuras R. Ugulava N.B. Li J. Hong S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) proposed that the different line shapes may also reflect different states of the complex or different positions of the ubiquinone headgroup. Resolving this issue will be a prerequisite to understand the chemistry of this unique reaction. [13C]Ubiquinone was synthesized anaerobically according to the method described for the synthesis of ethoxyubiquinone derivatives (13He D.-Y. Gu L.Q., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a Thunberg tube with a two-arm stopper. 1.5 ml of hexane solution containing 100 μl of [13C]methanol and 1 mg of sodium methoxide was placed in the bottom of the tube. 10 mg of Q0C10(2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-n-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone) in 0.5 ml of hexane was placed in one arm of the stopper. 20 μl of 10n acetic acid was placed in the other arm of the stopper. The assembly was then subjected three times to evacuation and argon flushing. The Q0C10 solution was then carefully tipped into [13C]methanol/methoxide solution. This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h in the dark with constant shaking. At the end of incubation the mixture was acidified by tipping in the acidic acid. The acidified mixture was concentrated under vacuum, redissolved in 0.3 ml of hexane, and subjected to thin-layer chromatography (TLC) separation. The TLC plate was developed with a mixture of hexane:ether (3.5:1.0). The yield of the synthesis was 75%. The pattern of 13C labeling was analyzed by mass spectroscopy. 22.6% of the ubiquinone molecules were found to carry two, 57.9% one, and 19.5% no 13C-methoxy group, corresponding to an average of 1.0 13C-atom per molecule. Cytochrome bc1 complex proteoliposomes were prepared by the cholate dialysis method essentially as described in Ref. 15Brandt U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar. 1 g of a mixture of 75% phosphatidylcholine (99% Sigma Type III-E), 20% phosphatidylethanolamine (98% Sigma Type IV-S), and 5% cardiolipin (>80% bovine heart) was dissolved in 26 ml of 3% sodium cholate, 1% octyl glucoside, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaN3, 20 mm K+/Mops, pH 7.2, by sonication. 40–50 ml of a 20 μm solution of cytochrome bc1 complex in 10% glycerol was added to the dissolved lipids. After stirring for 15 min on ice, the mixture was placed into a dialysis tube and dialyzed overnight against a 100-fold volume of 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaN3, 20 mm K+/Mops, pH 7.2. The dialysis buffer was changed once after 4 h. The proteoliposomes were sedimented by centrifugation for 5–6 h at 50,000 × g av; the red pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of dialysis buffer made with D2O, and the liposomes were sedimented again by overnight centrifugation at 50,000 × g av. The concentration of cytochrome bc1 complex was determined spectroscopically using ε562–575 = 28.5 cm−1 mm−1 for the sum of two hemeb groups per monomer of cytochromebc1 complex. As a novel approach to directly measure the binding of an extremely hydrophobic, but weakly bound ligand to a membrane protein complex, we have used high resolution magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) spectroscopy of the liquid heterogeneous system composed of water, liposomes containing cytochrome bc1 complex, and ubiquinone to determine the binding stoichiometry of [13C]6-n-decylubiquinone to membrane-bound cytochrome bc1 complex. We used a mixture of unlabeled and labeled 6-n-decylubiquinone ([13C]Q0C10, Fig.2) carrying one 13C-methoxy group at C-2 or C-3 or two 13C-methoxy groups at C-2 and C-3 of the quinone ring (13He D.-Y. Gu L.Q., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since the ubiquinone diffused freely in the phospholipid bilayer that was not immobilized, e.g. by freezing or orientation between glass plates as used in solid state NMR investigations, the labeled methyl groups not only had identical1H and 13C chemical shifts but also gave rise to sharp resonances (proton line width of 7 Hz) under HR-MAS conditions (Fig. 2). Solid state MAS on frozen liposomes was not chosen for this investigation, since double labeled ubiquinone would have been necessary for the suppression of the protein background, and the experiments would have suffered from 10 times lower sensitivity. In the HR-MAS measurements, the enzyme-bound ubiquinones did not contribute to the NMR signal, because immobilization by the large integral membrane protein complex caused the signal to broaden beyond detection, since cytochrome bc1-bound ubiquinones assume the correlation time of the membrane protein in the liposome, which is of the order of microseconds. Thus, by displacing the cytochrome bc1 complex-bound ubiquinones with specific inhibitors, the number of bound ubiquinones can be inferred from the increase of the NMR signal. Cytochrome bc1 complex isolated from bovine heart mitochondria (14Schägger H. Link T.A. Engel W.D. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) was reconstituted into unilamellar proteoliposomes at a molar ratio of 3000–4000 lipids per cytochromebc1 complex dimer (15Brandt U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Signals were calibrated using [13C]acetate as an internal standard (cf. Fig. 2) that remains in the water phase and neither interacts with the lipid membrane nor with the cytochromebc1 complex. Calculated concentrations took into account corrections for differences in the NMRT 1 relaxation times of the nuclei giving rise to the signals from ubiquinone and acetate (see Fig. 2). Controls using liposomes without protein (not shown) confirmed that it was possible to calculate the concentration of the mobile, unbound species from the integral of the [13C]Q0C10 signal in a two-dimensional HR-MAS heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) experiment (16Stöver H.D.H.

To assess unspecific binding, we measured immobilization of ubiquinone by reconstituted bovine heart cytochromec oxidase (23Brandt U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a membrane-bound complex of similar size but not containing a ubiquinone binding site. Unspecific binding was significant in the millimolar range and increased with the concentration of ubiquinone added to the sample. However, the extent of unspecific binding was very similar for cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome bc1 complex (with the specific sites blocked, see below), suggesting that it was largely due to weak association of ubiquinone molecules with the membrane domain of the complexes. To determine the number of specific ubiquinone binding sites of cytochrome bc1 complex, we used high affinity inhibitors (24von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) with precisely known binding sites determined by x-ray crystallography (9Kim H. Xia D., Yu, C.A. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) as well defined competitors. Counting the number of ubiquinone molecules per cytochrome bc1 complex displaced by these highly specific inhibitors in the presence of saturating concentrations of ubiquinone avoided interference by nonspecific immobilization of ubiquinone by the cytochromebc1 complex. Unspecific binding was always observed at the high concentrations of ubiquinone necessary to saturate the rather weak ubiquinone binding sites of the cytochrome bc1 complex under conditions of the NMR experiment and made direct quantitative binding studies impossible (not shown). For the ubiquinone reduction site, x-ray structures show that a single ubiquinone shares a common binding pocket with the inhibitor antimycin (2Xia D., Yu, C.-A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 4Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Michel H. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Competition was used to validate our approach. We added [13C]Q0C10(1.2–3.6 mm) to cytochrome bc1complex (0.15–0.29 mm) in proteoliposomes; antimycin (0.3–1.5 mm) displaced 1.04 ± 0.15 mol of ubiquinone from each mole of cytochrome bc1 complex as expected from the molecular structure (Fig.3). It should be stressed that this ratio was calculated using independently determined concentrations in the sample for the cytochrome bc1 complex via UV-visible spectroscopy and for ubiquinone via referencing of the NMR integral to the NMR integral of acetate. Stigmatellin, a chromone-type inhibitor of the ubiquinol oxidation site, was found to displace 1.87 ± 0.07 mol of ubiquinone/mol of cytochromebc 1 complex. If both antimycin and stigmatellin where added to the cytochrome bc1 complex proteoliposomes, 2.94 ± 0.11 mol/mol were released. Stigmatellin is known to bind with much higher affinity to the ubiquinol oxidation pocket when the Rieske iron-sulfur protein is reduced (24von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, reducing this redox center by sodium ascorbate prior to the competition experiment had no effect on the displacement stoichiometries. In the presence of the E-β-methoxyacrylate inhibitor myxothiazol, a somewhat higher displacement ratio of 2.28 ± 0.16 mol/mol was measured, but antimycin plus myxothiazol again displaced only 3.07 ± 0.20 mol/mol. A possible explanation for the slight difference between the stoichiometries with stigmatellin and myxothiazol alone is that in contrast to stigmatellin, myxothiazol may have a weak affinity for the ubiquinone reduction site and could therefore partially displace ubiquinone in competition with antimycin. This seems feasible as other E-β-methoxyacrylate inhibitors have been shown to be inhibitors of the plastoquinone reduction site of plastidial cytochrome b6f complex (25Rich P.R. Madgwick S.A. Brown M.S. von Jagow G. Brandt U. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 34: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). None of the found stoichiometries was affected upon variation of the ubiquinone concentrations from 1.6 up to 3.6 mm or upon variation of the inhibitor concentrations from 0.33 up to 1.5 mm (see Fig. 3 for details). When less than 1.6 mm ubiquinone was present, lower stoichiometries were observed for stigmatellin and myxothiazol, but not for antimycin (not shown), indicating incomplete saturation of the ubiquinol oxidation (Qo or QP) site and somewhat tighter binding of ubiquinone to its reduction (Qi or QN) center. This is in agreement with ubquinone occupancy in molecular structures (2Xia D., Yu, C.-A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and seems characteristic for mitochondrial cytochromebc1 complex. It should be noted however that in the bacterial enzyme QoS (cf. Fig. 1) was reported to have the highest affinity (11Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15979-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our results clearly indicate that a total of three ubiquinones bind specifically to mitochondrial cytochrome bc1complex: one binds at the ubiquinone reduction center and is displaced by antimycin, and two bind at the ubiquinol oxidation center and are displaced by stigmatellin and myxothiazol. To test whether this finding is in accordance with structural data obtained by x-ray crystallography, we modeled two ubiquinone molecules carrying a long isoprenoid side chain that for technical reasons could not be used in the experiments into the ubiquinol oxidation pocket of the cytochromebc1 complex (Fig.4). Two ubiquinone molecules could be accommodated by changes of the order of 1.5 Å in the atomic positions of a few neighboring amino acid residues. Movements on this scale are only slightly larger than those that have been observed experimentally for the removal of ubiquinone from the reaction center fromRhodopseudomonas viridis (26Lancaster C.R.D. Michel H. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1339-1359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows one set of possible conformations of the two quinones in the ubiquinol oxidation site; other conformations are possible. Our equilibrium binding approach, using high concentrations of ubiquinone and cytochrome bc1 complex, inherently provides no information on the functional meaning of the binding of two ubiquinone molecules at the ubiquinol oxidation center. However, our finding is in perfect agreement with the “double occupancy Qo site model” by Ding et al. (11Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15979-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,27Ding H. Robertson D.E. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3144-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), suggesting a functional role for two ubiquinones. In this complementary study, specific line shape changes in the EPR spectrum of the reduced Rieske iron-sulfur cluster were interpreted as reflecting the presence of two functionally interacting ubiquinone species in the ubiquinol oxidation pocket of bacterial cytochromebc1 complex. However, the indirect way in which ubiquinone binding was monitored in this approach allowed alternative interpretations of the data. Crofts and colleagues (10Crofts A.R. Guergova-Kuras M. Kuras R. Ugulava N.B. Li J. Hong S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 456-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) proposed that the different line shapes may also reflect different states of the complex or different positions of the ubiquinone headgroup. However, our compelling result that two ubiquinone molecules bind to the ubiquinol oxidation pocket and are specifically displaced by inhibitors of this site corroborates the interpretation of Ding and colleagues. Together, both approaches provide strong support for the functional implications that have been based on the “double occupancy model” (11Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15979-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In particular, charge transfer between ubiquinone and ubiquinol molecules, as implemented in the “proton-gated charge-transfer” mechanism (28Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), appears as a chemically attractive paradigm for the role of a ubiquinone pair in bifurcated electron flow at the ubiquinol oxidation center of the cytochromebc1 complex. The HR-MAS approach presented may be widely employed to study binding of hydrophobic cofactors to membrane proteins. It should be useful for the analysis of ubiquinone binding to other respiratory chain complexes such as complex I and ubiquinol oxidase, for which specific inhibitors are available but the binding stoichiometries are uncertain. The method may develop into a general procedure for analyzing the binding of hydrophobic ligands to membrane bound proteins. If tighter binding reduces the problem of unspecific binding, quantitative binding studies with no need to use inhibitors will also be possible. We thank Franz Streb for skilful technical assistance. All measurements were done at the Large Scale Facility for Biomolecular NMR, Frankfurt and Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany."

It is composed of an N-terminal (NT) domain (residues 1–191) that is responsible for binding to members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family and a C-terminal (CT) domain (residues 216–299) that anchors the protein to lipoprotein particles by virtue of its high-affinity lipid binding characteristics. Isoform-specific differences in the NT domain that modulate the lipoprotein binding preference elicited by the CT domain suggest the existence and importance of domain interactions in this protein. Employing steady state fluorescence quenching and resonance energy transfer techniques, spatial proximity relationships between the N- and C-terminal domains were investigated in recombinant human apoE3. ApoE3 containing a single Trp at position 264 and anN-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-napthyl) ethylenediamine (AEDANS) moiety covalently attached to the lone Cys residue at position 112 was used (AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected]). Fluorescence quenching studies revealed a solvent-exposed location for Trp-264. In the lipid-free state, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was noted between Trp-264 and AEDANS, with a calculated distance of 27 Å between the two fluorophores. Control experiments established that FRET observed in this system is intramolecular. FRET was abolished upon proteolysis in the linker region connecting the NT and CT domains. Lowering the solution pH to 4 induced an increase in the efficiency of intramolecular energy transfer, with the two domains reorienting about 5 Å closer to one another. Interdomain FRET was retained in the presence of 0.6–1.0 m guanidine hydrochloride but was lost at higher concentrations, a manifestation of unfolding of the domains and increased distance between the donor-acceptor pair. Interaction of AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] with lipid induced a loss of FRET, attributed to spatial repositioning of the domains by >80 Å. The data provide biophysical evidence that, in addition to reported conformational changes in the four-helix bundle configuration induced by lipid association, lipid binding of apoE is accompanied by reorientation of the tertiary disposition of the NT and CT domains.

The data provide biophysical evidence that, in addition to reported conformational changes in the four-helix bundle configuration induced by lipid association, lipid binding of apoE is accompanied by reorientation of the tertiary disposition of the NT and CT domains. apolipoprotein E N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-napthyl) ethylenediamine C-terminal dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine fluorescence resonance energy transfer guanidine hydrochloride lysophosphatidylcholine N-terminal high performance liquid chromatography Apolipoprotein E (apoE),1 a resident of several classes of plasma lipoprotein, plays a key role in regulating plasma cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis (1Weisgraber K.H.

Transgenic mice overexpressing apoE manifest decreased cholesterol levels on chow diet and a marked resistance to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia (4Shimano H. Yamada N. Katsuki M. Yamamoto K.

These studies emphasize its principal role in lipoprotein metabolism, while other studies suggest an emerging role for apoE in nerve regeneration and Alzheimer's disease (2Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). Studies of apoE structure-function relationship identified two independently folded domains in the protein (6Wetterau J.R.

The 34-kDa, 299-residue protein is composed of a 22-kDa N-terminal (NT) domain (residues 1–191) linked to a 10-kDa C-terminal (CT) domain (residues 216–299) via a protease-sensitive loop localized between residues 191 and 216 (see Fig. 1). The NT domain houses the LDL receptor binding region and bears weak lipid binding capability (1Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while the CT domain accommodates high affinity lipid binding sites (6Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

X-ray crystal analysis of the isolated NT domain of apoE (9Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 817-822PubMed Google Scholar) reveals four amphipathic α-helices that sequester their hydrophobic faces to form a helix-bundle in the lipid-free state. Our knowledge of the molecular architecture and structural hierarchy of the CT domain of apoE is limited, though selected peptide segments have been crystallized (10Forstner M. Peters-Libeu C. Contreras-Forrest E. Newhouse Y. Knapp M. Rupp B. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Secondary structure algorithms identify a high degree of α-helicity in the CT domain, with three segments bearing potential amphipathic α-helical propensities (11Segrest J.-P. Jones M.K. DeLoof H.

Sedimentation equilibrium studies indicate that the CT domain is responsible for self-association of apoE (7Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C-S.C. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol.

Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15745-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, this study also demonstrated that apoE3-(1–244) displayed no binding to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), thereby designating this portion of the CT domain as an important lipoprotein binding site in apoE. The NT and CT domains have been shown to be capable of mediating their roles in isolation. In the lipid-bound state, the isolated NT domain retains receptor-binding activity (15Innerarity T.L. Friedlander E.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the CT fragment has been shown to possess lipid-binding capability (16Sparrow J.T. Sparrow D.A. Fernando G.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, isoform-specific variations in the NT domain have profound effects on the lipoprotein binding preference of apoE, manifested by the CT domain. The isoforms are distinguished by amino acids at positions 112 and 158: apoE2 and E4 contain Cys and Arg at these positions, respectively, while apoE3, the most prevalent isoform, contains a Cys at 112 and Arg at 158 (1Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE4 elicits a preference for binding to VLDL (18Dong L.M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A.

Prot. Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the intact protein the structural organization of the two domains with respect to each other is not known. The report of a salt bridge (between Arg-61 in the NT domain and Glu-255 in the CT domain) directing the binding preference of apoE4 for VLDL (18Dong L.M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19053-19057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) has invoked the concept of domain interactions. This concept is further emphasized in the isoform-specific variability demonstrated in the interaction between apoE and amyloid beta peptide, mediated by the CT domain (20Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.-M. Salsesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8098-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Morrow et al. (21Morrow J.A. Segall M.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Knapp M. Rupp B. Weisgraber K.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11657-11666Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) observed that the NT domain determines the differences in stability among the apoE isoforms. Finally, the observation that lipoprotein-bound apoE displays variable receptor binding ability (22Windler E. Chao Y. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5475-5480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has led to the proposal that the CT domain anchors the protein to the lipid surface, while the NT domain undergoes reversible conformational changes that modulate receptor binding activity (23Narayanswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As lipid binding modulates the functional capability of apoE, it is important to understand the structural disposition of apoE domains in solution and alterations that may occur upon lipid binding. Recently, it was demonstrated that lipid binding induces gross structural changes in isolated apoE3 NT fragment involving reorganization of the helices following opening of the helix bundle (24Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Lu B. Morrow J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20775-20781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and steady state fluorescence techniques to probe spatial relationships between the NT and CT domains in apoE3 in aqueous and lipid-bound environments. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla). ApoE3, containing a single reactive cysteine residue at position 112 in the NT domain was used throughout the studies. In one of the variants, designated apoE3/[email protected], all but one (Trp-264) of the seven Trp residues in wild-type apoE3 were mutated to Phe, yielding a protein with a single Trp in the CT domain. Another variant, termed apoE3/Trp-null, wherein all the seven Trps were mutated to Phe, was also constructed. DNA sequencing was carried out to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and the lack of undesired mutations. Recombinant human apoE3 variants were expressed in E. coli using the IMPACT™-CN system (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The apoE3 coding sequence is harbored in the expression vector pTYB2, immediately upstream of a protein-splicing element with inducible self-cleavage activity. Following expression, intact apoE3 was recovered by affinity chromatography followed by further purification by reversed-phase HPLC as described previously (26Narayanaswami V. Wang J. Kay C.M. Scraba D.G. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26855-26862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), yielding a preparation of ≥98% purity. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the mutations introduced into apoE3 did not affect the overall secondary structural characteristics of the protein. Sedimentation ultracentrifugation experiments of apoE3/[email protected] and apoE3/Trp null in aqueous buffer demonstrated that the proteins exist as tetramers and higher state oligomers as reported by others (7Aggerbeck L.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36758-36765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Covalent labeling of apoE3 byN-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine (AEDANS) (Sigma) was carried out as described previously (24Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The labeling was stoichiometric, as determined from absorption spectroscopy using the following molar extinction coefficients: 6500 m−1 cm−1 at 340 nm for AEDANS, 11,040 m−1 cm−1 for apoE3/[email protected] and 5380 m−1cm −1 for apoE3/Trp-null at 279 nm. Fluorescence analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer using 5-nm slit width for both excitation and emission monochromators. Emission spectra were recorded using an excitation wavelength of 292 nm to selectively excite tryptophan. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements were carried out in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 at room temperature. A blank spectrum of buffer alone was subtracted from all spectra. The optical density of the samples was maintained below 0.1 to avoid inner filter effects. To examine the effect of aqueous quenchers, apoE3/[email protected] or AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] were treated with increasing concentrations of potassium iodide (KI) or acrylamide. KI solutions contained 1 mm sodium thiosulfate to suppress free iodine formation. Fluorescence intensities were measured at 348 nm for Trp and 471 nm for AEDANS emission. The effective quenching constants were determined based on the Stern-Volmer equation, Fo/F = 1 + KSV [Q], where Fo and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively, and [Q] is the molar concentration of the quencher. The slope of the plot of Fo/F versus [Q] is the effective Stern-Volmer quenching constant, KSV (27Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1999: 237-265Crossref Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching of free tryptophan was measured with both KI and acrylamide. For comparison with tryptophans in a known location, apoE3(1–183)[email protected], wherein all the 4 naturally occurring Trp residues were replaced by Phe and Tyr-118 was mutated to Trp, was used. The protein was purified as described previously (28Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The efficiency E, of energy transfer in AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] was calculated based on alterations in donor fluorescence emission (29Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar), and is given by Equation 1,E=1−QDAQDEquation 1 where, QD and QDAare the quantum yields of the donor in the absence (apoE3/[email protected]) and presence of acceptor (AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected]), respectively. Quantum yields were calculated based on a value of 0.2 for free tryptophan in aqueous neutral solutions (30Teale F.W.J. Weber G. Biochem. J. 1957; 65: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The distance of separationR, between the energy donor and acceptor is calculated as in Equation 2,R=Ro(1E−1)16Equation 2 where R0, the Förster radius (31Förster T. Sinanoglu O. Modern Quantum Chemistry. Academic Press, New York1966: 93-137Google Scholar), is the distance at which the transfer efficiency is 50%.R0 is derived from Equation 3,RO=9.765×103(k2JQDn−4)16Equation 3 where k2 is the orientation factor of the donor and acceptor (a value of two-thirds for k2was used (32Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) based on random rotation of the fluorophores),n is the refractive index of the medium, taken to be 1.4 (33Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 303-339Crossref Google Scholar), and J is the spectral overlap integral, calculated as described earlier (24Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). FRET was monitored from fluorescence emission spectra recorded with excitation set at 292 nm. For all AEDANS-containing samples, fluorescence emission contribution arising from direct excitation of AEDANS at 292 nm was subtracted. To study the possibility of intermolecular FRET, different proportions of apoE3/[email protected] and AEDANS-apoE3/Trp-null or AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] and apoE3/Trp-null were incubated at 4 °C overnight, and fluorescence emission spectra of the samples were recorded following excitation at 292 nm. Mild proteolysis of AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] was carried out as described by Wetterau et al. (6Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was incubated with sequence grade modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI; specific activity >5000 units/mg) at a 1:2000 enzyme/substrate ratio (w/w) in 0.1 mammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8 at room temperature for 20 min. In studies examining the effect of pH on FRET, fluorescence measurements were carried out on apoE3/[email protected], AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] and free AEDANS in the following buffers: 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8; 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7; 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.2, 5.1 or 4 (appropriate corrections were made for fluorescence emission resulting from direct excitation of AEDANS at 292 nm at the corresponding pH). To study the effect of GdnHCl on FRET, apoE3/[email protected], AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] or free AEDANS were incubated with 0, 0.025, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 2.7, and 4.5 m GdnHCl in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 16 h at room temperature before analysis. The lipid bound state of apoE3, apoE3/[email protected], or AEDANS-labeled protein was examined in two different environments: micellar state or phospholipid bilayer disc complexes. For micellar state, FRET was evaluated in the presence of 0.4% lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) or 1% SDS, and Ro was derived from apoE3/[email protected] present in the respective environment. For DMPC bilayer disc complexes, FRET measurements were carried out with the following different proteins or mixtures: apoE3/[email protected], AEDANS-labeled apoE3/[email protected], apoE3/[email protected] and AEDANS-apoE3/Trp-null (1:1 w/w), apoE3/[email protected] and apoE3/Trp-null (1:8 w/w) and AEDANS-labeled apoE3/[email protected] and apoE3/Trp-null (1:8 w/w). Disc complexes were formed by incubation of protein with unilamellar DMPC vesicles (2.5:1 w/w lipid/protein ratio) at 24 °C for 16 h. DMPC vesicles were obtained by bath sonication. The discoidal complexes were separated from unbound protein and vesicles by density gradient ultracentrifugation as mentioned earlier (26Narayanaswami V. Wang J. Kay C.M. Scraba D.G. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26855-26862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Human apoE3 possesses 7 Trp residues, located at positions 20, 26, 34, and 39 in the NT domain, 264 and 276 in the CT domain, and position 210 in the loop linking the NT and CT domains. Six of these were mutated to Phe leaving a single Trp at position 264 (apoE3/[email protected]) as a probe in the CT domain. In silico predictions localize Trp-264 at the polar/non-polar interface of a putative amphipathic helical segment spanning residues 225–266 (11Segrest J.-P. Jones M.K. DeLoof H. Brouillette C.G Venkatachalapathi M. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An initial fluorescence characterization of Trp-264 was carried out to assess its microenvironment in terms of defining its location in the tetrameric organization of apoE3 in an aqueous milieu. Excitation of apoE3/[email protected] at 292 nm yielded a spectrum with maximum emission (λmax) at 348 nm, suggesting a predominantly exposed location of Trp-264. Both acrylamide and KI efficiently quenched Trp-264 fluorescence emission, yielding Stern-Volmer quenching constants, KSV of 4.89 ± 0.13m−1 and 7.54 ± 0.06m−1, respectively (TableI). In comparison, free Trp was fully accessible to the quenchers and displayed a λmax of 355 nm, consistent with values reported by others (34Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Further, an apoE variant, apoE3-(1–183)/[email protected], wherein the lone tryptophan is located in a reported helical segment was examined. The λmax was relatively blue-shifted (337 nm), and KSV values for acrylamide and KI quenching for this protein were low, indicating a buried location of Trp-118. Crystal structure analysis (9Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 817-822PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that residue 118 is located in the protein interior, thereby validating conclusions derived from fluorescence quenching studies. Taken together, the fluorescence data indicate that Trp-264 favors an interfacial or predominantly exposed location in the CT domain.Table IFluorescence emission maxima and Stern-Volmer quenching constants of apoE variantsλmax1-aExcitation: 292 nm.KSVAcrylamideKInmm−1apoE/[email protected]3484.89 ± 0.131-bValues are average ± S.D. from three independent experiments.7.54 ± 0.06Free tryptophan35518.09 ± 0.618.58 ± 0.45apoE3-(1–183)/[email protected]3372.58 ± 0.110.89 ± 0.0041-a Excitation: 292 nm.1-b Values are average ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab The single Cys at position 112 on helix 3 in the NT domain of apoE3/[email protected] was covalently labeled with the extrinsic fluorophore, AEDANS. The self-association characteristics of the labeled protein were similar to those of wild-type apoE3. The KSV of quenching AEDANS fluorescence by acrylamide and KI were 1.7m−1 and 0.3 m−1, respectively. The crystal structure indicates that Cys-112 is located in a partially buried location in the helix bundle. It is likely that the AEDANS moiety prefers a partially buried interfacial location as well, wedged between helices. Given these characteristics, Trp-264 and AEDANS-Cys-112, represent a favorable donor-acceptor pair (24Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Lindeberg M. Zakharov S.D. Cramer W.A. J. Mol.

Fig.2 shows fluorescence emission spectra of apoE3/[email protected] and AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] in the lipid-free state following excitation at 292 nm. ApoE3/[email protected] yielded a spectrum attributed to emission of the single Trp at position 264. In the case of AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected], a decrease in emission intensity at 348 nm was observed, concomitant with the appearance of a new fluorescence peak at a longer wavelength, centered at 471 nm. This is ascribed to AEDANS fluorescence arising from non-radiative energy transfer from Trp-264. To account for the contribution of fluorescence emission from direct excitation of AEDANS, a mutant apoE3 lacking Trp altogether (apoE3/Trp-null) was constructed. Fluorescence emission of AEDANS-apoE3/Trp-null (Fig. 2) was minimal, indicating the large fluorescence peak at 471 nm in AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] is predominantly the result of FRET. Although small, the contribution from direct excitation of AEDANS at 292 nm has been subtracted from all subsequent spectra of AEDANS-labeled protein. ApoE3 oligomerizes in buffer, predominantly forming tetramers (13Perugini M.A. Schuck P. Howlett G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36758-36765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Self-association of apoE (8Yokoyama S. Kawai Y. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16375-16382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is proposed to be mediated by a predicted amphipathic helical segment spanning residues 267–289 in the CT domain (14Westerlund J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15745-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given this organization, the potential contribution of intermolecular FRET to the spectrum shown in Fig. 2 was evaluated using three different approaches. In the first case, FRET was evaluated in apoE3 mixtures where the donor, Trp-264, is present on one molecule while the acceptor AEDANS resides on an apoE3/Trp-null molecule. No FRET was observed when apoE3/[email protected] was mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio with AEDANS-apoE3/Trp-null, as evidenced by lack of appearance of AEDANS fluorescence emission at 471 nm or changes in Trp fluorescence emission at 348 nm (Fig. 3). No FRET was observed following incubation of the mixtures for 10 min to 72 h at 4 or 37 °C. In a second approach, FRET was monitored in AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] mixed with excess apoE3/Trp-null (∼1:10 molar ratio), such that heteromeric tetramers will be formed, in which, on average, each AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] will be surrounded by apoE3/Trp-null molecules that bear neither the donor nor the acceptor. No change in FRET was noted (data not shown), implying that the contribution of intermolecular FRET in lipid-free tetrameric apoE is negligible. Lastly, FRET was evaluated as a function of dilution of AEDANS-apoE3/[email protected] in buffer (from 300 to about 15 μg/ml).

We have identified a p53-inducible gene by performing mRNA differential display on IW32 murine erythroleukemia cells containing a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant allele, tsp53Val-135. Sequence analysis of the full-length cDNA revealed its identity as the mouse homologue of the human thiamine transporter 1 (THTR-1). Induction of the mouse THTR-1 (mTHTR-1) mRNA was detectable as early as 1 h at 32.5 °C; upon shifting back to 38.5 °C, mTHTR-1 transcript was rapidly degraded with a half-life of less than 2 h. Elevation of mTHTR-1 expression was found in DNA damage-induced normal mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, but not in p53−/−mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, suggesting that mTHTR-1 induction was p53-dependent. A region within the first intron of the mTHTR-1 gene bound to p53 and conferred the p53-mediated transactivation. Furthermore, increased thiamine transporter activities were found in cells overexpressing mTHTR-1 and under conditions of DNA damage or p53 activation. Our findings indicate that p53 may be involved in maintaining thiamine homeostasis through transactivation of THTR-1. p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that functions, in part, through many of its downstream target genes.

Accumulating evidence has also indicated that p53 may be involved in DNA repair (4Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar, 12Ford J.M.

These functions of p53 are thought to prevent the replication of damaged DNA and protect the organism from accumulating genetic damages. One well studied characteristic of p53 is its ability to act as a sequence-specific transcription factor. It binds to distinct DNA motif containing the consensus sequence 5′-PuPuPuC (A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3′ and induces the transcription of genes residing in the vicinity of the response elements (13El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 14Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell.

Extensive effort has therefore been directed to search for the p53 downstream target genes in the hope of gaining insight into the mechanisms mediating its function. An increasing number of p53 target genes have been identified, and the best characterized among these is p21Waf1/Cip1. p21Waf1/Cip1 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (15El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and is vital in mediating the p53-induced G1 arrest. p53 has also been suggested to play a role in regulating the G2/M progression. The recent identification of a number of p53-inducible genes further substantiates its role in G2/M checkpoint control responding to various stress conditions. B99 is a p53-inducible gene that encodes a microtubule localized protein and is specifically expressed in G2 phase (17Utrera R. Collavin L. Lazareviæ D. Delia D. Schneider C.

Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) is a mitochondrial protein that, by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential, plays a pivotal role for the p53-induced apoptosis. Induction of a specific ribonucleotide reductase gene after DNA damage has recently been documented (25Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for p53 in DNA repair. The growing list of p53-regulated genes explains why p53 can respond to divergent environmental stresses to protect cells against neoplastic transformation. As well as the genes that are directly involved in growth suppression, p53 also induces the expression of growth-promoting or anti-apoptotic genes. For example, p53 up-regulates the expression of TRID (26Sheikh M.S. Huang Y. Fernandez-Salas E.A. El-Deiry W.S. Friess H. Amundson S. Yin J. Meltzer S.J. Holbrook N.J. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4153-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and TRUNDD (27Meng R.D. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. El-Deiry W.S. Mol. Ther. 2000; 1: 130-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the decoy death receptors that, upon overexpression, inhibit apoptosis. Although the contribution of the p53-dependent induction of these anti-apoptotic molecules in p53 signaling remains unclear, it is becoming apparent that the cellular response to p53 depends on the intricate coordination of an abundance of genes. Characterization of these genes will be crucial in understanding the p53 signaling network. We have introduced a temperature-sensitive p53, tsp53Val-135 (28Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), into the p53-null IW32 murine erythroleukemia cells (29Tang P.P. Wang F.F. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Several transfectants that stably express the temperature-sensitive p53 mutant protein were obtained. At permissive temperature, these cells were growth-arrested and underwent either differentiation and/or apoptosis. In the present study, we have identified a direct transcriptional target gene of p53 by the method of mRNA differential display (30Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed its identity to be the mouse orthologue of the newly identified human THTR-11 (31Diaz G.A.

Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We have shown that THTR-1 gene was induced under DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner; moreover, increased thiamine uptake activity correlated with p53 activation. Thus, in addition to the currently identified p53 target genes known to be involved in growth regulation and apoptosis, our findings demonstrate that p53 also regulates the expression of a molecule that is critical to thiamine homeostasis and mitochondria integrity. The IW32 murine erythroleukemia cell line and its stable transfectants expressing tsp53Val-135 allele (29Tang P.P. Wang F.F. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and H1299 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin in 5% CO2. Temperature shift was performed by transferring subconfluent flasks to a preequilibrated incubator. Wild-type and p53-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and its SV40 T antigen-transformed subline (293T) were cultured in the same medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and subcultured every 3 days. Total RNA was isolated by lysing the cells in Tri reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA preparations using an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen) according to the procedures described by the manufacturer. We utilized the RNAimage kit from GenHunter for mRNA differential display (30Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar). The parental IW32 cells and tsp53Val-135-expressing clone 1–5 cells were cultured at 0, 5, and 9 h at 32.5 °C; RNA was isolated and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O. The RNA (0.4 μg) was incubated with 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 40 units of RNasin, and 0.2 μm H-T11G (A or C) primer in 20 μl of reverse transcription buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 37.6 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm dNTP) at 37 °C for 1 h. After heat inactivation of the reverse transcriptase at 75 °C for 5 min, 2 μl of the sample was used for PCR in 20 μl of PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, and 2 μm dNTP) with 0.2 μmarbitrary primer (H-AP1 to H-AP16), 0.2 μm H-T11G (A or C) primer, 1 μl of [α-35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol) and 1 unit of AmpliTaq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The parameters for PCR were as follows: 40 cycles of cycling step (94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 30 s) followed by 72 °C elongation step for 5 min. The amplified cDNAs were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% sequencing gel. The positive bands were excised from the dried gel and boiled in 100 μl of H2O for 15 min, and DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 10 μl of H2O. Four μl of recovered cDNAs were used for reamplification by PCR in 40 μl of reaction volume with the same primers used for initial amplification except with a higher concentration of dNTP (20 μm). The parameters for PCR were the same as in the initial amplification. Reamplified cDNAs were purified from agarose gel and subcloned into pGEM-T TA cloning vector (Promega) for sequencing. The differentially expressed DDA1 cDNA fragment was sequenced using a Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described in the manufacturer's directions. To extend the 5′ cDNA sequences, 5′-RACE was performed with the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) using poly(A)+ RNA prepared from clone 1–5 cells cultured at 32.5 °C. Alternatively, the mouse liver Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) was used as template for 5′-RACE reaction. Adaptor primer (AP-1, 5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and gene-specific primer (GSP-1d, 5′-GCGTGGTAAAATGTGGATACAGTC-3′) complementary to the 3′ end of DDA1 were used for the PCRs. A 3.3-kb partial cDNA was obtained from PCR, and repeated 5′-RACE cloning did not result in additional 5′ sequence. To explore the possibility that there are extremely GC-rich sequences in the 5′ region of the gene that prevents the extension, 5′-RACE was performed again using Advantage-GC cDNA polymerase (CLONTECH), which has the benefits of efficient amplification of GC-rich templates. The amplified fragment extended the 5′ sequence 237 nucleotides farther upstream. Sequence compilation revealed a cDNA of 3554 bp that contained a noninterrupted open reading frame of 498 amino acids. TBLASTN was used to compare DDA1 protein sequence with the GenBankTM data base. Search results indicate that DDA1 is the mouse orthologue of the human thiamine transporter gene THTR-1 (31Diaz G.A. Banikazemi M. Oishi K. Desnick R.J. Gelb B.D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Dutta B. Huang W. Molero M. Kekuda R. Leibach F.H. Devoe L.D. Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. J. Biol.

Genet. 1999; 22: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); we therefore renamed DDA1 as mTHTR-1 (mouse THTR-1). Using the mouse liver cDNA library as template with primers homologous to mTHTR-1, PCR products of 3.5 kb in length were obtained. These cDNAs were subcloned into pGEM-T (pGEM-T-mTHTR-1), and sequencing from both directions was performed on several clones. Multiple sequence alignment was performed with CLUSTALW (www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). The mTHTR-1 genome was cloned from ICR Swiss mouse GenomeWalker genomic libraries (CLONTECH). Primer pairs specific for mTHTR-1 cDNA were synthesized for genome walking PCRs according to the protocols provided. Twenty-five μg of total RNA per lane was separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% MOPS-formaldehyde agarose gel. RNA was then blotted to the Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer. After UV radiation, the blot was prehybridized in hybridization buffer (5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 50% formamide, 10× Denhardt's solution, 0.3% SDS, and 200 μg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA) at 42 °C for 3–4 h. Hybridization was performed by incubating the blot with hybridization buffer containing 32P-labeled probe at 42 °C for 20–24 h, followed by washing in 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Probes were gel-purified cDNA fragments labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the Rediprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides for p53RE(2D) –p53RE(4D) and p53MRE(4D), with GATC added to the 5′-end for directional cloning, were synthesized,. After annealing of the oligonucleotides, they were cloned into pGUP.PA.8 luciferase-expressing vector (14Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) that had been predigested withBamHI and SmaI. To perform the reporter assay, 1 × 105 of H1299 cells were seeded per well in 12-well culture plates for 24 h, the reporter construct (0.5 μg) was cotransfected with p53-expressing plasmid (0.5 μg) by LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions; pCMV-β-galactosidase (0.5 μg) was included for calibrating the transfection efficiency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Nuclear extract was prepared according to the protocols described (35McLure K.G. Lee P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). H1299 cells with or without p53 transfection were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold hypotonic solution (10 mmHEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was extracted with 40 μl of hypertonic solution (hypotonic solution containing 0.5m KCl) with continuous agitation for 30 min. After centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant containing the nuclear extract was used for electrophoresis mobility shift assay. p53RE(4D) was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the probe was incubated with nuclear extracts (7.5 μg) prepared from H1299 cells transfected with or without wild-type p53 DNA in a final reaction volume of 12 μl containing 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.8 μg poly(dI-dC) in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. p53-specific antibody PAb421 (0.15 μg) was added where indicated. Unlabeled oligonucleotides in 50-fold molar excess (5 pmol) were added as competitors for p53-DNA complex formation. After incubating at room temperature for 30 min, the mixture was chilled on ice and analyzed by electrophoresis in a native 4% polyacryamide gel. The p53Con used in the competition assay corresponds to the p53 response element from the human p21Waf1/Cip1 gene (15El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar) and contains the sequence 5′-GAACATGTCCCAACATGTTG-3′. To construct the pCMV-mTHTR-1, pGEM-T-mTHTR-1 was digested with NotI, and theNotI fragment containing the entire open reading frame of mTHTR-1 cDNA was ligated into pRc-CMV (Invitrogen) through the NotI site. Mouse reduced folate carrier 1 (mRFC-1) cDNA containing the entire open reading frame was obtained by PCR using the mouse liver cDNAs as templates. It was ligated to the NotI site of pRc-CMV for expression. TheSalI and ClaI mTHTR-1 cDNA fragment was cloned into the EcoRI site of pTRE plasmid (CLONTECH) for establishment of the Tet-on-inducible mTHTR-1 expression cells. Human 293T cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per well in 24-well culture dishes in 0.5 ml of vitamin-free RPMI (Select-Amine kit, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 24 h. The cells were then transfected by LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1 μg of pRc-CMV, pCMV-mTHTR-1 or pCMV-mRFC-1. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with vitamin-free RPMI medium, followed by a 30-min incubation with 0.4 ml of vitamin-free RPMI medium containing 25 nm[3H]thiamine (10 Ci/mmol) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.) at 37 °C. After being washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were solubilized by overnight incubation in 0.2 n NaOH followed by neutralization with 0.2 n HCl. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For measuring thiamine uptake in tsp53Val-135 transfected IW32 cells (clone 1–5), 2 × 106 cells were seeded per well in 12-well dishes and cultured at 32.5 °C for 0, 6, and 12 h. Cells were harvested and assayed for [3H]thiamine uptake as described. To assay thiamine uptake in DNA damage-induced cells, 1 × 105 NIH3T3 cells were seeded per well in 12-well culture dishes and cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were treated with 400 ng/ml of adriamycin for 16 h and processed for thiamine uptake assay as described. Nonspecific uptake of [3H]thiamine was determined by performing the reaction in the presence of 10 mm unlabeled thiamine. A nucleotide with sequence corresponding to amino acids 209–294 of the mTHTR-1 cDNA was cloned into pGEX-5X-3. The GST fusion protein was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified with a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. The protein (100 μg) was mixed with Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into rabbits. Rabbits were boosted three times at 4-week intervals, and samples of serum were collected 2 weeks after injection. To establish the mTHTR-1-expressing cells under the control of a tetracycline promoter, the pTRE-mTHTR-1 plasmid was transfected into the tet-on HEK 293 cells (CLONTECH). Cells were cultured in the presence of 0.15 mg/ml hygromycin for 3 weeks, and the resistant clones were selected. Expression of mTHTR-1 was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR using mTHTR-1-specific primer pairs. For immunofluorescence assay, the tet-on HEK 293 cells stably transfected with pTRE-mTHTR-1 or the control pTRE-vector were seeded on glass slides for 16 h and treated with or without doxycycline (5 μg/ml) for 24 h. The cells were incubated with anti-mTHTR-1 antibodies (1: 1000 dilution) for 16 h followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution) and viewed under a confocal microscope. We have cotransfected the p53-null IW32 murine erythroleukemia cells with pSV2neo and a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant DNA, tsp53Val-135 (28Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar); several stable clones containing the mutant p53 allele were obtained (29Tang P.P. Wang F.F.

These cells were growth-arrested when cultured at 32.5 °C; some clones predominantly underwent apoptosis, whereas others were viably arrested and differentiated along the erythroid pathway. In order to search for p53-regulated genes, we performed mRNA differential display on one of the tsp53Val-135 transfectants (clone 1–5) cultured at 32.5 and 38.5 °C. Clone 1–5 cells when grown at permissive temperature, arrested in G1 phase of the cell cycle and matured along the erythroid pathway, as indicated by increased hemoglobin mRNA and protein synthesis (29Tang P.P. Wang F.F. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Upon differential display with a total of 16 arbitrary 10-mers and 3 poly(T) primers, 5 cDNA fragments were identified that showed increased levels of expression upon p53 induction. The activation of two of these genes, provisionally named DDA1 and DDA3 (36Lo P.K. Chen J.Y. Lo W.C. Chen B.F. Hsin J.P. Tang P.P. Wang F.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7765-7774Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as they were identified by differential display and were activated by p53, was further verified by Northern blot analysis. The 346-base pair DDA1 differential display fragment hybridized to a transcript corresponding to 3.8 kb in size that showed a pronounced rise in clone 1–5 cells cultured at 32.5 °C (Fig.1A). The induction was first observed at 1 h following temperature downshifting, earlier than that of p21Waf1/Cip1 (Fig. 1A). No induction of DDA1 could be detected in pSV2neo-alone transfected IW32 cells (Neo) cultured at 32.5 °C, ruling out the possibility that up-regulation of DDA1 transcript was a nonspecific temperature effect. Moreover, the p53-dependent activation of DDA1 was consistently observed in each of the five sublines of p53 transfectants tested (data not shown), indicating that the induction of DDA1 was not merely a positional effect due to site-specific p53 integration. We further examined the mechanisms underlying p53-dependent activation of DDA1 mRNA expression. Clone 1–5 cells were pretreated with or without protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for 1 h before shifting to 32.5 °C, and DDA1 induction was analyzed. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, induction of DDA1 mRNA was not inhibited by cycloheximide pretreatment, indicating that protein synthesis is not required for the activation of DDA1 by p53. Control experiments with the Neo-transfected IW32 cells showed that cycloheximide had no significant effect on DDA1 mRNA levels. To confirm whether p53 activated DDA1 at the transcriptional level, cells were incubated with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D for 30 min before temperature downshift, and DDA1 expression was monitored by Northern blotting. As can be seen in Fig. 1C, induction of DDA1 mRNA was abolished when cells were pretreated with actinomycin D. These results, together with the robust expression and fast kinetics of its induction, suggest that DDA1 is a potential p53 target gene. 5′-RACE was adopted to clone the full-length cDNA of DDA1. After several rounds of RACE experiments using the cDNAs prepared from clone 1–5 cells and a mouse liver cDNA library as templates, a compilation of sequence data established a DDA1 sequence of 3554 nucleotides. The sequence contains an open reading frame of 1497 bp, with an ATG initiation codon starting at nucleotide 199 and a termination codon stopping at nucleotide 1695. The most upstream ATG is likely to be the translation initiation codon because it is preceded by two in-frame stop codons located at nucleotides 28 and 73, and the nucleotide sequence surrounding it resembles the Kozak consensus sequence (37Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). The open reading frame is followed by a 3′-untranslated region of 1859 bp that contains a polyadenylation signal. It predicts a protein of 498 amino acids with two potentialN-glycosylation sites at asparagines 63 and 415. The deduced amino acid sequence, containing 12 transmembrane domains, has 40% identity to the mRFC-1 (38Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol.

The best characterized function of APC is its association with a multiprotein complex that facilitates the degradation of the oncoprotein, β-catenin (3Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B.

The largest cellular pool of β-catenin is membrane-associated and engaged in adhesion-mediated signaling via cell-cell contact at the AJ (14Orsulic S. Huber O. Aberle H. Arnold S. Kemler R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The AJ is a highly dynamic structure composed of the transmembrane protein, E-cadherin, and several members of the catenin family, including α-, β-, and γ-catenin, and p120ctn(reviewed in 15). When bound to E-cadherin, β-catenin links adhesion complexes to the actin cytoskeleton in ways that maintain epithelial cell polarity, preserve barrier function, and facilitate cell migration (15Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Studies examining the localization of wild-type and cancer-associated truncated APC proteins suggest the involvement of this tumor suppressor in AJ function (reviewed in Ref. 16Barth A.I.M. Nathke I.S. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). By altering the availability of β-catenin for engagement with AJ constituent proteins, APC may indirectly modulate epithelial cell adhesion (17Shoemaker A.R. Gould K.A. Luongo C. Moser A.R. Dove W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F25-F48PubMed Google Scholar). APC was found co-localized with the actin cytoskeleton and with AJs in the epithelial cells of Drosophila embryos consistent with a role in regulating epithelial cell-cell contacts (18McCartney B.M. Dierick H.A. Kirkpatrick C. Moline M.M. Baas A. Pfeifer M. Bejsovec A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1303-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar,19Yu X. Bienz M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 84: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies also showed that APC resides in the lateral cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells, in regions containing the catenins (20Miyashiro I. Senda T. Matsumine A. Baeg G.-H. Kuroda T. Shimano T. Miura S. Noda T. Kobayashi S. Monden M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 89-96PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor-associated APC mutations generally cause chain termination and result in expression of truncated proteins lacking the C terminus (21Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). By immunofluorescence microscopy, both full-length and truncated APC proteins were associated with the membrane at the apical borders of murine intestinal cells (22Reinacher-Schick A. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting that both forms of the protein are available to modulate adhesive interactions. Epithelial homeostasis depends on the dynamic regulation of cadherin-catenin adhesion complexes at the AJ. The intestinal epithelium is normally maintained by the robust proliferation of stem cells situated in crypts. The progeny of stem cells differentiate as they migrate to the tips of the villi, where they eventually senesce and are exfoliated into the intestinal lumen. To mediate the processes of embryonic development, wound healing, and crypt-villus migration, the AJ must be efficiently disassembled and reassembled (reviewed in Ref. 23Birchmeier W. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The importance of the AJ to epithelial homeostasis is illustrated by the observation that loss of AJ structure correlates with tumor formation, invasion, and metastasis (24Troxell M.L. Loftus D.J. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1237-1246PubMed Google Scholar, 25Perry I. Hardy R. Tselepis C. Jankowski J.A. Mol.

Targeted gene disruption in mice shows that β-catenin is essential for maintenance of AJ activity, as this protein is required for the structural organization of the embryonic ectoderm (27Haegel H. Larue L. Oshugi M. Federov L. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Development. 1995; 121: 3529-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A high expression of E-cadherin reduces the nuclear localization and transcriptional potential of β-catenin (14Orsulic S. Huber O. Aberle H. Arnold S. Kemler R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sadot E. Simcha I. Shtutman S. Ben'Ze'ev A. Geiger B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15339-15344Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The interactions of β-catenin and E-cadherin, and consequently downstream signal transduction, are also regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of AJ constituents including β-catenin (29Behrens J.

Velmaat J.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (33Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In addition, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) can dephosphorylate β-catenin, thus promoting cell-cell adhesion and migration (34Meng K. Rodriguez-Pena A. Dimitrov T. Chen W. Yamin Y. Noda M. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2603-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The consequence of β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation is its dissociation from the AJ (14Orsulic S. Huber O. Aberle H. Arnold S. Kemler R. J.

Norton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) which, in turn, can cause loss of AJ structure (36Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 37Akhtar N. Hotchin N.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Under certain conditions of AJ loss, E-cadherin may be internalized and returned to the membrane of epithelial cells as adhesion contacts re-form (36Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 37Akhtar N. Hotchin N.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The importance of appropriate adhesive interactions to optimal enterocyte migration was demonstrated by the targeted expression of E-cadherin in the murine small intestine (38Hermiston M.L. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 39Wong J. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Previous studies in our laboratory showed that Apc mutation also affects enterocyte migration in the intestinal mucosa of Min/+ mice. The germ line of the Min/+ mouse contains a chain terminating mutation inApc, and Min/+ mice develop multiple intestinal adenomas that exhibit loss of the wild-type Apc allele (ApcMin/−). We found that Min/+ non-tumor enterocytes (ApcMin/+) displayed an ∼25% reduced migration rate when compared with theApc+/+ littermate controls and the functionally hemizygous Apc1638N enterocytes (40Mahmoud N.N. Boolbol S.K. Bilinski R.T. Martucci C.M. Chadburn A. Bertagnolli M.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5045-5050PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggested Apc genotype-dependent alterations in intestinal cell-cell adhesion. To characterize further the effect of the ApcMin allele upon enterocyte adhesion, we examined the changes in AJ structure that occur during the progression from wild-type (Apc+/+) to slowly migrating ApcMin/+ enterocytes and to adenoma cells (ApcMin/−). We extracted enterocytes from the mouse small intestine using a method that preserves cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts and therefore provides an accurate evaluation of thein vivo status of adhesion complexes (41Weyant M.J. Carothers A.M. Dannenberg A.J. Bertagnolli M.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 118-125PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that diminished β-catenin-E-cadherin association and internalization of E-cadherin occurs in the non-tumor enterocytes from Min/+ mice when compared with their wild-type littermates and toApcMin/− adenomas. These changes suggest that the Min mutation alters the membrane-associated pool of β-catenin in adult animals in ways that reduce cell-cell adhesion and slow enterocyte migration but that nevertheless maintain the histologically normal appearance of the mucosa. The data further support the view that the Min mutation yields a dominant negative effect on Apc function. Five-week-old female Min/+ mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). AIN-76A chow was prepared by Research Diets (New Brunswick, NJ). Antibodies directed against β-catenin (clone 14), EGFR (clone 13), RPTPβ/ζ (clone 12), p120ctn (clone 98), and against an epitope on the intracellular portion of E-cadherin (clone 36) were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Anti-RPTP-γ (M-18), anti-PTP LAR (R-20), and anti-c-Src (SRC2) (sc-18) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A second RPTPβ/ζ antibody (MAB5210) was generously provided by Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Anti-α-catenin (clone αCAT-7A4) and anti-E-cadherin (clone ECCD-2) antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibody recognizing the extracellular domain of E-cadherin (DECMA-1) and anti-β-actin antibody (clone AC-40), and the proteasome inhibitor,N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN), were purchased from Sigma. Anti-v-Src antibody (Ab-1) was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA), and anti-Src-p-Tyr416 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The LSAB2 detection system was obtained from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). IPs used the protein G kit of Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Reagents and materials for IB analyses were as described previously (41Weyant M.J. Carothers A.M. Dannenberg A.J. Bertagnolli M.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 118-125PubMed Google Scholar). FemaleApc+/+ and ApcMin/+ mice were fed AIN-76A diet and tap water ad libidum. Similar growth and food intake occurred in the two groups. At 110 days of age all mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation, and their intestinal tracts were removed, opened, and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Tumors were excised, pooled, and frozen in liquid N2. Enterocytes from the ileum were isolated in the following manner. Sections of proximal small intestine were opened longitudinally, washed with PBS, and inspected for evidence of tumor involvement by examination under × 3 magnification. Enterocytes were removed from 1- to 2-cm segments of tumor-free ileum by lightly scraping the mucosal surface with the edge of a microscope slide. The material obtained by scraping was then washed in cold PBS, and the resulting pellet was frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cell pellets were stored at −70 °C until the time of assay. Enterocytes prepared in this manner also contained some lamina propria and fibroblasts, although the absorptive enterocytes and goblet cells of villi substantially outnumbered these cell types (Fig.1). Serial sections underestimate the ratio between enterocytes and stromal cells, which were shown by three-dimensional analyses to exceed other cell types by >100-fold (42Potten C.S. Loeffler M. Development. 1990; 110: 1001-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Wright N.A. Irwin M. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1982; 15: 595-609PubMed Google Scholar). These preparations, therefore, provided a favorable signal-to-noise ratio for studying the characteristics of post-mitotic, differentiated enterocytes in their in vivo condition. Cold lysis buffer (38Hermiston M.L. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) was added to the tumors or enterocytes pooled from two mice of the same genotype. Unless otherwise indicated, the proteasome inhibitor, ALLN (10 mm), was added to the lysis buffer. Cells and tumors in lysis buffer were separately homogenized by 10 strokes in chilled Dounces. All subsequent steps for protein isolation were performed at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and protein concentrations of supernatants were determined by Lowry assay. Normalized aliquots of each lysate were placed in Laemmli buffer (67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v)) and stored at −70 °C. In parallel, portions of each lysate were pre-cleared to remove immunoglobulins by mixing with protein G beads at 4 °C for 4 h, followed by centrifugation and removal of the beads. After pre-clearing, the same amount of protein from each lysate was reacted with primary antibody for 1 h. Immune complexes were precipitated for 12 h with protein G beads. The beads were washed, and the bound proteins were released in 50 µl of Laemmli buffer. The entire amount of each IP sample or the total cell lysate samples were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Procedures for IB analyses were as detailed (42Potten C.S. Loeffler M. Development. 1990; 110: 1001-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Washed membranes were stripped by incubation at 65 °C for 20 min in 68 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, and 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol before re-probing. All experiments were repeated at least twice using independently prepared lysates. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was performed, and tissues were examined by light microscopy to document histology. Serial sections of mid-small intestinal mucosa fromApc+/+ and ApcMin/+animals were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched in 3% H2O2, and the slides were rinsed in PBS. The sections were then incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with a rat anti-mouse E-cadherin antibody (clone ECCD-2). Detection was accomplished using the LSAB 2 system using a biotinylated anti-rat antibody at 1:300 dilution. Enterocytes and tumor cells isolated as described above were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2. Pelleted cells were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70 °C. At the time of assay, cell pellets were placed in 1 ml of a hypotonic lysis buffer without EDTA, NaCl, and detergent (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, plus proteasome, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors as described (40Mahmoud N.N. Boolbol S.K. Bilinski R.T. Martucci C.M. Chadburn A. Bertagnolli M.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5045-5050PubMed Google Scholar)). Cells were allowed to thaw and swell on ice for 15 min, before being homogenized with 30 strokes. Cell suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,700 rpm. The pellet containing debris, nuclei, and unlysed cells were discarded; the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The subsequent high speed centrifugation supernatants (S100) were retained; the pellets (P100) were suspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged as above. The supernatants (detergent-soluble P100) were retained; the pellets (detergent-insoluble P100), suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, were also retained. Aliquots of each fraction were removed for protein determination by Lowry assay. Normalized amounts of the fractionated proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and IB analyses performed. Because the migration ofApcMin/+ enterocytes is decreased relative to that of their wild-type littermates (Apc+/+) (40Mahmoud N.N. Boolbol S.K. Bilinski R.T. Martucci C.M. Chadburn A. Bertagnolli M.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5045-5050PubMed Google Scholar), we predicted that the AJ structure and/or function ofApcMin/+ intestinal cells is also altered. Furthermore, we expected that changes in the AJ would also be found inApcMin/− tumor cells, since these cells may have lost the ability to migrate altogether (14Orsulic S. Huber O. Aberle H.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We examined the overall expression of E-cadherin inApc+/+, ApcMin/+, andApcMin/− adenoma cells by IB analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, equivalent expression of E-cadherin was present in Apc+/+and non-tumor ApcMin/+ tissues; however, expression of this protein was increased inApcMin/− adenoma cells. To examine the association between E-cadherin and β-catenin in the tissue samples, β-catenin was immunoprecipitated from tissue lysates prepared with the proteasome inhibitor, ALLN. An IB of the precipitated proteins detected the association of E-cadherin with β-catenin inApc+/+ cells (Fig. 2B). This experiment showed a significantly increased association of E-cadherin with β-catenin in the ApcMin/− adenoma cells. In ApcMin/+ enterocytes, however, a decreased association between these proteins was evident. These results suggested an effect of the ApcMinallele on the AJ structure of intestinal epithelial cells. To characterize this effect further, we determined the subcellular location of E-cadherin and β-catenin by fractionatingApc+/+, ApcMin/+, andApcMin/− cells. The cells were lysed without detergent; nuclei were removed, and then the lysate samples were centrifuged at high speed to obtain cytosolic (S100) and membrane (P100) fractions. The membrane fractions were further separated by treatment with detergent to yield membrane-soluble and membrane-insoluble fractions. IB analyses were separately performed to detect both the intracellular (clone 36) and extracellular (DECMA-1) domains of E-cadherin. As shown in Fig.3, E-cadherin was detected by both antibodies in the P100 membrane-associated (detergent-soluble) and membrane integral (detergent-insoluble) fractions in all three samples. The localization of E-cadherin in these two epithelial cell compartments was described in previous studies (45Shore E.M. Nelson W.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Attachment of E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton via α- and β-catenin renders the complex insoluble in detergent (45Shore E.M. Nelson W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19672-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46McNeill H. Ryan T.A. Smith A.J. Nelson W.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this experiment showed an increase in both the extra- and intracellular components of E-cadherin in the cytosol ofApcMin/+ enterocytes (Fig. 3). Internalization of E-cadherin is promoted in epithelial cells grown under conditions that do not permit stable cell-cell contact, such as low cell density (36Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 37Akhtar N. Hotchin N.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These results are therefore consistent with a significant loss of AJ structure in the ApcMin/+enterocytes. This result was confirmed using immunohistochemistry to detect the location of E-cadherin in sections obtained fromApc+/+ and ApcMin/+ small intestine (Fig. 4). E-cadherin antibody demonstrates prominent staining of the lateral membranes in theApc+/+ enterocytes (Fig. 4A) that is lost in the ApcMin/+ tissue (Fig.4B).Figure 4Decreased membrane E-cadherin inApcMin/+ enterocytes. Photomicrograph (× 100) of small intestine sections from Apc+/+and ApcMin/+ mice.

The ApcMin/− adenomas lack functional Apc and are therefore unable to degrade free cytosolic β-catenin (48Levy D.B. Smith K.J. Beazer-Barclay Y. Hamilton S.R. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5953-5958PubMed Google Scholar,49Luongo C. Moser A.R. Gledhill S. Dove W.F. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5947-5952PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, we expected to find increased amounts of cytosolic β-catenin in the ApcMin/− cells. Because the fractionation shown in Fig. 3 was performed using cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor, the increase in cytosolic β-catenin in theApcMin/− adenomas could not be detected. To compare the effect of Apc-mediated degradation on β-catenin levels inApc+/+, ApcMin/+, andApcMin/− tissues, we measured β-catenin expression by IB using whole cell lysates prepared with and without ALLN (Fig. 5). Bands of 92 kDa, the size of β-catenin, were present in the ApcMin/+ andApc+/+ samples at similar low"

Previous studies have demonstrated that this new class of antimicrobial agent blocks translation by inhibiting initiation complex formation, while post-initiation translation by polysomes and poly(U)-dependent translation is not a target for these compounds. We found that oxazolidinones inhibit translation of natural mRNA templates but have no significant effect on poly(A)-dependent translation. Here we show that various oxazolidinones inhibit ribosomal peptidyltransferase activity in the simple reaction of 70 S ribosomes using initiator-tRNA orN-protected CCA-Phe as a P-site substrate and puromycin as an A-site substrate. Steady-state kinetic analysis shows that oxazolidinones display a competitive inhibition pattern with respect to both the P-site and A-site substrates. This is consistent with a rapid equilibrium, ordered mechanism of the peptidyltransferase reaction, wherein binding of the A-site substrate can occur only after complex formation between peptidyltransferase and the P-site substrate. We propose that oxazolidinones inhibit bacterial protein biosynthesis by interfering with the binding of initiator fMet-tRNAiMetto the ribosomal peptidyltransferase P-site, which is vacant only prior to the formation of the first peptide bond.

Oxazolidinones, which were first discovered at E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Co. in 1983 (1Slee A.M. Wuonola M.A. McRipley R.J. Zajac I. Zavada M.J. Bartholomew P.T. Gregory W.A. Forbes M. Antimicrob.

Although these compounds block protein biosynthesis (2Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Slee A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), they inhibit neither translation by polysomes (3Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Zajac I. Slee A.M. Antimicrob.

Dunyak D.S. Demyan W.F. Buysse J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, oxazolidinones do bind preferentially to the 50 S subunit of bacterial ribosomes (5Lin A.H. Murray R.W. Vidmar T.J. Marotti K.R. Antimicrob.

Swaney S.M. Dunyak D.S. Demyan W.F. Buysse J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These agents do not affect the formation of the 30 S preinitiation complex (6Burghardt H. Schimz K.-L. Muller M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Swaney S.M. Aoki H. Ganoza M.C. Shinabarger D.L. Antimicrob.

Shinabarger D.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3251-3255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Except for two contradictory reports of their effect upon peptide bond formation (4Shinabarger D.L.

The lack of clarity surrounding the mechanism of oxazolidinone action suggested to us that more thorough kinetic studies, at different levels of complexity, might prove illuminating. We used detailed initial velocity kinetics studies to decipher the mechanism of action of these inhibitors. Here we show that oxazolidinones inhibit (a) the translation of natural mRNAs; (b) the puromycin reaction that utilizes 70 S ribosomes, initiator fMet-tRNAiMet, and puromycin; and (c) the fragment reaction, which involves 70 S ribosomes, CCA-Phe-X-biotin and puromycin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that oxazolidinones behave as competitive inhibitors with respect to both the P-site and A-site substrates of ribosomal peptidyltransferase.

Tight couple 70 S ribosomes from E. coli MRE 600 were prepared essentially as described by Spedding (11Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 1-9Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Bacterial cells (50 g) were suspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6 at 0 °C), 6 mmMgCl2, 30 mm NH4Cl, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride). Cells were broken by grinding with prechilled alumina in buffer A (50 ml) followed by the addition of an equal volume of buffer A supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and benzamidine hydrochloride. After incubation with RNase-free DNase (30 min at 0 °C), alumina and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 and 30,000 × g, respectively. The supernatant fluid was then layered over an equal volume of 1.1 m sucrose in buffer B (buffer A containing 0.5 m NH4Cl) and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 15 h. The upper part of the supernatant fluid was collected and dialyzed against buffer A (4 liters, three times). After washing with Polymix buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 at 0 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 8 mmputrescine, 1 mm spermidine, 5 mmNH4Cl, 95 mm KCl, 1 mmdithioerythritol or 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), the ribosomal pellet was resuspended in buffer C (Polymix buffer containing 0.5m NH4Cl) and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 column preequilibrated with buffer C. Size fractionation was performed by elution with buffer C (400 ml) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing 70 S ribosomes were pooled, concentrated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g overnight, and redissolved in buffer A. Because analysis of the gel filtration fractions did not show any significant contamination with dissociated 30 S and 50 S subunits, the gel filtration step was omitted in further preparations. The procedure yielded ∼50 nmol tight-couple 70 S ribosomes. Synthesis of f-[35S]Met-tRNAfMet was performed as described (12Dubnoff J.S. Maitra U. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 20C: 248-260Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using purified tRNAfMet and S-100 extract as a source of formyltransferase, and methionyl-tRNA synthetase. The concentration of tRNAiMet was estimated via specific radioactivity of the final preparation as well as by evaluation of the maximum radioactivity incorporation in the puromycin reaction at saturating concentrations of ribosomes and puromycin. Depending on the quality of acceptor tRNA, a typical preparation had specific radioactivity of 0.02–0.03 μCi/pmol. A solution of 6-((biotinoyl)amino)hexanoic acid succinimidyl ester (250 mg, 0.55 mmol), l-phenylalanine t-butyl ester hydrochloride (142 mg, 0.55 mmol), and triethylamine (84 μl, 0.60 mmol) in dry dimethylformamide (5.5 ml) was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction was poured into water and extracted with 5% methanol in dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed twice with water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated. The residue was recrystallized from a boiling mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane to afford 250 mg of the title compound as a white solid. MS (ES+)m/e = 583 (M + Na). 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6): 1.10–1.65 (m, 12H), 1.31(s, 9H), 2.04 (m, 4H), 2.56 (d, 1H), 2.79–2.87 (m, 2H), 2.97 (m, 3H), 3.10 (m, 1H), 4.12 (m, 1H), 4.24 (m, 1H), 4.28 (m, 1H), 6.31 (s, 1H), 6.37 (s, 1H), 7.19–7.26 (m, 5H), 7.66 (t, 1H), 8.08 (d, 1H). A solution of biotin-X-Phe-O-tBu (247 mg, 0.44 mmol) in trifluoroacetic acid (0.44 ml) was stirred overnight, concentrated to dryness, and coevaporated with ethanol. The residue was dissolved in methanol (0.44 ml), and 1 mtetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide in methanol (0.48 ml, 0.48 mmol) was added. After concentrating the reaction mixture to dryness, the residue was coevaporated with dry toluene and dissolved in dry dimethylformamide (about 2 ml). Chloroacetonitrile (31 μl, 0.49 mmol) was added, and the reaction was stirred overnight. The reaction was added to water and extracted three times with dichloromethane. The combined organic layers were dried over magnesium sulfate, concentrated to dryness, and used without further purification. 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6): 1.10–1.65 (m, 12H), 2.04 (m, 4H), 2.56 (d, 1H), 2.81(dd, 1H), 2.87–3.13 (m, 5H), 4.24 (m, 1H), 4.28 (m, 1H), 4.51 (m, 1H), 4.96 (s, 2H), 6.31 (s, 1H), 6.37 (s, 1H), 7.21–7.29 (m, 5H), 7.66 (t, 1H), 8.35 (d, 1H). Oligonucleotides were handled in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated sterile water. The procedure of Ellman et al. (13Ellman J. Mendel D. Anthony-Cahill S. Noren C.J. Schultz P.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 302-336Google Scholar) was modified. The CCA trinucleotide was converted to the tetra-n-butylammonium salt by passing an aqueous solution of trinucleotide through a 5-g column of Bio-Rex 70 resin (prepared from the sodium form by washing sequentially with 70% ethanol-water, water, 0.1 n aqueous sodium hydroxide, water, 0.1n aqueous hydrochloric acid, water until neutral, 0.1n tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide, and water until neutral). To the lyophilized CCA (504A260, 18 μmol) was added an 0.25 msolution of biotin-X-Phe-O-CH2CN in dryN,N-dimethylformamide (0.36 ml of 0.25m stock), and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. HPLC of an aliquot quenched into water showed the presence of one major lipophilic product (which reverted to starting trinucleotide upon standing at room temperature). This product was isolated by preparative HPLC on a 1 × 25-cm C18 reverse phase HPLC column with a 5–60% gradient of acetonitrile in 50 mm aqueous ammonium acetate at pH 4.5.

Messenger RNA of firefly luciferase was synthesized using RiboMAXTM Large Scale RNA Production System-SP6 and pSP luc+ vector carrying the luc+ allele according to the instructions provided by Promega. The resulting mRNA was purified by G-25 gel filtration chromatography, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. The size and purity of luciferase mRNA were assessed using gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (4–15% PhastGels with DNA PhastGel buffer strips) using RNA markers I and II. All mRNA-dependent translation reactions were carried out at room temperature in a 50-μl total assay volume. Translation of luc+ mRNA (0.14 mg/ml) was performed in buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9 at 0 °C), 54 mmNH4Cl, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm spermine, 2 mm spermidine, 1.6 mm ATP, 0.05 mm GTP, and 5 mmphosphoenol pyruvate) containing 0.4 mg/ml total tRNA, 0.28 mg/ml S-100 extract, 0.03 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 0.28 μm 70 S ribosomes from E. coli MRE 600 in the presence of 50 μm amino acids with 20 μm[14C]leucine (300 mCi/mmol) as a source of label. Reactions were stopped with equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 1% bovine serum albumin (5:1 v/v) followed by precipitation and washing procedure essentially as described (11Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 1-9Google Scholar). Initial rates of the reaction in the presence of different concentrations of inhibitors were determined from stopped time point assays (20 min). The progress in these reactions was linear for at least 45–60 min, which assured linearity. KaleidaGraph software was used both for plotting and linear regression analysis of all data. The Poly(N)-dependent translation reactions were carried out at room temperature in a 50-μl total assay volume. Translation of poly(U) template was done as described in Ref. 14Bommer U.A.

Translation of poly(A) (at a 1 mg/ml concentration) was performed in buffer E (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6 at 0 °C), 30 mmNH4Cl, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 9 mmMgCl2, 0.05 mm spermine, 2 mmspermidine, 1.6 mm ATP, 0.05 mm GTP, and 5 mm phosphoenol pyruvate) in the presence of 50 μm amino acids, 10 μm[14C]lysine (300 mCi/mmol), 0.4 mg/ml total tRNA, 0.3 mg/ml S-100 extract, 0.03 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 0.28 μm 70 S ribosomes. Radiolabeled peptide product was detected as described above for mRNA-dependent translation. Peptidyltransferase activity using puromycin as a substrate was assayed essentially as described by Monro (15Monro R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 20C: 472-481Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out on ice and contained the following components: 36.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 23 °C), 10 mm MgCl2, 266.7 mm KCl, 0.002–0.07 μm E. coli 70 S ribosomes, 0.012–0.8 μmf-[35S]Met- tRNAiMet, 10–200 μm puromycin, 33.3% MeOH, and 1.6% Me2SO. The specifics of each experiment are given in the figure legends. The reaction mixture was stopped by the addition of KOH to a 1 n final concentration after varying incubation times. Following incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the product was obtained by extracting into ethyl acetate containing 1 mNaPO4 (pH 7.0 at room temperature). The [35S]formylmethionyl-puromycin formation was quantified using a Packard Topcount-NTXTM (Packard Bioscience Co.) after adding Microscint-40 to the organic phase. The fragment peptidyltransferase reactions were performed at room temperature and contained the following components in a 60-μl reaction volume: 20 μl of 3× reaction buffer (37 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 23 °C), 10 mm MgCl2, and 267 mm KCl, 33% MeOH), 0.15 μm E. coli MRE600 70 S ribosomes, various concentrations of CCA-Phe-X-biotin, 50 μm [3H]puromycin (0.5 Ci/mmol), 33.3% MeOH, and 1.6% Me2SO. The reaction mixtures were stopped by the addition of 0.5 volume of 7 m guanidine HCl with 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0 at room temperature) after varying incubation times. The quenched reactions were then transferred to a SAM96Biotin Capture plate prewetted with 2 mNaCl. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the plate was filtered and washed with 2 m NaCl to remove unreacted [3H]puromycin. The bound biotin-Phe-[3H]puromycin was measured using a Packard Topcount-NTXTM after adding 15 μl of Microscint-20. Ribosomal peptidyltransferase behaves in vivo as an ordered bireactant system (16Green R. Switzer C. Noller H.F. Science. 1998; 280: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) in which the A-site substrate can bind only to the preformed P-substrate·ribosome complex. It was also shown that under physiological conditions, the formation of the first peptide bond occurs via a rapid equilibrium mechanism (17Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 18Tomsic J. Vitali L.A. Daviter T. Savelsbergh A. Spurio R. Striebeck P. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Gualerzi C.O. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the puromycin reaction is MeOH-dependent, and thus the sequence of substrates binding might differ from the physiological situation. Assuming rapid equilibrium conditions (where for a given substrate, Km ≅ Kd), an ordered bisubstrate reaction can be described as in Reaction 1.E+A⇌EA+B⇌EAB→kpE+PREACTION 2 Correspondingly, the rapid equilibrium random Bi Bi reaction can be depicted as in Reaction 2.REACTION2 Reciprocal plots at various concentrations of a competitive inhibitor of the first substrate, the P-site substrate in our study, should intersect on the 1/v axis above the horizontal axis when either A or B is varied (19Segel, I. H. (1993) Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems, pp. 274–329, 749–751, Wiley-Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Competitive reciprocal patterns for both substrates would distinguish the P-site inhibitor from the inhibitor competitive with the second, A-site, substrate. For the latter, reciprocal plots would show an uncompetitive pattern with respect to the P-substrate and a competitive pattern with puromycin as the varied substrate (19Segel, I. H. (1993) Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems, pp. 274–329, 749–751, Wiley-Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar).

Inhibitor studies versus the P-site substrate were performed at fixed concentrations of puromycin (150 μm) and 70 S ribosomes (0.008–0.010 μm). Initiator fMet-tRNAiMet was varied from 0.012 to 0.045 μm, and the oxazolidinone was varied from 0 to 200 μm. Competition with the A-site substrate was performed at fixed concentrations of 70 S ribosomes (0.004 μm) and fMet-tRNAiMet (0.1 μm). Puromycin was varied from 12.5 μm to 100 μm, and the oxazolidinone was varied from 0 to 150 μm. Progress curves were measured for each set of conditions, and the initial rates were determined by linear regression analysis. The v versus [S] data were fitted to possible inhibition models using GraFit software. The mode of inhibition was determined from the model which best fits the data, based on standard deviations for kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax, andKi) and by F test estimates. The apparent inhibition constant ( Kiapp) was defined as a slope replot intercept for the varied substrate. Oxazolidinones are known to inhibit the protein biosynthesis pathway (2Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Slee A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as well as the coupled transcription-translation reaction (4Shinabarger D.L. Marotti K.R. Murray R.W. Lin A.H. Melchior E.P. Swaney S.M. Dunyak D.S. Demyan W.F. Buysse J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To refine our understanding of the mechanism of oxazolidinone action, we examined their inhibitory activity in translation systems of various levels of complexity, ranging from mRNA-dependent translation to simple peptide bond formation. The luc+ mRNA translation assay was used to test whether oxazolidinones inhibit translation uncoupled from transcription. Inhibition curves for DuP 721, XA043, linezolid, and chloramphenicol (a non-oxazolidinone control) are shown in Fig.1. The data show that three oxazolidinones inhibit this reaction to different extents. Whereas one of the early oxazolidinones, DuP 721, shows little effect, the second generation inhibitor, XA043, is even more potent than linezolid. The observed incomplete inhibition may result from the presence of endogenous RNA templates in the reaction mix derived from the E. coli extracts. In addition, because the S-100 protein extract is the source of both translation factors and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the level of control over many components in this reaction (including substrates) is restricted. The poly(A)-dependent translation reaction was used to test elongation step components as possible targets for oxazolidinones. Poly(A), rather than poly(U), was chosen as the template because poly(U) translation is insensitive to well known elongation step inhibitors such as chloramphenicol and erythromycin (20Picking W.D. Odom O.W. Tsalkova T. Serdyuk I. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1534-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hall C.C. Bertasso A. Watkins J.D. Georgopapadakou N.H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1992; 45: 1697-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The poly(A) reaction, however, is sensitive to various translation elongation inhibitors including fusidic acid, kirromycin, tobramycin, sparsomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. None of the three oxazolidinones tested was inhibitory in this reaction (Fig.2). To distinguish between initiation factors and the peptidyltransferase site as possible targets, oxazolidinones were tested in puromycin reaction, an assay specific for peptide bond formation. In this reaction, 70 S ribosomes catalyze peptide bond formation using initiator fMet-tRNAfMet and puromycin as P- and A-site substrates, respectively, in buffer containing 30% MeOH to overcome the requirement for translation factors and mRNA. As seen in Fig. 3, the three oxazolidinones tested inhibit peptide bond formation in this assay. The fragment puromycin reaction is the simplest reaction catalyzed by ribosomal peptidyltransferase. Truncated N-protected aminoacylated oligonucleotides with a length of 3 or longer can serve as an alternative substrate to the complete initiator fMet-tRNAiMet in the puromycin reaction (22Kukhanova M. Streltsov S. Victorova L. Azhaeyev A. Gottikh B. Kraevsky A. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Bhuta P. Kumar G. Chladek S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 696: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). With this in mind, a partial P-site substrate that mimics the isoacceptor end of tRNA molecule aminoacylated with N-protected phenylalanine (CCA-Phe-X-biotin) was synthesized. This molecule was accepted as a substrate in the peptidyltransferase reaction, and known inhibitors blocked the reaction. As seen in Fig.4, oxazolidinones inhibit the fragment reaction with truncated P-site substrate. To probe further the mechanism of action of oxazolidinones, initial velocity studies as a function of inhibitor and substrate concentrations were conducted using the puromycin reaction. To select a valid substrate concentration range, apparent Kmapp values for both substrates were determined. Values of ∼0.01 μm for initiator fMet-tRNAiMet and ∼20 μm for puromycin were obtained. Fixing the puromycin (A-site substrate analog) concentration at saturating levels (150 μm), the initial velocity of reactions catalyzed by 70 S ribosomes in the presence of varying concentrations of initiator fMet-tRNAiMet (P-site substrate) at different concentrations of inhibitor was measured. The results of inhibition using XA043 are shown in Fig.5A. The pattern of lines in the reciprocal plot suggests that XA043 behaves as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the P-site substrate. The best fit of these data to various models of inhibition using nonlinear regression analysis by the Marquart-Levenburg algorithm confirmed this finding. A similar competitive pattern has been observed for linezolid (see Fig.5B). Replots of the reciprocal plot slopes and nonlinear least square fit yielded a Kmapp value for initiator tRNA of 0.015 ± 0.004 μm with Kiapp values of 36 ± 10 μm for XA043 and 83 ± 20 μm for linezolid. The puromycin reaction was used to examine the effect of inhibitors on the A-site. Oxazolidinones behave as competitive inhibitors of the A-site substrate as well (Fig. 6,A and B). Replots of the reciprocal plot slopes and nonlinear least square fit yielded a Kiapp value for puromycin of 15 ± 3 μm with Kiapp values of 10 ± 2 μm for XA043 and 29 ± 4 μm for linezolid. Thus, in any case oxazolidinones are competitive inhibitors with respect to initiator tRNA at the P-site and may also be competitive inhibitors of the A-site, if peptidyltransferase MeOH reaction has a random mechanism of action. Despite vigorous research efforts, the molecular target of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics has remained elusive (1Slee A.M. Wuonola M.A. McRipley R.J. Zajac I. Zavada M.J. Bartholomew P.T.

We previously reported on a genomic locus inLeptomonas collosoma that encodes for multiple C/D snoRNAs whose expression is regulated at the processing level (Xu, Y., Liu, L., Lopez-Estraño, C., and Michaeli, S.

Having a length of 69 nucleotides, h1 has the potential to guide pseudouridylation on 28 S rRNA. The h1 is processed from a long polycistronic transcript that carries both the C/D and h1 snoRNAs. The h1/rRNA duplex obeys the rules for guiding pseudouridylation. Mapping of the pseudouridine site indicated that the predicted U is indeed modified.

The most common modifications are conversion of uridine to pseudouridine (Ψ)1 and 2′-O-methylation of the backbone ribose. The function of the modified nucleotides is currently unknown. Most ribosomal pseudouridines and 2′-O-methyl groups are dispensable for cell growth. However, both pseudouridines and 2′-O-methyl nucleotides are clustered around the functionally important regions in the RNAs, suggesting their importance. Site-specific pseudouridylation and 2′-O-methylation of rRNA is directed by snoRNAs in the nucleolus (1Kiss-László Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T.

The snoRNAs that guide 2′-O-methylation carry two conserved boxes: the C (5′-RUGAUGA-3′), where R represents a purine (A or G), and D (5′-CUGA-3′) boxes, which often form a 5′–3′ terminal stem (1Kiss-László Z.

Fibrillarin shares common motifs with known methyltransferases and is likely to be the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the 2′-O-methyl nucleotide (4Smith C.M. Steitz J.A.

The D and/or D′ boxes are preceded by 10–21 nt that are a perfect match to the rRNA sequences. The modified nucleotide is always present 5 nt upstream to the D/D′ box. This is known as the +5 rule (1Kiss-László Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T.

Science. 1999; 283: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The maturation of most of the intron-encoded snoRNAs involves debranching of the lariat and exonucleolytic trimming (14Ooi S.L. Samarsky D.A. Fournier M.J. Boeke J.D.

The first study on trypanosome snoRNAs suggested that trypanosomes obey the +5 rule for snoRNA-mediated methylation (22Levitan A. Xu Y. Ben-Dov C. Ben-Shlomo H. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, studies carried out on snoRNAs that are located within the spliced leader-associated (SLA1) RNA loci in several trypanosomatid species suggested that trypanosomes do not obey the general methylation rules and indicated that the methylation site can have an alternate position located 6 or even 1 nt upstream to the D or D′ box (23Roberts T.G.

Further studies of T. brucei analyzing 17 C/D snoRNAs identified by immunoprecipitation using antibodies raised against the T. brucei fibrillarin protein concluded thatT. brucei obeys the +5 rule (24Dunbar D.A. Wormsley S. Lowe T.M. Baserga S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14767-14776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A more recent study performed on snoRNAs present in two clusters in Leptomonas collosoma suggested that the methylation-guiding rule of trypanosomatid snoRNA is not unusual; also L. collosomaobeys the +5 rule (26Xu Y.

As opposed to C/D snoRNAs, nothing is known about trypanosome H/ACA RNA.Cloning and sequencing of trypanosomatid snoRNA genes suggest that the snoRNAs are organized in clusters that carry single or multiple RNAs (22Levitan A.

Expression studies on snoRNA-2, which encodes for a single C/D snoRNA, suggest that expression of the gene, when cloned into the pXneo episomal vector, requires at least a 20-bp flanking sequence. However, expression of the tagged gene, although at a lower level, was detected in the absence of an upstream sequence, suggesting the lack of a conventional promoter adjacent to the gene. The expression of the snoRNA genes, however, is dependent on the transcription from the upstream episomal neo gene. Data obtained from transcription in permeable cells suggest that snoRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Interestingly all C/D snoRNAs are flanked by sequences that form a perfect stem structure. The significance of this stem for the processing of the snoRNA is currently unknown (26Xu Y. Liu L.

Liu L. Lopez-Estraño C. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14289-14298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Additional three C/D snoRNAs (B3, B4, and B5) and two copies of the first trypanosome H/ACA RNA, termed h1 RNA, were revealed. h1 is 69 nt long and can be folded into the canonical H/ACA RNA structure but consists of only a single hairpin structure rather than two hairpins connected by a single-stranded hinge and tail regions. However, h1 carries an AGA box at the 3′-end. Two short motifs of h1 in the internal loop base pair with the 28 S rRNA sequence flanking the target uridine. Mapping of the pseudouridines present in this region indicated that U3643 on 28 S rRNA, the predicted site, is indeed pseudouridylated. The h1 is present on the same polycistronic transcript that encodes for the C/D snoRNAs. Like the C/D snoRNAs, h1 is flanked by a stem structure. This is the first report on a trypanosome H/ACA RNA. h1 is the shortest H/ACA RNA described so far. All RNAs undergo post-transcriptional site-specific modifications. The most common modifications are conversion of uridine to pseudouridine (Ψ)1 and 2′-O-methylation of the backbone ribose. The function of the modified nucleotides is currently unknown. Most ribosomal pseudouridines and 2′-O-methyl groups are dispensable for cell growth. However, both pseudouridines and 2′-O-methyl nucleotides are clustered around the functionally important regions in the RNAs, suggesting their importance. Site-specific pseudouridylation and 2′-O-methylation of rRNA is directed by snoRNAs in the nucleolus (1Kiss-László Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T.

Cell. 1997; 89: 565-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The snoRNAs that guide 2′-O-methylation carry two conserved boxes: the C (5′-RUGAUGA-3′), where R represents a purine (A or G), and D (5′-CUGA-3′) boxes, which often form a 5′–3′ terminal stem (1Kiss-László Z.

Fibrillarin shares common motifs with known methyltransferases and is likely to be the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the 2′-O-methyl nucleotide (4Smith C.M. Steitz J.A.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Many snoRNAs also carry internal C′ and D′ boxes. The D and/or D′ boxes are preceded by 10–21 nt that are a perfect match to the rRNA sequences. The modified nucleotide is always present 5 nt upstream to the D/D′ box. This is known as the +5 rule (1Kiss-László Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Cell. 1996; 85: 1077-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). More relevant to this study are the snoRNAs that guide pseudouridylation. Structurally these snoRNAs consist of two hairpin domains connected by a single-stranded hinge, the H (ANANNA) domain, and a tail region, the ACA box. Two short rRNA recognition motifs of the snoRNA base pair with rRNA sequences flanking the uridine to be pseudouridylated. The Ψ is always located 14–16 nt upstream to the H or ACA box of the snoRNA (2Ganot P. Bortolin M.L. Kiss T.

Although the snoRNAs select the site to be modified on the target RNA, the snoRNP proteins may carry out the actual modification. Four H/ACA binding proteins have been identified: Gar1P, Cb5p (which shows striking structural similarities to pseudouridine synthase), Nhp2p, and Nop10p (5Bachellerie J.-P. Cavaille J. Qu L.-H.

Interestingly a nucleolar protein was identified inTrypanosoma brucei that may play a role in RNA metabolism in the nucleolus (11Das A. Peterson G.C. Kanner S.B. Frevert U. Parsons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15675-15681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In vertebrates many of the guide snoRNAs are encoded by introns of host genes that encode for proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and function (6Tollervey D. Kiss T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 12Weinstein L.B. Steitz J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In yeast, only a few snoRNAs are encoded by introns, and most of them are independently transcribed (13Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R. Science. 1999; 283: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The maturation of most of the intron-encoded snoRNAs involves debranching of the lariat and exonucleolytic trimming (14Ooi S.L. Samarsky D.A. Fournier M.J. Boeke J.D. RNA. 1998; 4: 1096-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The self-transcribed snoRNAs are processed from a precursor by endonucleolytic cleavage and exonucleolytic trimming (15Villa T. Ceradini F. Presutti C. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3376-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In yeast, two exonucleases, Rat1 and Xrn1, were shown to carry out 5′ to 3′ trimming (15Villa T. Ceradini F. Presutti C. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell.

A splicing-independent processing pathway that functions in processing clustered snoRNAs carrying both C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs operates in plants (20Leader D.J. Clark G.P. Watters J. Beven A.F. Shaw P.J. Brown J.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Trypanosomatids are protozoan parasites that diverged early in the eukaryotic lineage and possess unique RNA processing pathways such astrans-splicing and RNA editing. Trypanosome rRNAs undergo a nonconventional processing pathway that results in cleaving the 28 S rRNA into two large and six small rRNA fragments (21Campbell D.A. Kubo K. Clark C.G. Boothroyd J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Very little is known about ribosome biogenesis and modification in trypanosomatids. However, C/D snoRNAs were characterized in several trypanosomatid species (22Levitan A. Xu Y. Ben-Dov C. Ben-Shlomo H. Zhang Y. Michaeli S.

The first study on trypanosome snoRNAs suggested that trypanosomes obey the +5 rule for snoRNA-mediated methylation (22Levitan A. Xu Y. Ben-Dov C. Ben-Shlomo H. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, studies carried out on snoRNAs that are located within the spliced leader-associated (SLA1) RNA loci in several trypanosomatid species suggested that trypanosomes do not obey the general methylation rules and indicated that the methylation site can have an alternate position located 6 or even 1 nt upstream to the D or D′ box (23Roberts T.G.

Further studies of T. brucei analyzing 17 C/D snoRNAs identified by immunoprecipitation using antibodies raised against the T. brucei fibrillarin protein concluded thatT. brucei obeys the +5 rule (24Dunbar D.A. Wormsley S. Lowe T.M. Baserga S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14767-14776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A more recent study performed on snoRNAs present in two clusters in Leptomonas collosoma suggested that the methylation-guiding rule of trypanosomatid snoRNA is not unusual; also L. collosomaobeys the +5 rule (26Xu Y. Liu L. Lopez-Estraño C. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14289-14298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As opposed to C/D snoRNAs, nothing is known about trypanosome H/ACA RNA. Cloning and sequencing of trypanosomatid snoRNA genes suggest that the snoRNAs are organized in clusters that carry single or multiple RNAs (22Levitan A. Xu Y. Ben-Dov C. Ben-Shlomo H. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Xu Y. Liu L. Lopez-Estraño C. Michaeli S. J. Biol.

Expression studies on snoRNA-2, which encodes for a single C/D snoRNA, suggest that expression of the gene, when cloned into the pXneo episomal vector, requires at least a 20-bp flanking sequence. However, expression of the tagged gene, although at a lower level, was detected in the absence of an upstream sequence, suggesting the lack of a conventional promoter adjacent to the gene. The expression of the snoRNA genes, however, is dependent on the transcription from the upstream episomal neo gene. Data obtained from transcription in permeable cells suggest that snoRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Interestingly all C/D snoRNAs are flanked by sequences that form a perfect stem structure. The significance of this stem for the processing of the snoRNA is currently unknown (26Xu Y. Liu L. Lopez-Estraño C. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14289-14298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we have cloned and sequenced the entire repeat that was recently described (26Xu Y. Liu L. Lopez-Estraño C. Michaeli S. J. Biol.

Sequence similarity searches were used to identify two groups of homologues that were frequently arranged with prokaryotic methylmalonyl-CoA mutase genes, and that were of unknown function. Both gene groups had homologues in the human genome. Because methylmalonyl-CoA mutases are involved in the metabolism of propionyl-CoA, we inferred that conserved neighbors of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase genes and their human homologues were also involved in this process. Subsequent biochemical studies confirmed this inference by showing that the prokaryotic gene PH0272 and its human homologue both encode dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemases. To our knowledge this is the first report in which the function of a eukaryotic gene was determined based on the analysis of prokaryotic gene arrangements. Importantly, such analyses are rapid and may be generally applicable for the identification of human genes that lack homologues of known function or that have been misidentified on the basis of sequence similarity searches.

Hence, if the function of one gene in a conserved cluster is known, the remaining genes in that cluster can be inferred to function in the same metabolic process (1Bork P. Dandekar T. Diaz-Lazcoz Y.

Knowledge of a gene's metabolic role can lead to rapid assignment of specific function by focusing biochemical studies. Although such analyses appear inapplicable to eukaryotes (gene clustering is rare in these organisms), it should be possible to extrapolate the functional information obtained from the analysis of prokaryotic gene arrangements to eukaryotes by homology searches (Fig.1). To determine whether such analysis can in fact be used to rapidly determine the function of human genes, we investigated genes involved in propionyl-CoA metabolism. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes metabolize propionyl-CoA by a coenzyme B12-dependent pathway (6Banerjee R. Chowdhury S. Banerjee J. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley, New York1999: 707-730Google Scholar) (Fig.2). In humans, inborn errors in the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mcm) gene lead to methylmalonyl aciduria, a rare but severe inherited disease (7Rosenblatt D.S. Fenton W.A. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley, New York1999: 367-384Google Scholar). Defects in theCblABCDF complementation groups also lead to this disease (7Rosenblatt D.S. Fenton W.A. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley, New York1999: 367-384Google Scholar). These complementation groups are thought to encode enzymes needed for the conversion of hydroxy-B12 to coenzyme B12, the required cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM).1 In addition, defects in the dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase gene may also lead to methylmalonyl aciduria, as MCM is specific for thel-isomer of methylmalonyl-CoA (8Montgomery J.A. Mamer O.A. Scriver C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although themcm gene is known, the genes corresponding to theCblABCDF complementation groups and to thedl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase have not been identified. To identify additional human genes involved in propionyl-CoA metabolism, prokaryotic gene arrangements were examined. By these analyses, we identified the human dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase gene as well as a second human gene likely to be involved in propionyl-CoA metabolism, but of unknown function. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a eukaryotic gene that has been identified based on the analysis prokaryotic gene arrangements. Importantly, the method used is rapid and may be generally applicable for the identification of eukaryotic genes that lack homologues of known function or which have been misidentified on the basis of sequence similarity searches. Electrophoresis, bacterial transformation, restriction digestions, and other routine molecular and biochemical methods were performed as described previously (9Johnson C.L.V.J. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PCR was used to amplify the portion of the human racemase cDNA corresponding to its prokaryotic homologues. The primers used were GTGTGGAACCTGGGTCGACTGAACC and TCAAGCTTGCTCCAGTTCCACAAGGA, and the template used was a Marathon-ready human liver cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The enzyme used for amplification was Advantage 2 DNA polymerase mix (CLONTECH). The PCR product obtained was treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase to create blunt-ended DNA (10Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and cloned into the SmaI site of pGEM4z (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmid DNA isolated from one transformant was shown to have the expected DNA sequence. Subsequently, this clone was used as template for a second PCR amplification that employed primers GCCGCCAGATCTGGATGACGACGACAAGATGTGGAACCTGGGTCGACTC and GCCGCCAAGCTTTCAAGCTTGCTCCAGTTCCACAAGGA. These primers introduced an enterokinase site as well as BglII and HindIII restriction sites that allowed cloning into the protein expression vector, pET41a (Novagen, Cambridge, MA). The BglII site was positioned such that after cloning the dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase would be fused to N-terminal glutathioneS-transferase- and 6×His-tags encoded by the expression vector. The enterokinase site was positioned such that the portion of the human racemase homologous to its prokaryotic counterparts would be precisely released upon proteolysis (Fig.3). The DNA sequence of one clone derived from the second PCR product was verified, and the plasmid carrying this clone was transformed into the expression strainEscherichia coli BL21 DE3 RIL (Stratagene). One isolate obtained from this transformation (TA1002) was used for high level expression of the putative human racemase enzyme. PCR was used to amplify the P. horikoshii dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase coding sequence. The primers used were GCGATCAGATCTCATATGATATGGATGTTTAAGAGGATAGACCATGTTGG and GCGGAATTCGACGTTACTCTTTCCTTTCACATAGCTCCAGGAGC. These primers provided the BglII and EcoRI sites used for cloning the PCR product. The BglII site was positioned such that subsequent to cloning the native dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase was expressed via a T7 promoter and an idealized ribosome-binding site present on the expression vector. The template used for amplification was P. horikoshii genomic DNA obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and the enzyme used was Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product was cloned into the BglII and EcoRI sites of expression vector pTA925(9). Plasmid DNA isolated from one transformant was shown to have the expected DNA sequence. This DNA was transformed into the expression strain E. coli BL21 DE3 RIL. One isolate obtained from this transformation (TA1015) was used for high level expression of the native form of the putative P. horikoshii racemase enzyme. Protein expression strains were grown on LB supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Cells were grown to an optical density of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm. Then, expression of the target protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cultures were incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for an additional 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 3 ml of 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7, 300 mm NaCl, and broken using a French Pressure Cell (SLM Aminco, Urbana, IL). The cell lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 31,000 × gmaxusing a Beckman JA20 rotor. The supernatant from this centrifugation was the crude cell extract used for protein purification. dl-Methylmalonyl-CoA racemase activity was measured using a coupled assay. In this assay, racemase convertedd-methylmalonyl-CoA to l-methylmalonyl-CoA, which in turn was converted to succinyl-CoA by MCM, which is specific for the l-isomer (6Banerjee R. Chowdhury S. Banerjee J. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley, New York1999: 707-730Google Scholar). Racemase activity was quantified using HPLC to follow the disappearance of methylmalonyl-CoA using HPLC conditions described previously (11Demoz A. Garras A. Asiedu D.K. Netteland B. Berge R.K. J. Chromatogr. 1995; 667: 148-152Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures contained 50 mm potassium phosphate pH 7, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 75 μmdl-methylmalonyl-CoA, and 5.6 μg/ml holo-MCM. The holo-MCM was prepared by incubating the following mixture for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark: 0.56 μg/μl purified apo-MCM, 0.63 μm coenzyme B12, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. The specific activity of the holo-MCM used was >2 μmol/min/mg of protein. Assays were initiated by addition of holo-MCM and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. This depleted thel-methylmalonyl-CoA from the assay mixtures. After this initial 5-min incubation, a source of dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase was added, and incubation at 37 °C was continued for an additional 5 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 75 μl of 1m acetic acid. Samples were then frozen using a dry ice ethanol bath and stored at −20 °C until analyzed. To prevent photolysis of coenzyme B12, all manipulations were carried out in dim light. Crude cell extract, prepared as described above, was filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size filter, and 1 ml of filtered extract (32 mg of protein) was applied to a 1-ml Ni-NTA column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The column was used according to the manufacturer's instructions except that prior to elution, the column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer containing 40 mmimidazole. The eluate from the Ni-NTA column was further processed using a 2-ml column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Upsalla, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The partially purified racemase from the glutathione affinity column was concentrated and exchanged into buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 using a Vivaspin 4 centrifugal concentrator (Viva Science, Binbrook, UK). The concentrated racemase preparation (500 μl, 385 μg of protein) was combined with 14.5 units of recombinant enterokinase (Novagen) and incubated at 20 °C for 16 h. Recombinant enterokinase was removed using enterokinase capture agarose (Novagen). Then, the racemase preparation was applied to a 1 ml of Ni-NTA column, which was eluted with 5 ml of equilibration buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The fusion tags and the uncut fusion protein remained bound to the column. The purified racemase was found in the column pass-through and eluate, which were concentrated, exchanged into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, and stored at 4 °C until analyzed. The GenBankTM accession number for Homo sapiens methylmalonyl-CoA racemase cDNA is AF364547. The GenBankTM accession number for P. horikoshii methylmalonyl-CoA racemase coding sequence isAF364548. Prokaryotes often cluster genes involved in the same metabolic process (1Bork P. Dandekar T. Diaz-Lazcoz Y. Eisenhaber F. Huynen M. Yuan Y. J. Mol.

Therefore, to identify additional genes involved in propionyl-CoA metabolism, we searched for genes that frequently cluster with prokaryotic mcm genes (Fig. 1). The first step employed was to identify prokaryotes that had bothmcm homologues and completed genome sequences. Blast searches (12Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68215) Google Scholar) of the NCBI nonredundant (nr) data base identified 16 prokaryotes that had homologues (Expect values ≤7 × 10−11) of the human mcm gene. For eight of these, complete genome sequences were available. These included three Bacteria (Deinococcus radiodurans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and E. coli) and five Archaea (Archaeoglobus fulgidus, P. horikoshii, Pyrococcus abyssi, Aeropyrum pernix, and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1). Next, the chromosomal contexts of the mcm genes in these eight prokaryotes were determined. Blastp software was used to identify the homologues of ten genes on each side of the mcm gene. Then, it was determined whether these homologues also clustered withmcm genes by examining the protein tables available through Entrez Genomes (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/micr.html). By these analyses, two conserved neighbors of prokaryotic mcm genes were identified: genes with homology to lactoylglutathione (LGSH) lyases were neighbors of mcm genes in 5/8 prokaryotic genomes and in 4/5 Archaeal genomes examined, and genes with homology to lysine/arginine/ornithine (LAO) transport proteins were found nearmcm homologues in 8/8 cases. These gene arrangements suggested that certain proteins with homology to LGSH lyases and LAO transporters were misidentified by homology searches and actually encode proteins involved in propionyl-CoA metabolism. Next we sought to identify the human homologues of prokaryotic LGSH lyases and LAO transporters. TheP. horikoshii protein gi7448629 (an LGSH lyase homologue) was used to query the human genome with tBlastn software (12Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68215) Google Scholar). This prokaryotic sequence aligned with peptides encoded by two regions of chromosome II that likely corresponded to exons of the homologous human gene. However, the 5′ exon identified did not include the expected ATG, suggesting that one or more exons remained to be detected. Hence, we compared the two exons that were found to the expressed sequence tag data base using Blastn software. This allowed the identification of several apparent full-length human cDNAs that included appropriate ATGs, Kozac consensus sequences for ribosome binding, and triplets corresponding to stop codons. Subsequent analyses showed that the full-length human cDNA (af364547) corresponded to three exons on chromosome II and encoded a protein homologous to the P. horikoshii LGSH lyase homologue with an Expect value of 2 × 10−21 (Fig. 3). Thus, a human LGSH lyase homologue was identified. Because the P. horikoshii LGSH lyase homologue is a conserved neighbor of mcm genes, we inferred that theP. horikoshii gene and its human homologue are both involved in propionyl-CoA metabolism. The full-length human cDNA identified above encoded a protein with about 40 N-terminal amino acids not found in its prokaryotic homologues (Fig. 3). In humans, propionyl-CoA metabolism occurs in the mitochondrion (7Rosenblatt D.S. Fenton W.A. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley, New York1999: 367-384Google Scholar),and the additional amino acids of human protein would be needed for mitochondrial targeting. MitoProt II and Predotar protein localization prediction software supported mitochondrial localization for the human LGSH lyase homologue with scores of 0.95 and 0.99, respectively (www.inra.fr/Internet/Produits/Predotar/) (15Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 770-786Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Thus, these results are consistent with the prediction that the human homologue of LGSH lyase genes was misidentified by the homology searches employed and in fact encoded a protein involved in propionyl-CoA metabolism. To identify the human homologue of prokaryotic LAO transport proteins, a procedure similar to that described above for identification of the human LGSH lyase homologue was employed. The longest human cDNA identified (gi: 12914481) was a partial sequence that represented four exons on chromosome IV. The protein encoded by this cDNA aligned with the M. tuberculosis LAO transporter (gi: 3915555) over the greater portion of its length (263/334) with an Expect value of 3 × 10−33 using Blastx software. Because the human cDNA was incomplete at the 5′ end, the possibility of a mitochondrial targeting sequence could not be examined. Nonetheless, the cDNA identified represents a probable human LAO transporter homologue. Thus, two human genes were identified that were homologous to conserved neighbors of prokaryotic mcm genes. We inferred that these human genes were involved in propionyl-CoA metabolism. Unidentified genes thought to function in this process include those that encodedl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemases as well as those that encode enzymes needed to convert hydroxy-B12 to coenzyme B12. Accordingly, we focused further studies on determining whether the human cDNAs identified encoded such enzymes. Adl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase was previously purified from rat liver and was found to be composed of two 16-kDa polypeptides (16Stabler S.P. Marcell P.D. Allen R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Given that the LGSH lyase homologues have similar predicted molecular masses (15 kDa for the P. horikoshii homologue), we hypothesized that LGSH lyase homologues that cluster withmcm genes were misidentified by homology searches and actually encode dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase. Furthermore, we predicted that the human LGSH lyase homologue was also adl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase. To determine whether the human LGSH lyase homologue identified above was in fact adl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase, cDNAs corresponding to the full-length predicted human racemase and to the portion of the racemase homologous to its prokaryotic counterparts were cloned into a T7 expression system that allows high level expression of proteins inE. coli. Both cDNA clones were prepared, because some enzymes are known to be inactive until their targeting sequences are proteolytically cleaved. Neither clone expressed significant amounts of a protein of the expected molecular mass. Subsequently, the clone encoding the portion of the human racemase homologous to the prokaryotic protein was cloned into a T7 expression plasmid so as to provide N-terminal glutathione S-transferase- and 6xHis-tags (Fig. 3, bottom). The resulting plasmid (pTA1002) expressed high levels of a fusion protein of the expected molecular mass (∼45 kDa) and was used for further studies. The protein produced from plasmid pTA1002 was shown to havedl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase activity. Following nickel affinity chromatography, extracts derived from cells containing the expression plasmid with the cDNA clone (strain TA1002, Fig.4, lane 3) contained high levels of racemase activity (60 μmol/min/mg of protein). In contrast, no racemase activity was observed in similarly prepared cell extracts derived from cells containing vector without insert (strain TA1004). This indicated that the cloned cDNA encoded a functionaldl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase. The racemase reaction requirements were investigated. As expected, no racemase activity was observed without the addition of partially purified racemase, methylmalonyl-CoA, MCM, or coenzyme B12. MCM and coenzyme B12 are required components, because the racemase assay involves coupled enzymatic reaction. The predicted human racemase was then purified using several affinity chromatography steps as well as enterokinase cleavage of the racemase fusion protein. The site of enterokinase cleavage is shown in Fig. 3. The progress of the purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining (Fig. 4). The specific activity of the racemase increased at each step of the purification (Table I). The final specific activity of the highly purified racemase was 833 μmol/min/mg of protein. This activity is within the range previously reported for dl-methylmalonyl racemases purified from other sources. dl-Methylmalonyl-CoA racemase previously purified from Propionibacterium shermanii had a specific activity of 33.4 or 607.5 μmol/min/mg of protein depending on the purification protocol used (17Allen S.G.H. Kellermeyer R. Stjernholm R. Jacobson B. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1637-1642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Leadlay P.F. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase purified from rat liver had a specific activity of 8400 μmol/min/mg of protein (16Stabler S.P. Marcell P.D. Allen R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the findings presented above constitute strong evidence that one of the two human genes identified as a conserved neighbor of prokaryotic mcm genes encodes adl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase rather than an LGSH lyase as would be suggested by homology searches.Table IPurification of the human DL-methylmalonyl-CoA racemasePurification stepTotal proteinTotal activityYieldSpecific activitymgμmol/min%μmol/min/mgCell-free extract32NDNDNickel affinity chromatography 3.2 192 100 60Glutathione affinity chromatography 1.5 132 69 88Cleavage/capture and nickel affinity chromatography 0.084 70 36 833ND, not determined. dl-Methylmalonyl-CoA racemase activity could not be accurately determined in cell extracts due to a nonspecific activity that degraded methylmalonyl-CoA. Open table in a new tab ND, not determined. dl-Methylmalonyl-CoA racemase activity could not be accurately determined in cell extracts due to a nonspecific activity that degraded methylmalonyl-CoA. To obtain further evidence that certain LGSH lyase homologues are in fact dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemases, the predicted P. horikoshii racemase gene was cloned into a T7 expression vector. This clone mediated expression of a large amount of protein near the expected molecular mass, 15 kDa (not shown). Partially purified cell extracts were prepared by anion exchange chromatography, and those derived from cells containing the expression plasmid with insert (strain TA1015) contained racemase enzyme with a specific activity of 93 μmol/min/mg of protein. In contrast, no racemase activity was observed in cell extracts derived from cells containing vector without insert (strain BE119). This indicated that the clonedP. horikoshii gene encoded adl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase. These findings provided evidence that LGSH lyase homologues neighboring mcm genes were misidentified by homology searches and actually encodedl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemases. In addition, they provide confirmatory evidence that the human clone described above also encodes a dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase. In this report, we sought to determine whether the analysis of prokaryotic gene arrangements could be used to help determine the function of human genes. Sequence similarity searching identified two genes of unknown function that were conserved neighbors of prokaryoticmcm genes and that had human homologues. Because MCMs are involved in propionyl-CoA metabolism, we inferred that conserved neighbors of mcm genes and their human homologues were also involved in this process, and we used this knowledge to guide biochemical tests. Subsequently, we showed that one conserved neighbor (PH0272) and its human homologue both encodeddl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemases. The purified human racemase had a specific activity of 833 μmol/min/mg of protein, which is comparable with the specific activity ofdl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemases purified from other sources (see above) (16Stabler S.P. Marcell P.D. Allen R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Allen S.G.H. Kellermeyer R. Stjernholm R. Jacobson B. Wood H.G. J. Biol.

These findings constitute strong evidence that the human gene corresponding to cDNA af364547 is indeed adl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase gene. Thus, a previously unknown human gene was rapidly identified based on the analysis of prokaryotic gene arrangements. The human dl-methylmalonyl-CoA racemase gene has been implicated in the inherited disorder methylmalonyl aciduria (although this is uncertain, since a bypass pathway ofd-methylmalonyl-CoA racemization may exist in mammals) (8Montgomery J.A. Mamer O.A. Scriver C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the analysis of prokaryotic gene arrangements has the potential to allow the rapid identification of human genes involved in inherited metabolic disorders. Importantly, the prediction that a given gene is involved in a particular inherited disease does not require the determination of its biochemical function. Such predictions require only knowledge that a gene is involved in a particular metabolic process, and this information can be obtained directly from the bioinformatic analysis of gene arrangements. We also identified a second gene of unknown function that was a conserved neighbor of mcm genes and that had homology to a human gene. This gene had homology to those that encode LAO transport proteins. The function of this gene has not yet been determined. We suspect that it is not involved in lysine/arginine/ornithine transport. It may have a role in the conversion of hydroxy-B12 to coenzyme B12, or in the reactivation of MCM, as genes encoding such enzymes have been shown to cluster with genes encoding other coenzyme B12-dependent enzymes (9Johnson C.L.V.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32034-32041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Attempts to determine the function of this gene with biochemical tests were hampered by the fact that overexpression resulted in inclusion body formation under all conditions tested. 2T. A. Bobik and M. E. Rasche, unpublished data. Nonetheless, the potential involvement of this gene in methylmalonyl aciduria is testable given its DNA sequence even without knowledge of its specific biochemical function. It was expected that several genes involved in the conversion of vitamin B12 to hydroxy-B12 would be identified by the gene arrangement analyses reported herein. As mentioned above, only one candidate was found and its function was not verified. There are several possible reasons why the genes for such enzymes were not found. We feel the most likely reason is that some of the genes involved in the conversion of hydroxy-B12 to coenzyme B12 have functions in addition to propionyl-CoA metabolism that dictate alternative gene arrangements. Last, we point out that the analysis of prokaryotic gene arrangements may have broad application for the identification of human genes. Potentially, the method is applicable to any physiological process that is shared between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This includes many aspects of metabolism, transcription, translation, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Furthermore, the method may prove valuable for the identification of genes involved processes currently thought to be distinctively eukaryotic.

To access the molecular function of AMY-1, a two-hybrid screening of cDNAs encoding AMY-1-binding proteins was carried out with AMY-1 as a bait using a human HeLa cDNA library, and a clone encoding cAMP-dependent protein kinase anchor protein 149 (AKAP149), was obtained. AMY-1 was found to bind in vitro and in vivo to the regulatory subunit II binding region of AKAP149 and S-AKAP84, a splicing variant of AKAP149 expressed in the testis. AMY-1 was expressed postmeiotically in the testis, as S-AKAP84 was expressed. Furthermore, S-AKAP84 and regulatory subunit II, a regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, made a ternary complex in cells, and AMY-1 was localized in the mitochondria of HeLa and sperm in association with AKAP149 and S-AKAP84, respectively. These results suggest that AMY-1 plays a role in spermatogenesis. We have reported that a novel c-Myc-binding protein, AMY-1 (associate of Myc-1), stimulated the transcription activity of c-Myc.

Tamai Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 551-567Google Scholar). Two mRNAs, AMY-1S and AMY-1L, which are derived from the alternative usage of poly(A) adenylation signals, encode the same protein, AMY-1 (1Taira T. Maëda J. Onishi T. Kitaura H. Yoshida S. Kato H. Ikeda M. Tamai Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 551-567Google Scholar). AMY-1 was found to be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus only during the S phase of the cell cycle along with c-Myc, suggesting that AMY-1 is a co-activator for c-Myc (3Trendelenburg G. Hummel M. Riecken E.O. Hanski C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, AMY-1, in contrast to c-myc, was found to be a stimulating factor for the initial step in the erythrocyte differentiation of human K562 cells (2Furusawa M. Onishi T. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 339-345PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that AMY-1 is a trigger for K562 cells to differentiate into erythrocyte cells and that AMY-1 has a function independent of or different from c-Myc. The molecular mechanism of AMY-1 function, however, remains to be clarified. To elucidate the functions of AMY-1, a two-hybrid screening of cDNAs encoding AMY-1-binding proteins was carried out, and AKAP149, an anchor protein of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 (3Trendelenburg G. Hummel M. Riecken E.O. Hanski C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), was identified as an AMY-1-binding protein. AKAP is a protein that translocates PKA to the specific sites where the individual PKA works. Of the AKAPs, AKAP149 and its splicing variant, S-AKAP84 (4Lin R.Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), have been found to anchor PKA to the mitochondria to phosphorylate the target proteins. The results showed that AMY-1 is localized in mitochondria of HeLa and sperm along with AKAP149 and S-AKAP84, respectively, suggesting that the function of AMY-1 is related to spermatogenesis. Human HeLa and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. The cDNA containing the full size of AKAP149, pBS-AKAP149, was provided by C. Hanski. For pGLex-AMY-1, AMY-1 cDNA starting from the first ATG was inserted in frame into theEcoRI-XhoI sites of pGLex, a modified version of the LexA-derived bait vector for yeast two-hybrid screening (5Ono T.

For pcDNA3-F-AMY-1 and pcDNA3-F-S-AKAP84, AMY-1 cDNA and S-AKAP84 cDNA starting from the first ATG were inserted intoEcoRI-XhoI sites of pCMV-F, a pcDNA3 containing FLAG tag (6Mori K. Maëda Y.

For pcDNA3-RIIβ-HA, RIIβ cDNA was inserted into EcoRI-NotI sites of pcDNA3-HA (6Mori K. Maëda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 cells containing the lacZ gene driven by the GAL1 promoter were transformed first with pGLex-AMY-1, which did not activate lacZtranscription by itself. The transformant cells were subsequently transformed with human HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA (CLONTECH), a cDNA library expressing the GAL4 activation domain (GALAD) fused to the cDNAs from human HeLa cells. Approximately 5.6 × 106colonies were screened for lacZ expression, and the results indicated the association of a GALAD-fused protein with LexABD-fused AMY-1. The plasmid DNAs in the lacZ-positive cells were extracted by the procedure described in the protocols fromCLONTECH. Nucleotide sequences of the plasmids derived from positive colonies were determined by using an ABI377 or Li-Cor Long Reader 4200 autosequencer. 35S-Labeled S-AKAP84 was synthesized in vitro using the reticulocyte lysate of the TnT-transcription-translation coupled system (Promega). Labeled proteins were mixed with GST or GST-AMY-1 expressed in and prepared from Escherichia coli at 4 °C for 60 min in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After washing with the same buffer, the bound proteins were separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and visualized by fluorography. Ten μg of pcDNA3-F-S-AKAP84 together with 10 μg of pEF-AMY-1-HA was transfected into human 293T cells 60% confluent in a 10-cm dish by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (7Graham F.L. Vander Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, the whole cell extract was prepared by the procedure described previously (1Taira T. Maëda J. Onishi T. Kitaura H. Yoshida S. Kato H. Ikeda M. Tamai Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 551-567Google Scholar). Approximately 500 μg of the 293T cell proteins was first immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) or with nonspecific mouse IgG under the same conditions as those of thein vitro binding assay as described above. After washing with the same buffer except for 0.05% instead of 0.25% Nonidet P-40, the precipitates were separated in a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and reacted with a rabbit anti-HA antibody (Y11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or with the mouse anti-FLAG antibody. The human HeLa cells were fixed with a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and reacted with a rabbit anti-AMY-1 polyclonal antibody synthesized against the peptide corresponding to amino acid numbers 343–370, a mouse anti-AKAP149 antibody (clone 6; Transduction Laboratories), or nonimmune antiserum. The cells were then reacted with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or AMCA-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and observed under a fluorescent microscope. At the same time, the mitochondria in cells were stained with MitoTracker Red CM-H2Xros (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The ejaculated human sperm was collected onto a cover glass by centrifugation and stained as described above. Total testis RNAs were prepared by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method, and cDNA was synthesized using the oligo(dT) primer and BcaBEST polymerase (Takara Co., Ltd). The first strand of cDNA products was amplified with specific primers for the first 5 min at 94 °C and then for 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The nucleotide sequences of the sense and antisense primers were as follows: mouse c-myc sense, 5′-GGGCCAGCCCTGAGCCCCTAGTGC-3′; mouse c-myc antisense, 5′-ATGGAGATGAGCCCGACTCCGACC-3′; c-kit sense, 5′-GAGCTACCTGGGCAATCACATGAAT-3′; c-kit antisense, 5′-GTTTCTGCTCAGGCATCTTCGTGCA-3′; acrosin sense, 5′-GCCTCCTGAACTCCCACTG-3′; Acrosin antisense, 5′-TGTGGGGTATTTCGGGGAG-3′; protamine-1 sense, 5′-AGGTTGGCTGGCTCGACC-3′; Protamine-1 antisense, 5′-GCAGGAGTTTTGATGGAC-3′; β-actin sense, 5′-TACCACGGGCATTGTGATGG-3′; β-actin antisense, 5′-GATCTTGATCTTCATGGTGC-3′. The amplified products were separated on 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. To screen cDNAs encoding AMY-1-associating proteins, a full-size AMY-1 starting from amino acid number 1 was fused to the LexA-DNA binding domain and introduced into S. cerevisiae L40 cells. A human HeLa cDNA library cloned in pGADGH was then introduced into the transformant yeast cells, and the colonies resistant to aHis marker followed by β-galactosidase expression were selected. Among a total of 5.6 × 106 transformant cells, 79 colonies were His- and β-galactosidase-positive, and four of the 79 positive colonies were identified as AKAP149, a PKA anchor protein, after determination of their nucleotide sequences. Since the longest clone contained amino acids 253–903 of AKAP149, the full-size AKAP149 cDNA was kindly provided by C. Hanski. S-AKAP84 is a splicing variant of AKAP149 and contains the same amino acids spanning 1–530 as does AKAP149 (3Trendelenburg G. Hummel M. Riecken E.O. Hanski C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Both proteins are composed of at least three domains (an anchor region, a leucine zipper-like (LZ) region, and an RII-binding (RIIbd) region), and AKAP149 additionally contains a KH domain (Fig. 1A). To determine the AMY-1-binding region of AKAP149 or S-AKAP84, various deletion constructs fused to the GALAD were used for the two-hybrid assay with AMY-1 as bait (Fig. 1A). The wild-types of both AKAP149 and S-AKAP84 bound to AMY-1, and the C-terminal half-fragment spanning amino acids 531–903 of AKAP149 did not bind to AMY-1, suggesting that the same amino acids present in AKAP149 and S-AKAP84 contribute to the AMY-1 binding activity. The fragment spanning amino acids 253–530 was found to be sufficient for AMY-1 binding. Furthermore, deletion of the RII binding region (AK253–530ΔRIIbd) but not LZ (AK253–530ΔLZ) from this fragment abolished AMY-1 binding activity, indicating that AMY-1 binds to the RII binding region both in AKAP149 and S-AKAP84. Anin vitro binding assay was then performed by using a35S-labeled AMY-1-binding fragment of S-AKAP84 synthesizedin vitro with GST-AMY-1 expressed in and prepared fromE. coli. After GST-AMY-1 or GST trapped in glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin had been mixed with labeled proteins, the bound proteins were separated on gel and visualized by fluorography (Fig. 1B). As in the case of binding in yeast, the fragment spanning amino acids 253–530 of S-AKAP84 bound to GST-AMY-1, while the fragment in which the RII binding region had been deleted did not have binding activity toward GST-AMY-1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2), and no bindings of two proteins to GST alone were observed (Fig. 1B, lanes 3and 4). To observe the complex formation of S-AKAP84 with AMY-1 in vivo, expression vectors for FLAG-tagged S-AKAP84 and its deletion fragments together with HA-tagged AMY-1 were transfected into human 293T cells. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cell extract was prepared, and the proteins in the extract were first immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody or nonspecific IgG. The precipitates were immunoblotted against the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1C). The anti-FLAG antibody did precipitate FLAG-S-AKAP84 (data not shown). AMY-1-HA, on the other hand, was detected in the immunoprecipitate from wild-type S-AKAP84-transfected cells with the anti-HA antibody but not with IgG (Fig. 1C,lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Furthermore, the fragment spanning amino acids 253–530, but not that in which the RII-binding region had been deleted, of S-AKAP84 was again found to bind to AMY-1 (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). These results indicate that AMY-1 is associated with the RII-binding region of S-AKAP84 in ectopic expressed 293T cells. Since S-AKAP84 has been reported to be expressed in testis and to be related to spermatogenesis, Northern blot analysis of AMY-1 expression was carried out using a multiple tissue bolt filter to see its expression profile (Fig. 2A). AMY-1S and S-AKAP84 mRNAs were found to be strongly expressed in the testis, while AMY-1L, a variant of alternative usage of the poly(A) signal of AMY-1S, and AKAP149, a splicing variant of S-AKAP84, were ubiquitously expressed in tissues. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNAs was then carried out to examine the timing of expression of AMY-1S and S-AKAP84 during spermatogenesis using total RNAs extracted from the mice testis at various days after birth (Fig. 2B). Specific primers for the amplification of mRNAs of c-kit, acrosin, and protamine-1 were used to identify the times at which the expressions of spermatogonia, spermatocyte, and spermatid started (8Sorrentino V. Giorgi M. Geremia R. Besmer P. Rossi P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 149-151PubMed Google Scholar, 9Florke S. Phi-van L. Muller-Esterl W. Scheuber H.P. Engel W.

Dev. 1989; 1: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), respectively. The results showed that AMY-1S began to be weakly expressed in 2-week-old mice and was strongly expressed after the expression of spermatid, during which time S-AKAP84 was expressed. On the other hand, c-myc was found to be expressed from the time of spermatogonia. These results indicate coordinate expression between AMY-1S and S-AKAP84. Since AKAP binds to RII of PKA in order to be translocated to a specific site in cells (11Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), it is possible that AMY-1 is in a complex with RII. Two isoforms of RII, RIIα and RIIβ, have been reported, and RIIβ was used in this experiment. To determine whether the above possibility is true, the expression vectors for FLAG-AMY-1, T7-S-AKAP84, and RIIβ-HA were transfected into 293T cells in various combinations. Forty-eight h after transfection, the proteins in cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, and the precipitated proteins were blotted with the anti-FLAG antibody to detect FLAG-AMY-1 or with an anti-HA antibody to detect RIIβ-HA (Fig.3A). First, the expressions of the introduced proteins were examined by Western blotting using respective antibodies, and T7-S-AKAP84, RIIβ-HA, and FLAG-AMY-1 were detected (Fig. 3A, a, lanes 1 and 3 and lanes 2 and3, respectively). Expression of FLAG-AMY-1 was also detected (data not shown). Although the anti-FLAG antibody precipitated the introduced FLAG-AMY-1 in three sets of cells at similar levels, RIIβ-HA was coprecipitated in cells cotransfected with T7-S-AKAP84 but not without T7-S-AKAP84 (Fig. 3A, b,lanes 2 and 3, respectively). These results indicate that RIIβ is associated with AMY-1 via S-AKAP84. The formation of a ternary complex of AMY-1, S-AKAP84, and RIIβ was further examined in mouse AM416 cells, which are mouse NIH3T3 cells expressing exogenously added AMY-1-HA as described previously (1Taira T. Maëda J. Onishi T. Kitaura H. Yoshida S. Kato H. Ikeda M. Tamai Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 551-567Google Scholar). AM416 cells were transfected with a constant amount of FLAG-S-AKAP84 and with various doses of RIIβ-HA, and cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection. Expression levels of introduced FLAG-S-AKAP84, RIIβ-HA, and AMY-1-HA were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B, a). The proteins in the extract were then immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody, and the precipitates were blotted with the anti-HA antibody (Fig.3B, b). Two or three bands of RIIβ-HA were observed in trasfected cells. Faster migrating bands may be degradation products of RIIβ-HA, and the similar patterns of RIIβ have been reported in human testis (12Reiton N. Collas P. Haugen T.B. Skalhegg B.S. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Taskén K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The result showed that RIIβ-HA was coprecipitated with the S-AKAP84-AMY-1 complex in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that RIIβ and AMY-1 mutually, but not competitively, bound to the RII-binding region of S-AKAP84. Previous studies have shown that AMY-1 was usually located in the cytoplasm and translocated from the cytoplasm to nuclei only during the S phase of the HeLa cell upon the expression of c-Myc (1Taira T. Maëda J. Onishi T. Kitaura H. Yoshida S. Kato H. Ikeda M. Tamai Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 551-567Google Scholar) and that S-AKAP84 was localized in the mitochondria of HeLa, elongating spermatid (4Lin R.Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and mature sperm (12Reiton N. Collas P. Haugen T.B. Skalhegg B.S. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Taskén K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine the cellular localization of AKAP149/S-AKAP84 and AMY-1 more precisely, human HeLa cells and the ejaculated human sperm were stained with anti-AMY-1 and anti-AKAP149/S-AKAP84 antibodies, and the proteins were detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate- and AMCA-conjugated second antibodies, respectively, and then visualized under a confocal laser microscopy (Fig. 4). Mitochondria were also stained with MitoTracker, which gives a red color. In HeLa cells, AMY-1 (green), AKAP149 (blue), and mitochondria (red) were co-localized as shown by the white color (Fig. 4A, Overlay). In sperm, both AMY-1 and S-AKAP84/AKAP149 were localized in the neck of the sperm, which was identified as mitochondria by MitoTracker staining, and these three were colocalized as shown by the white color (Fig. 4B, Overlay). To distinguish which AKAP, S-AKAP84 or AKAP149, is located in the ejaculated human sperm and HeLa cells, proteins extracted were blotted with the anti-AKAP149/S-AKAP84 antibody and with an anti-actin antibody as an internal control (Fig. 5). Results clearly showed that S-AKAP84 was strongly expressed and a faint amount of AKAP149 was expressed in sperm (Fig. 5, lane 2). In HeLa cells, on the other hand, only AKAP149 was expressed (Fig. 5, lane 1). These results clearly show that AMY-1 is colocalized with AKAP149 or S-AKAP84 in the mitochondria of HeLa cells or sperm, respectively.Figure 5Expressions of AKAP149/S-AKAP84 mRNAs in human HeLa cells and sperm. Proteins were extracted from human HeLa cells or the ejaculated human sperm with the radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS. Fifty μg of proteins were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, blotted with an anti-AKAP149/S-AKAP84 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), and visualized by ECL.

It has also been reported that an inhibitor of PKA inhibits and that an inhibitor of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase stimulates both tyrosine phosphorylation and fertilization, suggesting that PKA plays a crucial role in tyrosine-phosphorylation-mediated fertilization (18Leclerc P. de Lamirande E. Gagnon C. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 19Leclerc P. de Lamirande E. Gagnon C. Free Rad. Biol.

It has been shown that AKAP determines the place where PKA works in cells and that S-AKAP84 and AKAP149 anchor PKA to the mitochondria in spermatid, sperm, and various somatic cells, respectively (3Trendelenburg G. Hummel M. Riecken E.O. Hanski C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Lin R.Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that AMY-1 was located in the mitochondria in sperm and HeLa cells in a complex with S-AKAP84/AKAP149 and RIIβ and that both AMY-1 and S-AKAP84 were expressed after the appearance of spermatocytes in the testis, while the expression profile of c-myc during spermatogenesis was not parallel with that of AMY-1. These results suggest that AMY-1 plays a role independent of that of c-Myc in spermatogenesis. In addition to the functions of S-AKAP84 in spermatogenesis, it has been reported that S-AKAP84/AKAP149 may be involved in apoptosis regulation by anchoring PKA to mitochondria in which the unphosphorylated active form of BAD, a protein for proapoptosis, is bound to Bcl-XL, an antiapoptosis protein, to be inactivated. After BAD is phosphorylated by PKA in mitochondria, the phosphorylated inactive form of BAD is translocated to the cytoplasm and binds to 14-3-3 protein, thereby leading to the free active form of Bcl-XL that functions as an antiapoptosis protein (21Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M. Huang L.J. Taylor S.S. Scott J.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 2: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice carrying overexpressing AMY-1 are apt to become infertile (data not shown). Although the precise mechanisms of the AMY-1 function in testis are not clear at present, it is possible that AMY-1 affects the apoptosis of spermatogenesis-related proteins by modification of PKA anchored by S-AKAP84. Furthermore, since AMY-1 and RIIβ were found to bind mutually to the RII-binding region of S-AKAP84/AKAP149, which spans 22 amino acids, it is possible that both proteins bind to the same surface of the RII-binding region side by side or that each protein binds to the opposite surface of the RII-binding region of S-AKAP84/AKAP149. To examine these possibilities, structural analysis of the complex containing AMY-1 is now being carried out. We are grateful to C. Hanski for the cDNA of AKAP149. We also thank Yoko Misawa and Kiyomi Takaya for technical assistance."

The PC12 and epithelial cell culture models were used to determine the molecular mechanism by which CD induces apoptosis. Our data indicate that CD leads to both growth arrest and apoptosis in a subpopulation of cells, which correlate with the up-regulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and concurrent up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1. Additionally, CD induced both a G1/S and a G2/M arrest. Transient transfection of a dominant negative p53 (p53DN) construct into PC12 cells, which inhibited endogenous p53 activation, significantly reduced the induction of apoptosis associated with CD. Interestingly, CD also induced the persistent activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Activation of NF-κB has been shown to promote cell survival and proposed to antagonize p53. Consistent with this, expression of a super-repressor form of IκBα (SR-IκBα) that functions to strongly inhibit NF-κB activation, profoundly enhanced cell death during CD. In summary, these results suggest that the effects of CD on apoptosis and subsequent cell survival are mediated through two different signaling pathways, p53 and NF-κB, respectively. Taken together, our data demonstrates the induction of opposing mechanisms associated with nutrient deficiency that may provide a molecular mechanism by which CD promotes carcinogenesis.

Although CD is associated with many pathological effects, the molecular mechanism(s) by which CD exerts these effects has not yet been elucidated. Apoptosis is a physiological cell death mechanism that occurs during development, in response to cell damage, and in response to external stress (17Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis is a multi-step mechanism that includes tightly regulated signal transduction pathways involving protease activation. In several cases, the induction of apoptosis is associated with activation of p53, a transcription factor sensitive to cellular stress (18Yin Y. Terauchi Y. Solomon G.G. Aizawa S. Rangarajan P.N.

Additionally, p53 functions to induce growth arrest in part by activating the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1(19El-Diery W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M.O. Velculescu V.E. Canmam C.E. Jackman J.

Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).

Following induction of nuclear translocation by exposure of cells to stimuli including inflammatory mediators, NF-κB regulates the expression of genes encoding cytokines, cytokine receptors, and cell adhesion molecules (23Karin M.

This control of inflammatory gene expression likely explains the association of NF-κB activation with inflammatory diseases such as arthritis (26Miagkov A.V. Kovalenko D.V. Brown C.E. Didsbury J.R.

Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2323-2330PubMed Google Scholar). More recently the activation of NF-κB was shown to be associated with the regulation of cell growth through the induction of genes such as c-myc (32Lee H. Arsura M. Wu M. Duyao M. Buckler A. Sonenshein G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and cyclin D1 (33Guttridge D.C. Albanese C. Reuther J.Y. Pestell R.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5785-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its involvement in cell growth, NF-κB activation is required for the induction of oncogenic transformation and tumor formation in certain models of cancer (30Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y.

At least one mechanism whereby NF-κB facilitates oncogene-driven transformation is through the suppression of apoptosis (30Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). While many factors involved in regulation of apoptosis induced by TNF receptor family signals have been elucidated, details of nutrient regulation of apoptotic signaling are few. In particular, the molecular mechanism(s) for CD-induced apoptosis and its associated carcinogenic potential have not been defined. Because p53 and NF-κB are transcriptional regulators associated with cellular stress and oncogenic events and are antagonistic in many cell systems (36Ravi R. Mookerjee B. van Hensbergen Y. Bedi G.C. Giordano A. El-Deiry W.S. Fuchs E.J. Bedi A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4531-4536PubMed Google Scholar, 48Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we asked whether these transcription factors are involved in CD-induced apoptosis. In this study, our findings may provide a molecular mechanism for cell survival and the further development of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with CD. PC12 cells were cultured as previously described (15Holmes-McNary M.Q. Loy R. Mar M.H. Albright C.D. Zeisel S.H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 101: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 choline-free media (American Biogenics) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% humidified incubator. For the following experiments, cells at 70% confluency were maintained in defined Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 serum-free media as previously indicated (15Holmes-McNary M.Q. Loy R. Mar M.H. Albright C.D. Zeisel S.H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 101: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A parallel group of cells grown under the same conditions were exposed to either 0 rads (Sham) or 500 rads γ irradiation (γ-IRR) (100 rads = 1 Gy). Cell growth was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion for number of viable cells. Three independent experiments were completed in duplicate. The H1299 cell line, which contains a homozygous deletion of the p53 gene (37Mitsudomi T. Steinberg S.M. Nau M.M. Carbone D. D'Amico D. Bodner S. Oie H.K. Linnoila R.I. Mulshine J.L. Minna J.D. et al.Oncogene. 1992; 7: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and G418/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.). This allowed selection for stable clones expressing the temperature-sensitive p53 (H1299-tsp53). The H1299 and H1299ts-p53 were kind gifts of Dr. N. Raab-Traub (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) and have been described previously (38Fres K.L. Miller W.E. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8653-8659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as previously described (39Holmes-McNary M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3477-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of cytoplasmic extracts (60 µg) were loaded and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked with 5% milk proteins in 1× Tris-buffered saline and 0.5% Tween 20 buffer and probed with either a specific monoclonal anti-mouse p53 antibody (1:1000, NovaCastra Labs) or a polyclonal anti-rabbit p21 antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Blots were probed with a secondary anti-mouse IgG (p53 detection) or anti-rabbit IgG (p21 detection) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000). Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and audioradiography. PC12 cells were cultured with and without choline as described. After 48 h apoptotic cells were detected by Tdt-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) using the cell death in situ assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The H1299-tsp53 cells were cultured with and without choline for 48 h either at 32 °C to induce the p53 wild type (wt-p53) conformation or at 39 °C for the p53 mutant (mut-p53) conformation. All cells were counterstained with fluorescein mounting medium (DAB, Oncor) and viewed by fluorescent microscopy. The H1299-tsp53 cells were cultured as described above. After 48 h cell death was detected by the ELISA apoptosis assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (39Holmes-McNary M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3477-3483PubMed Google Scholar), and the percentage of apoptosis was quantitated. Staurosporine was used as a positive control for the induction of apoptosis. Samples were run in triplicate, and data represents three independent experiments. Flow cytometric analysis was performed as previously described (40Rathmell W.K. Kaufmann W.K. Hurt J.C. Byrd L.L. Chu G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 68-74PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells were incubated with and without choline. After 48 h, log-phase cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in 10 mm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized and fixed in ice-cold 95% ethanol/5% PBS. Fixed cells were incubated in 0.08% pepsin for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by 2 n HCl incubation for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were neutralized, resuspended in incomplete Freund's adjuvant + 0.5% Tween 20, and then stained with α-BrdUrd-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) in the dark for 30 min. Stained nuclei were resuspended in 5 µg/ml RNase A and 50 µg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), incubated at 37 °C for 15 min followed by an additional 15 min in the dark on ice. Cell cycle analysis was performed on a FAC Scan instrument (Becton-Dickinson) at 488 nm. Data were analyzed by Modfit computer program, and data are representative of three independent experiments. PC12 cells were co-transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.) with either the empty expression vector (pDCR), the expression plasmid that contained the X-gal binding site (pCMV-lacZ), with the mutant p53135 expression vector that acted as a dominant negative inhibitor of endogenous p53 (41Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) (p53DN; gifts from Dr. M. Mayo, Univ. of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, NC) (29Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 39Holmes-McNary M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3477-3483PubMed Google Scholar), or with the 3XκB-luc reporter. Transfections used 5.0 µg of the pDCR empty vector alone or 1.0 µg of either the pCMVlacZ, the p53135 expression vectors, or the 3XκB-luc reporter and were brought to a final concentration of 5.0 µg with the empty vector for 24 h. After 24 h, cells were treated with or without choline. A parallel transfection experiment included the use of the super-repressor IκBα (SR-IκBα) protein that binds endogenous IκBα preventing NF-κB nuclear translocation. PC12 cells were co-transfected with either 1.0 µg of DNA from either the empty expression vector (pDCR), the p53135 expression vector (p53DN), or the SR-IκBα expression vector and brought to a final concentration of 5.0 µg with the empty vector. In general, 0.2 × 106 PC12 cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown overnight before transfection. Fresh media was added 1–2 h prior to transfection. LipofectAMINE-DNA complexes were allowed to form for 30 min in serum-free media before adding washed cells. Cells were incubated with complexes for 7 to 8 h followed by a media wash and then incubated for 24 h. The β-gal in situ assay was used to detect transfected cells as a measure of transfection efficiency and correspondingly to cell survival (39Holmes-McNary M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3477-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, culture plates were washed in 2 ml PBS, fixed in formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, washed twice in PBS, and then incubated with X-gal dye in PBS-cyanide solution overnight at 37 °C. β-Gal activity was assessed by counting the number of viable β-gal-expressing cells stained blue in relation to total cells. Data are presented as a percent of control. PC12 cells were transfected as described above. A cell count of both attached and detached cells was quantified and cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion assay. Viable cells excluding the dye (unstained) and cells incorporating the dye (stained) are non-viable. Cell viability after treatment was determined by counting the total number of cells and the number of unstained, and stained cells and data are expressed as a percent of control. PC12 cells were plated in 10 ml of complete media in 100-mm tissue culture plates at 1 × 107 cells/plate. After CD treatment, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were made using a procedure described previously (42Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed as described previously (39Holmes-McNary M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3477-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of nuclear extract (5 µg) were incubated with a [32P]dCTP-labeled probe in 1 µg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in high-ionic strength Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA), dried, and autoradiographed. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against either the p50 subunit (sc-114; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or the p65 subunit (Rel A; 100–4165; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) of NF-κB. Nuclear extracts were incubated with poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and the α-32P-labeled probe and then analyzed as described above. Significant differences between treatment groups were assessed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) by Macintosh StatView software. CD has been shown previously to inhibit cell growth in PC12 cells (8Yen C.L. Mar M.H. Zeisel S.H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Holmes-McNary M.Q. Loy R. Mar M.H. Albright C.D. Zeisel S.H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 101: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), however the molecular mechanisms associated with this response have not been clearly determined. To characterize the nature of the CD-induced growth arrest, we examined cell cycle distribution by flow cytometric analysis. Proliferating PC12 cells were grown in media containing 130 µm choline (CS), or in media without choline (CD). In a parallel experiment PC12 cells were either irradiated (5 Gy; γ-IRR) or not irradiated (Sham). As shown in the flow cytometric histogram (Fig. 1A), cell cycle distribution was significantly altered during CD as compared with its matched control, CS, at 48 h. In particular, during CD PC12 cells exhibited an 8-fold increase in the proportion of cells arrested in G0/G1 (p < 0.0001) and a 1.6-fold increase in G2/M (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1B). The number of total cells in S-phase were reduced 2.7-fold after CD (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1, Aand B). γ-IRR is a potent inducer of a p53-mediated pathway that results in G1 arrest, therefore it was used as a positive control (43Lu X. Lane D.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 765-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 44Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, after γ-IRR the majority of cells accumulated in both G0/G1 and G2/M of the cell cycle (data not shown). These data demonstrate that CD inhibited cell cycle progression and suggest that this inhibition may occur through a p53-mediated pathway. Previous evidence for the induction of apoptosis by CD was shown by growth inhibition and by the demonstration of DNA fragmentation (15Holmes-McNary M.Q. Loy R. Mar M.H. Albright C.D. Zeisel S.H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 101: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Albright C.D. Liu R. Bethea T.C. Da Costa K.A. Salganik R.I. Zeisel S.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cellular growth arrest is often mediated by induction of p53, and p53-mediated arrest depends, in part, on the induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 (45Gartel A.L. Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 213: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Therefore, to study the signaling pathway involved in CD-induced cell cycle arrest and cell death, we measured the induction of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1protein expression. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from PC12 cells that were also used for EMSAs. p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression in PC12 cells were examined following either CD or γ-IRR treatment by Western blot analysis. γ-IRR is known to activate a p53-mediated pathway resulting in p53 protein accumulation and was the positive control (43Lu X. Lane D.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 765-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 44Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, the expression of the p53 protein was strongly induced 24 h after CD treatment and remained elevated after 48 h (Fig.2A; compare lane 1with lanes 3 and 4). As expected, p53 protein expression was dramatically increased in γ-IRR PC12 cells after 24 h (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Using the same extracts, p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression was induced during CD and γ-IRR in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2B, lanes 3–4). p21WAF1/CIP1function has been demonstrated to be necessary for p53-mediated G1 arrest following irradiation (45Gartel A.L. Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 213: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). These data are important because the induction of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression in response to CD are consistent with growth inhibition previously reported (15Holmes-McNary M.Q. Loy R. Mar M.H. Albright C.D. Zeisel S.H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 101: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Albright C.D. Liu R. Bethea T.C. Da Costa K.A. Salganik R.I. Zeisel S.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and with inhibition of cell cycle progression in the present study. To determine whether p53 controls the observed CD-induced cell growth and apoptosis, we used a cell line that was inducible for functional p53. The H1299 human lung carcinoma cell line does not express endogenous wild type p53 (wt-p53), but has been engineered to stably express a temperature sensitive (ts) form of p53 (H1299.ts-p53). The H1299.ts-p53 cell line is well characterized and provides an effective tool for analysis of p53 function without interference from endogenous wt-p53 protein (37Mitsudomi T. Steinberg S.M. Nau M.M. Carbone D. D'Amico D. Bodner S. Oie H.K. Linnoila R.I. Mulshine J.L. Minna J.D. et al.Oncogene. 1992; 7: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fres K.L. Miller W.E. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8653-8659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the mutant p53 conformation and activity occurred at 39 °C, and expression of the wild type conformation and its associated activity occurred at 32 °C (38Fres K.L. Miller W.E. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8653-8659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Controls consisted of staurosporine as the positive control and untreated media as the negative control for apoptosis (Fig.3A). Evidence of DNA fragmentation was determined quantitatively in H1299.ts-p53 cells by the cell death ELISA assay. Upon the expression of wt-p53 at 32 °C, CD strongly induced apoptosis as determined by cell death ELISA (Fig.3B), morphological analysis, and TUNEL assay (Fig.3C). But at 39 °C, the p53 mutant significantly reduced the ability to support CD-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3, B andC, upper panel). In addition, p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression was induced at 32 °C during CD but not at 39 °C as indicated by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Thus, our data strongly suggest that the observed CD-induced apoptosis is a p53-mediated process in both preneuronal and epithelial cells as evidenced by the induction of both p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression. The mutant p53135 protein can abrogate p53-mediated cell death because it functions as a dominant negative (p53DN) by inhibiting endogenous wt-p53 protein (41Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 46Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3287-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). p53 is wild type in this PC12 cell line, therefore, it is possible that wt-p53 contributed to CD-induced cell death. To determine whether a p53-dependent mechanism was operative during CD-induced apoptosis, we examined the ability of the p53DN to rescue cells from CD-induced apoptosis. PC12 cells were transiently transfected using"
https://openalex.org/W2138990037,"We have investigated glycogen synthase (GS) activation in L6hIR cells expressing a peptide corresponding to the kinase regulatory loop binding domain of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) (KRLB). In several clones of these cells (B2, F4), insulin-dependent binding of the KRLB to insulin receptors was accompanied by a block of IRS-2, but not IRS-1, phosphorylation, and insulin receptor binding. GS activation by insulin was also inhibited by >70% in these cells (p < 0.001). The impairment of GS activation was paralleled by a similarly sized inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha (GSK3 alpha) and GSK3 beta inactivation by insulin with no change in protein phosphatase 1 activity. PDK1 (a phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate-dependent kinase) and Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) activation by insulin showed no difference in B2, F4, and in control L6hIR cells. At variance, insulin did not activate PKC zeta in B2 and F4 cells. In L6hIR, inhibition of PKC zeta activity by either a PKC zeta antisense or a dominant negative mutant also reduced by 75% insulin inactivation of GSK3 alpha and -beta (p < 0.001) and insulin stimulation of GS (p < 0.002), similar to Akt/PKB inhibition. In L6hIR, insulin induced protein kinase C zeta (PKC zeta) co-precipitation with GSK3 alpha and beta. PKC zeta also phosphorylated GSK3 alpha and -beta. Alone, these events did not significantly affect GSK3 alpha and -beta activities. Inhibition of PKC zeta activity, however, reduced Akt/PKB phosphorylation of the key serine sites on GSK3 alpha and -beta by >80% (p < 0.001) and prevented full GSK3 inactivation by insulin. Thus, IRS-2, not IRS-1, signals insulin activation of GS in the L6hIR skeletal muscle cells. In these cells, insulin inhibition of GSK3 alpha and -beta requires dual phosphorylation by both Akt/PKB and PKC zeta."
https://openalex.org/W2015177440,"Insulin secretion from glucose-stimulated pancreatic β-cells is oscillatory, and this is thought to result from oscillations in glucose metabolism. One of the primary metabolic stimulus-secretion coupling factors is the ATP/ADP ratio, which can oscillate as a result of oscillations in glycolysis. Using a novel multiwell culture plate system, we examined oscillations in insulin release and the ATP/ADP ratio in the clonal insulin-secreting cell lines HIT T-15 and INS-1. Insulin secretion from HIT cells grown in multiwell plates oscillated with a period of 4 min, similar to that seen previously in perifusion experiments. Oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio in cells grown under the same conditions also occurred with a period of 4 min, as did oscillations in [Ca2+]i monitored by fluorescence microscopy. In INS-1 cells oscillations in insulin secretion, the ATP/ADP ratio, and [Ca2+]i were also seen, but with a shorter period of about 1.5 min. These observations of oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio are consistent with their proposed role in driving the oscillations in [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion. Furthermore, these data show that, at least in the clonal β-cell lines, cell contact or even circulatory connection is not necessary for synchronous oscillations induced by a rise in glucose.

These oscillations persist in dissociated islets and in clonal insulin-secreting cell lines, suggesting that the impetus for such oscillations is within the insulin-secreting cell (3Cunningham B.A. Deeney J.T.

The importance of oscillations in insulin release is highlighted by the fact that oscillations are often altered or impaired in patients with Type II diabetes (5Polonsky K.S. Given B.D. Hirsch L.J.

A widely accepted model of glucose-induced insulin release has been developed in which the driving force for oscillatory secretion is proposed to be oscillations in glucose metabolism (6Berggren P.-O. Larsson O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Detimary P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. J. Clin.

In this model glucose passes readily into the β-cell via the Glut-2 transporter to be phosphorylated by glucokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. Glucokinase has been described as the glucose sensor in the β-cell since it can regulate glucose entry into glycolysis over a physiologically relevant concentration range (9Meglasson M.D. Burch P.T. Berner D.K. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Oscillations in glycolysis are a direct result of the allosteric regulation of phosphofructokinase (PFK).1PFK is inhibited by ATP and activated by AMP and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6bP), thus providing exquisite sensitivity to the energy state of the cell (10Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7322-7328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The autocatalytic activation of PFK by its product F1,6bP results in bursts in the production of ATP from glycolysis and in oscillations of metabolites both up-and downstream of PFK (11Tornheim K.

The oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio thus produced would cause closing and reopening of ATP sensitive K+(KATP) channels (12Hopkins W.F. Fatherazi S. Peter-Riesch B. Corkey B.E. Cook D.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 129: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), leading to oscillations in membrane potential and subsequent oscillations in voltage-gated Ca2+channel activity (13Larsson O.

Oscillations in glucose-induced insulin secretion may result from oscillations both in the ATP/ADP ratio and cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (14Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). There have been a number of studies showing a close association between membrane depolarization, [Ca2+]ichanges, and insulin release (15Gilon P. Shepherd R.M. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22265-22268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bergsten P. Grapengiesser E. Gylfe E. Tengholm A. Hellman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8749-8753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other experiments have demonstrated discordance between [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion when monitored simultaneously (17Zaitsev S.V. Efendic S. Arkhammar P. Bertorello A.M. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9712-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or in parallel (18Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Berggren P.-O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 887: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). When the regulation of Ca2+ influx is short circuited by the presence of KCl to depolarize the cell and diazoxide to maintain the KATPchannel open and unresponsive to changes in the ATP/ADP ratio, glucose continues to cause an increase in secretion in a concentration-dependent manner (19Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Secretion under these conditions (KATP channel-independent pathway) remains oscillatory while the [Ca2+]i is elevated and unchanging (3Cunningham B.A. Deeney J.T. Bliss C.R. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E702-E710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Westerlund J. Gylfe E. Bergsten P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2547-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data suggest that [Ca2+]i is not the sole regulator of insulin release in the pancreatic islet but rather may play a permissive role. Again using the KATP channel-independent pathway to stimulate secretion, investigators found that formycin A, an adenosine analogue which was converted to formycin A-triphosphate in islets, was capable of potentiating insulin secretion independent of glucose concentration (21Sato Y. Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These data suggest that ATP or the ATP/ADP ratio is an important metabolic coupling factor that may regulate insulin release independent of [Ca2+]i. Studies attempting to link oscillations in metabolism with those of secretion have been limited to non-invasive measurements, due to the inaccessibility of the cells either in columns or in microscope chambers. Measurements of oxygen consumption (22Longo E.A. Tornheim K. Deeney J.T. Varnum B.A. Tillotson D. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) have been correlated to both [Ca2+]i and insulin secretion. Oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio have only been correlated to oscillations in [Ca2+]i under conditions in which the cells are stirred in a cuvette, preventing the simultaneous measurement of insulin secretion (25Nilsson T. Schultz V. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Correlations between changes in the ATP/ADP ratio and KATP channel activity (26Köhler M. Norgren S. Bergrren P.-O. Fredholm B.B. Larsson O. Rhodes C.J. Herbert T.P. Luthman H. FEBS Letters. 1998; 441: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and insulin secretion (27Maechler P. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Letters. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have been made in clonal β-cells transfected with luciferase, but in these cases oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio were not detected. It is still not clear how the cells within an islet are coordinated or synchronized to each other to obtain oscillations in insulin release from single perifused islets (28Westerlund J. Hellman B. Bergsten P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There is also a question as to how islets or cells with no cell-cell contact can be coordinated with each other to maintain an oscillatory pattern of secretion over time. It has been proposed that a yet unidentified factor secreted from the cells may play a role in maintaining metabolic synchrony, as is the case in yeast (3Cunningham B.A. Deeney J.T. Bliss C.R. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E702-E710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tornheim K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that HIT-T15 clonal insulin-secreting cells exhibit large oscillations in insulin secretion with a period of 15–20 min, the peaks of which were superimposed with smaller oscillations of 5–8 min period, when perifused in a column (3Cunningham B.A. Deeney J.T. Bliss C.R. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E702-E710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oscillations observed in these cells suggest that the populations of cells mixed with the beads were synchronous in their response to glucose. The synchronous response of these cells suggests that oscillations could also be evident in attached cultured cells in a multiwell plate. In this case, if a diffusible soluble factor controlled synchrony, oscillations with differing phases or periods might be obtained in the separate wells of the plate, thus masking the oscillations seen in the column. By using a multiwell approach, we now show that HIT cells grown in a multiwell plate exhibit oscillations in insulin secretion with a period similar to that found in cells perifused in a column. Oscillations in insulin release were also observed from INS-1 cells similarly attached to multiwell plates. These oscillations in insulin release correlated with oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio and are similar in period to those in [Ca2+]i, confirming a role for metabolic oscillations in oscillatory insulin release. Clonal insulin-secreting tumor cells, HIT-T15, were cultured in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 32.5 μmglutathione, 0.1 μm selenous acid, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were used between passages 64 and 85. INS-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm pyruvic acid, 10 mm HEPES, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were used between passages 65 and 100. HIT cells grown in 48-well plates (Costar) were washed three times in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) containing (in mm) 109 NaCl, 4.6 KCl, 5 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.15 Na2HPO4, 0.4 KH2PO4, 0.1 MgSO4, 5 glutamine, and 20 HEPES, pH 7.4, and preincubated in the identical buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The preincubation medium in each well was then replaced at 30 s intervals with KRB containing 10 mm glucose to produce a time course of insulin secretion. Thus, the first well was exposed to glucose for 24 min and the last for 30 s. Insulin was collected simultaneously from all the wells by inverting the test plate into a second 48-well plate. The cells were then quick frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until extracted for ATP/ADP ratio measurements. The same procedure was followed for INS-1 cells, using a 10-s time interval for the addition of glucose to the wells over an 8-min time course. INS-1 cells were grown overnight in RPMI 1640 medium containing 3 mm glucose, preincubated for 30 min in KRB with 3 mm glucose and stimulated with 16.7 mm glucose. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research Inc., St. Louis, MO). Cells were extracted in cold 1% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (0.5 ml/well), and the trichloroacetic acid supernatant was neutralized with four equal volume washes of diethyl ether using vacuum suction to remove the ether between each wash. Neutralized supernatants were then freeze-dried in a Speed Vac (Savant) and stored at −80 °C until assayed for ATP and ADP. Dried samples were redissolved in 0.5 ml of water and an aliquot was removed to measure ATP directly with luciferase using a Turner Model 20e luminometer equipped with a Cavro injector. ADP was converted to ATP to be assayed by luciferase after the sample was depleted of endogenous ATP with ATP sulfurylase, thus enhancing the sensitivity of the ADP measurement (30Schultz V. Sussman I. Bokvist K. Tornheim K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Data are presented as the ATP/ADP ratio, making them independent of changes in cell number per well or loss of sample volume during extraction. [Ca2+]iwas measured in fura-2-loaded clonal insulin-secreting cells (31Deeney J.T. Cunningham B.A. Chheda S. Bokvist K. Juntti-Berggren L. Lam K. Korchak H.M. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18154-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) grown on glass coverslips that were used as the bottom of a custom built perifusion chamber. The chamber was mounted on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 135 TV, Zeiss, Germany) and excited at 340 nm and 380 nm using a SPEX fluorometer with the emission at 510 nm collected by a cooled CCD camera. Image analysis was performed with Inovision software (Durham, NC). Resting [Ca2+]i was measured in 0.1 mm glucose or 5 mm glutamine for HIT cells and 3 mm glucose for INS-1 cells. HIT cells were stimulated with 10 mm glucose plus 10 mmleucine, while INS-1 cells were stimulated with 20 mmglucose plus 10 mm leucine. Data were analyzed using the Bergman technique for estimating measurement error in time courses (32Finegood D.T. Bergman R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: E472-E479PubMed Google Scholar,33Bradley D.C. Steil G.M. Bergman R.N. Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 1995; 46: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This program, Optimized Optimal Segments (OOPSEG), quantitates and filters random measurement error to reconstruct the error-free shape of data curves. This program reiteratively assumes the error in the time-course data and fits the data to a line such that the residuals (the difference between the smoothed curve and data points) are random and consistent with the assumed error. Data are presented as smoothed curves, and the coefficient of variance (CV) is calculated. The derivative (slope) at each data point on the line is also estimated by the OOPSEG program and plotted. Periods of oscillations were calculated without the aid of a specific program using the derivative data from the OOPSEG program where applicable. Measurements of insulin release and the ATP/ADP ratio were not always made from the same cells. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for unpaired data. HIT cells grown in 48-well plates and stimulated with 10 mm glucose, one well at a time at 30 s intervals, exhibited oscillations in insulin secretion (Fig.1). Oscillations in the wells were seen as step jumps with increases in secretion (exocytosis turned on) followed by plateaus (exocytosis turned off) and are of a 4-min period, similar to those seen in the packed column. The secretion patterns from the wells were linearized by smoothing the data with a three point moving average, fitting it to a straight line (Fig. 1A), and then determining the positive or negative differences between the data and the straight line (residuals). Plotting the secretion from cells grown in multiwell plates as residuals clearly shows the oscillatory pattern of exocytosis (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows the same data unsmoothed and then smoothed using the OOPSEG analysis (32Finegood D.T. Bergman R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: E472-E479PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bradley D.C. Steil G.M. Bergman R.N. Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 1995; 46: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The derivative of the OOPSEG smoothed data is plotted in Fig.1D and shows results similar in number of oscillations to the residual analysis (Fig. 1B). In the case of the OOPSEG derivative, the troughs (D) correlate to the plateaus (slope approaching zero) in insulin release (C) and are thus slightly right shifted from the peaks in Fig. 1B. These results indicate that cells from different wells with no possibility of contact exhibited synchronous oscillations in response to a step jump in glucose concentration. The multiwell plate has the advantage of allowing access to the cells for metabolite measurements. The time course of changes in the ATP/ADP ratio, measured from 30 individual wells, is seen in Fig.2. The smoothed ATP/ADP ratio determined by the OOPSEG program as well as the actual ATP/ADP ratio data is shown in Fig. 2A, while the derivative of the smoothed data is shown in Fig. 2B. The ATP/ADP ratio oscillated with a period similar to that of insulin secretion (Fig. 2, C and D). [Ca2+]i determined by image analysis of fura-2-loaded HIT cells also oscillated in response to glucose stimulation with a period similar to that of the ATP/ADP ratio and insulin secretion (Fig. 2, E and F). Thirty-three of a total of 47 HIT cells examined in four separate experiments (70%) responded with an increased [Ca2+]i upon stimulation with glucose, with 16 cells (33%) exhibiting a clear oscillatory pattern. In the average signal from a field of cells the first [Ca2+]i oscillation was often much larger than those that followed due to the heterogeneity of the response after the initial increase in [Ca2+]i (data not shown). The average data showed that [Ca2+]iin the population oscillated with a similar period as the ATP/ADP ratio and insulin secretion (Table I).Table IPeriods of oscillations for ATP/ADP ratio, [Ca2+]iand insulin release in HIT-T15 and INS-1 cellsParameterHIT-T15INS-1Period (min)Period (min)ATP/ADP ratio3.6 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.11-ap < 0.005 for oscillations in INS-1 cells compared to HIT-cells.(3)(3)[Ca2+]i5.0 ± 0.51.4 ± 0.11-ap < 0.005 for oscillations in INS-1 cells compared to HIT-cells.(4)(3)Insulin release4.0 ± 0.51.5 ± 0.11-ap < 0.005 for oscillations in INS-1 cells compared to HIT-cells.(3)(5)Values for oscillatory periods of ATP/ADP ratio and insulin release from the two clonal β-cell lines were determined from cells grown in multiwell plates.

Open table in a new tab Values for oscillatory periods of ATP/ADP ratio and insulin release from the two clonal β-cell lines were determined from cells grown in multiwell plates. Oscillations in [Ca2+]i were monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Values in parenthesis represent number of replicate experiments. In contrast, when another insulin-secreting cell line, INS-1, was exposed to stimulatory levels of glucose (20 mm), all of the cells responded with both an initial increase and oscillations in [Ca2+]i (49 cells in three experiments). These oscillations were faster than those observed in HIT cells, having an average period of 1.4 min (Fig.3, E and F). When the oscillations in [Ca2+]i were averaged from 18 cells monitored in a single experiment, the oscillatory pattern was only slightly dampened compared with that obtained from a single cell (data not shown), indicating that all cells responded similarly. The average results show oscillations with a similar period to those found in the individual cells (Table I). To determine whether the faster oscillations in [Ca2+]i found in INS-1 cells were due to faster oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio in these cells, we again employed the multiwell system. The ATP/ADP ratio in INS-1 cells was measured in response to raising the glucose concentration from 3 mm to 16.7 mm. Induced oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio, when measured in INS-1 cells grown in multiple wells and analyzed by OOPSEG (Fig. 3, A and B), were similar in period to the [Ca2+]ioscillations measured in the same cell line. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from INS-1 cells grown in the multiwell plates and analyzed by OOPSEG (Fig. 3, C and D and Table I) had the same period as the ATP/ADP ratio and [Ca2+]i. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the ATP/ADP ratio is the driving force for the oscillations in [Ca2+]i and insulin release. In this paper we have directly tested the hypothesized link between insulin secretion and the ATP/ADP ratio using a novel multiwell culture system to analyze glucose-induced oscillations in metabolism and insulin secretion. Insulin secretion from clonal insulin-secreting cells (HIT) grown in multiwell plates oscillated with a similar period as seen previously when these cells were perifused in a column (3Cunningham B.A. Deeney J.T. Bliss C.R. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E702-E710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order for oscillations in secretion to be observed in a population, the cells must somehow be in synchrony with one another (29Tornheim K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The synchronous nature of cells packed in a column has been believed to be in part due to the proximity of the cells to each other allowing for some kind of cell-cell communication. This communication may result from the effect of a soluble factor possibly secreted from some or all cells of the population (3Cunningham B.A. Deeney J.T. Bliss C.R. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E702-E710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or could be the result of electrical coupling between cells (34Rosario L.M. Atwater I. Scott A.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1986; 211: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The synchrony achieved among cells grown in separate wells could not be explained by a putative soluble synchronizing factor or electrical coupling. The multiwell approach employed in the present study provided a physical barrier separating distinct groups of cells that were stimulated by glucose to act in unison. Presumably, the similar metabolic effects of glucose on the different groups of cells resulted in the apparent synchrony of the cells in separate wells. Admittedly, these oscillations were studied over a relatively short time (15 min), and it cannot be ruled out that a more active process of synchronization is involved in maintaining the oscillations that have been observed over much longer times (3Cunningham B.A. Deeney J.T. Bliss C.R. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E702-E710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Longo E.A. Tornheim K. Deeney J.T. Varnum B.A. Tillotson D. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9314-9319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The advantage of the multiwell approach to study oscillatory secretion is the ability to quickly freeze-clamp the cells to examine related parameters. By using this approach, we demonstrated that oscillations in insulin secretion were similar to those in the ATP/ADP ratio and thus to metabolism. Changes in the ATP/ADP ratio occurred with the same period as that of secretion in HIT and INS-1 cells. This is the first time that oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio have been shown to correlate with oscillations in insulin release in glucose-stimulated cells. Our data suggest that synchrony in secretion is determined by synchrony in glucose metabolism of the cells. The glucose-induced oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio and insulin release were also similar in period to the [Ca2+]i oscillations in both HIT cells and INS-1 cells. This, together with our previous demonstration that changes in the ATP/ADP ratio precede changes in [Ca2+]i (25Nilsson T. Schultz V. Berggren P.-O. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35Civelek V.N. Deeney J.T. Kubik K. Schultz V. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), is strong evidence that the metabolism of glucose, via changes in the ATP/ADP ratio, determines the level of [Ca2+]i maintained in the cell and which in turn drives exocytosis of insulin. The amplitude of oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio was 2.4 ± 0.3 (n = 3) in the INS-1 cells compared with 1.7 ± 0.2 (n = 3) in the HIT cells. This may be the result of a larger proportion of glucose-responsive cells in the INS-1 cell population. Thus, the large number of non-responsive HIT cells may dampen the changes observed in the ATP/ADP ratio in these cells. The lack of glucose response in many of the HIT cells was demonstrated by the inability of glucose to stimulate an increase in [Ca2+]i in 30% of the cells tested. Oscillations in [Ca2+]ioccurred in almost all of the INS-1 cells tested, suggesting that the ATP/ADP ratio in all of these cells increased with glucose stimulation. There is a striking difference in the period of oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio, insulin secretion (as measured in the multiwells), and the [Ca2+]i changes between the two cell lines tested. Indeed, it is the contrasting nature of these two cell lines that highlights the importance of glucose metabolism in determining [Ca2+]i levels essential for secretion. The shorter oscillatory period in the ATP/ADP ratio of INS-1 cells may relate to increased flux through glycolysis due to differences in glucokinase expression (36Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and/or differences in the isoform profile (37Yaney G.C. Schultz V. Cunningham B.A. Dunaway G.A. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or regulation of PFK (10Tornheim K. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7322-7328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proposed to be the glycolytic oscillator in the β-cell. It is also possible that oscillations in other metabolites, enzymes, or channels may contribute to the differences in the pulsatility of insulin release between HIT cells and INS-1 cells. We thank Drs. D. C. Bradley and R. N. Bergman for their kind gift of the Optimized Optimal Segments (OOPSEG) program used to analyze oscillations in the ATP/ADP ratio and insulin release."

Therefore as the results, the F43H/H64L mutant is able to catalyze the sulfoxidation and epoxidation reaction at the rate comparable with the values of peroxidases.On the other hand, cytochromes P-450 (P-450) catalyze the hydroxylation of a wide variety of substrates, including hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic molecules (7Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1997: 223-282Google Scholar). The variance in reactivity of Mb and P-450 could arise from differences in the active site structure and the arrangement of functional amino acid residues. The crystal structure of P-450cam with d-camphor reveals that the substrate is tightly bound in the hydrophobic heme pocket through hydrogen bonding interaction with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-96 and the carbonyl oxygen of d-camphor (Fig.1A) (9Poulos T.L.

On the contrary, the active site of myoglobin is exposed to the exterior and does not provide any specific interactions for accommodating a foreign substrate with high affinity (10Phillips G.N.J. Arduini R.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be difficult for a ferryl porphyrin radical cation of Mb to hydroxylate a substrate molecule, which is not bound in an appropriate position nearby the heme. We hypothesize that a ferryl oxygen atom transfer to aliphatic or aromatic molecules by Mb mutants might be possible even without a proximal thiolate ligand if the substrates were fixed nearby the heme iron.The F43W/H64L Mb mutant, which was previously constructed to investigate effects of an electron-rich tryptophan residue on the peroxygenase activity, appears to be a good model for examining the hypothesis, because aromatic carbon atoms of tryptophan are fixed in the heme vicinity (Fig. 1B) (12Ozaki S. Hara I. Matsui T. Watanabe Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of the F43W/H64L Mb is not available at the moment, the calculated model structure suggests that the distances of Fe–C7 and Fe–C6 are 4.9 and 5.5 Å, respectively. (A calculated structure of F43W/H64L Mb was obtained by using the Insight II molecular modeling program (Biosym MSI, San Diego, CA). The Trp-43 in the mutant is generated by replacing His-43 of the F43H/H64L Mb (6Ozaki S. Matsui T. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6666-6667Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with a tryptophan residue and minimizing the energy of the heme pocket.) The predicted values are similar to the distance between C5 of d-camphor and iron in P-450cam. Our earlier studies provided preliminary evidence that Trp-43 in F43W/H64L Mb was oxidatively modified in the reaction with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA); however, the exact structure of the modified product(s) remains to be elucidated (12Ozaki S. Hara I. Matsui T. Watanabe Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The subject of this study is to identify the oxidized tryptophan residue to determine whether or not the F43W/H64L Mb mutant is capable of performing the oxidation of aromatic molecules.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe oxidative modification of Trp-43 in F43W/H64L Mb has been performed by adding mCPBA in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The transition from 5- to 6-coordinated ferric high spin state is a good indication of the protein modification (Scheme FS1) (17Giacometti G.M. Ascenzi P. Bolognesi M. Brunori M. J. Mol.

ThemCPBA-treated F43W/H64L mutant is digested with Lys-C achromobacter, and two peptide fragments A and B, which consist of Trp-43(modified)-Asp-44-Arg-45-Phe-46-Lys-47 (W*DRFK), are purified by FPLC. Fig. 2 shows the comparison of the MS/MS spectra of unmodified WDRFK fragment and the modified fragment A. The difference in the spectra provides the direct evidence for the modified site to be Trp-43, and the increased mass number of 30 Da could correspond to the addition of two oxygen atoms and loss of two protons. The MS/MS spectrum of the fragment B is identical to that of the fragmentA. Prior to the NMR analysis, A and Bhave been further treated with trypsin to simplify the NMR spectra. While the fragment B affords a shorter peptide defined asB′ (W*DR), trypsin does not cleave the carboxyl side of arginine in the fragment A. Therefore, we have performed NMR analysis of the intact WDR fragment and modified fragmentsA (W*DRFK) and B′ (W*DR).Figure FS1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2MS/MS analysis of the intact WDRFK fragment (A) and product A (W*DRFK) performed on MALDI-TOF(B) (PerSeptive Biosystems, Voyager DESTR).

The close examination of the1H NMR spectrum of A reveals that one proton signal at 6.60 ppm couples with two different proton signals with coupling constants of J = 8.2, 2.3 Hz. Two other proton signals appear at 6.58 and 7.19 ppm with coupling constants ofJ = 2.3 and 8.2 Hz, respectively. The only structure that could afford such a coupling pattern is a 2,6-disubstituted indole substructure as shown in Fig. 4;i.e. the resonance at 6.58 ppm, 6.60 ppm, and 7.19 ppm are unambiguously assigned to the protons at C7, C5, and C4, respectively.Figure 31H NMR spectra of the unmodified WDR fragment and the modified product A (W*DRFK).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table I1H NMR chemical shifts (δ in ppm) of Trp-43 of the intact WDR fragment, product A (W∗DRFK), and product B′ (W∗DR)Cα—HCβ—HC2—HC4—HC5—HC6—HC7—HIntact fragment4.353.46/3.367.327.647.177.267.51dd, J = 7.0, 7.0dd,J = 7.0, 7.0sd, J = 8.0dd, J = 7.2, 8.0dd,J = 7.2, 8.0d, J = 8.0Product A4.142.65/2.267.196.606.58dd, J = 7.7, 8.7dd,J = 7.6, 8.9d, J = 8.2dd, J = 8.2, 2.3d,J = 2.3Product B′4.462.90/2.836.916.266.36dd, J = 9.5, 2.9dd,J = 9.4, 2.9d, J = 8.5dd, J = 8.5, 2.5d,J = 2.5The NMR spectra were obtained in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pD 7.0) in D2O at 25 °C on a Unity Inova 600 MHz NMR and a Unity plus 600 MHz spectrometer (Varian).

Furthermore, the correlation of the C4–H with Cα–H (4.14 ppm) and Cβ–H (2.65 ppm) is observed by the ROESY experiments. The combination of the COSY, ROESY, and TOCSY methods allows us the complete assignment for the fragment A as summarized in TableII. Essentially the same assignment can be applied to the interpretation for the NMR spectra of B′. Two doublet signals at 6.36 ppm (J = 2.5 Hz) and 6.91 ppm (J = 8.5 Hz) are assigned to the C7 and C4 protons of the modified Trp-43 in B′, respectively, and the resonance at 6.26 ppm (J = 8.5, 2.5 Hz) is derived from C5-H (Table I). Therefore, the tryptophan residue in the fragmentB′ (W*DR) also must have the 2,6-disubstituted indole substructure (Fig. 4). The coupling pattern in the 1H NMR spectrum of the fragment B is essentially the same as those observed in A and B′ spectra.Table II1H NMR chemical shifts (δ in ppm) for the residues in the intact WDR fragment, product A (W∗DRFK), and productB′ (W∗DR)Cα—HCβ—HCγ—HCδ—HCɛ—HCζ—HAsp in intact fragment4.692.77/2.62Arg in intact fragment4.101.80/1.651.513.11Asp in product A4.282.84/2.60Arg in product A4.001.481.27/1.063.02Phe in product A4.613.26/2.967.297.357.29Lys in product A4.091.73/1.551.271.602.97Asp in product B′4.402.55/2.45Arg in product B′4.151.79/1.671.523.12The NMR spectra were obtained in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pD 7.0) in D2O at 25 °C on a Unity Inova 600 MHz NMR and a Unity plus 600 MHz spectrometer (Varian). The chemical shifts are referred to TSP-d4. Open table in a new tab Amino acid sequence and composition analyses provided us with a clue to identify the structural differences in the modified tryptophan of the fragment A and B′. First of all, A does not react with phenylisothiocyanate, and the Edman degradation does not give us any sequence information, while the sequence analysis for B′ shows Trp*-43(not detected)-Asp-44-Arg-45 sequence. Second, amino acid composition analysis of A reveals that the fragment consists of Asp, Arg, Phe, and Lys; however, the tryptophan residue is not identified due to its modification. The results imply that the amino terminus of the fragment A is protected, but the residues except for Trp-43 are intact. To clarify the amino-terminal structure, we have measured 13C NMR of A. The spectrum exhibits a unique signal at 71.1 ppm, which could be assigned as a signal from the hydroxylated carbon atom. Since the fragment A does not contain a serine nor a threonine residue, the comparison of chemical shift for the α carbon in tryptophan (56.1 ppm), indole-3-lactic acid (70.6 ppm), and A (71.1 ppm) suggest that the terminal amino group in A is replaced with the hydroxyl moiety. Thus, we conclude at the moment that the indole substructure in the modified tryptophan is 2,6-dihydro-2-imino-6-oxoindole in A(X=O, Y=NH in Fig. 4) and 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole in B terminal (X=Y=O). The proposed structures are consistent with the increase in the 30-Da mass unit with respect to the intact tryptophan. Although further studies are required to clarify the mechanism, a cyclic intermediate generated through the reaction of the terminal amine with the carbonyl carbon atom at the C2 position followed by hydrolysis might be involved to afford 2,6-dihydro-2-imino-6-oxoindole substructure without changing the total mass of the peptide (SchemeFS2).Figure FS2Possible rearrangement of 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole to 2,6-dihydro-2-imino-6-oxoindole.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It should be noticed that trypsin somehow recognizes the structural difference in the amino-terminal of pentapeptide A (W*DRFK) and prevents hydrolysis of the carboxyl side of arginine to yieldA′ (W*DR). More interestingly, the fragment A is found to be produced from B during the incubation with trypsin or Lys-C, while B is stable in aqueous solution in the absence of peptidases.Since the mixing of mCPBA and tryptophan does not produce the modified tryptophan, a ferryl porphyrin radical cation generated in the reaction of F43W/H64L Mb with mCPBA is presumably a catalytic species to form 6-hydroxytryptophan either directly or via the epoxidation followed by hydrolysis (SchemeFS3). Previous studies using Fremy's salt as the oxidant indicate that 6-hydroxy-3-methylindole is readily oxidized to yield 3-methylindole 2,6- and 6,7-dione, and 6,7-dione is reported to be a minor product due to its instability (yield of 3-methylindole 2,6-dione = 63%, 6,7-dione = 7%) (22Itoh S. Ogino M. Haranou S. Terasaka T. Ando T. Komatsu M. Ohshiro Y. Fukuzumi S. Kano K. Takagi K. Ikeda T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 1485-1493Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We expect that 6-hydroxytryptophan could further be oxidized withmCPBA (Scheme 3A) or compound I (Scheme 3B) by overall four electron oxidation to produce the 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole substructure.Figure FS3Plausible mechanisms for the formation of 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In summary, the indole substructure of Trp-43 in F43W/H64L Mb is oxidatively transformed into 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole in the presence of mCPBA. Our finding is the first example of the oxidation of aromatic carbons by the myoglobin mutant system as far as we know. The results implicate that a ferryl oxygen atom transfer to aromatic molecules would be possible by a heme enzyme with a non-thiolate ligand if the substrates were fixed nearby the heme iron. Our results would coincide with recent genetic analysis, suggesting that a hemoenzyme similar to cytochrome c peroxidase with an imidazole as the proximal ligand is involved in biosynthesis of tryptophan tryptophylquinone, a novel cofactor bearing indole 6,7-dione moiety, in methylamine dehydrogenase (11Tanizawa K.

In addition, we have reported herein that a unique amino-oxo exchange reaction of the amino-termnal 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole was performed by Lys-C and trypsin. Myoglobin (Mb),1 a carrier of molecular oxygen, can perform oxidation reactions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), although the activity is not as great as that of peroxidase (1Adachi S.

The accumulated biochemical and biophysical data allow us to utilize Mb as a heme enzyme model system, and various myoglobin mutants have been constructed to elucidate structure-function relationship on the activation of peroxides (3Ozaki S. Matsui T. Roach M.P. Watanabe Y. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2000; 198: 39-59Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 4Wan L. Twitchett M.B. Eltis L.D. Mauk A.G. Smith M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, F43H/H64L Mb, one of the distal histidine relocation mutants, exhibits the enhanced reactivity with H2O2 and the longer lifetime of an active intermediate, a ferryl porphyrin radical cation (O=FeIVporphyrin⋅+) (6Ozaki S. Matsui T. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6666-6667Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore as the results, the F43H/H64L mutant is able to catalyze the sulfoxidation and epoxidation reaction at the rate comparable with the values of peroxidases. On the other hand, cytochromes P-450 (P-450) catalyze the hydroxylation of a wide variety of substrates, including hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic molecules (7Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. 2nd Ed. Cytochrome P450. Plenum Press, New York1995: 245-303Google Scholar, 8Watanabe Y. Funabiki T. Oxygenases and Model Systems. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1997: 223-282Google Scholar). The variance in reactivity of Mb and P-450 could arise from differences in the active site structure and the arrangement of functional amino acid residues. The crystal structure of P-450cam with d-camphor reveals that the substrate is tightly bound in the hydrophobic heme pocket through hydrogen bonding interaction with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-96 and the carbonyl oxygen of d-camphor (Fig.1A) (9Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). The distance between the heme iron and C5 of d-camphor, the hydroxylation site, is 4.2 Å. On the contrary, the active site of myoglobin is exposed to the exterior and does not provide any specific interactions for accommodating a foreign substrate with high affinity (10Phillips G.N.J. Arduini R.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be difficult for a ferryl porphyrin radical cation of Mb to hydroxylate a substrate molecule, which is not bound in an appropriate position nearby the heme. We hypothesize that a ferryl oxygen atom transfer to aliphatic or aromatic molecules by Mb mutants might be possible even without a proximal thiolate ligand if the substrates were fixed nearby the heme iron. The F43W/H64L Mb mutant, which was previously constructed to investigate effects of an electron-rich tryptophan residue on the peroxygenase activity, appears to be a good model for examining the hypothesis, because aromatic carbon atoms of tryptophan are fixed in the heme vicinity (Fig. 1B) (12Ozaki S. Hara I. Matsui T. Watanabe Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of the F43W/H64L Mb is not available at the moment, the calculated model structure suggests that the distances of Fe–C7 and Fe–C6 are 4.9 and 5.5 Å, respectively. (A calculated structure of F43W/H64L Mb was obtained by using the Insight II molecular modeling program (Biosym MSI, San Diego, CA). The Trp-43 in the mutant is generated by replacing His-43 of the F43H/H64L Mb (6Ozaki S. Matsui T. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6666-6667Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with a tryptophan residue and minimizing the energy of the heme pocket.) The predicted values are similar to the distance between C5 of d-camphor and iron in P-450cam. Our earlier studies provided preliminary evidence that Trp-43 in F43W/H64L Mb was oxidatively modified in the reaction with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA); however, the exact structure of the modified product(s) remains to be elucidated (12Ozaki S.

ThemCPBA-treated F43W/H64L mutant is digested with Lys-C achromobacter, and two peptide fragments A and B, which consist of Trp-43(modified)-Asp-44-Arg-45-Phe-46-Lys-47 (W*DRFK), are purified by FPLC. Fig. 2 shows the comparison of the MS/MS spectra of unmodified WDRFK fragment and the modified fragment A. The difference in the spectra provides the direct evidence for the modified site to be Trp-43, and the increased mass number of 30 Da could correspond to the addition of two oxygen atoms and loss of two protons. The MS/MS spectrum of the fragment B is identical to that of the fragmentA. Prior to the NMR analysis, A and Bhave been further treated with trypsin to simplify the NMR spectra. While the fragment B affords a shorter peptide defined asB′ (W*DR), trypsin does not cleave the carboxyl side of arginine in the fragment A. Therefore, we have performed NMR analysis of the intact WDR fragment and modified fragmentsA (W*DRFK) and B′ (W*DR).Figure 2MS/MS analysis of the intact WDRFK fragment (A) and product A (W*DRFK) performed on MALDI-TOF(B) (PerSeptive Biosystems, Voyager DESTR).

Thus, we conclude at the moment that the indole substructure in the modified tryptophan is 2,6-dihydro-2-imino-6-oxoindole in A(X=O, Y=NH in Fig. 4) and 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole in B terminal (X=Y=O). The proposed structures are consistent with the increase in the 30-Da mass unit with respect to the intact tryptophan. Although further studies are required to clarify the mechanism, a cyclic intermediate generated through the reaction of the terminal amine with the carbonyl carbon atom at the C2 position followed by hydrolysis might be involved to afford 2,6-dihydro-2-imino-6-oxoindole substructure without changing the total mass of the peptide (SchemeFS2).Figure FS2Possible rearrangement of 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole to 2,6-dihydro-2-imino-6-oxoindole.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It should be noticed that trypsin somehow recognizes the structural difference in the amino-terminal of pentapeptide A (W*DRFK) and prevents hydrolysis of the carboxyl side of arginine to yieldA′ (W*DR). More interestingly, the fragment A is found to be produced from B during the incubation with trypsin or Lys-C, while B is stable in aqueous solution in the absence of peptidases.Since the mixing of mCPBA and tryptophan does not produce the modified tryptophan, a ferryl porphyrin radical cation generated in the reaction of F43W/H64L Mb with mCPBA is presumably a catalytic species to form 6-hydroxytryptophan either directly or via the epoxidation followed by hydrolysis (SchemeFS3). Previous studies using Fremy's salt as the oxidant indicate that 6-hydroxy-3-methylindole is readily oxidized to yield 3-methylindole 2,6- and 6,7-dione, and 6,7-dione is reported to be a minor product due to its instability (yield of 3-methylindole 2,6-dione = 63%, 6,7-dione = 7%) (22Itoh S.

We expect that 6-hydroxytryptophan could further be oxidized withmCPBA (Scheme 3A) or compound I (Scheme 3B) by overall four electron oxidation to produce the 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole substructure.Figure FS3Plausible mechanisms for the formation of 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In summary, the indole substructure of Trp-43 in F43W/H64L Mb is oxidatively transformed into 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole in the presence of mCPBA. Our finding is the first example of the oxidation of aromatic carbons by the myoglobin mutant system as far as we know. The results implicate that a ferryl oxygen atom transfer to aromatic molecules would be possible by a heme enzyme with a non-thiolate ligand if the substrates were fixed nearby the heme iron. Our results would coincide with recent genetic analysis, suggesting that a hemoenzyme similar to cytochrome c peroxidase with an imidazole as the proximal ligand is involved in biosynthesis of tryptophan tryptophylquinone, a novel cofactor bearing indole 6,7-dione moiety, in methylamine dehydrogenase (11Tanizawa K.

ThemCPBA-treated F43W/H64L mutant is digested with Lys-C achromobacter, and two peptide fragments A and B, which consist of Trp-43(modified)-Asp-44-Arg-45-Phe-46-Lys-47 (W*DRFK), are purified by FPLC. Fig. 2 shows the comparison of the MS/MS spectra of unmodified WDRFK fragment and the modified fragment A. The difference in the spectra provides the direct evidence for the modified site to be Trp-43, and the increased mass number of 30 Da could correspond to the addition of two oxygen atoms and loss of two protons. The MS/MS spectrum of the fragment B is identical to that of the fragmentA. Prior to the NMR analysis, A and Bhave been further treated with trypsin to simplify the NMR spectra. While the fragment B affords a shorter peptide defined asB′ (W*DR), trypsin does not cleave the carboxyl side of arginine in the fragment A. Therefore, we have performed NMR analysis of the intact WDR fragment and modified fragmentsA (W*DRFK) and B′ (W*DR). Although the 1H NMR spectrum of the intact WDR fragment exhibits signals derived from five tryptophan protons, only three proton signals of the tryptophan appear in the aromatic region for the modified product A (W*DRFK) (Fig.3, TableI). The close examination of the1H NMR spectrum of A reveals that one proton signal at 6.60 ppm couples with two different proton signals with coupling constants of J = 8.2, 2.3 Hz. Two other proton signals appear at 6.58 and 7.19 ppm with coupling constants ofJ = 2.3 and 8.2 Hz, respectively. The only structure that could afford such a coupling pattern is a 2,6-disubstituted indole substructure as shown in Fig. 4;i.e. the resonance at 6.58 ppm, 6.60 ppm, and 7.19 ppm are unambiguously assigned to the protons at C7, C5, and C4, respectively. The NMR spectra were obtained in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pD 7.0) in D2O at 25 °C on a Unity Inova 600 MHz NMR and a Unity plus 600 MHz spectrometer (Varian). The chemical shifts are referred to TSP-d4. The coupling between proton signals at C4 and C5 observed in the COSY spectrum also support the assignment. Furthermore, the correlation of the C4–H with Cα–H (4.14 ppm) and Cβ–H (2.65 ppm) is observed by the ROESY experiments. The combination of the COSY, ROESY, and TOCSY methods allows us the complete assignment for the fragment A as summarized in TableII. Essentially the same assignment can be applied to the interpretation for the NMR spectra of B′. Two doublet signals at 6.36 ppm (J = 2.5 Hz) and 6.91 ppm (J = 8.5 Hz) are assigned to the C7 and C4 protons of the modified Trp-43 in B′, respectively, and the resonance at 6.26 ppm (J = 8.5, 2.5 Hz) is derived from C5-H (Table I). Therefore, the tryptophan residue in the fragmentB′ (W*DR) also must have the 2,6-disubstituted indole substructure (Fig. 4). The coupling pattern in the 1H NMR spectrum of the fragment B is essentially the same as those observed in A and B′ spectra. The NMR spectra were obtained in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pD 7.0) in D2O at 25 °C on a Unity Inova 600 MHz NMR and a Unity plus 600 MHz spectrometer (Varian). The chemical shifts are referred to TSP-d4. Amino acid sequence and composition analyses provided us with a clue to identify the structural differences in the modified tryptophan of the fragment A and B′. First of all, A does not react with phenylisothiocyanate, and the Edman degradation does not give us any sequence information, while the sequence analysis for B′ shows Trp*-43(not detected)-Asp-44-Arg-45 sequence. Second, amino acid composition analysis of A reveals that the fragment consists of Asp, Arg, Phe, and Lys; however, the tryptophan residue is not identified due to its modification. The results imply that the amino terminus of the fragment A is protected, but the residues except for Trp-43 are intact. To clarify the amino-terminal structure, we have measured 13C NMR of A. The spectrum exhibits a unique signal at 71.1 ppm, which could be assigned as a signal from the hydroxylated carbon atom. Since the fragment A does not contain a serine nor a threonine residue, the comparison of chemical shift for the α carbon in tryptophan (56.1 ppm), indole-3-lactic acid (70.6 ppm), and A (71.1 ppm) suggest that the terminal amino group in A is replaced with the hydroxyl moiety. Thus, we conclude at the moment that the indole substructure in the modified tryptophan is 2,6-dihydro-2-imino-6-oxoindole in A(X=O, Y=NH in Fig. 4) and 2,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxoindole in B terminal (X=Y=O). The proposed structures are consistent with the increase in the 30-Da mass unit with respect to the intact tryptophan. Although further studies are required to clarify the mechanism, a cyclic intermediate generated through the reaction of the terminal amine with the carbonyl carbon atom at the C2 position followed by hydrolysis might be involved to afford 2,6-dihydro-2-imino-6-oxoindole substructure without changing the total mass of the peptide (SchemeFS2). It should be noticed that trypsin somehow recognizes the structural difference in the amino-terminal of pentapeptide A (W*DRFK) and prevents hydrolysis of the carboxyl side of arginine to yieldA′ (W*DR).

Conformational changes in RNA polymerase and DNA strand opening then convert this closed complex to an open complex ready to initiate RNA synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 2deHaseth P.L. Zupancic M.L. Record M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3019-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the initial phase of transcription, many short RNAs are formed without RNA polymerase leaving the promoter (3Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 4Munson L.M. Reznikoff W.S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2081-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Hsu L.M.

This “abortive initiation” phase ends when RNA polymerase moves away from the promoter. The transition to a stable elongation complex is termed promoter escape (6Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7829-7842Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Straney S.B. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 699-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This process is poorly understood, although it can have profound consequences on gene expression (8Qi F. Liu C. Heath L.S. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 71-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter escape requires RNA polymerase both to break its contacts with the promoter and to thread RNA properly through the RNA channel. In prokaryotes, all DNA sequences contacted by RNA polymerase in the initiating complex can affect promoter escape (9Vo N.V. In Vitro Studies of the Transcript Initiation Process by E. coli RNA Polymerase. Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1998Google Scholar). This initial contact region can be divided into two parts, the promoter recognition region (PRR),1 which spans from −60 to the start site (+1), and the initial transcribed sequence (ITS), which spans from +1 to +20. The PRR is composed of the three consensus promoter elements: two conserved hexamers positioned at −10 and −35 bp upstream of the start site of transcription, which form the core promoter; and the UP element, positioned at −40 to −60 from the transcription start site. The conserved hexamers are recognized by one of several ς factors in the cell, with each ς factor conferring unique recognition properties on the multisubunit core RNA polymerase (α2ββ′) conserved among all organisms (reviewed in Ref. 1Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The UP element is found predominantly in strong promoters and is recognized by α (10Estrem S.T. Ross W. Gaal T. Chen Z.W. Niu W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2134-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Strong promoter contacts promote RNA polymerase binding, but may impede promoter escape, with a concomitant increase in the number of smaller “abortive” RNA products per long “productive” transcript (9Vo N.V. In Vitro Studies of the Transcript Initiation Process by E. coli RNA Polymerase. Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1998Google Scholar, 11Ellinger T. Behnke D. Bujard H. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There has been little investigation either of the interactions of the ITS with RNA polymerase or of its role in promoter escape. Knowledge that the ITS affects promoter escape arises from the serendipitous finding by Bujard and co-workers (12Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) nearly 15 years ago. They fused a synthetic ITS to the PRR of the strong bacteriophage T5 N25 promoter and found that gene expression decreased 10-fold both in vivo and in vitro (12Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). They called this synthetic ITS “anti” and found that it could be fused to several different strong promoters with similar effects, indicating that it is a portable element (12Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Later, Chamberlin and co-workers (5Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11588-11592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) showed that the anti-sequence decreased promoter strength by impeding promoter escape. At most promoters, 10 nt is the maximum length of abortive transcripts observed. However, promoters with the anti-ITS accumulate both typical abortive transcripts as well as longer transcripts that reach a maximum size of 16 nt (5Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11588-11592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The 13–15-nt transcripts observed at promoters with an anti-ITS have been presumed to be abortive transcripts since they accumulate with time, cannot be chased into longer transcripts, and appear to be released from the transcription complex (13Hsu L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probability of proceeding to a productive transcript at these positions is quite small, suggesting that inability to escape the promoter is correlated with production of these unusual 13–15-nt transcripts (13Hsu L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanistic basis of the anti-ITS effect will provide a basis for understanding the general role of the ITS in promoter escape. We considered two classes of explanations for the ability of the anti-ITS to prevent promoter escape. First, some property of the RNA/DNA hybrid formed by the ITS might be responsible. For example, the stability of this RNA/DNA hybrid might somehow sabotage promoter escape. Alternatively, an aberrant interaction between this RNA/DNA hybrid and core RNA polymerase could impede escape. This is feasible since both the β and β′ core RNA polymerase subunits cross-link to the RNA/DNA hybrid (14Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Malhotra A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Science. 2000; 289: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Second, interactions of RNA polymerase with some other feature of the ITS might impede promoter escape. For example, at the λPR′ promoter, an interaction between ς and the non-template strand of the ITS pauses RNA polymerase, which allows time for the λQ protein to modify the elongation complex, rendering it insensitive to termination signals (15Ring B.Z. Yarnell W.S. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 485-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study is to distinguish between these two possibilities. Contrary to the predictions of a model in which the effects of the anti-ITS are mediated through the stability of the RNA/DNA hybrid or its interactions with core RNA polymerase, we found that the effect of the anti-ITS is ς-specific. Although the anti-ITS inhibits promoter escape at all strong ς70 promoters tested, it does not do so when placed downstream of the strongest PRR recognized by another ς factor, ς32. Moreover, a specific set of ς70 mutants defective in interacting with core RNA polymerase eliminates the negative effects of the anti-ITS on promoter escape. Interestingly, these same mutants abolish the ITS transcriptional pause mediated by ς70 that is required for λQ function at the PR′ promoter. Finally, bases important for the anti-ITS function are positioned similarly in the anti- and λPR′ promoters. We propose that the effect of the anti-ITS is mediated, at least in part, by an interaction between ς and the non-template strand of the ITS. Dinucleotides were purchased from Sigma, radionucleotides from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and NTPs from Stratagene. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Core RNA polymerase was purified by the methods of Burgess and Jendrisak (16Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J.

N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged wild-type and mutant ς70factors were purified as described (18Sharp M.M. Chan C.L. Lu C.Z. Marr M.T. Nechaev S. Merritt E.W. Severinov K. Roberts J.W. Gross C.A.

Chan C.L. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22282-22294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This minimized differences in DNA sequence upstream of the promoter and downstream of +15 and allowed use of the same pair of primers to polymerase chain reaction amplify DNA fragments for use in transcription reactions. Plasmids pDS3 and pDS31 were the source for the N25 promoter with either the N25 ITS or the anti-ITS, respectively (12Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H.

The plasmids that contain templates D–G in Fig. 1 were constructed from pCL430, a derivative of pCL185 that contains the groEL promoter fused to the ITS from the T7 A1 promoter and a BsrGI site engineered upstream of the −10 region. Oligonucleotides with the sequences of templates D–G shown in Fig. 1 were cloned between theBsrGI and BamHI sites of pCL430. 2Plasmids or further construction details are available upon request. All plasmids constructed for this study were sequenced. Holoenzyme was reconstituted by incubating core RNA polymerase and a 5-fold molar excess of ς in transcription buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween) at 37 °C for 20 min in a minimum volume of at least 20 μl. Transcription reactions were initiated by diluting holoenzyme 4-fold with a mixture of DNA and NTPs in transcription buffer (e.g.5 μl of RNA polymerase was added to 15 μl of DNA/NTP mixture). The ratio of RNA polymerase to DNA was 2:1 for multiple-round reactions and 4:1 for reactions in which stalled complexes were made. DNA was present at a final concentration of 100 nm in multiple-round experiments and 50 nm in single-round experiments. Linear DNA fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction that contained a minimum of 100 bp of DNA upstream and 60 bp downstream of the transcription start site were used in all in vitrotranscription reactions. Multiple-round reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and reactions to assemble stalled complexes were incubated for 20 min. For each multiple-round transcription experiment, two reactions were performed in parallel, one in which transcripts were end-labeled with 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol) and a second reaction in which transcripts were internally labeled with 50 μm [α-32P]GTP (20 Ci/mmol). The other two nucleotides were present at 100 μm each; and for some reactions, 50 μm [α-32P]UTP (20 Ci/mmol) was substituted for 50 μm [α-32P]GTP (20 Ci/mmol). Internally labeled reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution (7 m urea, TBE (890 mm Tris, 890 mm borate, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), 0.25% xylene cyanol, 0.25% bromphenol blue); end-labeled reactions were stopped by adding a 0.2 volume (5 μl) of EDTA stop solution (50 mm EDTA, 0.35 m sodium acetate, and 0.5 mg/ml glycogen). The end-labeled RNA was precipitated by adding 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol, and the recovered RNA was washed with 80% ethanol, dried in vacuo, and resuspended in 0.5× stop solution. Stalled complexes were generated to assess the activity of ς preparations. The yield of stalled transcripts confirmed that all of the ς preparations for which values are reported in Fig. 4 were of comparable activity. A dinucleotide present at 250 μm and three other NTPs present at 10 μm each were used to initiate transcription that would stall at the first occurrence of the missing NTP. Transcripts were labeled with [α-32P]ATP (N25 promoter), [α-32P]CTP (groEL promoter), or [α-32P]GTP (either template) at a specific activity of 40 Ci/mmol. ApU and a subset of NTPs were used to form complexes that stall at +18 on the N25 promoter (see Fig. 1, template A), whereas CpA and a subset of NTPs were required to form complexes that initiate at −1 and stall at +18 on the groEL promoter (see Fig. 1, template C). Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution. To determine if transcription at the groELpromoter starts at the A marked as +1 in Fig. 1, as previously reported (21Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), RNA transcripts from a multiple-round reaction were labeled with either [γ-32P]ATP or [α-32P]CTP, and the mobility of the abortive products was the same as that of the stalled complexes, demonstrating that +1 is the natural start site (data not shown). Samples were heat-denatured and electrophoresed through a 20% denaturing 7 murea/TBE-acrylamide gel (9:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) and visualized by autoradiography, and the products were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). If the yield of the abortive and runoff products is known, then the probability that a transcript will abort rather than extend to the next position, defined here as abortive probability, can be calculated from the following equation (13Hsu L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar):Pi=Xii=full lengthΣXii=iEquation 1 where Pi is the probability at theith position and Xi is the yield of transcript at the ith position. After normalizing for the specific activity of the transcripts, the abortive probability profile was not found to vary at positions beyond +3 irrespective of how the transcripts were labeled (e.g. [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]UTP, or [α-32P]GTP), length of incubation time (e.g. 5 or 20 min), or whether transcription was initiated with a dinucleotide and stalled by withholding an NTP (e.g. at +18 for the N25 promoter) (data not shown). The means ± S.D. of the observed abortive probability from at least 10 independent different experiments for wild-type ς70and at least three independent experiments for the ς70mutants are reported in Figs. 2 and 4. To determine the effect of the ITS on promoter escape, we used multiple-round transcription assays to examine the promoter escape properties of a series of synthetic promoters with varying ITS regions in the context of a constant PRR. The multiple-round transcription reactions fulfilled two criteria: 1) products accumulated throughout the time course of the assay, and 2) very few transcribing complexes were “moribund” (committed solely to the production of abortive products) (data not shown and Ref. 22Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The RNA products were either end-labeled, allowing visualization of every abortive product, or internally labeled, allowing visualization of only those abortive products containing the labeled base. Use of different internal labels allowed accurate assignment of the identity of the different abortive products. RNA products were separated by size and quantified, allowing us to calculate the probability that transcription would abort at each position. We refer to this quantity as the abortive probability, which has been defined by Hsu (13Hsu L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 59-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as follows: moles of transcript at any position divided by total moles of transcript of a size equal to or greater than the chosen position. We acknowledge that the short transcripts in question may or may not be true abortive products as defined by two criteria: 1) release from the transcription complex and 2) reestablishment of an open complex that is capable of reinitiating transcription. Each experiment consisted of two independent reactions performed in parallel, one end-labeled and a second internally labeled. After correcting for differences in the specific activity of the transcripts, we found that abortive probability was unaffected by choice of label. In another protocol, we assembled stalled elongation complexes by priming with a dinucleotide and withholding one of the substrates. The abortive probabilities at all positions except +3 were the same as those observed in multiple-round experiments (data not shown). Thus, the abortive probability at each position is a highly reproducible profile of promoter escape and allows comparison of different reactions. This measure is insensitive to factors that can affect the total yield of products such as DNA or RNA polymerase concentration since the products are normalized to the amount of productive transcript. The ITS initially defined by Bujard and co-workers (12Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) changed bases from +3 to +20. As Vo and Chamberlin found that positions downstream of +15 are unimportant for anti-function (9Vo N.V. In Vitro Studies of the Transcript Initiation Process by E. coli RNA Polymerase. Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1998Google Scholar), we fused two ITS sequences, one with N25 sequences from +3 to +14 (Fig. 1, template A) and a second with anti-sequences from +3 to +14 (Fig. 1, template B), to the N25 PRR (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this study, these modified ITS constructs are called “N25 ITS” and “anti-ITS,” respectively. Transcription of the hybrid promoter containing the N25 PRR and the anti-ITS produced many short transcripts that were unusually long and very little runoff RNA (Fig.2A, lanes 3 and4). In contrast, transcription from the promoter with the N25 ITS produced fewer and shorter transcripts as well as abundant runoff RNA (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). The abortive probability profile for transcription from these two promoters is shown in Fig. 2B. For the promoter with the N25 ITS, the three largest short transcripts are 8, 9, and 10 nucleotides long; the probability of aborting at each of these positions is ∼40%. In contrast, for the promoter with an anti-ITS, the three largest short transcripts are 13, 14, and 15 nucleotides long, and the abortive probability at each of the last two positions is very high. At position 14, the probability that transcription will not advance is almost 90%; and at position 15, the probability is 60%. The high probability that transcription will not advance at +14 causes a strong block to elongation and decreases the amount of productive transcript synthesized. Thus, at the anti-ITS promoter, accumulation of transcripts between 13 and 15 nucleotides in length appears to be a diagnostic characteristic of the ability of the anti-ITS to impede promoter escape. We wished to determine whether the effect of the anti-ITS was specific to ς70 or could affect promoters recognized by other ς factors. We reasoned that if the effect of the anti-ITS was mediated by an interaction with ς, then an alternative ς factor recognizing a different sequence might not be able to mediate anti-ITS function. We chose to use ς32 because its −10 consensus sequence differs significantly from that of ς70 promoters and because its promoters were of comparable strength to ς70 promoters (23Cowing D.W. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Cowing D.W. Bardwell J.C.A. Craig E.A. Woolford C. Hendrix R.W. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2679-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This latter requirement came from the observation that a strong PRR is required for the anti-ITS to impede promoter escape. For example, the anti-ITS is unable to impede promoter escape on ς70 PRRs that either are deleted of the UP element or have a severely disabled −10 consensus sequence (9Vo N.V. In Vitro Studies of the Transcript Initiation Process by E. coli RNA Polymerase. Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1998Google Scholar). We considered five different ς32 promoters (groEL, dnaK P1, dnaK P2,htpG, and rpoD phs), all of which are strong ς32 promoters, are comparable in strength to strong ς70 promoters, and contain UP elements in addition to their −10 and −35 consensus sequences (10Estrem S.T. Ross W. Gaal T. Chen Z.W. Niu W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2134-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We investigated the strength of these five ς32-dependent promoters by both nitrocellulose filter binding and in vitrotranscription (25Deuschle U. Kammerer W. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2987-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Of these, the groEL promoter was the strongest (data not shown) and was therefore chosen for these experiments. Our initial experiment compared transcription from the authentic ς32groEL promoter (Fig. 1, template F) with that from hybrid promoters with the PRR of groEL and either the N25 ITS (template G) or the anti-ITS (template H). During transcription from the authentic groEL promoter, few abortive transcripts of any size and no abnormally long abortive products were synthesized (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and6). Neither the N25 ITS (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8) nor the anti-ITS (lanes 9 and10) produced any abnormally long abortive products in the context of the groEL PRR. Furthermore, both hybrid promoters produced equivalent amounts of productive transcript, indicating that the anti-ITS does not impede promoter escape. This experiment suggests that although the anti-ITS impedes promoter escape from the N25 PRR (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), it does not affect promoter escape directed by the groEL PRR (lanes 9 and 10). One caveat to this experiment is that both the sequence and length of the region located between the −10 consensus sequence and the transcription start site differ in the ς32groEL PRR and ς70 N25 PRR. Since this region of the PRR affects abortive transcription (9Vo N.V. In Vitro Studies of the Transcript Initiation Process by E. coli RNA Polymerase. Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1998Google Scholar), sequence differences here could account for the inability of the anti-ITS to affect promoter escape from groEL. To investigate this possibility, we constructed a new hybrid PRR that contained the groEL sequence only through −8 and the N25 sequence from −7 to +1 and fused it to either the N25 ITS (template I) or the anti-ITS (template J). Again, no 13–15-nt transcripts were observed for either template, and promoter escape was unaffected (data not shown). We conclude that the anti-ITS is unable to block promoter escape from the groEL PRR. As groEL is one of the strongest ς32 promoters, this experiment suggests that the anti-ITS is likely to be ineffective at all ς32promoters. The inability of the anti-ITS to affect promoter escape from a strong ς32promoter raised the possibility that the effect of the anti-ITS was specific to ς70. The simplest explanation for such specificity is that a specific interaction between the anti-ITS and ς70 mediates its effects on promoter escape. The ς70-ITS interaction required for λQ function provides precedent for such an idea and also led us to consider the possibility that the same surface of ς70 is required for both functions. A region of ς70 required for λQ function was first identified by Roberts and co-workers (26Ko D.C. Marr M.T. Guo J. Roberts J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3276-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in a screen for ς70 mutants defective in λQ function (Fig.3B, residues inpink). Interestingly, this region is coincident with a cluster of mutations that we had identified in a selection for ς70 mutants defective in binding to core RNA polymerase (Fig. 3B, residues in blue) (18Sharp M.M. Chan C.L. Lu C.Z. Marr M.T. Nechaev S. Merritt E.W. Severinov K. Roberts J.W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Locating the positions of the amino acids encoded by these mutations on the crystallized fragment of ς70 indicates that these amino acids lie along a single surface of ς70 (Fig.3B) (27Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). All of the ς70 mutants within this cluster that have been tested for λQ function are impaired (18Sharp M.M. Chan C.L. Lu C.Z. Marr M.T. Nechaev S. Merritt E.W. Severinov K. Roberts J.W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Ko D.C. Marr M.T. Guo J. Roberts J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3276-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The defect in λQ function is a particular property of the binding-defective ς70 mutants from this surface of ς70; ς70 mutants defective in core binding elsewhere in ς70 do not show this phenotype (18Sharp M.M. Chan C.L. Lu C.Z. Marr M.T. Nechaev S. Merritt E.W. Severinov K. Roberts J.W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For example, P504A has a decreased affinity for core, but does not affect the ability of λQ to modify the transcription complex. We investigated whether the same region of ς70 required for λQ function is also required for response to the anti-ITS. We examined the promoter escape behavior of four ς70 core binding-defective mutants altered in the cluster of residues previously identified to be important forλQ function. In addition, we examined the promoter escape behavior of a single core binding-defective mutant from each of the other regions of ς70 (Fig.3A). We found that the binding-defective ς70mutants altering the cluster of residues required forλQ function were unable to mediate anti-ITS function, i.e. in these mutants, escape from a promoter with an anti-ITS was not impeded. In contrast, binding-defective mutants from other regions of ς70 had no effect on anti-ITS function. A representative transcription profile of one ς70 mutant of each type is shown in Fig.3C. Accumulation of transcripts 13–15 nt in size is diagnostic of the anti-ITS phenotype. We therefore compared the abortive probability for each mutant ς (Fig. 4A,colored bars) with that for wild-type ς (black bars surrounding the data for mutant ς proteins) at transcript positions 12–15. Mutational alteration of the cluster of residues associated with λQ function (Q406A, D403A, E407K, L384A, and E407A) showed"

Although SP-D can bind to alveolar macrophages and can elicit their chemotaxis, relatively little is known about the direct cellular consequences of SP-D on the function of these cells. Because matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are synthesized in increased amounts in response to various proinflammatory stimuli, we investigated the capacity of SP-D to modulate the production of MMPs by freshly isolated human alveolar macrophages. Unexpectedly we found that recombinant rat SP-D dodecamers selectively induce the biosynthesis of collagenase-1 (MMP-1), stromelysin (MMP-3), and macrophage elastase (MMP-12) without significantly increasing the production of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1β. SP-D did not alter the production of these MMPs by fibroblasts. Phosphatidylinositol, a surfactant-associated ligand that interacts with the carboxyl-terminal neck and carbohydrate recognition domains of SP-D, inhibited the SP-D-dependent increase in MMP biosynthesis. A trimeric, recombinant protein consisting of only the neck and carbohydrate recognition domain did not augment metalloproteinase production, suggesting that the stimulatory effect on MMP production depends on an appropriate spatial presentation of trimeric lectin domains. Although SP-D dodecamers can selectively augment metalloproteinase activity in vitro, this effect may be competitively inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases or surfactant-associated ligands in vivo.

Rev. 2000; 173: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition to membership in this family of immune mediators, there is growing evidence suggesting that SP-D can act as a mediator of host defense within the alveolar spaces and distal airways of the lung. SP-D is secreted as a homotrimer, each trimer consisting of four structural domains: the amino-terminal, cysteine-rich, cross-linking region; the triple-helical collagenous domain; the coiled-coil “neck” (or linking) region; and the globular, carboxyl-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (1Crouch E.C. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). While trimerization is sufficient for some of the functions of the protein, SP-D in the alveolar space exists predominantly as a dodecamer, consisting of four identical homotrimeric subunits. This higher order multimerization is thought to mediate bridging interactions, enabling simultaneous interaction with multiple binding partners. Trimerization is required for high affinity SP-D binding to various carbohydrate ligands, and the association with glycoconjugates on bacterial, fungal, and viral surfaces has been attributed to the trimeric CRD region of SP-D (1Crouch E.C. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4Holmskov U.L. APMIS Suppl. 2000; 100: 1-59PubMed Google Scholar). These carbohydrate-mediated interactions have been suggested to assist in the clearance of pathogens and of certain organic particulate antigens. In addition to carbohydrates, the SP-D carboxyl-terminal domain is also capable of binding to the surfactant lipid phosphatidylinositol in part via the inositol moiety of the lipid (5Ogasawara Y.

SP-D elicits directional polymerization of F-actin to regulate macrophage chemotaxis, may induce the production of superoxide radicals (11Tino M.J. Wright J.R. Am. J.

Macrophages are known to mediate host defense by their production of inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and toxic oxygen metabolites. These cells also have the capacity to secrete several members of the matrix metalloproteinase family including collagenase-1 (MMP-1, Ref. 16Cury J.D. Campbell E.J. Lazarus C.J. Albin R.J. Welgus H.G.

While the activity of these proteinases likely contributes to both the host defense function of macrophages and to normal tissue remodeling and repair, ectopic or excessive MMP proteolysis has been associated with several pathological conditions including arthritis, cancer growth and metastasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (20McCachren S.S.

By contrast with the more generalized activation response elicited by bacterial LPS, SP-D dodecamers caused a selective increase in the production of specific MMPs without concomitant stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine secretion. These effects were dependent on the state of multimerization of the SP-D CRDs and were inhibited with phosphatidylinositol. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. unless otherwise indicated. All radioisotopes were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Recombinant rat SP-D was isolated as described previously (28Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO-K1 cells were transfected with a full-length rat SP-D cDNA in the pEE14 mammalian expression vector. Cells were selected for incorporation of the plasmid, cloned by serial dilution, and screened for production of recombinant protein. Conditioned medium from a clonal population was harvested and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA. The dialysate was recalcified and applied to a maltosyl-agarose column equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline containing 2 mm calcium chloride. The column was washed with the same buffer prior to elution of the bound protein with Tris-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA. SP-D dodecamers were then resolved from larger multimers and minor lower molecular weight contaminants by gel filtration chromatography under nondenaturing conditions as described previously (28Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining, and proteins in the desired fractions were concentrated by rechromatography on maltosyl-agarose. For most studies, the bound protein was eluted with Hepes-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA and was stored at −80 °C. Recombinant rat SP-D CRD containing an amino-terminal His6tag was expressed in Escherichia coli (29Vuk-Pavlovic A. Crouch E.C. Limper A.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: A108Google Scholar) and was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Characterization of the recombinant protein indicated that it self-associated to form trimers as it was eluted from a gel filtration column at the size expected for a trimeric protein. Carbohydrate binding activity of the recombinant CRD was confirmed by its ability to bind maltosyl-agarose. Previous studies have shown that these trimeric mutants retain their ability to elicit chemotaxis and to bind various microbial ligands in vitro (30Cai G.Z. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. Longmore W.J. Moxley M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L131-L136PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hartshorn K.L. White M.R. Voelker D.R. Coburn J. Zaner K. Crouch E.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The level of endotoxin contamination for both recombinant proteins was quantified using a sensitive, end point chromogenic microplate assay (Chromogenix, Gothenberg, Sweden) with E. coliO111:B4 endotoxin as a standard. The endotoxin content of the purified recombinant proteins used for these experiments was <2 ng/ml or <∼10 pg/μg SP-D for our stock solutions. For individual assays, the stock was further diluted at least 25-fold in endotoxin-free medium, giving final endotoxin concentrations of <80 pg/ml, several orders of magnitude less than the amount associated with detectable macrophage activation in our system. Human alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage of healthy adult volunteer cigarette smokers (minimum, 1 pack/day). For each harvest, 600 ml of sterile saline was introduced and recovered from the right middle lobe and lingular subsegment as described previously (32Senior R.M. Campbell E.J. Villiger B. Adams D.O. Edelson P.J. Koren H.S. Methods for Studying Mononuclear Phagocytes. Academic Press, New York1981: 69-83Crossref Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 (DMEM/F12, 1:1, v/v, BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) before plating in Linbro six-well plates (Flow Laboratories, Inc., McLean, VA) at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml/well. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1–3 h in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) after which the medium was changed to DMEM/F12 containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). This treatment resulted in a population of cells that were >98% macrophages. Cells were then left untreated or were treated with experimental reagents as indicated and were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. In the case of SP-D preincubation with lipids, recombinant protein was mixed with chloroform-solubilized lipid (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) in a microcentrifuge tube and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 min prior to addition to cells. Human peripheral blood monocytes were obtained from healthy volunteers. Cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation followed by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation of the mononuclear layer in a Beckman J2–21 centrifuge as described previously (33Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1968; 97: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated monocytes were plated in six-well plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml/well. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1–3 h after which medium was changed to DMEM/F12 containing 5% FBS. Cells were then left untreated or were treated with LPS (2.5 μg/ml) or SP-D (5 μg/ml) and were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. In vitro differentiation of macrophages from peripheral blood monocytes was accomplished by culturing isolated cells for 7 days in DMEM supplemented with glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% autologous human serum with only one medium change at day 1 postplating. Human fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection no. CRL 1905) were plated in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2. When cells reached confluence (∼3 days postplating), the media were changed to DMEM containing 5% FBS, and cells were then left untreated or were treated with LPS (2.5 μg/ml), SP-D (10 μg/ml), or PMA (20 ng/ml). Human alveolar macrophages were obtained and plated in six-well plates as described above. 1–3 h postplating, media were changed, and cells were left untreated or were treated with SP-D (10 μg/ml). Media were harvested at the indicated times, nonadherent cells were removed by centrifugation, and media samples were stored at −80 °C until assayed. An immunosorbent assay was used to measure collagenase-1 protein in the macrophage-conditioned medium after 72 h and to determine the time course of collagenase-1 induction (34Cooper T.W. Bauer E.A. Eisen A.Z. Collagen Relat. Res. 1983; 3: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For measurement of macrophage cytokine production, cells were left untreated or were incubated in the presence of either LPS (2.5 μg/ml) or SP-D (5 μg/ml). Media were harvested at 48 h post-treatment and stored at −80 °C until assayed. Human TNFα and IL-1β immunoassay kits were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and were used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Human alveolar macrophages were obtained, plated, and maintained overnight as described above. At 24 h postplating, media were aspirated, and cells were starved in serum-free, methionine-free DMEM/F12. After 1 h, media were again aspirated, and newly synthesized proteins were metabolically labeled by incubating the cells in methionine-free DMEM/F12 containing 5% dialyzed FBS to which 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) had been added. Human peripheral blood monocytes were labeled 24 h postisolation and plating as for the macrophages above. In all cases, cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 h before radiolabeled media were harvested for immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled proteins. Radiolabeled conditioned media were diluted 1:1 with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.8% Triton X-100. Samples were then “precleared” to diminish nonspecifically binding proteins by rotating end-over-end for 1 h at room temperature with 45 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Protein A-Sepharose was removed by centrifugation, and media were transferred to new tubes containing polyclonal antibody for collagenase-1 (35Stricklin G.P. Bauer E.A. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), 92-kDa gelatinase (36Wilhelm S.M. Collier I. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). 35 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose was added to each tube, and immunoprecipitations were allowed to proceed by rotation end-over-end overnight at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed four times with detergent buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 0.25% deoxycholate, 2 mmEDTA, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 10–12% polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were fixed, treated with En3Hance (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and dried before visualization of immunoprecipitated proteins by fluorography. Human alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage as described above were plated in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Costar, Corp., Cambridge, MA) at a density of 3 × 107 cells/flask. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1–3 h after which media were replaced. Cells were then left untreated or were treated with LPS (2.5 μg/ml) or SP-D (10 μg/ml). Approximately 26 h postplating (24 h post-treatment), media were aspirated, and RNA was isolated using TRIZOL total RNA isolation reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Human fibroblasts were cultured and treated with LPS, SP-D, or PMA as described above. Approximately 24 h post-treatment, media were aspirated, and RNA was isolated using TRIZOL total RNA isolation reagent as described above. Total RNA was separated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel containing 1 m formaldehyde as described previously (39Pierce R.A. Kolodziej M.E. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11593-11599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal loading and RNA integrity were confirmed by staining with ethidium bromide. RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer and was cross-linked to the filter by drying under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h. The filter was prehybridized for 1 h at 65 °C in a buffer containing 250 mm Na2HPO4, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Hybridization was performed in the same buffer under the same conditions overnight. cDNA probes for collagenase-1 (40Goldberg B.D. Wilhelm S.M. Kronberger A. Bauer E.A. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6600-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and β-actin were random prime-labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Redivue labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Following hybridization, the filter was washed three times (10 min/wash) in a buffer containing 40 mmNa2HPO4, 1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA at 60 °C. The filter was exposed overnight at −80 °C to Kodak XAR-5-Omat film. Although activated macrophages have the capacity to produce several matrix metalloproteinases, unstimulated cells secrete nearly undetectable levels of several MMPs, including collagenase-1 (Ref. 18Welgus H.G. Campbell E.J. Cury J.C. Eisen A.Z. Senior R.M. Wilhelm S.M. Goldberg G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar; Fig.1, lane 1). MMP synthesis by macrophages is induced upon their activation as evidenced by collagenase-1 secretion after treatment with lipopolysaccharide (Fig.1, lane 2). Incubation with purified recombinant SP-D also induces biosynthesis of collagenase-1 by alveolar macrophages in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, lanes 3–5). Maximal stimulation was in the physiologically relevant range of 1–10 μg/ml SP-D (11Tino M.J. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L164-L174PubMed Google Scholar). Even 1 μg/ml SP-D resulted in collagenase-1 production roughly equivalent to that seen with maximal LPS stimulation. It should be noted that, based upon electrophoretic mobility, treatment with either reagent yielded the catalytically active form of the metalloproteinase. Northern analysis of total cellular RNA demonstrated induction of collagenase-1 steady-state mRNA levels by SP-D (Fig. 2).Figure 2Effect of SP-D on collagenase-1 steady-state mRNA levels. Panel a, macrophages were cultured in the presence of no agent (lane 1), LPS (lane 2), PMA (lane 3), and SP-D (lane 4). Total cellular RNA was isolated, and a Northern blot was performed. Panel bshows the ethidium bromide-stained gel prior to transfer, indicating that each lane contains similar amounts of total RNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A time course of collagenase-1 secretion was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with SP-D-treated, macrophage-conditioned medium. Fig. 3shows that no collagenase-1 was detected during the first 4 h of treatment. Secretion increased linearly after 24 h post-treatment, yielding a final production that was calculated to be 0.95 μg of collagenase-1/106 cells/24 h. In addition to collagenase-1 secretion, alveolar macrophages can synthesize and secrete several additional metalloproteinases, including gelatinase B (92-kDa gelatinase or MMP-9), stromelysin (MMP-3), and macrophage elastase (MMP-12). Under in vitro culture conditions, MMP-9 is secreted constitutively, while MMP-3 and -12 are synthesized following treatment with an activating agent such as LPS. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess whether the biosynthesis of these proteinases was also modulated in response to SP-D. Fig.4 indicates that production of both MMP-3 and -12 were induced by SP-D treatment (Fig. 4, panels C andB, respectively), while the biosynthesis of MMP-9 was unchanged (Fig. 4, panel A). Macrophage activation, as classically defined by tumoricidal and phagocytic capacity, is fully induced by treatment with both LPS and interferon γ. LPS alone induces macrophage production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide (41Salvemini D. Mollace V. Pistelli A. Anggard E. Vane J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 982-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) as well as secretion of various inflammatory mediators including TNFα and IL-1β (42Hempel S.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). SP-D treatment of macrophages has also been reported to induce the production of reactive oxygen (12Van Iwaarden J.F. Shimizu H. Van Golde P.H. Voelker D.R. Van Golde L.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) but does not significantly increase the production of nitric oxide in the absence of contaminating endotoxin (43Wright J.R. Zlogar D.F. Taylor J.C. Zlogar T.M. Restrepo C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L650-L658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the ability of SP-D to induce a more generalized cellular activation, secretion of both TNFα and IL-1β were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays following exposure of alveolar macrophages to either recombinant surfactant protein or optimal concentrations of LPS. Results for each of these assays are shown in Fig.5. As expected, LPS induced a significant increase in the production of both TNFα and IL-1β. By contrast, neither cytokine was significantly up-regulated in response to SP-D. While MMPs are secreted by a number of different cell types, the mediators that regulate production are often cell-specific. To investigate the cell type specificity of the SP-D response, interstitial fibroblasts, peripheral blood monocytes and macrophages derived from in vitro differentiation of monocytes were treated with the surfactant protein, and immunoprecipitation assays for MMPs were performed. The results shown in Fig.6 demonstrate that in contrast to both alveolar and in vitro differentiated macrophages of nonsmokers, peripheral blood monocytes do not secrete MMP-1 and minimal amounts of MMP-12 after stimulation with SP-D (but not LPS) (not shown). Fibroblasts do not produce MMP-1 in response to SP-D. Fibroblasts do, however, synthesize this proteinase in response to treatment with PMA (Fig. 6, panel a, lane 2). To further characterize the mechanism of MMP induction, we examined the effects of a known competing ligand, phosphatidylinositol (PI), on macrophage MMP biosynthesis. The interactions of SP-D with PI have been well characterized and are mediated by the carboxyl-terminal domain of SP-D and, at least in part, by the inositol moiety of the lipid (5Ogasawara Y.

In solution, the electron-withdrawing nitro groups of both compounds establish a resonance equilibrium that appears to stabilize the keto form of one of the cyclic amide carbonyl bonds. Changes in the 6,7-dinitro-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline vibrational spectra on binding to the glutamate receptor, interpreted within the framework of a published crystal structure, illuminate the stereochemistry of the interaction and suggest that the binding site imposes a more polarized electronic bonding configuration on this antagonist. Similar spectral changes are observed for 6-cyano-7-dinitro-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline, confirming that its interactions with the binding site are highly similar to those of 6,7-dinitro-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline and leading to a model of the 6-cyano-7-dinitro-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline-S1S2 complex, for which no crystal structure is available. Conformational changes within the GluR ligand binding domain were also monitored. Compared with the previously reported spectral changes seen on binding of the agonist glutamate, only a relatively small change is detected on antagonist binding.

Glutamate binding triggers the channels to open, permitting cations to flow down their electrochemical gradients, depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane and thereby stimulating the receiving cell. According to agonist affinity profiles, the GluR can be subdivided into three subfamilies: α-amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA),N-methyl-d-aspartate, and kainate receptors (1Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar,2Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3660) Google Scholar). Recent large scale expression of the extracellular ligand binding domains of two AMPA receptor subunits, namely GluR2 and GluR4, has paved the way for a number of structural and spectroscopic investigations. This ligand binding domain, known as S1S2, retains ligand binding parameters quite similar to those of the intact receptor and hence serves as an excellent model to study the ligand-protein interactions of the complete molecule (3Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4Lampinen M. Pentikainen O. Johnson M.S. Keinänen K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21355-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Crystal structures have been determined for the GluR2S1S2 protein in the apo form and in complex with kainate, glutamate, 6,7-dinitro-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline (DNQX), and AMPA (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). These structures indicate that the ligand binding domain is a bilobate structure and that the degree of cleft closure between the two lobes is related to the type of ligand bound to the protein (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Full agonists such as glutamate and α-amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazole propionate induce a 20° closure of the two domains relative to the apo form, whereas the partial agonist kainate induces only a 12° closure of the two domains (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the antagonist DNQX-bound form does not exhibit any large conformational changes relative to the apo form (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the degree of domain closure most likely controls the extent of channel activation, thus providing the first structural insight into the activation mechanism of the glutamate receptors. The interactions of the ligands kainate and glutamate with GluR4-S1S2 have also been investigated using vibrational spectroscopy (8Jayaraman V. Keesey R. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8693-8697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The ability to assign vibrational modes to individual functional groups using site-specific isotopic labeling, coupled with the high inherent sensitivity of these vibrations to the electronic environments of the groups, permitted a detailed investigation of the interactions between each of the carboxylate moieties of the ligands with the protein. Furthermore, the amide I vibrations of the protein backbone, which are sensitive to the secondary structure of the protein, indicated larger and different changes in the protein on binding glutamate relative to kainate, consistent with the crystallographic data (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The spectroscopic results extended the structural information by providing a more detailed picture of the strength of the important interactions between the ligand and protein and within the protein. In this study, we performed similar investigations of the interactions of the antagonists DNQX and 6-cyano-7-nitro-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline (CNQX) with GluR4-S1S2 using vibrational spectroscopy. Because of the presence of electron-withdrawing nitro and cyano substituents, the cyclic amide groups of the free quinoxaline GluR antagonists exist in both delocalized (enol) and localized (keto) bonding configurations; interactions with the GluR binding site specifically stabilize one of these configurations. The DNQX vibrational frequency shifts also provide valuable information on the stereochemistry of the binding interactions and can be used to interpret the published crystal structure of the S1S2-DNQX complex (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). This complex in turn serves as a reference for modeling the interactions in the CNQX complex, which has not been structurally characterized but which we have analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the structures of DNQX, CNQX, and the isotopomers used in this study. The isotopomers of DNQX were synthesized using the following reaction scheme. Equimolar quantities of o-phenylenediamine and either oxalic acid or 1,2-13C-oxalic acid (Campro Scientific) were condensed in 4 n hydrochloric acid under reflux to 2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline or 2,3-13C2-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline, respectively. The recrystallized (ethanol) products were nitrated in concentrated H2SO4using KNO3 at temperatures increasing from 0 °C to room temperature. The mononitrated products were isolated and purified and subjected to a second nitration step under identical conditions. 2,3-Dihydroxyquinoxaline was 15N-labeled by two-step nitration with K15NO3. The labeled and unlabeled 6,7-dinitro-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxalines were stirred in ethanol (absolute, twice), filtered, and dried. 7-15NO2-CNQX was prepared by nitration of 6-cyano-2,3-dihydroxyquinoxaline in 98% H2SO4with a large excess of K15NO3 at 0 °C. 1H NMR spectra (500 MHz, dimethylsulfoxide-d6) exhibited the expected resonances for the isotopomers of DNQX (S, 2H, 7.718 ppm; and S, (−OH)2, 12.448 ppm) and CNQX (S, 1H, 7.558 ppm; D, 1H, 8.038–8.043 ppm; S, −OH, 12.432 ppm; and S, −OH, 12.472 ppm). The chemical purity of the isotopomers was >99%. Mass spectra revealed the expected peak at m/z 254 for both 2,3-13C2-DNQX and 6,7-(15NO2)2-DNQX, with 99 and 95% isotopic purity, respectively, and the expected peak at m/z233 for 7-15NO2-CNQX, with 95% isotopic purity. The GluR4-S1S2 protein was expressed, purified, and characterized as described (9Madden D.R. Abele R. Andersson A. Keinänen K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, S1S2 was expressed as a secreted construct in the baculovirus system. After clarification and concentration of the cell-culture supernatant, it was purified to homogeneity by immunoaffinity and ion exchange chromatography. The protein was concentrated and dialyzed to yield a final concentration of 0.25–0.5 mm in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 mmNaCl and 0.02% NaN3. Protein-bound spectra were obtained in the presence of saturating concentrations of DNQX and CNQX. Because water has a large infrared absorption band at ∼1600 cm−1, D2O was used as the solvent to obtain spectra in the 1450–1800 cm−1 region. However, for studying the CN stretching vibration that occurs at ∼2200 cm−1, water was used as the solvent. The FTIR spectra were measured on a Nicolet Magna 870 infrared spectrophotometer using an FTIR cell with CaF2 windows and a 50-μm spacer. Spectra were collected at 4 cm−1 spectral resolution. A modified variable-length sample holder (Aldrich), which allowed liquid from a constant temperature bath to be circulated around the holder, ensured that the protein solutions were kept at a constant temperature of 15 °C. All spectra reported are difference spectra, and the subtraction was performed using the band at 2045 cm−1arising from the sodium azide present in the buffer as an internal standard. Furthermore, for generating the difference spectra between the ligand-bound and apo forms of the protein, the peaks that arise from excess unbound ligand (DNQX, CNQX, and isotopomers thereof) were subtracted using the spectrum of free ligand. The FTIR spectrum of DNQX at pH 7.4 is shown in Fig. 1,trace A. Comparison of the spectrum to spectra of DNQX isotopomers labeled at the carbonyl (13CO-DNQX) or nitro (15NO2-DNQX) positions (Fig. 1, traces B and C, respectively) reveals that the amide, nitro, and aromatic ring moieties of DNQX are the main infrared active chromophores in the 1450–1800 cm−1 region. The assignments are described in detail below and are summarized in TableI.Table IVibrational frequency modes of DNQX and CNQX in D2O and in complex with GluR4 S1S2LigandAmide IAromatic ring stretchAmide IIAsym.

The DNQX bands at 1690 and 1662 cm−1 (Fig. 1, trace A) are downshifted to 1647 and 1624 cm−1, respectively, in 13CO-DNQX (Fig. 1, trace B), indicating that they arise from amide I-type CO stretching vibrations of the DNQX cyclic amide groups (10Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. Wiley, New York1987Google Scholar). The presence of two amide I vibrations suggests that the carbonyl groups in free DNQX at pH 7.4 can adopt multiple bonding configurations, as illustrated in Fig.2. The high and low frequency vibrations would thus correspond, respectively, to strongly (e.g. Fig.2, keto group in Structure I) or weakly (e.g.Fig. 2, partial double bonds in Structures I andII) localized carbonyl double bonds. In the absence of electron-withdrawing substituents, the carbonyl moieties would be expected to be delocalized at neutral pH, but in DNQX the keto form is apparently stabilized by resonance structures (e.g. Fig. 2,Structure I) made possible by the presence of the electron-withdrawing nitro groups. This interpretation is supported by the differential sensitivities of the 1690- and 1662-cm−1 bands to pH (Fig. 2). Increasing the pH from 7.4 to 10 should titrate the amide protons, as illustrated in Fig. 2, Structures III and IV, leaving the carbonyl groups with little or no double bond character. As predicted, at pH 10, no band is observed at 1690 cm−1, whereas a much weaker signal is obtained at 1662 cm−1(Fig. 2, trace B). An accompanying pH-induced shift is observed in the frequency and intensity of the amide II band found at 1547 cm−1 in the pH 7.4 spectrum (Fig. 2, traces A and C), which has been identified on the basis of its frequency and ∼34-cm−1 downshift on 13CO labeling (Fig. 1, trace B). The amide II shifts observed at pH 10 can be attributed to changes in the composition of the band from a hybrid CN stretching and NH bending mode (Fig. 2, Structures I and II), to a predominantly CN stretching vibration (Fig. 2, Structures III and IV, and Ref. 10Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. Wiley, New York1987Google Scholar). The band at 1614 cm−1 in the spectrum of DNQX at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1, trace A) can be assigned to an aromatic ring-breathing mode on the basis of its frequency and its relatively small shift on 13CO labeling (Fig. 1, trace B), which presumably reflects coupling of the benzene and adjacent cyclic amide rings. 15N labeling of the DNQX nitro groups at pH 7.4 downshifts a shoulder on the band at ∼1547 cm−1 (Fig. 1,trace A) to 1510 cm−1 (Fig. 1, trace C). The frequency of the shoulder peak in the unlabeled molecule is 1542 cm−1, as revealed by a shift of the overlapping amide II peak from 1547 to 1513 cm−1 on 13CO labeling (Fig. 2, trace B). On the basis of its frequency and ∼30-cm−1 downshift on 15NO2labeling, the 1542-cm−1 band can be assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of the DNQX nitro groups. The resonance structure invoked above to explain the presence of two DNQX amide I vibrational modes (Fig. 2, Structure I) also implies the existence of two distinct bonding configurations of the nitro groups. However, only a single nitro vibrational mode is detected. One explanation is that there is little difference between the asymmetric vibrational frequencies of the two NO2bonding configurations and that the band observed at 1542 cm−1 represents a hybrid of two unresolved component frequencies. Consistent with this interpretation, an increase in pH from 7.4 to 10 causes the band to shift, but only by 5 cm−1 (data not shown), presumably reflecting selective stabilization of the uncharged form of the nitro moiety (Fig. 2,Structures III and IV). The structures of DNQX and CNQX are very similar, except that a single nitro group in DNQX is replaced by a cyano group in CNQX (Fig. 1). As a result, their spectra are also comparable (Fig. 1, traces A andD), and the assignments made by isotopic labeling of DNQX can be transferred to the CNQX spectrum. The small upshifts in the amide I, amide II, and aromatic ring vibrations of CNQX relative to DNQX (Fig. 1 and Table I) can be attributed to the fact that the CNQX cyano group is less electron-withdrawing than the corresponding DNQX nitro moiety. Like DNQX, free CNQX in solution exhibits dual amide I vibrational modes at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1, trace D), presumably also reflecting the existence of alternative bonding configurations (Fig. 2,Structures I and II). In the case of CNQX,Structure I in Fig. 2 is resolved into two distinct structures by the nonequivalence of the 6 and 7 substituents (Fig.3, Structures I andII). The amide I equilibrium should thus be coupled to the stretching vibration of the CNQX cyano group; the FTIR spectrum exhibits the expected two bands in the region of the CN stretching vibration (Fig. 3, trace A). The frequency of the asymmetric stretching vibration(s) of the single NO2 group of CNQX is revealed by the difference spectrum between CNQX and 15NO2-labeled CNQX (Fig. 1,trace E). The positive band at 1536 cm−1reflects asymmetric vibrations of the unlabeled NO2group. As for DNQX, this mode is likely to represent a hybrid of the component frequencies associated with the two different nitro group configurations shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The FTIR difference spectrum between DNQX-bound protein and apo protein (Fig.4, trace A) reflects changes in the vibrational modes of both DNQX and the protein. Difference spectra have also been obtained between complexes of protein with unlabeled DNQX and with DNQX isotopomers (Fig. 4, traces Band C). Isotopic labeling is essential not only to assign bands to specific DNQX functional group vibrations but also to detect bands that are masked in the unlabeled difference spectrum (e.g. Fig. 4, 1500–1550 cm−1) because of overlap between the protein and DNQX difference features. The assignments of the individual bound vibrational modes are described below and summarized in Table I. In the difference spectrum between DNQX bound to protein and13CO-DNQX bound to protein (Fig. 4, trace B), a positive band at 1689 cm−1 is downshifted by13CO labeling to yield a negative band at 1647 cm−1, indicating that it corresponds to an amide I vibration of bound DNQX. A second positive band at 1540 cm−1 is downshifted by isotopic labeling to 1506 cm−1, suggesting that it corresponds to an amide II vibration. Two small difference features are observed in the difference spectrum between DNQX-bound S1S2 and apo-S1S2 at 1619 and 1597 cm−1 (Fig. 4, trace A). On the basis of their frequency, these have been tentatively assigned to benzene ring vibrations of bound DNQX. The difference spectrum between DNQX bound to protein and15NO2-DNQX bound to protein (Fig. 4,trace C) has two positive overlapping bands at 1545 and 1527 cm−1 which are downshifted by15NO2 labeling to 1514 and 1504 cm−1, respectively, suggesting that they can be assigned to the two NO2 groups of the bound DNQX. As shown in Table I, S1S2 binding clearly affects the vibrational spectra of the DNQX nitro and cyclic amide moieties. Although the difference between the two bonding configurations of the DNQX nitro groups is too small to be resolved in solution, their distinct interactions with the S1S2 binding site upshift one asymmetric stretching vibration slightly and downshift the other significantly. At the carbonyl groups, the interaction with S1S2 simultaneously stabilizes the high frequency (keto) bonding configuration and apparently eliminates the low frequency (enol) configuration observed in free DNQX. Interpreted within the framework of crystallographic data on the S1S2-DNQX complex (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), these spectroscopic data establish the electronic bonding configuration of the bound antagonist and provide the basis for a model of the S1S2-CNQX interaction, which has not yet been structurally characterized. Comparing the dual frequencies of the nitro groups of bound DNQX (1545 and 1527 cm−1) with the corresponding single hybrid frequency (1542 cm−1) of the two nitro groups in free DNQX (Table I), it is evident that one of the bands is downshifted by ∼15 cm−1. This indicates that one of the nitro groups has become more electron-withdrawing, has formed a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the protein, or both. The other band is slightly upshifted by ∼3 cm−1 relative to the hybrid frequency, which would be consistent with a more negative electrostatic environment for the other nitro group in the binding pocket. In the crystal structure of the DNQX-bound GluR2 ligand binding domain (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), two different complexes are observed in the asymmetric unit. In one complex, a sulfate ion is located in the binding pocket together with the DNQX molecule, causing small but significant rearrangements of both ligand and protein side-chain moieties relative to the second, sulfate-free complex. In the sulfate-bound complex, each DNQX nitro group makes a single weak hydrogen bond to S1S2 (3.4 Å to Tyr-733 and 3.5 Å to Thr-687, respectively, using GluR4 sequence numbering) and another hydrogen bond to a water molecule (2.7 and 3.2 Å, respectively), and each is 3.4–3.7 Å from the closest protein carboxylate moieties (Glu-403 and Glu-706). Approximately equivalent shifts would therefore be expected for the two groups relative to their (overlapping) frequencies in solution, in contrast to the unequal effects seen in the vibrational spectra (Table I). In the sulfate-free complex (Fig.5), the DNQX nitro group that is distal to the S1S2 hinge makes a single 3.0-Å hydrogen bond to Thr-687 in S1S2 and is distant (≥4.5 Å) from both protein carboxylates, so that a downshift of the observed magnitude would be expected for this group. The hinge-proximal nitro group makes hydrogen bonds to Tyr-733 (2.7 Å) and to a water molecule (2.6 Å) but is located 3.2 Å from the negatively charged carboxylate of Glu-403 and 4.3 Å from the Glu-706 carboxylate. The competing influences of these interactions would be consistent with the small upshift we observe for the other nitro group. Our data therefore suggest that the sulfate-free crystal structure more accurately reflects the DNQX complex formed in solution. Furthermore, the negative electrostatic environment (Glu-403 and Glu-706) of the hinge-proximal nitro group causes the hinge-distal nitro group to be more electron-withdrawing, thus favoring the specific DNQX bonding structure shown in Fig. 5. The negative charge on the hinge-distal nitro group imposes a keto configuration on the opposite, hinge-proximal carbonyl group (Fig. 5), consistent with the high frequency amide I band observed in the bound DNQX and CNQX spectra. The localized double bond at the hinge-proximal carbonyl group is also stabilized by the hydrogen-bonding interaction of Pro-479 with the hinge-proximal amide proton (Fig. 5). In parallel, the absence of an enol vibrational mode suggests that a negatively charged single-bonded configuration is induced at the hinge-distal carbonyl group by electrostatic interactions with the nearby positively charged Arg-486 guanidino moiety (2.8 Å). The structure stabilized by the sum of these interactions would therefore exhibit a single, high frequency amide I vibrational mode, as observed. S1S2 binding has broadly similar effects on the distribution of CNQX vibrational frequencies as it does for DNQX. In the FTIR difference spectrum between CNQX-S1S2 and apo-S1S2 (Fig. 4, trace D), the positive bands at 1693 and 1623 cm−1 can be assigned in analogy to the corresponding bands at 1689 and 1619 cm−1in the bound DNQX spectrum. The four-wave number upshift in these vibrations in bound CNQX versus DNQX (Fig. 4) mirrors the similar upshift in the corresponding frequencies of free CNQXversus DNQX caused by the weaker electron-withdrawing character of the CNQX cyano group (Table I). It thus appears that S1S2 binding stabilizes the same carbonyl bonding configuration in CNQX as it does in DNQX, with one single bond and one strongly localized double bond. In the difference spectrum between CNQX bound to protein and15NO2-CNQX bound to protein (Fig. 4,trace E), there is one positive band at 1523 cm−1, which is downshifted to 1500 cm−1 by isotopic labeling of the NO2 moiety. The band at 1523 cm−1 can therefore be assigned to the asymmetric vibrational frequency of the single NO2 group of bound unlabeled CNQX. The cyano stretching vibrational mode of the bound CNQX (Fig. 3, trace B), on the other hand, exhibits a single peak that is upshifted by 4 cm−1 from the highest frequency band of free CNQX. The similar effects of S1S2 binding on the vibrational frequencies of DNQX and CNQX suggest a highly conserved stereochemical interaction of both antagonists with the binding pocket. Within this framework, the behavior of the vibrational frequencies of the CNQX cyano and nitro moieties permits us to identify their likely positions in the S1S2 ligand binding pocket. The 13-cm−1 downshift in the asymmetric vibration of the single CNQX nitro group is comparable with the 15-cm−1 downshift assigned to the hinge-distal nitro group of DNQX. As a result, the CNQX nitro group would be expected to carry a negative charge and to occupy the hinge-distal nitro binding site (Fig. 5). The resulting bonding configuration of S1S2-bound CNQX is also reflected in the behavior of the cyano stretching vibration, for which only a single peak is found, in contrast to the dual peaks observed in the free form (Fig. 3). The high frequency of this peak corresponds to the less conjugated form of the cyano group (Fig. 3,Structure I), consistent with the negative charge being located on the nitro group in the S1S2-bound state (Fig. 5). Furthermore, assuming that the nitro group occupies the hinge-distal position as postulated, the cyano group would have to be placed in the negative electrostatic environment of the hinge-proximal binding site, which would further localize the electrons and in addition decrease the conjugation between the CN group and the CNQX aromatic ring. Consistent with this prediction, the frequency of the cyano stretching vibration in the difference spectrum of bound CNQX, (2247 cm−1) is four wave numbers higher than the higher of the two frequency bands observed in free CNQX (2243 cm−1). Although most of the bands in the difference spectra of DNQX-S1S2 and CNQX-S1S2versus apo S1S2 (Fig. 4, traces A andD) can thus be assigned to vibrational modes of the bound antagonist, this is not the case for the features at 1645 and 1644 cm−1, respectively. The frequency of these bands appears not to be shifted by isotopic labeling of the antagonists, nor is the CNQX frequency upshifted relative to the DNQX frequency, as seen for most antagonist vibrational frequencies. The frequencies and lack of agonist sensitivity of these bands suggest that they reflect the amide I vibrational mode of α-helices in the protein (10Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. Wiley, New York1987Google Scholar, 11Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar), and positive bands in the difference spectra thus indicate a modest increase in the α-helical content of the S1S2 domain on binding of the quinoxaline antagonists. The increase appears to be similar for DNQX and CNQX, suggesting that both compounds induce similar, small conformational changes in the binding domain. Compared with the modest effect of the antagonists DNQX and CNQX, much more extensive changes in the vibrational spectra of GluR4 S1S2 have been described on binding of full and partial agonists (8Jayaraman V. Keesey R. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8693-8697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The full agonist glutamate induces a significant increase in β-sheet content and simultaneous moderate increases in both α-helical and turn contents (8Jayaraman V. Keesey R. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8693-8697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Similar changes in β-sheet and turn contents and a small increase in α-helical content are observed on binding of the partial agonist kainate (8Jayaraman V. Keesey R. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8693-8697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 2S. Thiran, R. Madden, and V. Jayaraman, unpublished data.Thus, there is a correlation between the magnitude of the infrared spectral changes and the extent of channel activation induced by GluR ligands. Furthermore, as outlined in the Introduction, the extent of spectral changes mirrors the crystallographically observed differences in the extent of domain closure on the binding of antagonists, partial agonists, and full agonists (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that infrared spectral changes reflect physiologically relevant conformational changes in the binding domain. Infrared spectroscopy can be used to refine and extend the information provided by crystal structures. Here, the availability of isotopically labeled quinoxaline antagonists has revealed their electronic configurations and charge distributions as stabilized either in solution or by their interactions with the glutamate receptor binding site. This information is not directly accessible to crystallographic analysis alone but rather to a combination of structural and spectroscopic techniques. In addition, FTIR difference spectra confirm the similarity of the binding interactions of both CNQX and DNQX with S1S2 and permit us to model the previously uncharacterized CNQX interaction on the basis of the crystal structure of the DNQX-S1S2 complex. Finally, the vibrational spectra detect subtle changes in protein secondary structure content that appear to distinguish clearly the conformational effects of different functional classes of ligands, including antagonists, partial agonists, and full agonists. The ability to monitor such conformational changes spectroscopically may ultimately permit a time-resolved analysis of the conformational changes induced by agonist binding."
