https://openalex.org/W2134219545,"Mitochondria are endosymbiotic descendents of bacteria, well tolerated by the eukaryotic cells that they now serve after millions of years of co-evolution. But in extremis it seems strains in the relationship may emerge. Tests on plasma samples from patients who had suffered severe trauma show that mitochondrial DAMPs (or damage-associated molecular patterns) are released into the circulation as a result of tissue damage, where they activate neutrophils via specific formyl peptide receptors. This triggers systemic inflammation, tissue damage and apparent sepsis. These DAMPs interact with receptors that are part of the innate immune response to molecules known as PAMPs (pathogen associated molecular patterns), which are expressed on invading microorganisms, causing bacterial sepsis. This finding appears to explain the apparent sepsis sometimes associated with severe trauma even when no infection is present. Severe trauma can lead to death and sepsis in the absence of apparent infection. Here evidence shows that mitochondrial debris, released from damaged cells, is present in the circulation of seriously injured trauma patients. Such debris is shown to activate neutrophils via specific formyl peptide receptors, triggering systemic inflammation and end organ injury. Injury causes a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that is clinically much like sepsis1. Microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) activate innate immunocytes through pattern recognition receptors2. Similarly, cellular injury can release endogenous ‘damage’-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate innate immunity3. Mitochondria are evolutionary endosymbionts that were derived from bacteria4 and so might bear bacterial molecular motifs. Here we show that injury releases mitochondrial DAMPs (MTDs) into the circulation with functionally important immune consequences. MTDs include formyl peptides and mitochondrial DNA. These activate human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) through formyl peptide receptor-1 and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9, respectively. MTDs promote PMN Ca2+ flux and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, thus leading to PMN migration and degranulation in vitro and in vivo. Circulating MTDs can elicit neutrophil-mediated organ injury. Cellular disruption by trauma releases mitochondrial DAMPs with evolutionarily conserved similarities to bacterial PAMPs into the circulation. These signal through innate immune pathways identical to those activated in sepsis to create a sepsis-like state. The release of such mitochondrial ‘enemies within’ by cellular injury is a key link between trauma, inflammation and SIRS."

These predictions have been the topic of intense metaphysical debate ever since the theory's inception early last century. However, supreme predictive power combined with direct experimental observation of some of these unusual phenomena leave little doubt as to its fundamental correctness. In fact, without quantum mechanics we could not explain the workings of a laser, nor indeed how a fridge magnet operates. Over the last several decades quantum information science has emerged to seek answers to the question: can we gain some advantage by storing, transmitting and processing information encoded in systems that exhibit these unique quantum properties? Today it is understood that the answer is yes. Many research groups around the world are working towards one of the most ambitious goals humankind has ever embarked upon: a quantum computer that promises to exponentially improve computational power for particular tasks. A number of physical systems, spanning much of modern physics, are being developed for this task---ranging from single particles of light to superconducting circuits---and it is not yet clear which, if any, will ultimately prove successful. Here we describe the latest developments for each of the leading approaches and explain what the major challenges are for the future."
https://openalex.org/W2041136224,"Debugging Metabolic Disease Obesity, now officially recognized as an epidemic in many developed nations, is a key component of “metabolic syndrome,” an array of metabolic disturbances that increase an individual's risk of developing diabetes and heart disease. The rise in obesity rates has been largely attributed to the growing imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure, but recent provocative work has suggested a possible link between obesity and the composition of microbes residing within the gut. Vijay-Kumar et al. (p. 228 , published online 4 March; see the Perspective by Sandoval and Seeley ) now find that mutant mice deficient in a component of the innate immune system (which defends the body against microbial pathogens) develop hallmark features of metabolic syndrome, accompanied by changes in gut microbiota. Notably, transfer of gut microbiota from the mutant mice to wild-type mice conferred several features of metabolic syndrome to the recipients. Thus, the development of metabolic syndrome may indeed be influenced by gut microbes that are regulated by the innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2052751736,"The sirtuin family of regulatory proteins has been implicated in various biological pathways including responses to calorie restriction and metabolic stress. Work in mice now shows that sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), which mediates deacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins, is induced in liver and brown adipose tissue during fasting. One of SIRT3's substrates is shown to be long-chain acyl co-enzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD). Without SIRT3, LCAD becomes hyperacetylated, which diminishes its activity, and reduces fatty acid oxidation. Mice without SIRT3 have all the hallmarks of fatty acid oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and intolerance to cold. These findings suggest that acetylation is a novel regulatory mechanism for fatty acid oxidation. During fasting SIRT3 is induced in liver and brown adipose tissue. One of SIRT3's substrates is shown to be long–chain acyl co-enzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD). Without SIRT3 LCAD becomes hyperacetylated, which diminishes its activity, and reduces fatty acid oxidation. Mice without SIRT3 have all the hallmarks of fatty acid oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and intolerance to cold. Thus, acetylation is a novel regulatory mechanism for fatty acid oxidation. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases. They mediate adaptive responses to a variety of stresses, including calorie restriction and metabolic stress. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it regulates the acetylation levels of metabolic enzymes, including acetyl coenzyme A synthetase 2 (refs 1, 2). Mice lacking both Sirt3 alleles appear phenotypically normal under basal conditions, but show marked hyperacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins3. Here we report that SIRT3 expression is upregulated during fasting in liver and brown adipose tissues. During fasting, livers from mice lacking SIRT3 had higher levels of fatty-acid oxidation intermediate products and triglycerides, associated with decreased levels of fatty-acid oxidation, compared to livers from wild-type mice. Mass spectrometry of mitochondrial proteins shows that long-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCAD) is hyperacetylated at lysine 42 in the absence of SIRT3. LCAD is deacetylated in wild-type mice under fasted conditions and by SIRT3 in vitro and in vivo; and hyperacetylation of LCAD reduces its enzymatic activity. Mice lacking SIRT3 exhibit hallmarks of fatty-acid oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and intolerance to cold exposure. These findings identify acetylation as a novel regulatory mechanism for mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation and demonstrate that SIRT3 modulates mitochondrial intermediary metabolism and fatty-acid use during fasting."

Threads from several species exhibit granular cuticles containing a protein that is rich in the catecholic amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) as well as inorganic ions, notably Fe3+. Granular cuticles exhibit a remarkable combination of high hardness and high extensibility. We explored byssus cuticle chemistry by means of in situ resonance Raman spectroscopy and demonstrated that the cuticle is a polymeric scaffold stabilized by catecholato-iron chelate complexes having an unusual clustered distribution. Consistent with byssal cuticle chemistry and mechanics, we present a model in which dense cross-linking in the granules provides hardness, whereas the less cross-linked matrix provides extensibility."
https://openalex.org/W2011254556,"Nucleation is a fundamental step in atmospheric new-particle formation. However, laboratory experiments on nucleation have systematically failed to demonstrate sulfuric acid particle formation rates as high as those necessary to account for ambient atmospheric concentrations, and the role of sulfuric acid in atmospheric nucleation has remained a mystery. Here, we report measurements of new particles (with diameters of approximately 1.5 nanometers) observed immediately after their formation at atmospherically relevant sulfuric acid concentrations. Furthermore, we show that correlations between measured nucleation rates and sulfuric acid concentrations suggest that freshly formed particles contain one to two sulfuric acid molecules, a number consistent with assumptions that are based on atmospheric observations. Incorporation of these findings into global models should improve the understanding of the impact of secondary particle formation on climate."

https://openalex.org/W2020767027,"Bubble, Bubble, Warming and Trouble Vast quantities of methane are stored in ocean sediments, mostly in the form of clathrates, but methane is also trapped in submerged terrestrial permafrost that was flooded during the last deglaciation. There is thus concern that climate warming could warm ocean waters enough to release methane cryogenically trapped beneath the seabed, causing even more warming. Shakova et al. (p. 1246 ; see the Perspective by Heimann ) report that more than 80% of the bottom water, and more than 50% of the surface water, over the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, is indeed supersaturated with methane that is being released from the sub-sea permafrost, and that the flux to the atmosphere now is as great as previous estimates of that from the entire world ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2026044755,"Sestrin and the Consequences of Aging The protein kinase TOR (target of rapamycin) plays key roles in the control of fundamental biological processes, including growth, metabolism, aging, and immune function. Sestrin proteins show increased abundance in response to stress and have been implicated in control of TOR activity. Lee et al. (p. 1223 ; see the Perspective by Topisirovic and Sonenberg ) characterized Drosophila fruit flies lacking sestrins. Sestrins were implicated in a negative feedback loop in which the abundance of sestrins is controlled by TOR activity with sestrins concomitantly also inhibiting activity of TOR. Furthermore, flies lacking sestrins showed accumulation of fat, muscle degeneration, and heart abnormalities similar to those that plague aging humans with a sedentary life-style."
https://openalex.org/W1979883233,"Aging Snowball Earth Earth's glacial cycles have varied dramatically over time; at one point glaciers may have covered nearly the entire planet. Correlating various paleoclimate proxies such as fossil and isotope records from that time hinges on the ability to acquire precise age estimates of rocks deposited around the time of this so-called “Snowball Earth.” Macdonald et al. (p. 1241 ) report new high-precision U-Pb dates of Neoproterozoic strata in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, Canada, to calibrate the timing of carbon isotope variation in rocks from other locations around the globe. Based on the estimated past positions of where these rocks were deposited, glaciers probably extended to equatorial latitudes. The overlap with the survival and, indeed, diversification of some eukaryotes in the fossil record suggests that life survived in localized ecological niches during this global glaciation."

https://openalex.org/W2099640358,"The concept that astrocytes release neuroactive molecules (gliotransmitters) to affect synaptic transmission has been a paradigm shift in neuroscience research over the past decade. This concept suggests that astrocytes, together with pre- and postsynaptic neuronal elements, make up a functional synapse. Astrocyte release of gliotransmitters (for example, glutamate and adenosine triphosphate) is generally accepted to be a Ca2+-dependent process. We used two mouse lines to either selectively increase or obliterate astrocytic Gq G protein-coupled receptor Ca2+ signaling to further test the hypothesis that astrocytes release gliotransmitters in a Ca2+-dependent manner to affect synaptic transmission. Neither increasing nor obliterating astrocytic Ca2+ fluxes affects spontaneous and evoked excitatory synaptic transmission or synaptic plasticity. Our findings suggest that, at least in the hippocampus, the mechanisms of gliotransmission need to be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W2146447597,"Mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) are cultured with FGF2 and Activin A, like human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), but the action of the associated pathways in EpiSCs has not been well characterized. Here, we show that activation of the Activin pathway promotes self-renewal of EpiSCs via direct activation of Nanog, whereas inhibition of this pathway induces neuroectodermal differentiation, like in hESCs. In contrast, the different roles of FGF signaling appear to be only partially conserved in the mouse. Our data suggest that FGF2 fails to cooperate with SMAD2/3 signaling in actively promoting EpiSC self-renewal through Nanog, in contrast to its role in hESCs. Rather, FGF appears to stabilize the epiblast state by dual inhibition of differentiation to neuroectoderm and of media-induced reversion to a mouse embryonic stem cell-like state. Our data extend the current model of cell fate decisions concerning EpiSCs by clarifying the distinct roles played by FGF signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2007325299,"Carboxysomes in a Row The carboxysome is an organelle-like proteinaceous microcompartment that sequesters the enzymes of carbon fixation from the rest of the cytoplasm in cyanobacteria. Cyanobacterial carbon fixation is a major component of the global carbon cycle. Savage et al. (p. 1258 ) now show that carboxysomes are linearly arranged within the cytoplasm in a process that involves the bacterial cytoskeleton. This arrangement is important in carboxysome partitioning during cell division. When carboxysome partitioning is disrupted by interfering with the bacterial cytoskeleton, carbon fixation is impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2012363050,"Early Origin of Earth's Magnetic Field Earth's magnetic field protects us from stellar winds and radiation from the Sun. Understanding when, during the Earth's formation, the large-scale magnetic field was established is important because it impacts understanding of the young Earth's atmosphere and exosphere. By analyzing ancient silicate crystals, Tarduno et al. (p. 1238 ; see the Perspective by Jardine ) demonstrate that the Earth's magnetic field existed 3.4 to 3.45 billion years ago, pushing back the oldest record of geomagnetic field strength by 200 million years. This result combined with estimates of the conditions within the solar wind at that time implies that the size of the paleomagnetosphere was about half of that typical today, but with an auroral oval of about three times the area. The smaller magnetosphere and larger auroral oval would have promoted loss of volatiles and water from the early atmosphere."

Their counterparts, however—antinuclei or antimatter—are relatively shy about making an appearance. Chen et al. (p. 58 published online 4 March; see the Perspective by Cohen ) used the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider to coax them into existence by colliding high-energy beams of gold ions head-on. Within the debris from the collisions, evidence was found in the decay paths and particle tracks that suggested the formation of nuclei from antimatter. The ability to form these exotic particles in abundance should help to probe fundamental aspects of nuclear physics, astrophysics, and cosmology."

https://openalex.org/W2000531777,"Meiotic crossovers (COs) are tightly regulated to ensure that COs on the same chromosome are distributed far apart (crossover interference, COI) and that at least one CO is formed per homolog pair (CO homeostasis). CO formation is controlled in part during meiotic double-strand break (DSB) creation in Caenorhabditis elegans, but a second level of control must also exist because meiotic DSBs outnumber COs. We show that the antirecombinase RTEL-1 is required to prevent excess meiotic COs, probably by promoting meiotic synthesis-dependent strand annealing. Two distinct classes of meiotic COs are increased in rtel-1 mutants, and COI and homeostasis are compromised. We propose that RTEL-1 implements the second level of CO control by promoting noncrossovers."
https://openalex.org/W2075834906,"Current cosmological models indicate that the Milky Way's stellar halo was assembled from many smaller systems. On the basis of the apparent absence of the most metal-poor stars in present-day dwarf galaxies, recent studies claimed that the true Galactic building blocks must have been vastly different from the surviving dwarfs. The discovery of an extremely iron-poor star (S1020549) in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy based on a medium-resolution spectrum cast some doubt on this conclusion. Verification of the iron-deficiency, however, and measurements of additional elements, such as the alpha-element Mg, are necessary to demonstrate that the same type of stars produced the metals found in dwarf galaxies and the Galactic halo. Only then can dwarf galaxy stars be conclusively linked to early stellar halo assembly. Here we report high-resolution spectroscopic abundances for 11 elements in S1020549, confirming its iron abundance of less than 1/4,000th that of the Sun, and showing that the overall abundance pattern follows that seen in low-metallicity halo stars, including the alpha-elements. Such chemical similarity indicates that the systems destroyed to form the halo billions of years ago were not fundamentally different from the progenitors of present-day dwarfs, and suggests that the early chemical enrichment of all galaxies may be nearly identical."
https://openalex.org/W2083338784,"Hox genes are central to the specification of structures along the anterior-posterior body axis, and modifications in their expression have paralleled the emergence of diversity in vertebrate body plans. Here we describe the genomic organization of Hox clusters in different reptiles and show that squamates have accumulated unusually large numbers of transposable elements at these loci, reflecting extensive genomic rearrangements of coding and non-coding regulatory regions. Comparative expression analyses between two species showing different axial skeletons, the corn snake and the whiptail lizard, revealed major alterations in Hox13 and Hox10 expression features during snake somitogenesis, in line with the expansion of both caudal and thoracic regions. Variations in both protein sequences and regulatory modalities of posterior Hox genes suggest how this genetic system has dealt with its intrinsic collinear constraint to accompany the substantial morphological radiation observed in this group."
https://openalex.org/W2167300004,"The Rho family GTPase Rac1 has been implicated in the regulation of glucose uptake in myoblast cell lines. However, no evidence for the role of Rac1 has been provided by a mouse model. The purpose of this study is to test the involvement of Rac1 in insulin action in mouse skeletal muscle. Intravenous administration of insulin indeed elicited Rac1 activation in gastrocnemius muscle, suggesting the involvement of Rac1 in this signaling pathway. We then examined whether insulin-stimulated translocation of the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 from its storage sites to the skeletal muscle sarcolemma depends on Rac1. We show that ectopic expression of constitutively activated Rac1, as well as intravenous administration of insulin, caused translocation of GLUT4 to the gastrocnemius muscle sarcolemma, as revealed by immunofluorescent staining of a transiently expressed exofacial epitope-tagged GLUT4 reporter. Of particular note, insulin-dependent, but not constitutively activated Rac1-induced, GLUT4 translocation was markedly suppressed in skeletal muscle-specific rac1-knockout mice compared to control mice. Immunogold electron microscopic analysis of endogenous GLUT4 gave similar results. Collectively, we propose a critical role of Rac1 in insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation to the skeletal muscle sarcolemma, which has heretofore been predicted solely by cell culture studies.—Ueda, S., Kitazawa, S., Ishida, K, Nishikawa, Y., Matsui, M., Matsumoto, H., Aoki, T., Nozaki, S., Takeda, T., Tamori, Y., Aiba, A., Kahn, C.

https://openalex.org/W2030706868,"The nucleocytoplasmic egress of viral capsids is a rate-limiting step in the replication of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). As reported recently, an HCMV-specific nuclear egress complex is composed of viral and cellular proteins, in particular protein kinases with the capacity to induce destabilization of the nuclear lamina. Viral protein kinase pUL97 and cellular protein kinase C (PKC) play important roles by phosphorylating several types of nuclear lamins. Using pUL97 mutants, we show that the lamin-phosphorylating activity of pUL97 is associated with a reorganization of nuclear lamin A/C. Either pUL97 or PKC has the potential to induce distinct punctate lamina-depleted areas at the periphery of the nuclear envelope, which were detectable in transiently transfected and HCMV-infected cells. Using recombinant HCMV, which produces green fluorescent protein-labeled viral capsids, the direct transition of viral capsids through these areas could be visualized. This process was sensitive to an inhibitor of pUL97/PKC activity. The pUL97-mediated phosphorylation of lamin A/C at Ser22 generated a novel binding motif for the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase Pin1. In HCMV-infected fibroblasts, the physiological localization of Pin1 was altered, leading to recruitment of Pin1 to viral replication centers and to the nuclear lamina. The local increase in Pin1 peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase activity may promote conformational modulation of lamins. Thus, we postulate a novel phosphorylation-triggered mechanism for the reorganization of the nuclear lamina in HCMV-infected cells.

The proteinaceous network of the nuclear lamina, underlying the INM, constitutes a major obstacle for the nuclear egress of capsids. Lamins, belonging to type V intermediate filament proteins, are the main constituents of the nuclear lamina and are grouped into A and B types. A-type lamins (A, C, AΔ10, and C2; collectively lamin A/C) result from alternative splicing of the LMNA gene. B-type lamins are encoded by the LMNB1 (B1) or LMNB2 (B2, B3) gene (8Goldman R.D.

During mitosis, the nuclear lamina has to be transiently disassembled. This dynamic process is regulated by destabilizing phosphorylation of lamins at specific sites. In particular, it is well established that CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1; Cdc2) is mainly responsible for phosphorylation of lamins during mitosis (10Heald R. McKeon F.

A number of studies provided evidence that CMVs (including HCMV as well as murine CMV) and also other herpesviruses recruit another cellular lamin-phosphorylating kinase, namely protein kinase C (PKC). PKC is important for the phosphorylation and dissolution of the nuclear lamina (18Muranyi W. Haas J. Wagner M. Krohne G. Koszinowski U.H.

In HCMV-infected cells, the lamina-reorganizing activity of PKC appears to be supported by further lamin-phosphorylating protein kinases.

On the basis of these observations, we postulated the formation of an HCMV-specific nuclear egress complex (NEC) composed of viral and cellular components (21Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Sticht H. Marschall M. J. Gen. Virol. 2009; 90: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This complex may basically consist of pUL50, pUL53, pUL97, PKC, p32, and the lamin B receptor (21Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Sticht H. Marschall M. J. Gen. Virol. 2009; 90: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In particular, the direct and indirect recruitment of PKC and pUL97, respectively, is mediated by viral pUL50. Whereas pUL50 is principally sufficient for PKC recruitment (21Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Sticht H. Marschall M. J. Gen. Virol. 2009; 90: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), other viral proteins such as pUL53 appear to enhance this function. pUL50 and pUL53 represent an interactor pair of essential nuclear egress proteins that are conserved among herpesviruses (5Sanchez V.

In particular, our study describes the formation of distinct punctate lamin A/C-depleted areas at the periphery of the nuclear envelope that can be induced by HCMV infection or by transient overexpression of individual NEC kinases. Searching for the molecular mode of the phosphorylation-triggered process of lamina reorganization, we detected the involvement of the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase (PPIase) Pin1. These findings led us to propose a model that may explain the regulatory key features of the NEC and HCMV nuclear egress.

HeLa cells or primary HFFs were grown on coverslips for transient transfection or HCMV infection, respectively. At the indicated time points, cells were fixed and permeabilized following indirect immunofluorescence staining as described (19Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Marschall M. J. Gen.

Secondary antibodies used for double staining were fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-conjugated (Dianova). Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a 63× HCX PL APO CS oil immersion objective lens (Leica) and analyzed using LAS AF software (Leica). HFFs were seeded into 2-well chambered coverglass units with coverslip quality glass bottoms (Lab-Tek, Nunc) at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. The next day, the cells were infected with recombinant TB40-UL32-EGFP virus at a m.o.i. of 1.0. 62 h post-infection (hpi), the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution with calcium and magnesium (Invitrogen) and then incubated with prewarmed staining solution for live cell endoplasmic reticulum labeling (ER-Tracker red dye, Invitrogen) at a concentration of 1 μm for 20 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After replacing the staining solution with fresh probe-free medium, the cells were examined using a TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope. The intracellular trafficking velocity of viral particles was determined by using LAS AF Version 1.8.2 (build 1465, Leica). The kinase activity of FLAG-tagged pUL97 was determined in vitro (2.5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP) after immunoprecipitation of the kinase and the putative substrate proteins lamin A-GFP and lamin C-GFP from lysates of transfected 293T cells. Immunoprecipitates were subsequently pelleted, washed, and subjected to in vitro kinase assay reaction as described previously (19Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Marschall M. J. Gen.

Finally, samples were prepared for separation by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (A. Hartenstein) by Western blotting. Autoradiographic membranes were exposed to a phosphorimager plate and measured using a BAS-2000 phosphorimager (Fuji Film. Co., Tokyo, Japan). HFFs were seeded into cell culture flasks at a density of 3.6 × 106 cells/flask. The next day, cells were infected with HCMV strain AD169 at m.o.i. = 0.1 and 1.0. Three days post-infection, immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (21Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Sticht H. Marschall M. J. Gen.

Co-immunoprecipitated samples and expression controls were subjected to standard Western blot analysis using anti-Pin1 pAb (A302-316A, recognizing epitope 113-163 of human Pin1; BIOMOL) and anti-lamin A/C mAb.

The structure of lamin A in complex with Pin1 was modeled based on the known crystal structure of Pin1 in complex with a peptide from the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (Protein Data Bank code 1f8a) (35Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the C-terminal domain ligand sequence was replaced with that of lamin A using the lowest energy rotamers for the non-conserved amino acid side chains. The complex was subsequently refined by 100 steps of energy minimization using SYBYL 7.3 software (Tripos, L.P.). Structural analysis and visualization were performed using the program DS ViewerPro (Accelrys Inc.). Previous investigations demonstrated that HCMV replication exerts drastic morphological alterations on the nuclear lamina (21Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Sticht H. Marschall M. J. Gen.

The effects described include a thinning of the lamina layer, loss of the typical rim staining of individual lamina components, internal nuclear speckling of lamins, and modified antigenic detectability (7Buser C.

We investigated the fine-structured morphological organization of the nuclear lamina by CLSM and visualized effects produced by the expression of the viral protein kinase pUL97 (supplemental Fig. S1A). In vector-transfected cells, the staining for lamin A/C showed a strict rim signal (supplemental Fig. S1A, panels a–e). As a striking result, those cells expressing a catalytically active version of pUL97 (full-length pUL97 or N-terminally truncated pUL97-(181–707)) showed an increase of lamin signals throughout the nuclear plasma (supplemental Fig. S1A, panels f–p). The rim staining changed to a more homogeneous nuclear distribution (supplemental Fig. S1A, panels k and p). No induction of similar effects was observed for catalytically inactive versions of pUL97 (point mutant pUL97(K355M) or C-terminally truncated pUL97-(1–595)) (22Marschall M. Marzi A. aus dem Siepen P. Jochmann R. Kalmer M. Auerochs S. Lischka P. Leis M. Stamminger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33357-33367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1A, panels q–z). To ensure comparable levels of pUL97 expression, semiquantitative Western blot analysis was performed (supplemental Fig. S1B). Interestingly, transient expression of pUL97 produced only a rather moderate phenotype of lamin A/C reorganization (as shown in supplemental Fig. S1), whereas coexpression of pUL97 and egress protein pUL50 potentiated the lamina-reorganizing activity (Fig. 1A). Coexpression of pUL50 and pUL97 led to punctate distortions at the periphery of the nuclear envelope, which clearly represented centers of massive lamin A/C reorganization (Fig. 1A, panels l–p). The potentiating effect of pUL50 might be explained by an indirect protein interaction bridged by the pUL97-interacting cellular adapter protein p32 (22Marschall M. Marzi A. aus dem Siepen P. Jochmann R. Kalmer M. Auerochs S. Lischka P. Leis M. Stamminger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33357-33367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Coexpression of pUL53 and pUL97 did not induce a lamina reorganization as demonstrated for pUL50 and pUL97 (data not shown). Using pUL50 only induced some minor lamina alterations restricted to a small fraction of cells; however, in no case was a local depletion of the nuclear lamina observed (Fig. 1A, panels f–k). Quantification of pUL50/pUL97-coexpressing cells revealed that 8.2% of cells staining positive for pUL50 showed distinct distortions of nuclear lamin A/C (Fig. 1B). Treatment with the kinase inhibitor Gö6976 significantly reduced this effect to 1.8%, confirming the central role of protein kinase activity. The indolocarbazole compound Gö6976 possesses strong inhibitory potential against pUL97 (30Marschall M. Stein-Gerlach M. Freitag M. Kupfer R. van den Bogaard M. Stamminger T. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 36Marschall M. Stein-Gerlach M. Freitag M. Kupfer R. van den Bogaard M. Stamminger T. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and an additional activity against PKC (37Goekjian P.G. Jirousek M.R. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 877-903PubMed Google Scholar). The use of a kinase-inactive point mutant (K355M) led to a statistically significant difference in measurable lamina distortions compared with wild-type pUL97. However, a substantial portion of cells still showed measurable effects (4.4%) (Fig. 1B), suggesting that endogenous PKC activity, possibly associated with pUL97(K355M)-derived protein complexes, might also contribute to the alterations in lamin A/C. This notion was underscored by the finding that Gö6976 treatment markedly reduced the effect of mutant K355M (2.6%). The direct phosphorylation of lamins by pUL97 was analyzed by performing in vitro kinase assay. pUL97 and its putative substrates lamin A-GFP and lamin C-GFP were immunoprecipitated from lysates of transiently transfected cells. In the in vitro phosphorylation reaction, lamin A-GFP and lamin C-GFP were phosphorylated by pUL97 (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 7). The vector control (Fig. 2, lane 4), red fluorescent protein (lane 1), or GFP (data not shown) did not produce a phosphorylation signal. An additional antibody control confirmed the specificity of the reaction (Fig. 2, lane 9). Efficient precipitation of the substrate proteins was confirmed by precipitation control staining (Fig. 2, middle panels). In accordance with the findings shown in supplemental Fig. S1, lamin phosphorylation was exclusively detectable for catalytically active pUL97 (N-terminally truncated pUL97-(181–707)) (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 7), whereas an inactive C-terminally truncated version (pUL97-(1–595)) (lanes 6 and 8) or a kinase-inactive point mutant (pUL97(K355M)) (lanes 10 and 11) did not produce a phosphorylation signal. We addressed the question as to whether additional protein kinases are involved in lamina-modifying processes. Expression experiments with PKCα-GFP were performed to investigate whether PKC can induce morphological alteration of the nuclear lamina similarly to pUL97. In fact, the formation of distinct punctate distortions of nuclear lamin A/C was also detected in PKC-expressing cells (Fig. 1A, panels q–u). The inset magnification of the merged picture (Fig. 1A, panel u) shows PKCα-GFP mainly in a cytoplasmic localization adjacent to the regular nuclear rim shaped by lamin A/C. The nuclear rim is significantly broken so that no lamin signal remains detectable. Similar alterations were not detectable in control cells lacking PKCα-GFP expression (Fig. 1A, panel e). We monitored the induction of nuclear lamina alterations (lamin A/C) during HCMV replication and the localization of pUL97. In HCMV-infected primary HFFs, pUL97 was found mostly associated with viral replication centers at late time points of infection (60–120 hpi) as described previously (38Marschall M. Freitag M. Suchy P. Romaker D. Kupfer R. Hanke M. Stamminger T. Virology. 2003; 311: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). With increasing time, a number of cells also contained pUL97 in a perinuclear localization, which was at least in part associated with the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1C, panel f). Pronounced distortions of nuclear lamin A/C were increasingly induced in the late phase of viral replication (Fig. 1C, panel h). When using an AD169-derived UL97 deletion virus expressing a GFP reporter (AD169ΔUL97-GFP), limited distortions of the nuclear lamina were observed (Fig. 1C, panels i–m). This type of distortion was characterized by a limited thinning of the nuclear lamina (lamin A/C) and by smaller depletions appearing with lower quantity compared with parental HCMV AD169. Quantification of the data revealed that most of the lamina-specific effect could be attributed to the presence of pUL97 (Fig. 1D). The lack of viral pUL97 expression (AD169ΔUL97-GFP) and/or the inhibition of kinase activity (Gö6976) substantially reduced the effect of nuclear lamina depletion. Thus, the measurable inhibitory potency of Gö6976 in cells in"

The movement of the charged residues in the voltage sensor may be detected as gating currents. In Shaker K+ channels, the gating currents are asymmetric; although the on-gating currents are fast, the off-gating currents contain a slow component. This slow component is caused by a stabilization of the activated state of the voltage sensor and has been suggested to be linked to ion permeation or C-type inactivation. The molecular determinants responsible for the stabilization, however, remain unknown. Here, we identified an interaction between Arg-394, Glu-395, and Leu-398 on the C termini of the S4-S5 linker and Tyr-485 on the S6 of the neighboring subunit, which is responsible for the development of the slow off-gating component. Mutation of residues involved in this intersubunit interaction modulated the strength of the associated interaction. Impairment of the interaction still led to pore opening but did not exhibit slow gating kinetics. Development of this interaction occurs under physiological ion conduction and is correlated with pore opening. We, thus, suggest that the above residues stabilize the channel in the open state.

The voltage dependence of ion channels is the basis for all electrical signaling in the central nervous system. In tetrameric voltage-gated K+ channels, each subunit is composed of six transmembrane α-helices (S1–S6), with S1–S4 forming the voltage sensing domain and S5–S6 of all four subunits forming the pore. The voltage-sensing domains are covalently connected to the S5 of the pore region by the S4-S5 linker. The intracellular gate is made up of the S6 C-terminal ends that cross each other, forming a bundle that occludes the pore when the channel is closed. Pore opening in voltage-gated K+ channels is controlled by the movement of the voltage sensor in which charged residues of the S4 respond to changes in membrane potential. During this conformational change, the charges are moved through the electric field, generating the transient gating currents (for review, see Ref. 1Bezanilla F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Gating currents were first predicted by Hodgkin and Huxley and were first detected in sodium channels by Armstrong et al.

Briefly, on-gating currents rise and decay quickly after small depolarizations but rise more slowly and exhibit more prolonged and complex decay kinetics after intermediate depolarizations and, finally, develop and decay rapidly after depolarizations large enough to activate all channels. In contrast, off-gating currents, which develop upon repolarization, exhibit the following salient features; (i) after partial activation from low depolarizations (e.g. pulsing up to −50 mV), currents are fast, representing backward transitions that return channels from partially activated back to resting states, (ii) after intermediate depolarizations (e.g. pulsing to between −40 and −30 mV) currents show a similar fast component seen at low depolarizations followed by a slow component, the latter indicating slow deactivation of a small number of fully activated channels, (iii) after high depolarizations (e.g. pulses >−30 mV), currents have a rising phase and slow decay, signifying the slow return from the fully activated state of all channels (see Fig. 2). The slow off-gating currents have been described early on (6Perozo E. MacKinnon R. Bezanilla F. Stefani E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 353-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 7Bezanilla F. Perozo E. Stefani E. Biophys.

These characteristics of the off-gating currents have led others to suggest that the early transitions in the activation sequence represent quickly reversible events within one subunit, whereas the late transitions preceding the full activation of channels are slowly reversible and likely represent a concerted step involving all subunits (7Bezanilla F.

Physiol. 1999; 114: 215-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although theoretical descriptions of off-gating currents have been proposed (14McCormack K. Joiner W.J. Heinemann S.H.

Several mutants of the Shaker K+ channel have been described previously to suppress the slow off-gating component (13Kanevsky M. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen.

In most cases, pore opening did not occur in the experimental range, confirming that the slow component is linked to pore opening (6Perozo E. MacKinnon R. Bezanilla F. Stefani E.

This had first been demonstrated by preventing development of the slow component by application of 4-aminopyridine, which keeps the pore in the closed conformation (10Loboda A. Armstrong C.M.

However, in other mutations, the slow component was diminished despite an open pore. The mutations were located in the C-terminal S6 (see “Discussion”). All of the voltage sensors of the Shaker K+ channel are thought to enter the activated state before the channel undergoes one final cooperative step that leads to pore opening (22Pathak M. Kurtz L. Tombola F. Isacoff E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Dittman J. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen.

It has been suggested that the slow off-component is related to the final concerted step of the four voltage sensors (7Bezanilla F. Perozo E. Stefani E. Biophys.

Electromechanical coupling between voltage sensor movement and pore opening is mediated by interaction between the S4-S5 linker and the C-terminal S6 (25Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Hess P. Nature. 1992; 359: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we looked for an interaction that couples together neighboring subunits of the tetrameric channels. In this study we have mutated several conserved residues located at the interface between the S4-S5 linker and S6 of adjacent subunits to determine via analysis of the off-gating currents how interactions between these two regions influence electromechanical coupling and, in particular, whether the slow off-gating component is influenced. We have identified several key residues located at the C-terminal end of the S4-S5 linker and of the S6 whose interactions contribute to the rising phase and slow decay of the off-gating currents. We propose that interactions between these residues represent the last transition(s) in the activation pathway. All experiments were done using the pBSTA vector into which the Shaker IR (“inactivation-removed,” containing an N-terminal deletion (Δ6–46) that removes its fast inactivation properties (4Hoshi T.

Sequences were verified using automated DNA sequencing. cDNAs were linearized and in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (T7 mMessage machine kit; Ambion). cRNAs (23 or 46 μl; 0.1∼1.0 μg/μl) were injected into Xenopus oocytes, and currents were recorded 2–5 days after injection. With the cut-open voltage clamp epifluorescence technique using an Axioskop 2 FS upright microscope (Zeiss), CA-1B High Performance Oocyte Clamp (Dagan Corp.), and Photomax 200 Photodiode Detection System (Dagan Corp.) currents and fluorescence were measured as described previously (36Cha A. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Before recording, oocytes were placed in a 3-compartment chamber containing an external solution (115 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm Ca(OH)2) adjusted to pH 7.1 using MES, 3The abbreviations used are: MESmethanesulfonic acid4-AP4-aminopyridineEY-AAE395A/Y485AFfluorescenceGconductanceQgating charge. then permeabilized by exchanging external solution in the bottom chamber with 0.2% saponin. After permeabilization, saponin solution was replaced with an internal solution (10 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 115 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (for gating current recording) or KOH (for ionic current recording)) adjusted to pH 7.1 using MES. The voltage electrode was filled with 3 m KCl. Recordings were done at room temperature. methanesulfonic acid 4-aminopyridine E395A/Y485A fluorescence conductance gating charge. Gating currents were recorded from oocytes expressing mutations introduced into a non-conducting (W434F) Shaker IR-pBSTA vector background. The relation between the gating charge (Q) as a function of voltage (V) was fit into a single Boltzmann equation,QQmax=11+exp(−zFRTV−V1/2)=11+exp(−(V−V1/2)/dV)(Eq. 1) Here, Q/Qmax is the normalized charge obtained from integrating the on-or off-gating currents, z is the valence, F is Faraday's constant, V½ is the voltage at which 50% of the maximal gating charge has moved from one state to the other, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and dV = RT/zF. Ionic currents were recorded in oocytes expressing mutations made in a conducting Shaker IR-pBSTA background, which has a cysteine substitution in the extracellular space above the S4 (A359C or M356C). Tagging these cysteines with a fluorophore (tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide; Invitrogen) enables the tracking of the movement of the S4 voltage sensor (37Mannuzzu L.M. Moronne M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Science. 1996; 271: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 38Cha A. Bezanilla F. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1127-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) while simultaneously recording ionic current. For fluorescence experiments, oocytes were first labeled with 5 μm tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide dissolved in a solution containing 115 mm K+-MES, 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mm Ca2+-MES2, pH 7.0, for 20 min at room temperature in the dark and washed twice in supplemented Barth solution before recording. For ionic current recordings, the steady state currents elicited from a series of depolarizations was used to calculate conductance (G) of each mutant channel. GV relations were also fit into a single Boltzmann equation,GGmax=11+exp(−zFRTV−V1/2)=11+exp(−(V−V1/2)/dV)(Eq. 2) where G/Gmax is the normalized conductance, and V½ is the voltage at which 50% of the maximal conductance has been reached. Double Boltzmann distributions were fitted toGGmax=11+exp(−zFRTV−V′1/2)⋅(1+exp(−zFRTV−V1/2))=11+exp(−(V−V′1/2)/dV′)⋅(1+exp(−(V−V1/2)/dV))(Eq. 3) according to a three-state sequential model closed ↔ activated(closed) ↔ open with equilibrium at V½ and V½′ for the first and second transition, respectively. This follows after short derivation from Equation 4 below with voltage-dependent rate constants. It should be noted that this is not a superposition or multiplication of two single Boltzmann distributions. For experiments evaluating the effect of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on-gating and ionic currents, the final molarities of the carrier ion (N-methyl-d-glucamine for gating and K+ for ionic current) in internal solutions were adjusted to compensate for 10 mm 4-AP. After initial recording of currents in response to a series of increasing depolarizations, the channels were incubated with 10 mm 4-AP, and currents were repetitively acquired after the same saturating depolarizing pulse. Once 4-AP no longer had an effect on gating or ionic currents, currents were recorded in response to another series of depolarizations. Data acquisition and analysis programs were developed at the University of California, Los Angeles (Dept. of Anesthesiology). Energy minimization of Kv1.2 (PDB 2A79) S4-S6 domains (for wild type and mutant E327A (E395A in Shaker)) was conducted using Discover 3 forcefield and visualized with INSIGHT II software. Spherical areas of 8 Å from residue 327 in each subunit were subjected to forcefield conditions in a water box, whereas the rest of the molecule remained fixed. We created a 5-state model (see Fig. 9B) and fitted it to the gating currents obtained from a series of depolarizing pulses using Matlab. The first two transitions were charge-carrying transitions with a ratio of 0.45 (C ↔ A1) to 0.55 (A1 ↔ A2) of the total charge. The subsequent two transitions were electro-neutral. We chose the model to describe the initial movement of the voltage sensor itself (C → A2) and the subsequent interactions developing during electromechanical coupling between voltage sensor and pore (A2→AS). We, thereby, abided by the paradigms that the on-rate constants were free to vary for all pulse voltages, whereas the off-rate constants were constant because they all occur at the same resting potential during deactivation. The initial conditions for the on-gating transition (start of the pulse) are given by the steady state of the rate constants at resting potential (off-rate constants), and for the off-gating transition the predicted values after the depolarizing pulse according to the on-rate constants were used. With this model the traces could be well fitted except for possible delays in the immediate onset of on-gating, which require additional steps in the charge movement. We, however, were interested in the transitions occurring after major charge movement. In principle, rate constants should follow an exponential voltage dependence. However, we did not fit all voltages simultaneously and did, thus, not enforce the exponential voltage dependence. Therefore, transitions with low occupancy at a certain voltage range compensated for other transitions. One can derive from steady state probabilities that, in a sequential model A1 ↔ A2 ↔ A3 … An−1 ↔ An with forward rate constants α1, α2, α3, … αn−1 and the backward rates β1, β2, β3, … βn−1, the equilibrium occupancy of A1 is given byA1(t→∞)=11+α1β1⋅(1+α2β2⋅(1+α3β3…(1+αn−1βn−1)…))(Eq. 4) Assuming A1 ↔ A2 is the charge carrying transition (or lumping all major charge carrying transitions into A1 ↔ A2), the normalized charge equals Q/Qmax = 1 − A1. This means that, if βi ≫ αi, all subsequent transitions j > i have only a minor influence on A1. Also, the further apart from A1 a transition is, the less it will influence the position of the QV. It also follows immediately that A1 < β1/(α1 + β1) because the term in each of the parentheses is always larger than or equal to 1. This means that at V½ of the first transition (α1 = β1), Q > 1/2. Thus, the V½ of the entire system will always be more negative than that of the charge carrying step(s), and the QV will always be shifted to more negative potentials. Using the crystal structure of the mammalian homolog of Shaker, Kv1.2 (29Long S.B. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar), as a template, we identified several amino acids whose side chains project out into the intersubunit space between the S4-S5 linker and S6 of adjacent subunits. In the presumed open, inactivated state of the Kv1.2 crystal structure, Tyr-485 at the C-terminal end of the S6 of subunit IV appears to interact with several residues on the neighboring subunit I (Fig. 1A). The closest contacts were with Arg-394 and Glu-395 on the S4-S5 linker of subunit I, whereas more distant contacts were with Val-476 on the S6 of subunit I and Leu-398 located on the N-terminal S5 of subunit I (Fig. 1A). To determine the importance of these residues for electromechanical coupling, we verified whether they were well conserved in different KV channels. We aligned sequences spanning S4-S5 linker, N-terminal S5, and S6 regions in various related K+ channels, including voltage-gated mammalian and Drosophila K+ channels, a voltage-gated bacterial K+ channel (KvAP), and a cyclic nucleotide-regulated bacterial ion channel (MlotiK). The most conserved residues were Glu-395 (10/12) and Tyr-485 (11/12), with the latter found even in the distantly related MlotiK. The basic amino acid Arg-394 was conserved in the Shaker/Kv1 family and both bacterial channels, KvAP and MlotiK. In the other channels, it was replaced by another basic residue, lysine, in Shab and Shaw and by an amide, asparagine, in the mammalian homologs for Shab and Shaw. Val-476 and Leu-398 were conserved in 8 and 9 of 12 sequences, respectively. The fact that Arg-394, Glu-395, Leu-398, Val-476, and Tyr-485 are well conserved suggests their importance in proper channel function. We characterized the variation of gating current kinetics by several mutations in each of the positions identified above. Mutations were introduced into the non-conducting Shaker-IR channel, W434F (4Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 5Zagotta W.N.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 353-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We mutated each residue to alanine but also studied more conservative mutations (R394Q, E395D, L398V, L398I, L398N, Y485F, Y485H) and charge reversal mutations (R394E, E395R) (Table 1). All mutants expressed functionally, except Y485F and L398A. We initially studied the effect of each mutation on voltage sensor movement by analyzing gating currents produced in response to membrane depolarization (Fig. 2). Variations were found in both the on- and off-gating currents. The on-gating currents were accelerated only in E395R, L398V, L398W, and Y485A, whereas they remained unchanged for all other mutants. The effects on off-gating currents were more pronounced, which may be due to the fact that during deactivation the channels have to traverse the later steps of electromechanical coupling before charge movement because these transitions occur between closing of the pore and movement of the voltage sensor to its resting position. Analysis of the off-gating currents will provide information on these late transitions, and thus, we concentrated on the off-gating currents in this manuscript.TABLE 1Summary of gating current results in Shaker mutantsShaker constructIgatingQONQOFFnV½dVΔV½V½dVΔV½mVmVW434F−45.9±0.88.7 ± 0.7−53.2 ± 0.78.0 ± 0.65R394A−32.5 ± 0.76.3 ± 0.6+13.4−40.2 ± 0.55.7 ± 0.5+13.05R394Q−47.9 ± 1.38.4 ± 1.1−2.0−54.0 ± 0.87.8 ± 0.7−0.84R394E−46.0 ± 1.07.7 ± 0.9−0.1−50.8 ± 0.77.0 ± 0.6+2.44E395A (Vh = −90 mV)−62.2 ± 0.77.1 ± 0.6−16.3NDNDE395A (Vh = −120 mV)−62.3 ± 0.57.8 ± 0.4−16.4−71.0 ± 0.79.2 ± 0.6−17.84E395D−40.8 ± 0.711.6 ± 0.6+5.1−42.2 ± 0.611.6 ± 0.5+11.06E395R−76.2 ± 0.79.1 ± 0.6−30.3−82.4 ± 0.98.3 ± 0.8−29.26L398A−aMutants in which gating currents were not detected.−aMutants in which gating currents were not detected.L398N−48.8 ± 0.49.7 ± 0.4−2.9−58.3 ± 0.99.2 ± 0.8−5.12L398V−38.9 ± 1.012.1 ± 0.8+7.0−37.2 ± 1.011.3 ± 0.9+16.03L398I−28.0 ± 1.911.0 ± 2.1+17.9−27.5 ± 1.211.0 ± 1.8+25.75L398W−59.4 ± 1.924.4 ± 1.4−13.5−52.5 ± 1.726.1 ± 1.6+0.73V476A (Vh = −90 mV)−65.5 ± 1.69.1 ± 1.4−19.6NDNDV476A (Vh = −120 mV)−60.9 ± 0.77.6 ± 0.6−15.0−69.9 ± 0.57.8 ± 0.4−16.73Y485A−48.9 ± 0.610.8 ± 0.5−3.0−50.3 ± 0.411.8 ± 0.3+2.96Y485F–aMutants in which gating currents were not detected.–aMutants in which gating currents were not detected.Y485H−53.8 ± 0.410.4 ± 0.4−7.9−54.8 ± 0.410.0 ± 0.4+3.03R394A/E395A−45.7 ± 0.97.6 ± 0.8+0.2−52.2 ± 0.87.7 ± 0.7+1.05R394E/E395R−64.2 ± 0.46.3 ± 0.3−18.3−69.1 ± 0.57.3 ± 0.4−15.96E395A/Y485A−51.9 ± 0.612.7 ± 0.6−6.0−56.0 ± 0.412.0 ± 0.4−2.85a Mutants in which gating currents were not detected. Open table in a new tab The mutants can be classified into three groups on the basis of their effects on the off-gating currents (Fig. 2). The first is a group of mutants that completely removed the slow onset and slow decay kinetics typically seen in W434F when returning from high depolarizations (see the Introduction) and showed almost symmetrical gating currents (E395D, L398V, L398I (data not shown), Y485A, Y485H). These mutants form an interaction stabilizing the activated (or open) state of the channel. As this interaction acts across subunits, it very likely has some implication in cooperative opening of the channel. The second group of mutants modified, i.e. slowed down (E395R), immobilized (E395A, V476A), or accelerated (R394A, L398W), the slow components of the off-gating currents and thereby modulated the underlying interaction, which indicates that the corresponding residues are part of or located in close proximity to the molecular determinants of the interaction. Different mutations of position Glu-395 and Leu-398 are represented in both the first and second groups, confirming that these two positions play a central role in the stabilization process. Mutations of the third group did not significantly alter the shape of the gating currents (L398N, R394Q, R394E (data not shown)). When comparing the time courses of the gating currents (Fig. 2) with the amount of gating charge moved in response to membrane depolarization (QV, Fig. 3), it becomes evident that effects on time course and on QV do not always correspond to each other. As expected from the gating current traces, QV relations for the third group of mutants, i.e. R394Q, R394E, and L398N, were indistinguishable from those of W434F (Fig. 3). The first group of mutants, i.e. E395D, L398V and/or L398I, and Y485A and/or Y485H, which eliminated the slow component in the off-gating currents, all increased the slope factors (dV, shallower slope) of their QVs. They also had in common a reduced difference between the QONV and QOFFV, whereas their effects on the equilibrium voltage (V½) varied (Table 1; Fig. 3). The difference between QON and QOFF is likely caused by an immobilization of gating charges in the open state (see below). On the other hand, the second group of mutants all altered the V½ of the QV while leaving the dV constant. The V½ was increased when the slow off-gating component was accelerated (R394A) and decreased when the component was slowed down (E395R) or charges were immobilized (V476A, E395A), indicating that less energy was required"
https://openalex.org/W2056531111,"Proteolysis is regulated by inactive (latent) zymogens, with a prosegment preventing access of substrates to the active-site cleft of the enzyme. How latency is maintained often depends on the catalytic mechanism of the protease. For example, in several families of the metzincin metallopeptidases, a “cysteine switch” mechanism involves a conserved prosegment motif with a cysteine residue that coordinates the catalytic zinc ion. Another family of metzincins, the astacins, do not possess a cysteine switch, so latency is maintained by other means. We have solved the high resolution crystal structure of proastacin from the European crayfish, Astacus astacus. Its prosegment is the shortest structurally reported for a metallopeptidase, and it has a unique structure. It runs through the active-site cleft in reverse orientation to a genuine substrate. Moreover, a conserved aspartate, projected by a wide loop of the prosegment, coordinates the zinc ion instead of the catalytic solvent molecule found in the mature enzyme. Activation occurs through two-step limited proteolysis and entails major rearrangement of a flexible activation domain, which becomes rigid and creates the base of the substrate-binding cleft. Maturation also requires the newly formed N terminus to be precisely trimmed so that it can participate in a buried solvent-mediated hydrogen-bonding network, which includes an invariant active-site residue. We describe a novel mechanism for latency and activation, which shares some common features both with other metallopeptidases and with serine peptidases. Proteolysis is regulated by inactive (latent) zymogens, with a prosegment preventing access of substrates to the active-site cleft of the enzyme. How latency is maintained often depends on the catalytic mechanism of the protease. For example, in several families of the metzincin metallopeptidases, a “cysteine switch” mechanism involves a conserved prosegment motif with a cysteine residue that coordinates the catalytic zinc ion. Another family of metzincins, the astacins, do not possess a cysteine switch, so latency is maintained by other means. We have solved the high resolution crystal structure of proastacin from the European crayfish, Astacus astacus. Its prosegment is the shortest structurally reported for a metallopeptidase, and it has a unique structure. It runs through the active-site cleft in reverse orientation to a genuine substrate. Moreover, a conserved aspartate, projected by a wide loop of the prosegment, coordinates the zinc ion instead of the catalytic solvent molecule found in the mature enzyme. Activation occurs through two-step limited proteolysis and entails major rearrangement of a flexible activation domain, which becomes rigid and creates the base of the substrate-binding cleft. Maturation also requires the newly formed N terminus to be precisely trimmed so that it can participate in a buried solvent-mediated hydrogen-bonding network, which includes an invariant active-site residue. We describe a novel mechanism for latency and activation, which shares some common features both with other metallopeptidases and with serine peptidases."
https://openalex.org/W2100840103,"When selection favors sexual dimorphism, high-fitness parents often produce low-fitness progeny of the opposite sex. This sexual conflict is thought to overwhelm the genetic benefits of mate choice because preferred males incur a cost through the production of low-fitness daughters. We provide a counterpoint in a lizard (Anolis sagrei) that exhibits sexual conflict over body size. By using mate-choice experiments, we show that female brown anoles produce more sons than daughters via large sires but more daughters than sons via small sires. Measures of progeny fitness in the wild suggest that maximal fitness payoffs can be achieved by shifting offspring production from daughters to sons as sire size increases. These results illustrate how the resolution of sexual conflict can restore the genetic benefits of mate choice."
https://openalex.org/W1987311429,"Synthetic nanoparticle formulations have the potential for tumor-targeted gene delivery. Receptor-targeted nanocomplex (RTN) formulations comprise mixtures of cationic liposomes and targeting peptides that self-assemble on mixing with nucleic acids. RTN formulations were prepared containing different polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated lipids with esterase-cleavable linkers (e.g., ME42) to promote intracellular PEG detachment and nanoparticle disassembly. In addition, integrin-targeting peptides (peptide ME27) were tested with endosomal furin- and cathepsin B-cleavable peptide linkers located between the integrinbinding ligand and the K16 nucleic acid-binding domain to promote intracellular disengagement from the receptor. ME42/ME27 RTNs formed stable particles of >200 nm in isotonic salt buffers, compared with 4-μm particles formed by un-PEGylated RTNs. Transfection efficiency by PEG-modified, cleavable RTNs improved ~2-fold in 4 different cell lines, with 80% efficiency in murine neuroblastoma cells. In an in vivo model of neuroblastoma, ME42/ME27 RTNs delivering luciferase genes were tumor specific, with little expression in other organs tested. PEGylation of the RTNs enhanced luciferase transfection 5-fold over non-PEG formulations, whereas the cleavability of the peptide ME27 enhanced transfection 4-fold over that of RTNs with noncleavable peptides. Cleavability of the lipid for in vivo transfections had no effect. PEGylated, cleavable RTN formulations offer prospects for tumorspecific therapeutic gene transfer.—Grosse, S. M., Tagalakis, A.

During late M and early G1, the Mcm2–7 complex is loaded onto chromatin to form prereplicative complex in a Cdt1-dependent manner. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of this loading process is still elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that the previously uncharacterized C-terminal domain of human Mcm6 is the Cdt1 binding domain (CBD) and present its high resolution NMR structure.

For pre-RC assembly, the six-subunit origin recognition complex first binds replication origin on newly synthesized chromatin. The origin recognition complex serves as an origin marker and recruits the initiation factors Noc3p, Cdc6, and Cdt1 to origins for the chromatin loading of the heterohexameric Mcm2–7 complex (3Maiorano D.

The Mcm proteins are members of the highly diversified AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) protein family (8Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V.

All eukaryotic Mcm proteins contain a conserved central nucleotide binding domain, an AAA+ ATPase domain (MCM domain), and the N- and C-terminal domains that are unique to each of the Mcm proteins (12Forsburg S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Cdt1 is a critical member of pre-RC, and its main function is to load Mcm2–7 helicase onto chromatin to license the DNA for replication in the subsequent S phase (16Ferenbach A. Li A. Brito-Martins M. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Cdt1 alone in many types of mammalian cells is sufficient to induce rereplication (17Arentson E. Faloon P. Seo J. Moon E. Studts J.M. Fremont D.H. Choi K.

Previous studies have broadly defined three functional domains of Cdt1: a domain in the middle of the molecule containing the major Geminin interaction site; an N-terminal domain, which is required for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and contains a second interaction site for Geminin; and a C-terminal domain, which is required for association with Mcm proteins (12Forsburg S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Interactions between Cdt1 and individual members of the Mcm2–7 complex have been examined, and Cdt1 was found to interact with Mcm2 and Mcm6 (16Ferenbach A. Li A. Brito-Martins M. Blow J.J.

The existence of a stoichiometric complex between Cdt1 and Mcm2–7 was recently reported, which is consistent with earlier biochemical and genetic investigations (24Remus D. Beuron F. Tolun G. Griffith J.D. Morris E.P. Diffley J.F. Cell. 2009; 139: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the chromatin loading of the Mcm2–7 complex through Cdt1 remains elusive. In this report, we demonstrate that the conserved C-terminal domain of human Mcm6 directly interacts with the C-terminal region of Cdt1. We also present the solution structure of the Cdt1 binding domain (CBD) of human Mcm6 determined by high resolution NMR spectroscopy. The structure of CBD adopts a typical “winged helix” fold consisting of three α-helices and two β-strands. We also mapped the residues of CBD involved in Cdt1 binding by NMR titration and verified the results by mutagenesis studies. Biochemical characterization and structure determination of the Cdt1 binding domain of Mcm6 provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of Mcm2–7 chromatin loading and pre-RC assembly. The coding sequence of human CBD of Mcm6, corresponding to residues 708–821 (C721S), was inserted into the expression vector pET-28a(+)(Novagen). The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) at 37 °C for 5 h. Cell lysates were subject to affinity purification with the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) followed by the cleavage of the hexahistidine tag with thrombin. The resulting product (residues 708–821 of Homo sapiens Mcm6 with a 4-residue N-terminal extension remaining from the thrombin cleavage site) was further purified on a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (GE Healthcare). For the NMR studies, CBD samples uniformly labeled with 15N and/or 13C isotopes were expressed and purified as described above, except that the cells were grown in M9 medium containing [15N]ammonium chloride and d-glucose (or d-[13C6]glucose) (Cambridge Isotopes), respectively. Residual dipolar couplings were measured on a sample that was weakly aligned in the magnet by adding 12 mg/ml filamentous phage Pf1 (ASLA BIOTECH). The coding sequence of human Mcm6 binding domain (MBD), corresponding to residues 410–445 of Cdt1, was inserted into the pET-32a(+) (Novagen)-derived expression vector, in which the thioredoxin tag was replaced by the 56-residue B1 immunoglobulin binding domain of Streptococcal protein G (GB1) to increase the solubility and stability of the fusion protein. The N-terminal GB1-His6-fused Cdt1-MBD was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) at 16 °C for 16 h. Cell lysates were first purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) followed by gel filtration purification with Superdex 75 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare). The prewashed glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) were incubated with lysates of GST or GST-Mcm6-(708–821) at 4 °C for 5 h. The beads were washed three times, and the lysates of Cdt1 fragments were incubated with GST-Mcm6-(708–821) or GST-coupled beads at 4 °C for 4 h. Then, the beads were washed three times and eluted in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.9) containing 10 mm glutathione. One-fourth of the total elute was assayed on a 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. NMR spectra were acquired at 37 °C on 750- and 500-MHz Varian NMR spectrometers. All spectra were processed using NMRPipe (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar, 26Zhu G.

Distance restraints were obtained from 15N- or 13C-edited three-dimensional NOE spectroscopy spectra and two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy. Chemical shift perturbations (Δδ = [(ΔδH)2 + (0.16 ΔδN)2]½, in parts per million) were monitored from two-dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC spectra. NOE assignment and structure calculations were performed using the CANDID (30Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

For further details, see the supplemental Experimental Procedures. We conducted an extensive search to identify the Cdt1 binding domains in human Mcm2–7 complex by the yeast two-hybrid method and found that the interaction between human Mcm6 and Cdt1 is much stronger than that between Mcm2 and Cdt1, which is consistent with mouse study (21Yanagi K. Mizuno T. You Z. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40871-40880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To identify the binding domain of human Cdt1 and that of human Mcm6, different fragments of Mcm6 and Cdt1 were used in the yeast two-hybrid analysis. Our results showed that the C terminus of Mcm6 spanning residues 708–821 (the CBD) could bind with residues 392–471 of Cdt1. The direct physical interaction between these two domains was confirmed by pulldown assays in which GST-fused Mcm6-CBD and thioredoxin-fused Cdt1-(392–471) were used (Fig. 1A). The physical and functional interactions between binding domains of Cdt1 and Mcm6 were also verified by co-immunoprecipitation and dominant negative assays in human cells. 5Z. Wei, C. Liu, X. Wu, N. Xu, B. Zhou, C. Liang, and G. Zhu, unpublished data. As we observed that the Cdt1-(392–471) was unstable and unsuitable for structural study, several truncation mutations of this Cdt1 fragment fused with GB1 tag (40Gronenborn A.M. Filpula D.R. Essig N.Z. Achari A. Whitlow M. Wingfield P.T. Clore G.M. Science. 1991; 253: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 41Zhou P. Lugovskoy A.A. Wagner G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were constructed in an attempt to make them suitable for NMR analysis. We found that the region of Cdt1 spanning residues 410–445 is the core MBD, which is sufficient to interact with CBD (Fig. 1B). The interaction was also confirmed through a yeast two-hybrid assay. A recent investigation reported that mouse Cdt1 with alanine substitution of two lysines, Lys-441 and Lys-445 (corresponding to human Cdt1 Lys-429 and Lys-433), failed to form a complex with Mcm2–7 (23You Z. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24469-24477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and also confirms the importance of the 410–445 region of human Cdt1 in the Mcm6-Cdt1 interaction. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the conserved C-terminal domain of human Mcm6 (residues 707–821) physically interacts with Cdt1 (residues 410–445), the MBD. The three-dimensional structure of the CBD of human Mcm6 (residues 708–821) was determined by the standard multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy and well defined (27Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 28Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1390) Google Scholar, 29Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table S1; see also “Experimental Procedures”). A superimposed ensemble of the 20 water-refined NMR structures and the ribbon plot of the lowest energy structure are shown in Fig. 1C. The Ramachandran plot of the superimposed ensemble showed that 81.7% of the meaningful residues fell into the most favorable regions of torsion angle space, and 16.5% of the residues were in other allowed and generously allowed regions. The remaining 1.8% of the residues, all of which were in the disordered terminal and loop regions of the protein, fell in the so-called disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The structure of CBD adopts a winged helix-turn-helix fold, which is a typical DNA binding motif and may also participate in protein-protein interaction (42Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Residues 718–736 (α1), 745–756 (α2), and 763–781 (α3) constitute the canonical three-helix bundle, which is packed against two short antiparallel β-strands denoted as β1 (residues 787–790) and β2 (residues 810–813). The N terminus (residues 708–715), the region between β1 and β2 (residues 791–809), and the C terminus (residues 814–821) are flexible based on heteronuclear NOE data and are less well defined in the NMR ensemble due to high internal mobility (Fig. 1D). By contrast, loop 1 (residues 737–744) and loop 2 (residues 757–762) appear to be appreciably rigid because the three-helix bundle is tied with the β-sheet through loop 1. The rigidity is confirmed by the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE results (Fig. 1D) and is consistent with the calculated Random Coil Index (43Berjanskii M.V. Wishart D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14970-14971Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 44Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). The helix α1 and the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif (α2-loop 2-α3) establish the stable helix bundle by creating a hydrophobic core through the interactions between conserved residues Ile-726, Leu-748, and Ile-773 (Fig. 1E). A network of NOEs among the core residues in the three helices was observed (residues Glu-740–Val-812, Ser-741–Ile-788, and Ala-742–Val-812), revealing the formation of a compact architecture. The C terminus of CBD, including the antiparallel stranded β-sheet and the conserved Tyr-817, contributes significantly to the fold of CBD as deletion or substitution of these residues led to precipitation in solution or no expression of CBD in E. coli. To validate the three-dimensional structural fold of CBD in solution, we measured 1HN-15N residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) (46Tjandra N. Bax A. Science. 1997; 278: 1111-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar) with CBD protein weakly aligned in Pf1. The 52 experimental RDCs (not used in the structure calculations) of the well resolved resonances of the amino acids in the secondary structural elements agreed nicely with the values back-calculated from the structure that was determined based on the NOEs and the dihedral angle constraints, with the quality factor equal to 0.32. The surface residues and hydrogen-bond network exhibited in the NMR structures were confirmed from a paramagnetic mapping experiment5 and hydrogen exchange data obtained from solvent-exposed amides-HSQC experiment (45Lin D. Sze K.H. Cui Y. Zhu G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Taken together, data from the backbone dynamics study, RDC, and amide hydrogen exchange measurements demonstrate that the first few turns of the helix α1 are not as tightly packed as the remaining secondary structural elements in CBD. To identify the binding sites, we conducted an NMR titration experiment on CBD with GB1-tagged MBD. Remarkably, the addition of MBD induced significant chemical shift perturbations. As shown in Fig. 2A, signals that display large chemical shift changes (Δδ > 0.12 ppm) correspond to amino acids in the helix-turn-helix region formed by helix α2 (residues Trp-751, Lys-754, Glu-755, and Ile-756), loop 2 (residues Glu-757 and Ser-758), and helix α3 (residues Glu-764, Glu-765, and Arg-771) (Fig. 2, B–D). This observation is consistent with the pulldown results shown in Fig. 1B. Residues Leu-753, Glu-763, and Leu-766 completely disappeared due to line broadening after the CBD was titrated by MBD at a ratio of ∼1:2. The solvent accessibility calculated from NACCESS 2.1 and the amide exchange measurements from the SEA-HSQC experiment (45Lin D. Sze K.H. Cui Y. Zhu G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) indicate that either the main chain or the side chain of residues Lys-754, Glu-755, Glu-757, Ser-758, Glu-763, Glu-764, Glu-765, and Leu-766 is found to be on the surface of CBD (Fig. 2, C and D). These solvent-exposed residues form an MBD binding site. All available chemical shift perturbations were quantitatively analyzed to derive the dissociation constant, Kd, which is about 10−4 m. The sequence alignment reveals that the CBD contains a series of acidic residues that form a negatively charged region encompassing α2-loop 2-α3, where the residues experienced major chemical shift changes in the NMR titration experiments (Fig. 2, A–D). A series of point mutants in CBD were constructed to evaluate the contributions of these residues to the CBD-MBD interaction. These point mutants, Y752E, K754A, E755A, I756A, E757A, E757Q, E757D, E763A, E763Q, E763D, E764A, E765A, and L766A, were expressed and purified to homogeneity. Pulldown assay results (Fig. 2E) indicated that the highly conserved residues, Glu-757, Glu-763, and Leu-766, make major contributions to the interaction between MBD and CBD. The electrostatic surface potential of CBD shows that these residues may bind MBD through charge-charge interactions and hydrophobic interactions. To assess whether point mutations affect the structure of CBD, we recorded two-dimensional 1H-15N-HSQC spectra of mutants E757A, E763A, and L766A. The spectra showed similar patterns and line widths, indicating that the structural folds were not disrupted by mutations. These observations are consistent with the fact that these residues are on the surface of the protein. To further confirm the importance of residues Glu-757 and Leu-766 in the Mcm6-Cdt1 interaction, we co-transfected HA-tagged wild-type or alanine substitution mutants of full-length Mcm6 and full-length Cdt1 into 293T cells. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, HA-wtMcm6 and Myc-Cdt1 co-localized in the nucleus of 293T cells, whereas HA-Mcm6 mutants, such as E757A and L766A, failed to co-localize with Myc-Cdt1, although they still remained in the nucleus. As mutations on Glu-757 and Leu-766 disrupted Mcm6-Cdt1 co-localization without influencing the nuclear import of the Mcm6 mutants, the results indicate that these 2 residues were specific and pivotal for the Mcm6-Cdt1 interaction. In all eukaryotic cells, a highly conserved regulatory mechanism ensures that genomic DNA replicates exactly once in each cell cycle. Cdt1-mediated loading of the Mcm2–7 onto chromatin is a critical and accurately regulated event during the initiation of replication. The Mcm2–7 complex chromatin loading might be achieved through direct interaction between Cdt1 and subunits of Mcm2–7 complex. The newly reported results showed that single heptamers of Cdt1-Mcm2–7 are loaded onto DNA cooperatively (24Remus D. Beuron F. Tolun G. Griffith J.D. Morris E.P. Diffley J.F. Cell. 2009; 139: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). However, the detailed domains of Cdt1 and Mcm2–7 involved in the cooperative binding are missing. To fill this missing link, we have applied the yeast two-hybrid method to map the interacting domains between human Cdt1 and human Mcm2–7. We have characterized the C terminus of Mcm6 as the CBD and determined the high resolution NMR structure of CBD. We also identified and verified the binding surface and key residues of Mcm6-CBD involved in the Cdt1 interaction. Structural studies showed that the CBD contains a winged helix fold, which consists of an HTH motif and a wing (β-loop-β) motif. The core structure of the CBD spans residues Ser-718–His-782. The NMR titration experiment showed that the Cdt1 binding sites are located in the HTH region (helix α2-loop 2-helix α3). The GST pulldown assay with CBD mutants confirmed that Glu-757 in conjugation with Glu-763 and Glu-766 form a small cluster of residues in α2, loop 2, and α3 of CBD whose single-point mutation disrupts the interaction with Cdt1-MBD. A DALI search using CBD as input rendered more than 500 structurally related proteins (z-score > 2.0). Most closely related protein structures are those having nucleic acid binding activity, including the transcription factor E2F-4 (1CF7; z-score = 6.0), the penicillinase repressor (1XSD; z-score = 4.2), and the putative AphA-like transcription factor (2RKH; z-score = 4.8). The analysis of structural homologs suggests that CBD could potentially bind with double-stranded-DNA through the short sequence (KRIIEK) in the third helix. We therefore examined whether or not CBD binds DNA with the use of electrophoretic mobility shift assays and an NMR titration experiment using 16-bp double-stranded-DNA and single-stranded-DNA with low and high salt concentrations. However, we failed to observe any shift change in either experiment (data not shown). This may be explained based on the analysis of surface charge distributions of CBD, E2F-4, and penicillinase repressor. The surface charge distribution of CBD does not have the characteristic positively charged patches required for DNA binding (42Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The third helix (α3) of CBD is less positively charged than the DNA binding regions of E2F-4 and penicillinase repressor (supplemental Fig. S2), probably making its binding with DNA impossible. To summarize, we have identified and characterized the Cdt1-interacting domain in the subunits of the human Mcm2–7 complex and the Mcm6 binding domain of Cdt1. We also determined the high resolution solution structure of the Mcm6-CBD. The results here represent an important progress toward the understanding of the molecular mechanism of chromatin loading of the Mcm2–7 complex by Cdt1, which is a critical step during eukaryotic DNA replication initiation. Structural and functional studies on the CBD-MBD complex currently in progress will provide more details of the molecular mechanism for Cdt1-mediated Mcm2–7 complex chromatin loading.

Here, we investigated the role of MIF in the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) using MIF−/− mice and a mouse model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced NIDDM. Following single injection of STZ, MIF+/+ BALB/c mice showed a significant increase in blood glucose levels, developed polyuria, and succumbed to disease. In contrast, no such increase in blood glucose was observed in MIF −/− BALB/c mice treated with STZ. These mice produced significantly less inflammatory cytokines and resistin as compared with MIF+/+ mice and failed to develop clinical disease. Finally, oral administration of a smallmolecule MIF antagonist, CPSI-1306, to outbred ICR mice following induction of NIDDM significantly lowered blood glucose levels in the majority of animals, which was also associated with a significant reduction in the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α in the sera. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MIF is involved in the pathogenesis of NIDDM and is a therapeutic target to treat this disease.—Sanchez-Zamora, Y., Terrazas, L.

Attempting to settle the disagreements and reach a consensus, we undertook a collective discussion approach. This process clarified a number of issues but left some questions still unresolved. Discrepancies in published results about the role of N-cadherin in hematopoietic stem cells have led to confusion in the field. Attempting to settle the disagreements and reach a consensus, we undertook a collective discussion approach. This process clarified a number of issues but left some questions still unresolved. One of the fundamental principles in biology is that cells in multicellular organisms interact and communicate with surrounding cells to acquire or maintain certain properties. This principle is relevant for stem cell biologists as they examine the “niche” hypothesis. The “stem cell niche” concept was first applied to the mammalian hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) field in 1978 (for a review of this area, see Voog and Jones, 2010Voog and JonesCell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar); however, because of the rarity and low accessibility of HSCs, as well as the lack of specific HSC markers, it has been difficult to examine the specific contact of HSCs with niche cells. Drosophila researchers adopted the niche concept and demonstrated that DE-cadherin and β-catenin interact at the interface between germline stem cells (GSCs) and niche cells. Loss of DE-cadherin leads to the loss of GSCs. These observations in Drosophila gonads encouraged the mammalian HSC field to examine the role of cadherin in the marrow niche. Bone marrow contains a variety of cells that make up stem cell niche. There is evidence suggesting that some cells in the bone marrow express N-cadherin. Three papers published in 2003 and 2004 proposed that bone marrow osteoblasts are HSC niche cells, and two of them additionally showed that osteoblasts and HSCs are positive for immunohistochemical staining with a polyclonal anti-N-cadherin antibody (YS, Japan) (Calvi et al., 2003Calvi L.M. Adams G.B. Weibrecht K.W. Weber J.M. Olson D.P. Knight M.C. Martin R.P. Schipani E. Divieti P. Bringhurst F.R. et al.Nature. 2003; 425: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2003Zhang J. Niu C. Ye L. Huang H. He X. Tong W.G. Ross J. Haug J. Johnson T.

Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). However, none of the studies identified a functional role for N-cadherin in the HSC niche. Wilson et al., 2004Wilson A. Murphy M.J. Oskarsson T. Kalouis K. Bettess M.D. Oser G.M. Pasche A.C. Knabenhans C. MacDonald H.R. Trumpp A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2747-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar found that KLS (c-kit+lineage−Sca-1+) cells are a mixture of N-cadherin-positive and -negative cells based on staining with the YS antibody, but whether those YS antibody-positive cells were long-term repopulating HSCs was unclear. In their model, HSCs lacking c-myc maintain a high level of N-cadherin and other adhesion molecules to enhance stem cell-niche interaction and therefore promote HSC expansion, whereas HSCs with high c-myc repress the adhesion molecules, causing the loss of stem cell-niche interaction and progressive exhaustion of stem cell pool. Later, Hosakawa et al. demonstrated that reactive oxygen species downregulated expression of N-cadherin in LSK-SP (c-kit+lineage−Sca-1+-side population) cells by quantitative RT-PCR and proposed a role of N-cadherin in the HSC-niche interaction (Hosokawa et al., 2007Hosokawa K. Arai F. Yoshihara H. Nakamura Y. Gomei Y. Iwasaki H. Miyamoto K. Shima H. Ito K. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 363: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Another follow-up study detected N-cadherin expression in Flk2−LSK HSCs by flow cytometry with a monoclonal N-cadherin antibody (MNCD2) that was verified by RT-PCR. This study indicated that the YS polyclonal antibody does not reliably indicate N-cadherin and instead concluded that flow cytometry with MNCD2 can be used to identify distinct subpopulations of HSCs (Haug et al., 2008Haug J.S. He X.C. Grindley J.C. Wunderlich J.P. Gaudenz K. Ross J.T. Paulson A. Wagner K.P. Xie Y. Zhu R. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The authors concluded that Flk2−LSK cells that express intermediate levels of N-cadherin (N-cadherinint) are quiescent HSCs that lack significant reconstituting potential upon transplantation into irradiated mice, whereas cells expressing low levels of N-cadherin (N-cadherinlo) are primed/active HSCs with the capacity to reconstitute irradiated mice (Haug et al., 2008Haug J.S. He X.C. Grindley J.C. Wunderlich J.P. Gaudenz K. Ross J.T. Paulson A. Wagner K.P. Xie Y. Zhu R. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, two other papers reported no evidence of N-cadherin expression in Flk2−LSK cells or a further enriched population, SLAM-LSK HSCs, by a variety of techniques, including antibody staining and RT-PCR (Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, Kiel et al., 2007Kiel M.J. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 204-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, these authors found that N-cadherin conditional knockout mice had no observable phenotype in HSC frequency, hematopoiesis, long-term competitive repopulation, or serial transplantation (Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The observations from the different groups were therefore at odds with one another. The discrepancies described above were generating confusion in the published literature and thus in the field. With the aim of resolving the controversy and providing clarification of the issues involved, we embarked on an interactive discussion approach. At our (L.I.Z.) request, the principal investigators from the two groups that have generated the majority of the conflicting published data, Linheng Li and Sean Morrison, participated in a telephone conference in which each investigator presented and discussed pertinent data slides. This meeting also included another investigator, Toshio Suda, who has published work suggesting a positive role for N-cadherin in the bone marrow, and the editor of Cell Stem Cell, Deborah Sweet. This joint discussion was followed by a series of one-on-one phone meetings and two other telephone conferences with L.I.Z. During the discussion, it became clear that the disagreement centered on three major questions: (1) Do HSCs express N-cadherin? (2) Is the MNCD2 monoclonal antibody specific for N-cadherin? (3) Does N-cadherin play a role in HSC maintenance and regulation? Involving the groups who had previously come to differing conclusions in a joint discussion provided an efficient mechanism for critical analysis of key experimental data and honest expression of opinion about the relevant issues. With the available information, some conclusions about the first two issues became clear, and these will be outlined below. However, we were not able to reach an agreement on the third question on the basis of the available data. Upon the senior scientist's suggestion, the Li and Morrison labs agreed to independently perform a limiting dilution competitive transplantation with the exact same experimental conditions and N-cadherin conditional knockout mice, with a view to comparing data and coming to a consensus conclusion. Several emails between the groups outlined in detail the methods, doses of cells, and mechanism of conditional inactivation of N-cadherin. Six months later, we set up a phone call to examine the data from the two laboratories. During our initial discussions, we were able to come to agreement on a number of points relating to detection of N-cadherin expression in bone marrow cells. In previous studies, the expression of N-cadherin in HSCs has been examined at the mRNA level. The Li and Suda groups found that N-cadherin mRNA can be detected in highly enriched populations of stem cells by quantitative RT-PCR (Haug et al., 2008Haug J.S. He X.C. Grindley J.C. Wunderlich J.P. Gaudenz K. Ross J.T. Paulson A. Wagner K.P. Xie Y. Zhu R. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, Hosokawa et al., 2007Hosokawa K. Arai F. Yoshihara H. Nakamura Y. Gomei Y. Iwasaki H. Miyamoto K. Shima H. Ito K. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 363: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Hosokawa et al., 2010Hosokawa K. Arai F. Yoshihara H. Iwasaki H. Hembree M. Yin T. Nakamura Y. Gomei Y. Takubo K. Shiama H. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 194-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but Morrison and colleagues did not detect any expression by qRT-PCR or by microarray analysis (Kiel et al., 2007Kiel M.J. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 204-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Indeed, even in the Li and Suda groups' qRT-PCR assays, the expression level in HSCs was found to be very low compared with some non-HSC control populations. Moreover, no microarray analysis by any group has ever reported the enrichment of N-cadherin in HSCs. With very low levels of expression, divergent findings could potentially be explained by differences in experimental methods and assay sensitivities. The overall conclusion from these data is that N-cadherin RNA is either present at very low levels or absent in HSCs. The majority of the protein expression data presented by Haug et al. were obtained using a monoclonal antibody against N-cadherin, MNCD2 (Haug et al., 2008Haug J.S. He X.C. Grindley J.C. Wunderlich J.P. Gaudenz K. Ross J.T. Paulson A. Wagner K.P. Xie Y. Zhu R. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, challenges to the conclusion that HSCs might express varying low levels of N-cadherin on their surface have centered on concerns about the specificity of the MNCD2 reagent. MNCD2 was originally developed by Matsunami and Takeichi in 1995 (Matsunami and Takeichi, 1995Matsunami H. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 466-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and its specificity for N-cadherin in western blots was demonstrated by Radice et al., who compared wild-type and N-cadherin null mice (Radice et al., 1997Radice G.L. Rayburn H. Matsunami H. Knudsen K.A. Takeichi M. Hynes R.O. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 64-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The Morrison and Li groups also independently confirmed that MNCD2 was specific for N-cadherin by western blotting and immunostaining using neonatal forebrain cells and cell lines in which N-cadherin is abundantly expressed (Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, Haug et al., 2008Haug J.S. He X.C. Grindley J.C. Wunderlich J.P. Gaudenz K. Ross J.T. Paulson A. Wagner K.P. Xie Y. Zhu R. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To examine whether N-cadherin is expressed in enriched HSCs, Kiel et al. sorted 105 LSK cells and carried out western blot analysis with MNCD2. They failed to detect any N-cadherin protein despite readily detecting N-cadhrerin in a few thousand forebrain cells (Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, the available data suggest that MNCD2 does give a specific signal by Western blot in tissues in which N-cadherin is highly expressed, but Western blotting with MNCD2 has not been able to confirm N-cadherin expression in the LSK cells. These observations provide further support for the idea that N-cadherin is expressed in a very limited hematopoetic cell population and/or at extremely low levels, or may in fact be absent. Using improved Western blotting techniques and a large number of highly purified cells might reveal the answer. The above conclusions about the expression level of N-cadherin in HSCs raise the possibility that signals obtained for MNCD2 with other assays could be the result of nonspecific binding. Use of the MNCD2 antibody for flow cytometry with enriched HSCs has proved problematic. Haug et al. did see a shift in MNCD2 staining with Flk2-LSK cells compared with the control omitting MNCD2, but in their published study they did not compare this staining with isotype controls to assess staining above background or non-specific antibody binding (Haug et al., 2008Haug J.S. He X.C. Grindley J.C. Wunderlich J.P. Gaudenz K. Ross J.T. Paulson A. Wagner K.P. Xie Y.

Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar were unable to detect any staining of SLAM-LSK or Flk2-LSK HSCs using MNCD2 or other commercially available anti-N-cadherin antibodies. Moreover, both Kiel et al. and Foudi et al. found that MNCD2 strongly stained surface B220+ B cells in the bone marrow, but when these cells were sorted and analyzed by Western blot, no N-cadherin band was evident (Foudi et al., 2009Foudi A. Hochedlinger K. Van Buren D. Schindler J.W. Jaenisch R. Carey V. Hock H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The Morrison and Hock groups also examined HSCs enriched by multiple combinations of markers, such as SLAM-LSK and Flk2-LSK, and neither group observed any effect of N-cadherin deficiency on the MNCD2 staining of HSCs or other bone marrow cells (Foudi et al., 2009Foudi A. Hochedlinger K. Van Buren D. Schindler J.W. Jaenisch R. Carey V. Hock H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To some extent the differences in results could be due to variation in flow cytometry technique between the labs, different subclones of hybridoma used to produce the antibody, or the conditional knockout efficiency. However, the Morrison laboratory tested multiple aliquots of MNCD2 antibody obtained from the Li laboratory as well as directly from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank and confirmed in all of their experiments that N-cadherin deletion was complete or nearly complete by PCR (S.M. unpublished data). Concerns about these technical differences are heightened by the very low level of proposed N-cadherin expression and the non-specific binding of MNCD2 to HSCs/progenitors. There is no indication from any group that HSCs express high levels of N-cadherin, and instead the accumulated data are consistent with a low level of expression, if any at all, that might be limited to a very small subset of HSCs. Although very low levels of proteins can have a function in cell biology, these data currently cannot be used to support an important HSC function of N-cadherin. These conclusions formed the backdrop against which we discussed our viewpoints on functional studies. To address the question of whether N-cadherin is required for HSC maintenance, Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar studied N-cadherin conditional knockout mice, as the germline knockout is embryonic lethal. They did not observe any change of HSCs or hematopoiesis in homeostatic situations up to 5 months after N-cadherin deletion (using Mx-1-Cre). To further challenge the HSCs, they transplanted 106 bone marrow cells from the N-cadherin conditional knockout mice with comparable numbers of competitive bone marrow cells, and did not observe a significant difference in chimerism relative to wild-type donor cells, even in secondary transplantation. From these experiments, they concluded that HSCs “do not depend on N-cadherin to regulate their maintenance.” N-cadherin could potentially still be required during regeneration or the response to certain types of stresses, and testing the N-cadherin knockout animals for their response during various stresses or irradiation could be interesting. However, the Morrison group failed to see any effect of N-cadherin deletion on the recovery of mice in response to 5-fluorouracil treatment (Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), indicating that N-cadherin does not play an important role in at least this stress condition. During the discussion, the transplantation data by Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar were questioned. One potential issue related to the knockout efficiency in the donor mice, and it was suggested that using reporter mice that can indicate the Cre-mediated recombination activity could be helpful. However, with such an approach it is still possible that the recombination efficiency at the reporter locus could be different from the N-cadherin locus, or could vary between cell populations. As an alternative approach, Morrison's group purified the LT-HSC for clonal culture and performed PCR on each individual colony, showing the knockout efficiency was almost 100%. In addition, the donor-derived cells in the recipients' peripheral blood are also N-cad−/−, further confirming the knockout efficiency (Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J.

Based on these results, it seems unlikely that the failure to observe a phenotype is due to incomplete knockout. Even though transplantation is considered the gold standard for testing stem cell functionality, the field has not been able to agree on standardized procedures, and there are substantial inter-lab variances in aspects of hematopoietic transplantation protocols such as donor cell numbers and the cut-off for long-term multi-lineage reconstitution. In an attempt to address the controversy in a rigorous way, L.I.Z. suggested that both groups perform a limiting dilution competitive transplantation independently and compare results, and they agreed to do so. The agreed experiment was that 20,000, 60,000 and 200,000 wild-type or N-cad conditional knockout whole bone marrow cells would be transplanted together with 200,000 competitor cells, and the results examined 16 weeks after transplantation. Six months later, however, only the Morrison lab presented data from the agreed experiment (M. Acar, M. Kiel, and S. Morrison, unpublished data). We examined the resulting data with a biostatistician using standard software for calculating the frequency of hematopoietic stem cell engraftment and ANOVA analysis, and found that there was no difference between the wild-type and N-cadherin deficient groups, consistent with the conclusions published previously by Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar. For additional verification, we also showed the entire analysis to an independent investigator in the hematopoietic stem cell field, who also ran the data through statistical software and came to the same conclusion. Complete N-cadherin deletion was confirmed in these experiments by PCR of genomic DNA from donor cells sorted from the reconstituted mice. However, instead of the agreed set of experiments the Li lab independently chose to undertake a different approach involving using a Cre-loxP reporter system to indirectly indicate the recombination/knockout efficiency and transplanting purified reporter positive and reporter negative cells separately. They observed a difference between these two subsets of cells, which they interpreted as indicating a role for N-cadherin in HSCs (L. Li, unpublished data). However, in our view these experiments are not straightforward to interpret and are therefore not informative for resolving the question at hand. Thus, at this point our conclusion is that no substantial HSC phenotype associated with N-cadherin conditional deletion has been observed, suggesting that N-cadherin does not play an essential functional role in HSCs. Although the data available at this point do not indicate an essential role of N-cadherin in HSCs, redundancy in cadherin function in HSCs remains a possibility. Early experiments showed that HSCs do not express E-cadherin (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang J. Niu C. Ye L. Huang H. He X. Tong W.G. Ross J. Haug J. Johnson T. Feng J.Q. et al.Nature. 2003; 425: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). However, in this issue of Cell Stem Cell Toshio Suda's group show that the N-cadherin mRNA level in LSK cells differs between mouse strains by qRT-PCR (Hosokawa et al., 2010Hosokawa K. Arai F. Yoshihara H. Iwasaki H. Hembree M. Yin T. Nakamura Y. Gomei Y. Takubo K. Shiama H. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 194-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). They found that the C57BL/6 strain has significantly higher N-cadherin level than the 129/Sv strain, from which the N-cadherinfl/- mice were originally derived (Kostetskii et al., 2005Kostetskii I. Li J. Xiong Y. Zhou R. Ferrari V.A. Patel V.V. Molkentin J.D. Radice G.L. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 129/Sv strain has higher expression of other cadherins than the C57BL/6 strain. This could indicate that different cadherins are used by different strains. Interestingly, the Suda group found that overexpressing a dominant-negative(DN) N-cadherin inhibits the lodgment and long-term repopulating activities of HSCs, while overexpressing wild-type N-cadherin has the opposite effect (Hosokawa et al., 2010Hosokawa K. Arai F. Yoshihara H. Iwasaki H. Hembree M. Yin T. Nakamura Y. Gomei Y. Takubo K. Shiama H. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 194-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because of the non-specific blocking of cadherin family members by the DN-N-cadherin (Fujimori and Takeichi, 1993Fujimori E. Takeichi M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), this result leaves open the possibility that cell adhesion mediated by the redundant cadherin family members might be involved in HSC activities. However, it is worth noting that Kiel et al. were not able to detect N-cadherin mRNA in C57BL HSCs and studied knockout mice that were backcrossed with C57BL/6 for at least six generations, arguing against the idea that strain background is a basis for the discrepancy in results (Kiel et al., 2009Kiel M.J. Acar M. Radice G.L. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, although potential strain differences are intriguing, currently it does not appear likely they can provide an explanation for the different conclusions drawn. In summary, therefore, although there are still differences of opinion among the investigators involved in this process regarding the potential for N-cadherin function in HSCs, it is our view that to move the research in the field forward we need to acknowledge the current observations and set a common foundation for the stem cell community. The current observations on the N-cadherin conditional knockout model indicate that the maintenance of adult HSCs does not appear to depend on N-cadherin homophilic interactions. This conclusion does not support or argue against the potential role of osteoblasts or perivascular cells in the HSC niche, and it does not entirely rule out the idea of cadherin-mediated niche-HSC interaction model as cadherin redundancy is still a possibility. However, convincing evidence to support this idea would require demonstration of a clear HSC defect in knockout mice, either alone or in combination with the N-cadherin knockout, using limiting dilution competitive repopulation studies in the mouse. Our conclusion is that until clear cut data along these lines are forthcoming, the field should not base further experiments on the concept that there is a functionally significant cell-autonomous role for N-cadherin in HSCs. •N-cadherin expression in HSCs is either low or undetectable; if N-cadherin is expressed in HSCs it is present at a very low level and/or in a small subset of cells.•The N-cadherin monoclonal antibody, MNCD2, is not specific for N-cadherin expression in the hematopoietic compartment. This antibody should not be used for experiments that require flow-cytometric sorting of HSCs, although it still can be used to detect N-cadherin expression by Western blot or immunostaining in tissues that express high levels of N-cadherin, such as liver.•Currently available data lead to the conclusion that the maintenance of adult HSCs does not depend on a cell-autonomous role of N-cadherin. To argue against this conclusion, future experiments would need to demonstrate that genetic deficiency of another component, such as a different cadherin, causes a substantial HSC phenotype in N-cadherin conditional knockout mice. Cadherin-Based Adhesion Is a Potential Target for Niche Manipulation to Protect Hematopoietic Stem Cells in Adult Bone MarrowHosokawa et al.Cell Stem CellMarch 05, 2010In BriefDuring postnatal life, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are maintained in specialized bone marrow (BM) niches (Morrison and Spradling, 2008; Wilson and Trumpp, 2006; Yin and Li, 2006). Cadherins are major cell adhesion molecules responsible for Ca2+-dependent cell-cell interaction (Gumbiner, 1996), but the role of cadherin function, and more specifically N-cadherin, in HSC-niche interactions has been controversial (Li and Zon, 2010). In this study, we analyzed the expression of various cadherin (cad) genes in long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) and subpopulations of the cells isolated from the endosteum. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"

PKA is a tetramer with two catalytic (C) and two regulatory (R) subunits, each including two tandem cAMP binding domains, i.e. CBD-A and -B. Structural investigations of RIα have revealed that although CBD-A plays a pivotal role in the cAMP-dependent inhibition of C, the main function of CBD-B is to regulate the access of cAMP to site A. To further understand the mechanism underlying the cross-talk between CBD-A and -B, we report here the NMR investigation of a construct of R, RIα-(119–379), which unlike previous fragments characterized by NMR, spans in full both CBDs. Our NMR studies were also extended to two mutants, R209K and the corresponding R333K, which severely reduce the affinity of cAMP for CBD-A and -B, respectively. The comparative NMR analysis of wild-type RIα-(119–379) and of the two domain silencing mutations has led to the definition at an unprecedented level of detail of both intra- and interdomain allosteric networks, revealing several striking differences between the two CBDs. First, the two domains, although homologous in sequence and structure, exhibit remarkably different responses to the R/K mutations especially at the β2-3 allosteric “hot spot.” Second, although the two CBDs are reciprocally coupled at the level of local unfolding of the hinge, the A-to-B and B-to-A pathways are dramatically asymmetrical at the level of global unfolding. Such an asymmetric interdomain cross-talk ensures efficiency and robustness in both the activation and de-activation of PKA.

Such an asymmetric interdomain cross-talk ensures efficiency and robustness in both the activation and de-activation of PKA. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an essential and ubiquitous second messenger that relays extracellular signals and translates them into tightly regulated intracellular responses (1Berman H.M.

In eukaryotes, one of the main cAMP receptors is protein kinase A (PKA), 4The abbreviations used are: PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinase ABBRbase binding regionCBDcAMP binding domainH/Dhydrogen/deuterium exchangeHSQCheteronuclear single-quantum coherencePBCphosphate binding cassettePFprotection factorRregulatory subunit of PKACcatalytic subunit of PKARIαisoform Iα of the R subunit of PKAR2dimeric regulatory subunit of PKATROSYtransverse relaxation optimized spectroscopyNOESYtwo-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. which catalyzes Ser/Thr phosphorylation in downstream protein substrates that in turn control a wide range of cellular processes including metabolism and cell death (2Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). PKA exists in two forms: an inactive tetrameric holoenzyme and an active free catalytic subunit (C). In the holoenzyme, two C molecules form a complex with a dimeric regulatory subunit (R2). Upon binding to cAMP synthesized in response to external signals, each R-subunit undergoes a conformational change, releasing the C-subunit in its active state (1Berman H.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Goodsell D.S. Haste N.M. Kornev A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The cAMP-dependent activation of PKA is reversible, and when phosphodiesterases deplete cAMP levels, the R-subunits revert to their dormant C-bound state in which the kinase function is inhibited (3Dodge K.L. Khouangsathiene S. Kapiloff M.S. Mouton R. Hill E.V. Houslay M.D. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The reversibility in the activation of PKA represents a critical aspect of the regulation of its function, as it is required for the cell to revert to resting conditions after cAMP levels have been temporarily raised by transient external stimuli (4Kopperud R. Krakstad C. Selheim F. Døskeland S.O.

The R-subunit of PKA is a multidomain and highly dynamic protein. All known R-subunit isoforms share a common organization with an N-terminal dimerization/docking domain followed by a flexible linker region that includes the autoinhibitory segment and is C-terminally connected to two tandem CBDs (CBD-A and B, Fig. 1a) (5Taylor S.S. Kim C. Vigil D. Haste N.M. Yang J. Wu J. Anand G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Whereas the dimerization/docking domain mediates the subcellular localization of PKA via protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (6Scott J.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 465-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the interactions with the C-subunit and with cAMP involve the autoinhibitory region and CBDs A and B (7Kim C. Cheng C.Y. Saldanha S.A. Taylor S.S. Cell. 2007; 130: 1032-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Both CBDs share a typical α/β-subdomain architecture, with the β-barrels embedding the two cAMP binding sites and with the non-contiguous α-helical subdomains joined at the interface between the two domains (Fig. 1e) (8Su Y.

Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) have revealed an ordered sequential mechanism of PKA activation whereby cAMP binds first to CBD-B, making site A accessible to a second molecule of cAMP, which in turn causes the release of the active C-subunit. In other words CBD-B functions as a gatekeeper for CBD-A, whereas the latter acts as the central controlling unit of the PKA system and provides the primary interfaces with the C-subunit (7Kim C. Cheng C.Y. Saldanha S.A. Taylor S.S. Cell. 2007; 130: 1032-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 8Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L.

Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The structures of the R-subunit in its active and inhibited states have also demonstrated that although CBD-A and CBD-B play clearly distinct roles in the activation of PKA, they both share similar allosteric features (Fig. 1c). Specifically, in both domains cAMP docks into a conserved phosphate binding cassette (PBC) and a base binding region (BBR), causing a hinge rotation of the helical region C-terminal to the β-barrel (“hinge” or αB/C-helices) and a closure of the hinge region over the adenine base (Fig. 1d). In all CBD domains there is a conserved element called the “lid” that interacts with the adenine ring, but the origin of this lid varies in the different CBD domains (1Berman H.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Goodsell D.S. Haste N.M. Kornev A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the CBD-B of RIα, the lid comes from the αC-helix of the same CBD (i.e.“cis-domain lid”), whereas for CBD-A of RIα the lid is provided by the B domain (i.e.“trans-domain lid”) and specifically by the N3A motif (N3A) of CBD-B (Fig. 1c). The N3A constitutes the fourth conserved motif in both CBDs, which is the helical element that lies N-terminal to the β-barrel and is composed of an N-terminal helix, a 310 loop, and the following αA helix (Fig. 1, c–e). The cAMP-dependent rearrangement of the helices C-terminal to the β-subdomain also leads to a concurrent partial re-positioning of the N3A motif that in the case of CDB-B is fused to the αC-helix of CBD-A but is still functionally a part of CBD-B (Fig. 1, c and d) (7Kim C. Cheng C.Y. Saldanha S.A. Taylor S.S. Cell. 2007; 130: 1032-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This disposition of two CBDs in tandem and fused directly to each other is a distinctive feature of the R-subunits of PKA. However, structural investigations of other CBDs have shown that the four elements outlined above (i.e. PBC, BBR, hinge, N3A, Fig. 1, c and d) are universally conserved among eukaryotic domains that function as cAMP sensors (12Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13Kornev A.P. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: 1-9Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The crystallographic studies on the structure of CBDs have recently been complemented by NMR analyses of constructs including a single CBD of either PKA or EPAC (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP), which have unveiled an additional conserved allosteric “hot spot” at the loop between strands β2 and β3 (14Das R.

Furthermore, the solution studies have also revealed that cAMP binding controls not only the local environment of the allosteric sites as sensed by chemical shift changes but also the hierarchical distribution of excited states that defines the free energy landscape of these domains, as probed through H/D exchange monitored at residue resolution by NMR. Specifically, it is now clear that cAMP modulates not only global unfolding of the CBDs but also local unfolding at α-subdomain sites well removed from the PBC where cAMP docks (15Das R. Esposito V. Abu-Abed M. Anand G.S. Taylor S.S. Melacini G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Mazhab-Jafari M.T. Das R. Fotheringham S.A. SilDas S.

Whereas the definition of these long range perturbations represents a first step toward mapping intra-CBD signaling pathways and provides initial clues on how cAMP reshapes the free energy landscape of CBDs, the picture emerging from the NMR analysis of single CBD constructs is still somewhat limited by the lack of the adjacent domain. In particular, because of the absence of the “gatekeeper” CBD-B, the previous RIα construct used for NMR purposes (i.e. RIα-(119–244)) did not contain a full integral lid region (15Das R. Esposito V.

Here, we report the investigation by NMR of a two-domain construct of RIα, i.e. RIα-(119–379) (Fig. 1a). This construct not only includes the whole CBD-B, but it provides also an unprecedented representation of eukaryotic CBDs in general because, unlike previous NMR-based investigations (14Das R.

Furthermore, as a first step toward mapping the inter-CBD cross-talk, the NMR investigation of the wild-type two-domain construct RIα-(119–379) was also extended to two single mutants that target two highly conserved Arg residues in the PBCs, i.e. R209K in PBC-A and R333K in PBC-B (Fig. 1, c and d). The guanidiniums of Arg-209 and Arg-333 form salt bridges with the phosphate of cAMP and are an integral part of PBC-A and -B, respectively (8Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 13Kornev A.P. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2008; 4: 1-9Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, a–e). Indeed, these arginines are highly conserved not only in the PBCs of RIα (Fig. 1, b–d) but also in the majority of other known CBDs (20Kannan N. Wu J. Anand G.S. Yooseph S. Neuwald A.F. Venter J.C. Taylor S.S. Genome Biology. 2007; 8: R264.1-R264.13Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The mutation of Arg-209 to Lys has been shown to reduce the affinity for cAMP at site A by about 3 orders of magnitude (i.e. KD from 30 nm to the ≥μm range) as well as at the non-mutated site B by about 1 order of magnitude (i.e. KD from 15 to 130 nm) (21Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A similar reciprocal “domain silencing” effect has been reported also for R333K (21Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ability of the R209K and R333K mutations to decrease the cAMP affinity for both PBCs indicates that these point substitutions cause long range perturbations and represent useful tools to start dissecting the pathways that mediate the interdomain communication in RIα. Furthermore, despite the increased dissociation constants for cAMP, the inhibition of the C-subunit by either R209K or R333K RIα is still cAMP-dependent (21Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), indicating that both RIα mutants are functionally active. Overall, the three state (i.e. wild-type, R209K, and R333K RIα-(119–379)) comparative NMR analysis of chemical shifts and solvent protection factors for wild-type, R209K, and R333K RIα-(119–379) (Fig. 1b) has revealed several striking differences between domains A and B. Such differences pertain to intradomain as well as to interdomain cAMP signal propagation and provide new insight not only on the deactivation but also on the activation mechanism of PKA. The two-domain construct RIα-(119–379) of PKA was subcloned into the pRSET-B expression system (Invitrogen), and mutants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. The protein was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and overexpressed in M9 minimal medium. For 1H,15N HSQC and H/D exchange experiments, a single-labeled 15N sample with >98% 15N incorporation was used. For triple resonance experiments, triple-labeled 13C,2H,15N samples were prepared. Both 15N and 13C were incorporated at levels >98%, whereas 2H was present at levels of 50–98% at the Hα position of the protein after back exchange with purification buffers, depending on what percentage of 2H2O was used in the growth process. Selectively labeled samples of 15N-labeled Gly, Ala, Val, and Leu were also prepared for the wild type to assist in assignment. The Gly-, Ala-, and Val-selective samples were prepared by growing the cells in LB medium and adding 0.5 g of the 15N-labeled amino acid, predissolved in H2O, into the culture 1 h before induction by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, as previously described (22Englander J. Cohen L. Arshava B. Estephan R. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biopolymers. 2006; 84: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The [15N]Leu sample was prepared in M9 medium with the NH4Cl replaced by 100 mg each of the other unlabeled 19 amino acids and 200 mg of [15N]Leu. The cells were grown and induced under the same conditions as the other isotopically enriched M9 culture. The remaining portion of the sample preparations followed, to a large extent, previously published protocols and the details are available as supplemental material. During the last purification step, i.e. gel filtration, the protein was separated from the cAMP used during the prior elution steps, and the final product was a protein free of excess cAMP. The NMR samples were prepared by concentrating the protein to 0.5 mm, as determined by the Bradford assay (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar), and adding 2H2O to a final concentration of 5% (v/v). To ensure the long term stability of the NMR samples, 0.4 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine were also added. All NMR spectra were recorded at a temperature of 306 K on a Bruker AV 700 spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryo-probe. In all experiments, the 1H and 15N carrier frequencies were set at the water resonance and at the center of the amide region, respectively. The 13C carrier frequency varied depending on the experiment. All one-dimensional data sets were processed and analyzed using Xwinnmr (Bruker Inc.), and all multidimensional data sets were processed using NMRPipe (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11626) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, a phase-shifted-squared sine bell window function was employed for both dimensions before zero filling. Processed spectra were analyzed using NMRDraw and Sparky 3.114 (25Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2006Google Scholar). All of the two-dimensional HSQC spectra acquired were sensitivity- and gradient-enhanced and included water flip-back pulses. After 128 dummy scans, 8 scans were accumulated per t1 point using an inter scan delay of 1 s. Unless otherwise specified, the 15N dimension was digitized with 128 complex points for a spectral width of 31.8 ppm, and the 1H dimension was digitized with 1024 complex points for a spectral width of 15.939 ppm. All TROSY triple resonance three-dimensional experiments (i.e. HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HN(CO)CACB, HNCACB, HN(CA)CO, and HNCO) as well as the HSQC-NOESY-HSQC spectra were acquired on triple-labeled (>98% 15N, >98% 13C, and 50% 2H isotopic enrichment) protein samples with a concentration of 0.5 mm and with an inter-scan delay ranging from 1 to 2 s, depending on the sensitivity of the experiment. Chemical shift predictions were generated with ShiftX (26Neal S. Nip A.M. Zhang H. Wishart D.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 215-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) using the RIα-(91–379) crystal structure (PBD code 1RGS) (8Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) with corrections to account for deuteration. Secondary structure profiles were calculated with the program PECAN using the NH, HN, Cα, Cβ, and C′ backbone assignments (27Eghbalnia H.R. Wang L. Bahrami A. Assadi A. Markley J.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 32: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The compounded changes in chemical shift when comparing the wild-type protein with the mutants were calculated with the equation Δδcompound = ((Δδ1H)2 + (Δδ15N/6.5)2)1/2, where Δδ 1H and Δδ 15N are the ppm differences in nitrogen and hydrogen amide chemical shifts, respectively, between the two states being compared. The samples for the H/D exchange experiments were prepared by first concentrating 7.5 mg of protein to ∼2.5 mm (<100 μl final volume). The sample was prepared as previously described (28Das R. Abu-Abed M. Melacini G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 8406-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) by passing the sample through a Sephadex G10 column with a 3-ml bed volume pre-equilibrated with 98% 2H2O-based gel filtration buffer. A series of HSQC experiments was recorded with preset parameters for a sample with similar buffer and sample height to minimize the dead time (∼25 min) of the H/D exchange experiment. The fast initial decay was monitored through a series of 30 HSQC spectra acquired with four scans (∼10 min per HSQC). The remaining slower decay was monitored through a series of HSQC spectra acquired with eight scans. Data were acquired for a total of 20 h. The sample was kept at 33 °C, and HSQC spectra were acquired once per week to provide additional data points for slowly decaying peaks. For each construct (i.e. wild type and two mutants) H/D exchange data were acquired for both samples with no excess cAMP and 2 mm excess cAMP, resulting in a total of six H/D data sets (Fig. 1b). The HSQC cross-peak heights were quantified by NMRPipe as the sum of the intensities in a 3 × 3 grid centered on the peak maximum (29Tollinger M. Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11341-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The rates of exchange were measured using the Levenberg-Marqardt nonlinear least-square exponential fitting implemented through the Curvefit software as previously described (15Das R. Esposito V. Abu-Abed M. Anand G.S. Taylor S.S. Melacini G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The error on the intensities was based on the standard deviation of the spectral noise. The H/D decays were normalized relative to the intensities in the first HSQC spectrum acquired after exposure to 2H2O. As a first step toward a high resolution characterization of the tandem CBDs of the PKA R-subunit in solution, the backbone assignment of the cAMP-bound state of RIα-(119–379) was obtained using a combination of TROSY-based triple resonance experiments, HSQC-NOESY-HSQC spectra, selectively labeled amino acid samples (i.e. 15N-labeled Gly, Ala, Val, and Leu), and Cα and Cβ chemical shift calculations. Further details are available in the supplemental material. Overall, our integrated assignment strategy led to a total of 1268 assignments for the NH, HN, Cα, Cβ, and C′ resonances (i.e. ∼97% coverage of the backbone resonances) of the wild-type RIα-(119–379) construct in the presence of a 2 mm excess cAMP. Only two residues were not assigned, the first being Asp-119, which is the N-terminal residue and is typically broadened because of its rapid exchange with the solvent, and the second residue is His-138, which is broadened due to ms-μs internal dynamics of the N3A 310 loop to which it belongs. The NMR assignment of RIα-(119–379)·cAMP2 provides the foundation to further investigate this construct in solution at residue and atomic resolution. The ensemble of locally and globally unfolded states accessible to the RIα-(119–379)·cAMP2 complex was probed at high resolution by NMR-monitored H/D exchange experiments, and the resulting residue-specific protection factors (PFs) are reported in Fig. 3a (black symbols). Based on the magnitude of the PF values shown in Fig. 3a, the residues of each CBD can be subdivided into three major classes. Class I consists of residues that are highly protected (PF > 6.5) and rely mainly on transient global unfolding H/D exchange pathways, i.e. the solvent protection of class I residues is not modulated by local unfolding. Class II encompasses residues with intermediate PF values (4.0 < PF ≤ 6.5). These sites are generally protected from the solvent, but unlike class I residues, they do not strictly require global unfolding to be exchanged with deuterium. Class III includes those amides that exchange rapidly (PF ≤ 4.0), i.e. they are either unprotected from the solvent in the ground state structure or are protected but promptly exposed to the solvent through transient local unfolding events. The partitioning across these three broad H/D exchange classes of the key structural and functional elements of RIα-(119–379) provides an initial basic framework to start comparing the two CBDs of the regulatory subunit of PKA Iα. For both CBD-A and CBD-B of the RIα-(119–379)·cAMP2 complex, class I residues are largely confined to the β-subdomain (Fig. 3a), with the main exception of several residues in the αP helices of both PBCs that are slowly exchanging and display class I protection factors as well. Unlike the PBC sites, almost all residues in the other key functional sites (e.g. the BBR, the N3A motif, and the hinge regions) belong to the intermediate or fast exchange classes (i.e. classes II or III) (Fig. 3a). Whereas this observation applies to both domains, the partitioning of specific loci to class II versus class III is highly domain-specific. For instance, a striking difference between the two domains is the degree of protection observed for the N3A motif and the BBR in each CBD. In domain A, the BBR has several class II residues, and the N3A motif is mostly composed of class III residues (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, a reversed H/D exchange pattern is observed for domain B, with its BBR being highly solvent-exposed (i.e. most BBR-B residues belong to class III) and its N3A motif exhibiting some degree of protection (i.e. several N3A-B residues fall in class II) (Fig. 3a). The variability in the N3A and BBR H/D exchange patterns, therefore, defines a marked difference between CBD-A and -B (Fig. 3a). Further differences between the two domains are revealed by investigating how the H/D protection factors depend on cAMP. Because of the instability of the aggregation-prone apo state of RIα-(119–379) (28Das R. Abu-Abed M. Melacini G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 8406-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we investigated the cAMP dependence of its H/D PF values through a previously described equilibrium perturbation approach (28Das R. Abu-Abed M. Melacini G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 8406-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This method effectively circumvents experimental challenges caused by aggregation and/or precipitation of the apo RIα-subunit by requiring only the creation of minor populations of apo state in dynamic"

https://openalex.org/W2136233327,"The metzincins are a clan of metallopeptidases consisting of families that share a series of structural elements. Among them is the Met-turn, a tight 1,4-turn found directly below the zinc-binding site, which is structurally and spatially conserved and invariantly shows a methionine at position 3 in all metzincins identified. The reason for this conservation has been a matter of debate since its discovery. We have studied this structural element in Methanosarcina acetivorans ulilysin, the structural prototype of the pappalysin family, by generating 10 mutants that replaced methionine with proteogenic amino acids. We compared recombinant overexpression yields, autolytic and tryptic activation, proteolytic activity, thermal stability, and three-dimensional structure with those of the wild type. All forms were soluble and could be purified, although with varying yields, and three variants underwent autolysis, could be activated by trypsin, and displayed significant proteolytic activity. All variants were analyzed for the thermal stability of their zymogens. None of the mutants analyzed proved more stable or active than the wild type. Both bulky and small side chains, as well as hydrophilic ones, showed diminished thermal stability. Two mutants, leucine and cysteine, crystallized and showed three-dimensional structures that were indistinguishable from the wild type. These studies reveal that the Met-turn acts as a plug that snugly inserts laterally into a core structure created by the protein segment engaged in zinc binding and thus contributes to its structural integrity, which is indispensable for function. Replacement of the methionine with residues that deviate in size, side-chain conformation, and chemical properties impairs the plug-core interaction and prejudices molecular stability and activity.

https://openalex.org/W2116428827,"The beneficial effects of estrogens on the cardiovascular system are associated with adverse effects on reproductive tissues. On the basis of previous work indicating a major role for estrogen receptor (ER)-α in maintaining cardiovascular health, we evaluated the tissue selectivity of the ERα-selective agonist propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) compared with 17ß-estradiol (E2) invivo. Four weeks postovariectomy, equimolar doses of PPT and E2 were administered to rats in subcutaneous implants for 5 d. Both treatments restored rapid vasorelaxation of aortic tissue to estrogenic agents and prevented coronary hyperresponsiveness to angiotensin II in isolated heart preparations. Accordingly, multiple endpoints of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury exacerbated by ovariectomy returned to baseline following treatment. These protective effects were linked to increased in vivo levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Human EPC function was enhanced in vitro after PPT treatment. In sharp contrast to E2, PPT treatment had no effect on uterine weight and histomorphology except for vessel density, and failed to up-regulate classic estrogen target genes. Dissection of the effects on vascular reactivity and uterine morphology was also observed following increased exposure to PPT at a higher dose for longer time. These data provide the first in vivo evidence for tissue-specific ERa activation. By conferring cardiovascular protection dissected from unwanted uterotrophic effects, ERa-selective agonists may represent a potential safer alternative to natural hormones.—Bolego, C, Rossoni, G., Fadini, G.

In Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans, CODH/ACS exists as a heterotetramer as well, but the same ACS protein also can be isolated in monomeric form separate from CODH (24Svetlitchnyi V. Dobbek H. Meyer-Klaucke W. Meins T. Thiele B. Römer P. Huber R. Meyer O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Other structural differences between the ACDS and CODH/ACS systems include the absence of an ϵ subunit in bacteria (25Graham D.E. Overbeek R. Olsen G.J. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3304-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), substantial lack of homology in N- and C-terminal regions of various subunits, and the presence of a unique domain that harbors two additional [Fe4S4] clusters in the archaeal CODH α subunit. A prominent difference between bacterial and archaeal ACS proteins is the existence of an ∼317-amino acid N-terminal region (∼45% of the bacterial ACS α subunit) not present in the ACDS β subunit. Enzymatic functional differences between the ACDS and CODH/ACS systems are also observed. For example, methyl group transfer to the corrinoid protein (Scheme 1) requires a separate methyltransferase enzyme in bacteria, but the activity is intrinsic to the γδ subcomponent in ACDS. Furthermore, the isotope exchange reaction (Reaction 2),[1-14C]acetyl-CoA+CO⇄acetyl-CoA+14COREACTION 2 which takes place as a consequence of C–S and C–C bond cleavage activity (26Ragsdale S.W. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3970-3977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), typically exceeds the rate of overall acetyl-CoA synthesis by as much as 3- and 17-fold in experiments with CODHMt/ACSMt and the monomeric ACSCh, respectively (24Svetlitchnyi V.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 929-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unpublished data 3D. A. Grahame, unpublished data. from our laboratory suggest that ACDS catalyzes CO exchange much more slowly than the overall synthesis and cleavage of acetyl-CoA (Reaction 1) or any of the individual partial reactions (Scheme 1). Observations made with buffer-soluble extracts of M. barkeri also indicate an exceedingly low rate of CO exchange (30Fischer R. Thauer R.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1990; 153: 156-162Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Crystallographic structures of the CODH/ACS heterotetramer show the presence of an extended intersubunit tunnel (14Doukov T.I.

A major portion of the tunnel runs through the 317-amino acid N-terminal domain of the ACS α subunit that interfaces with the CODH β subunit. In addition to the N-terminal domain, the α subunit possesses two other principal domains formed from the central and C-terminal regions of the protein (Scheme 2) (14Doukov T.I. Iverson T.M. Seravalli J. Ragsdale S.W. Drennan C.L. Science. 2002; 298: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 15Darnault C. Volbeda A. Kim E.J. Legrand P. Vernède X. Lindahl P.A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 24Svetlitchnyi V. Dobbek H. Meyer-Klaucke W. Meins T. Thiele B. Römer P. Huber R. Meyer O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Two different conformational forms of the ACS α subunit have been observed, designated open and closed, that differ in how the N-terminal domain is positioned relative to the central and C-terminal domains and in whether or not zinc was present instead of nickel at the position proximal to the [Fe4S4] cluster (Scheme 2) (15Darnault C. Volbeda A. Kim E.J. Legrand P. Vernède X. Lindahl P.A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the closed conformation, the tunnel passes through the α subunit N-terminal domain and opens at an axial position above the proximal metal in the A cluster. In this state, the A cluster is buried within the interface formed between the N-terminal domain and the central and C-terminal domains. However, in the open form, blockage of the tunnel occurs within the α subunit N-terminal domain at a point ∼20 Å away from the A cluster; the A cluster becomes readily accessible to solvent, and there is a substantial loss of interdomain contacts. Solvent exposure of the A cluster increases upon transition to the open form; however, specific access of CO to the axial position above Nip becomes shielded by movement of a nearby conserved phenylalanine residue side chain (Phe-512 in ACSMt that corresponds to Phe-195 in the ACDS β subunit). A gating mechanism has been postulated in which delivery of CO to the A cluster would occur only in the closed conformation (tunnel open). Upon transition to the open form, occlusion of the tunnel would prevent leakage of CO produced at the C cluster and allow for entrance of the larger substrates (corrinoid-Fe/S protein and CoA) to react to form acetyl-CoA (15Darnault C. Volbeda A. Kim E.J. Legrand P. Vernède X. Lindahl P.A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 35Volbeda A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 9: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the structural and catalytic differences between the CODH/ACS and ACDS systems. A comparison of the acetyl-CoA carbonyl exchange activities of the ACDS complex with CO and CO2 was carried out to examine the basis for tight coupling between acetyl C–C bond fragmentation at the A cluster and CO oxidation at cluster C. A previously unrecognized role of the N-terminal ACS domain in producing conformational effects linked to catalysis at the A cluster was revealed by characterization of three different A cluster proteins, the recombinant ACDS β subunit, recombinant full-length ACS, and N-terminally truncated ACS from C. hydrogenoformans (ACSCh and ACSChΔN) that were analyzed in parallel for their EPR spectroscopic properties, activities in acetyl transfer and CO exchange, and kinetics in overall acetyl-CoA synthesis, including differences in inhibitory effects of CO. An explanation is provided for the variation in coupling efficiency between bacterial and archaeal systems, and new insight is obtained into how subunit-subunit and interdomain interactions act to orchestrate catalysis at the A cluster. All chemicals purchased from commercial sources were of the highest purity grade offered. [acetyl-1-14C]Acetyl-coenzyme A was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Coenzyme A, disodium salt (>96%, HPLC, Fluka BioChemika), was from Sigma, and methyl viologen dichloride dihydrate, 98%, was from Aldrich. All anaerobic procedures were carried out under an atmosphere of nitrogen containing 1–3% H2 using a Coy-type anaerobic chamber with O2 levels in the range of 0.5–2 ppm monitored by a Teledyne model 3190 trace oxygen analyzer. Blue titanium(III) nitrilotriacetate (Ti3+ NTA) stock solution (∼170 mm) was prepared fresh by adding 1 volume of anaerobic 30% (w/w) titanium(III) chloride in 2 n HCl reagent (Acros) to 13.8 volumes of an anaerobic solution containing 0.275 m nitrilotriacetate disodium salt, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Further dilutions with water provided working solutions in the range of 2–20 mm Ti3+ for direct additions to enzyme reaction mixtures. Purple Ti3+ EDTA and brown Ti3+ citrate were prepared as described previously (9Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Methylcobinamide was prepared from methylcobalamin by the method developed in the laboratory of K. L. Brown (36Zou X. Evans D.R. Brown K.L. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 1634-1635Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), as described previously (16Gencic S. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5544-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The ACDS β subunit from Methanosarcina thermophila TM-1 was expressed in anaerobically grown Escherichia coli as a 397-amino acid protein lacking 75 amino acids at the C terminus, as described previously (11Gencic S. Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6101-6110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This form of the protein is referred to in this study as the ACDS β subunit and is similar to the native β subunit purified from the ACDS complex after partial proteolysis (8Grahame D.A. DeMoll E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8352-8358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA synthase from C. hydrogenoformans (DSM 6008) was expressed as a full-length protein, designated ACSCh (732 amino acids), and as a form lacking the 317-amino acid N-terminal domain, designated ACSChΔN (415 amino acids). Forward NdeI and reverse XhoI primers were used in PCR amplifications of the full-length and shortened versions of the C. hydrogenoformans acsB gene. The PCR fragments were digested, eluted from agarose gels, and cloned between the NdeI and XhoI sites of the pETDuet-1 vector (Novagen). Following sequence verifications, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli NM522 that had been lysogenized with the λDE3 phage. The conditions described previously for anaerobic growth of E. coli and induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (11Gencic S. Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6101-6110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were used for all three proteins. Anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) was employed for initial purification of the nontagged ACSCh and ACSChΔN proteins from supernatants obtained following French pressure cell lysis of resuspended cell pastes, as described previously for the recombinant ACDS β subunit (11Gencic S. Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6101-6110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thereafter, different approaches were used for the final purifications, with anaerobic conditions maintained throughout. ACSCh was subjected to further chromatography on a column of Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad), eluted with a 0.01–0.40 m linear gradient of sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The peak fractions were concentrated, diafiltered for buffer exchange, loaded onto a Mono Q HR 10/10 anion exchange column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with a gradient of 0.05 to 0.80 m KCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For the ACDS β subunit, phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) was applied, using a buffer containing 0.6 m Na2SO4, 10% glycerol, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, for binding to the column, with elution by a linear gradient of decreasing Na2SO4 concentration. Following phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, a final step of Mono Q HR 10/10 was employed. After the initial Q-Sepharose purification, ACSChΔN was subjected to a single step of chromatography on a HiLoad 16/10 phenyl-Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Perkins (37Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), with modifications as described previously (11Gencic S. Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6101-6110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The concentration of active sites was estimated on the basis of absorbance at 400 nm of the nickel-reconstituted proteins, using a molar absorptivity for the A cluster of 17,900 m−1 cm−1, determined by inductively coupled plasma-emission spectrometry analysis of iron contents of preparations of the ACDS β subunit found to contain 224 ± 10 μm iron per A400 nm. Nickel reconstitution reactions were performed by procedures similar to those described previously (11Gencic S. Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6101-6110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Gencic S. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5544-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in which apoprotein, around 20–25 μm, was incubated overnight in the presence of 150 μm NiCl2 in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.7. Enzymatic assays were carried out using samples directly removed from the incubation mixtures. For EPR analyses, larger volume nickel reconstitution mixtures were prepared and, after incubation, concentrated ∼10-fold and diafiltered using Centricon 30 ultrafiltration units placed under ∼1 atm N2 overpressure inside the anaerobic chamber. Assays for the net synthesis of acetyl-CoA from CoA, methylcobinamide, and CO were performed as described previously with minor modifications (16Gencic S. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5544-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out at 25 °C, pH 7.2, in sealed vials under an atmosphere of 50% CO and 50% N2 (to give 0.48 mm dissolved CO, using the α value for CO gas solubility at 25 °C listed in Ref. 38Dean J.A. Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. 14th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1992: 5.1-5.8Google Scholar). The enzymes were preincubated for 5 min in the presence of CO and the indicated concentrations of methylcobinamide, with 34 μm Ti3+ NTA added as reducing agent. The reactions were initiated by addition of 120 μm CoA, and reaction progress was followed by quantitative HPLC analysis of acetyl-CoA and CoA in aliquots removed over time, with initial rates obtained from fits of the data to the first-order rate equation (16Gencic S. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5544-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The ability of the different enzymes to catalyze acetyl group transfer from acetyl-CoA, by activation of the thioester bond, was measured by following the low redox potential-dependent formation of CoA and 3′-dephospho-S-acetyl-CoA from the substrates acetyl-CoA and 3′-dephospho-CoA, by the method used previously (11Gencic S. Grahame D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6101-6110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The reaction mixtures (360 μl) were set up at 25 °C and contained 100 μm acetyl-CoA, 100 μm 3′-dephospho-CoA, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 6.7, and 50 μm aquacobalamin prereduced with 136 μm Ti3+ NTA. All components except the CoA substrates and enzyme were assembled and incubated for 30 min to allow for reduction of B12. Thereafter, 3′-dephospho-CoA was added, followed by the enzyme, and the reaction was initiated by addition of acetyl-CoA. For each reaction, a series of aliquots (55 μl) was removed over time. Each aliquot was mixed with an equal volume of stop solution (2 mm TiCl3, 0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 4.0) and frozen. Subsequent HPLC analysis of CoA, acetyl-CoA, 3′-dephospho-CoA, and 3′-dephospho-S-acetyl-CoA in the samples and the calculation of initial rates were performed as described previously (9Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It was found that acetyltransferase activity was stimulated ∼1.7-fold in the presence of 0.1 m KCl relative to reactions containing either 0.1 m NaCl or no additional salt. Analyses of isotopic exchange of CO and CO2 with the carbonyl group of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA were based on the general method (26Ragsdale S.W. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3970-3977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which the loss of radiolabel from solution was followed over time during incubation of the enzymes in the presence of excess unlabeled CO or CO2. Reactions for CO exchange were conducted under an atmosphere of 100% CO, which provided dissolved CO concentrations in the range of ∼0.94 mm at 26 °C to 0.65 mm at 66 °C (using the α values for CO gas solubility listed in Ref. 38Dean J.A. Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. 14th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1992: 5.1-5.8Google Scholar). For exchange with CO2, the atmosphere was 100% H2, and dissolved CO2 (∼0.74 mm at pH 7.2) was supplied by addition of 10 mm sodium bicarbonate from a 0.50 m stock solution. All reactions with the ACDS complex (prepared from M. thermophila TM-1 as"

https://openalex.org/W2082171731,"The Mastermindlike (MAML) family, comprising human MAML1, MAML2, and MAML3, are transcriptional regulators in Notch signaling. MAML proteins contain two consensus sites for SUMOylation at Lysine217 and Lysine299 that are conserved in humans, mice, and Xenopus. In this report, we show that MAML1 is SUMOylated at both sites. The E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9 is essential for MAML1 SUMOylation, and the E3 ligase PIAS1 stimulates this activity. Mutation of the lysines abolishes SUMOylation of MAML1 and strongly increases MAML1-activated transcription in cell culture assays. The protease SENP1 reverses SUMOylation of MAML1 and potentiates the transcription factor activity of MAML1. Furthermore, SUMOylation enhances MAML1 interaction with HDAC7, which decreases MAML1 transcriptional activity. Taken together, our data indicate that SUMOylation of MAML1 is a mechanism for repressing MAML1 activity by influencing its interaction with HDAC7.—Lindberg, M. J., Popko-Scibor, A. E., Hansson, M.

Wild-type untagged Ste14p also co-immunoprecipitated and co-purified with N-terminal-tagged His10-myc3-Ste14p (His-Ste14p). Furthermore, enzymatically inactive His-Ste14p variants L81F and E213Q both exerted a dominant-negative effect on methyltransferase activity when co-expressed and co-purified with untagged wild-type Ste14p. Together, these data, although indirect, suggest that Ste14p forms and functions as a homodimer or perhaps a higher oligomeric species."

Science. 2010; 327: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar describe how progenitor cells in the Drosophila larval midgut create a temporary niche to maintain stem cell fate during development. Stem cells are generally thought to reside in niches, or specialized local microenvironments, which prevent differentiation (Fuller and Spradling, 2007Fuller M.T. Spradling A.C. Science. 2007; 316: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).

In a recent report in Science, the Ohlstein lab provides an interesting glimpse into this process in the Drosophila midgut by showing that stem cell precursors (known as adult midgut progenitors [AMPs]) specify their own transient “niche” (peripheral cells [PCs]) during morphogenesis (Mathur et al., 2010Mathur D. Bost A. Driver I. Ohlstein B. Science. 2010; 327: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The Drosophila adult midgut is an epithelial monolayer composed of absorptive enterocytes (ECs) interspersed with secretory enteroendocrine (ee) cells. Although this tissue had long been considered quiescent, groundbreaking work in 2006 revealed that it is constantly renewed by a pool of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). ISCs divide asymmetrically to produce both ISCs and daughters (enteroblasts [EBs]) that differentiate into ECs or ee cells in a Notch-dependent manner (Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006Micchelli C.A. Perrimon N. Nature. 2006; 439: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006Ohlstein B. Spradling A. Nature. 2006; 439: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). All of the epithelial cells in the adult midgut arise from embryonic adult midgut progenitors (AMPs) (Hartenstein and Jan, 1992Hartenstein V. Jan Y.N. Rouxs Arch. Dev. Biol. 1992; 201: 194-220Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Jiang and Edgar, 2009Jiang H. Edgar B.A. Development. 2009; 136: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, as with most stem cell based-tissues, the events accompanying the AMP to ISC transition were not understood. Given that Notch signaling specifies stem cell daughter fates in the adult midgut (Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006Ohlstein B. Spradling A. Nature. 2006; 439: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007Ohlstein B. Spradling A. Science. 2007; 315: 988-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), Mathur et al. analyzed the expression of the Notch pathway ligand Delta, which marks adult ISCs, and the Notch reporter Gbe+ Su(H)LacZ, which marks enteroblasts, in the larval midgut. In young larvae, AMPs proliferate and disperse throughout the midgut (Figure 1A) and are detected as single Delta-positive cells. However, Notch activity is undetectable at this stage. In slightly older larvae, AMPs typically stop dispersing and produce clusters called midgut imaginal islands (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, the authors found that the AMP division marking the initiation of cluster formation is asymmetric: the founder AMP divides to give rise to one daughter cell maintaining Delta expression (and AMP identity), whereas the other daughter cell extinguishes Delta and instead expresses the Notch reporter. These Notch reporter-positive cells exit the cell cycle and undergo morphological changes revealing their identity—peripheral cells. Although PCs were described long ago as cells extending processes that wrap around clusters of AMPs (El Shatoury and Waddington, 1957El Shatoury H.H. Waddington C.H. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1957; 5: 134-142Google Scholar), their function was not known. Mathur et al. find that ectopic activation of Notch signaling in AMPs directs them to become PC-like cells, and removing Notch signaling from AMPs during larval development prevents them from dividing asymmetrically to generate PCs. Without PCs, AMPs differentiate prematurely. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) against a BMP ligand in PCs, or loss-of-function clones of BMP pathway members in AMPs, results in premature differentiation of AMPs. Therefore, AMPs generate PCs, which signal via BMP signaling to ensure that AMPs remain undifferentiated until after metamorphosis. PCs may serve a structural role as well. AMP clusters normally express high levels of β-catenin, suggesting that cadherin-mediated homotypic interactions between AMPs facilitate the formation of AMP islands. EGFR signaling, which promotes AMP proliferation during larval development, may also upregulate cadherin levels in AMPs to trigger clustering and inhibit their dispersion (Jiang and Edgar, 2009Jiang H. Edgar B.A. Development. 2009; 136: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Without the formation of PCs, AMP islands tend to merge. Therefore, in addition to preventing AMP differentiation, PCs may also inhibit AMP islands from prematurely fusing before metamorphosis. Soon after the onset of metamorphosis, PCs undergo apoptosis (Figure 1B). As the PCs disintegrate, most AMPs begin expressing differentiation markers. Approximately one AMP per island, however, retains markers characteristically found in ISCs. This subset of AMPs is considered the presumptive adult ISCs. Lineage analysis is needed to support this hypothesis and may also reveal whether the AMPs that initiate island formation are preferentially specified to become ISCs. The PC niche behaves similarly to the well-characterized stem cell niches found in the Drosophila ovary and testis, which also require BMP signaling for stem cell maintenance (Fuller and Spradling, 2007Fuller M.T. Spradling A.C. Science. 2007; 316: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, the PC is very different from other described niches in many respects. For example, in the Drosophila ovary or testis, the stem cells divide asymmetrically to produce a self-renewing daughter attached to the niche, and a daughter that moves away from the niche and consequently differentiates (Fuller and Spradling, 2007Fuller M.T. Spradling A.C. Science. 2007; 316: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Similarly, the basally located ISCs orient their divisions perpendicularly with respect to the basement membrane so that the EB daughter will lie more apically to the ISC (Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007Ohlstein B. Spradling A. Science. 2007; 315: 988-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Conversely, the AMP divides asymmetrically to create its own niche. This niche in turn allows only symmetric AMP divisions thereafter, and maintains all daughter AMPs in an undifferentiated state. Furthermore, it is necessary for the PC niche to break down during metamorphosis in order for AMPs to differentiate and establish ISCs. This contrasts with the adult, in which it is imperative for the niche to be maintained for the lifetime of the organism in order to sustain tissue homeostasis. Several interesting questions arise from this work. It is still not clear how the asymmetric division of the founder AMP during larval development occurs. A founder AMP dividing asymmetrically to produce a PC is reminiscent of an adult ISC dividing asymmetrically to generate an EB daughter. Even though the outcomes are very different— the larval AMP creates its own niche, whereas the adult ISC produces a differentiating daughter—the mechanism of asymmetric cell-fate specification may be the same. The dramatic difference in Delta content between the founder AMP and the pre-PC may arise by asymmetric Delta segregation or (as occurs in the adult midgut ISCs and their pre-EBs) by rapid downregulation of Delta in the PC after mitosis. Furthermore, it remains to be seen what signal initiates the compulsory breakdown of the PC niche to allow AMP differentiation at the appropriate developmental time during metamorphosis. Steroid hormones are highly conserved regulators of development, and the insect steroid hormone ecdysone plays a pivotal role in embryogenesis, larval molting, and metamorphosis (Li and White, 2003Li T.R. White K.P. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 59-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because pulses of ecdysone during development elicit the major developmental transitions of the fly including gut remodeling, it is interesting to speculate whether these drastic changes in ecdysone signaling may be responsible for triggering these events. The findings of Mathur et al. reveal a new mechanism whereby stem cell progenitors take an active role in creating their own niche to establish stem cell fate. A deeper understanding of how niches are established during development will probably provide valuable insight into the origin of tissue-specific stem cells during organogenesis."

Cardiovascular disease accounts for more than a third of mortality in high-income countries, the commonest form being ischemic heart damage (myocardial infarction) resulting from obstructed coronary arteries. Cardiomyocyte death without equivalent regeneration also is typical of cardiomyopathies. Rescuing cardiac muscle cell number is thus opportune as one means to rescue the heart's performance as a biomechanical pump. A priori approaches include preventing apoptosis, stimulating survival pathways, activating endogenous progenitors within the heart (which, unassisted, are insufficient to restore the organ), and cell grafting. More than 20 clinical trials of cell therapy for heart repair have been reported worldwide, chiefly with bone marrow cells, whose benefits are better explained by blood vessel formation and secreted factors than by the transdifferentiation once envisioned (Segers and Lee, 2008Segers V.F. Lee R.T. Nature. 2008; 451: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). In contrast, the capacity to generate new cardiac muscle is unquestionable for embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and progenitor/stem cells from the heart itself. Nevertheless, problems remain: if cardiopoiesis is to be more than a rare unguided event, there exists a compelling need to pinpoint the signals and networks that drive the necessary cardiac lineage decisions or expansion of committed or differentiated cells. This task is made more complex by the varying and even dichotomous roles factors play at different developmental stages in vivo and in differentiating ESCs, such as Wnts and bone morphogenetic proteins that can alternatively induce or repress cardiopoieisis (Olson and Schneider, 2003Olson E.N. Schneider M.D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1937-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, Yuasa et al., 2005Yuasa S. Itabashi Y. Koshimizu U. Tanaka T. Sugimura K. Kinoshita M. Hattori F. Fukami S. Shimazaki T. Ogawa S. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Building upon the previously reported ability of Noggin, a bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor, to stimulate cardiac myogenesis in differentiating ESCs (Yuasa et al., 2005Yuasa S. Itabashi Y. Koshimizu U. Tanaka T. Sugimura K. Kinoshita M. Hattori F. Fukami S. Shimazaki T. Ogawa S. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), Shimoji and colleagues identified the G-CSF receptor, gcsfr3, as a Noggin-induced gene that is enriched in developing mouse myocardium and tested its utility as a potential target to stimulate cardiopoiesis (Shimoji et al., 2010Shimoji K. Yuasa S. Onizuka T. Hattori F. Tanaka T. Hara M. Ohno Y. Chen H. Egasgira T. Seki T. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Expression of the G-CSF receptor and its ligand was enriched in embryonic cardiac myocytes at E9.5, peaking at E10.5 and E12.5, respectively. Intrauterine administration of G-CSF on E9 increased cardiomyocyte proliferation. Strikingly, a single dose of G-CSF at E9 conferred a persistently enlarged trabecular layer and increased thickness of the compact layer in late gestation and neonatal hearts. This effect was abrogated in gcsfr3−/− mice, which displayed decreased proliferation of cardiomyocytes during development, a thin-walled hypoplastic heart, and 50% intrauterine mortality. The effect on cycling in culture was marked with cardiomyocytes isolated at E9.5, minimal in cardiomyocytes from E12.5 embryos, and unseen in those from neonates. Next, it was postulated that the G-CSF receptor could be exploited in ESC-derived cardiomyocytes. Indeed, G-CSF increased the incidence of beating mouse embryoid bodies 5-fold. The normal upregulation of cardiac markers was abrogated by neutralizing antibodies to G-CSF. G-CSF did not alter the downregulation of Brachyury/T, a key marker of primitive mesoderm, or the initial appearance of Nkx2.5, the cardiogenic homeodomain transcription factor. Rather, G-CSF specifically increased later levels of Nkx2.5, suggesting a mitogenic effect on committed progenitors rather than an inductive one, an inference substantiated by the incorporation of BrdU by cells expressing the cardiogenic transcription factor Mef2c. Remarkably, as the net result, most cells in G-CSF-treated cultures expressed the cardiac proteins examined. Lastly, the authors tested the impact of G-CSF on cardiomyogenesis in marmoset ESCs and human iPSCs. In both cases, G-CSF increased the percentage of beating embryoid bodies, upregulating cardiac transcription factors and markers of later cardiac differentiation (e.g., NKX2.5, TBX5, MYL2, MYH6, and NPPA in hiPSCs). In summary, the authors report a novel mitogenic role for G-CSF in cardiac lineage-committed cells, with potential importance for generating nascent cardiomyocytes efficiently from ESCs, iPSCs and, conceivably, heart-derived cardiac progenitor cells. Toward these ends—not only for therapeutic grafting but also other applications requiring human heart muscle, like toxicology screens, disease models, and drug discovery—it will be important to learn how G-CSF affects specific cardiomyocyte subpopulations (atrial, ventricular, conduction system) and to determine its impact on biophysical and pharmacological maturation. G-CSF signaling has been investigated chiefly in the hematopoietic system and much remains to be learned in its role as a cardiopoietin. Activation of G-CSFR triggers multiple pathways involving JAK/STAT, Ras/Mek/Erk, Src-related kinases, Akt, and SOCS3 (Panopoulos and Watowich, 2008Panopoulos A.D. Watowich S.S. Cytokine. 2008; 42: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the current study, G-CSF and JAK2/STAT3 drove proliferation of cardiomyocytes in embryoid bodies and embryonic hearts, whereas G-CSF and JAK/STAT promoted cardiomyocyte survival, not proliferation, in adult mice after infarction (Harada et al., 2005Harada M. Qin Y. Takano H. Minamino T. Zou Y. Toko H. Ohtsuka M. Matsuura K. Sano M. Nishi J. et al.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), differences presumably reflecting age or pathobiological context. Human trials of G-CSF for heart repair have already been undertaken, facilitated by its prior use in autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation. Two broadly different perspectives are recognizable, focused on cardiac myocytes, as above, or more typically on bone marrow-derived cells' mobilization and homing to injured hearts. Alone, G-CSF impairs homing of bone marrow cells to the heart, perhaps by inhibiting the migratory response to SDF-1; by contrast, G-CSF plus a CD26/dipeptidylpeptidase IV inhibitor that elevates SDF1 levels improved these cells' recruitment to the heart, augmenting vascularization, pump function, and survival (Zaruba et al., 2009Zaruba M.M.

Cardiac-resident progenitor cells are a third potential target, as indicated by the fact that G-CSF may enhance the number of cardiac Sca-1+ cells (Brunner et al., 2008Brunner S. Huber B.C. Fischer R. Groebner M. Hacker M. David R. Zaruba M.M. Vallaster M. Rischpler C. Wilke A. et al.Exp. Hematol. 2008; 36: 695-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar; cf.

Is G-CSFR functionally coupled in the endogenous cardiac progenitor/stem cells resident in adult human hearts? Are salutary effects of G-CSF on the adult heart mediated in part by these cells? Might G-CSF be used to drive cardiopoiesis by adult cardiac progenitor cells, in culture or in situ? Optimization of any potential cardiopoietin must take into account the effects on proliferation as well as lineage commitment. Proliferation can occur in embryonic cardiomyocytes (Olson and Schneider, 2003Olson E.N. Schneider M.D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1937-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and Shimoji et al., 2010Shimoji K. Yuasa S. Onizuka T. Hattori F. Tanaka T. Hara M. Ohno Y. Chen H. Egasgira T. Seki T. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar localized the proliferation evoked by G-CSF to Mef2+ cells, Nkx2.5+ cells, and α-actinin+ cells. However, susceptibility to G-CSF was largely lost by E12.5. It remains to be learned whether other hypoplastic cardiac phenotypes impinge on this axis, e.g., through precocious differentiation, whether cardiac progenitors from both heart fields require G-CSF, and whether the effect of G-CSF is entirely myocyte autonomous. The unexpected cardiac-lethal phenotype of gcsfr3−/− mice differs from the original report of this knockout line, which had no premature lethality and was said to develop normally (Liu et al., 1996Liu F. Wu H.Y. Wesselschmidt R. Kornaga T. Link D.C. Immunity. 1996; 5: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). This inconsistency might be explained by the differing genetic background (ultimately backbred to C57Bl/6), but leads to the more general consideration, how many other essential cardiopoietins have been overlooked in ostensibly conclusive models? How might heart-forming factors best be identified in the future? Complementary, higher-throughput approaches to detect novel cardiopoietins have begun to include robotic screens in stem cells and other systems (Sadek et al., 2008Sadek H. Hannack B. Choe E. Wang J. Latif S. Garry M.G. Garry D.J. Longgood J. Frantz D.E. Olson E.N. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 6063-6068Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Along with other “high-bandwidth” approaches like saturation mutagenesis, these experimental platforms hold the promise of defining workable triggers for cardiac muscle creation, beyond the insights obtainable in stem cells or model organisms manipulating just one factor or pathway at a time, on an artisanal scale.

One in eight hundred individuals in the Western world suffers from Parkinson's disease (PD), which predominantly results from dysfunction in dopaminergic, neuromelanin-containing cells of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Although dopaminergic cells are disproportionately affected in PD, the syndrome more generally results in dysregulation of the processing of information by the basal ganglia. In recent years, direct treatment of PD has been attempted with transplantations to restore dopamine levels. The first human trials with adrenal chromaffin cells, which produce and release substantial quantities of catecholamines, gave promising, but unfortunately not very reproducible, results (Drucker-Colin and Verdugo-Diaz, 2004Drucker-Colin R. Verdugo-Diaz L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 24: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Freed et al., 1981Freed W.J. Morihisa J.M. Spoor E. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Seiger A. Wyatt R.J. Nature. 1981; 292: 351-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Others have decided to strike the problem at its core by transplanting embryonic or partially differentiated SNc cells in different brain regions (Bjorklund and Stenevi, 1979Bjorklund A. Stenevi U. Brain Res. 1979; 177: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). For this approach to succeed, axons from the transplanted cells need to find their way to the striatum where dopamine exerts its action on both GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons and interneurons. To overcome this challenge, an alternative approach is to transplant the dopamine neuronal precursor cells directly into the striatum (Freeman et al., 1995Freeman T.B. Olanow C.W. Hauser R.A. Nauert G.M. Smith D.A. Borlongan C.V. Sanberg P.R. Holt D.A. Kordower J.H. Vingerhoets F.J. et al.Ann.

Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 238-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar undertook a variation on this approach in an attempt to restore some of the motor deficits observed in 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine) SNc-lesioned animals, a widely used model of PD. Instead of trying to restore dopamine levels by introducing new dopaminergic neurons, the authors transplanted GABAergic precursor cells into the striatum. Forebrain GABAergic cells have been shown to originate embryonically from the ganglionic eminences of the ventral telencephalon, which based on anatomical and gene expression criteria have been subdivided into three anlagen, the medial, lateral, and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE, LGE, and CGE, respectively) (Batista-Brito and Fishell, 2009Batista-Brito R. Fishell G. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2009; 87: 81-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Of these regions, the MGE is known to produce a large percentage of striatal GABAergic interneurons, which have the remarkable ability to migrate widely even after transplantation within the postnatal forebrain (Wichterle et al., 1999Wichterle H. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Herrera D.G. Alvarez-Buylla A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Therefore, although the idea of introducing inhibitory GABAergic neurons may seem counterintuitive, if one thinks of PD as a network dysfunction (DeLong and Wichmann, 2007DeLong M.R. Wichmann T. Arch. Neurol. 2007; 64: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), the new methodology is highly intriguing. In testing the inhibitory approach, Martínez-Cerdeño et al., 2010Martínez-Cerdeño V. Noctor S.C. Espinosa A. Ariza J. Parker P. Orasji S. Daadi M.M. Bankiewicz K. Alvarez-Buylla A. Kriegstein A. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 238-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar dissected out MGE-derived precursor cells from E14.5 rat brains and transplanted them into the striatum of the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Although 25% of the cells within these grafts differentiated into oligodendrocytes, the remainder became neurons. Remarkably, MGE grafts directed into the striatum produce no astrocytes, despite the observation by the authors that the same cells transplanted into the subthalamic nuclei gives rise solely to astrocytes. Moreover, although only 1% of the grafted cells survived in the striatum after 1 year, those present differentiated into morphologically and electrophysiologically mature interneurons of the three major subtypes found in the striatum, namely CR+, PV+, and SOM+ cells (Perlow et al., 1979Tepper J.M. Bolam J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), all of which have been shown to originate from the MGE at embryonic stages. Even more remarkably, even though the surviving transplanted interneurons accounted for only about 5% of the total endogenous GABAergic interneuron population, they were sufficient to provide functional recovery in the lesioned animals, as assessed by behavioral and motor activity. The authors show that the interneurons integrated into the host circuitry by receiving and forming de novo synapses and hence they hypothesize that it is the transplant-mediated reorganization of the basal ganglia network that directly results in the functional recovery observed. By contrast, when the same donor cells were transplanted into the subthalamic nuclei, they failed to disperse, produce neurons, or provide therapeutic improvement of PD-like symptoms. Why would MGE transplants into the striatum give such robust results? Do the interneurons or the oligodendrocytes generated provide trophic support for residual dopaminergic fibers or, as Martínez-Cerdeño et al. hypothesize, is the effect due to the direct electrical impact of the grafted interneurons on the network? Although one can speculate upon any number of convoluted circuit rearrangements to which the transplanted MGE cells might contribute, there are two simple mechanisms by which inhibition provided by grafted interneurons could lead to the observed behavioral changes. Information coming into the striatum from the cortex and the dopaminergic neurons of the SNc segregates into two parallel routes, generally referred to as the direct and indirect pathways (Figure 1A). Dopamine is excitatory on medium spiny neurons of the direct pathway but inhibitory on those contributing to the indirect pathway. Because of this distinction, as well as the differential involvement of other inhibitory and excitatory elements in the two pathways, activation of the direct pathway results in increased thalamic and hence motor activity, whereas activation of the indirect pathway decreases it. In PD, the direct pathway is less excited whereas the indirect one is less inhibited and as a result the output of the internal globus pallidus (GPi) onto the thalamus is increased overall (Figure 1B, top). This elevation in activity ultimately culminates in the rigidity and constraint in voluntary movement characteristically observed in PD patients. Because the transplanted MGE neurons alleviate the motor symptoms of PD animals, their net effect must be to decrease the inhibitory output of the GPi to the thalamus. This result could be accomplished either by preferentially inhibiting the indirect pathway (Figure 1B, middle), and thus increasing GPi inhibitory output, or by providing indiscriminate inhibition to both the direct and indirect pathways (Figure 1B, bottom). For the latter to be effective, one must imagine that the direct pathway in conditions of PD already has such a low level of excitability as to make it nonfunctional, making its further inhibition irrelevant. Although many questions remain unanswered, the results of Martínez-Cerdeño et al. suggest that there might be alternatives not only to the transplantation of dopaminergic precursors into the brain but also the general efforts for dopamine replenishment in PD patients. It is important to remember that animal models, and the behavioral tests used to assay them, do not always reproduce human symptoms and responses. However, if the approach outlined by Martínez-Cerdeño and colleagues proves to be effective, it offers a number of attractive advantages over the more traditional transplantation of SNc DA neurons. First of all, fewer cells are probably needed for transplantation (i.e., GABAergic interneurons versus SNc cells). Second, the cells transplanted are of a kind normally found in the striatum. Finally, the interneurons have been shown to have a remarkable ability to disperse, integrate, and persist within the striatum. Thus, it may be that a minimal impact on GABAergic activity in the striatum, 5% in the case of Martínez-Cerdeño et al., is sufficient to provide an effective therapy for PD.

During brain development, embryonic MGE cells migrate into the striatum and neocortex where they mature into GABAergic interneurons and play a key role in establishing the balance between excitation and inhibition. Unlike most other embryonic neurons, MGE cells retain the capacity for migration and integration when transplanted into the postnatal and adult brain. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"
