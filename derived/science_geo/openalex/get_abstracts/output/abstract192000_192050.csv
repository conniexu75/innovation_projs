These were sent to Trinidad as material for his breeding programme. In 1943 Posnette2 visited Trinidad from the Gold Coast and obtained pods from these trees, as he was interested in their possible resistance to cacao swollen shoot virus."

The data of 10 analyses agreed in 2 cases with published evidence that the marine-shell C14 content is 10% higher than modern wood; 5 cases agreed very closely with modern wood. In 1 case, the mollusk flesh showed the same specific activity as the shells. Possible methods of depositing calcium carbonate by mollusks are suggested to explain these differences. The stratigraphy is included of the moa deposit at Pyramid Valley in the South Island of New Zealand. Features include the use of radiocarbon dates to confirm interhemisphere correlation of late- Pleistocene climate sequences and the age of the moas. The tabulated ages of calcareous samples were calculated on the assumption that the shell and wood C14 contents are identical and that the modern shell contains 10% more C14 than modern wood. The age of the moa (670 yr) is presumed to be correctly given by the age of the organic fraction of its crop contents. The date suggests that Dinornis as well as Euryapteryx (large and small species) were contemporary with man and were exterminated by him.The peat-age confirmation (suggested to be sub- Boreal on pollen-sequence basis) is considered the most important stratigraphic result of the study."

https://openalex.org/W2006097491,"SELENIUM tetrafluoride was first described in 19071, but the compound does not seem to have been obtained pure until quite recently2. It is not a particularly easy substance to handle, since it rapidly attacks tap-grease and also reacts slowly with ‘Pyrex’ glass, forming crystalline selenium dioxide and gaseous silicon tetrafluoride with a trace of boron trifluoride. It is also hydrolysed instantaneously by water or moist air to the dioxide."

Correct identification of the substance is important in all discussions ofits use, including the recent one."
