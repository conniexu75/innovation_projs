https://openalex.org/W2088159749,"Several theories put forward to explain the biological mechanisms underlying the aging process are examined. The only ones which attack the problem from the point of view of basic biological mechanisms are the wear-and- tear theory and the somatic mutation theory. The finding that radiation accelerates the aging process is a potent tool for attacking the problem experimentally. Experiments with mice specifically designed to verify the wear- and-tear theory showed conclusively that stress per se does not contribute to aging, and no experimental evidence could be found to support the theory. On the other hand, a great deal of evidence now available indicates that mutations in somatic cells play a dominant role in aging. It is further shown that the organs having cells which frequently undergo cell division take part in the aging process very little, if at all. Organs having cells which seldom, if ever, divide have no opportunity to throw off either spontaneous or induced mutations, and it is these organs which are responsible for the aging of the animal. Spontaneous mutations build up at a rapid rate in these organs. A cell may continue to function normally long after it has suffered a deleterious mutation, and thismore » accounts for much of the delay in the expression of radiation damage. It is suggested that the mutation rates for somatic celis are very much higher than the rates for gametic cells, and that this circumstance insures the death of the individual and the survival of the species.

https://openalex.org/W2027547386,Electrical stimulation of nerves to isolated rat and rabbit adipose tissue in vitro causes production of free fatty acids. Starvation increases the response. The response of white (epididymal) fat is prevented by sympathetic denervation. Direct evidence is provided showing that adipose tissue has the capacity to be an effector organ responsive to the nervous system.

https://openalex.org/W1989868424,"Comparative rates of RNA synthesis in chromatin and nucleolar fractions during mitosis in root-tip cells of Allium and Nigella were studied by pulse-labeling of cells with tritiated cytidine. Although the rate of RNA synthesis decreases in the condensing chromosomes during prophase, it remains normal in the nucleolar fraction as long as nucleoli are maintained. RNA synthesis stops in mitotic cells lacking distinct nucleoli. In the late telophase or very early interphase cells, RNA synthesis resumes at a faster rate in the pronucleolar bodies than in the chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W2007313416,"Fragments of embryonic spinal cord (human, rat, and chick) can regenerate and differentiate in tissue culture. Complex bioelectric activity evoked by electric stimuli indicates that nerve cells in cultures may maintain, for months in vitro, not only the capacity to propagate impulses along their neurites but also a remarkable degree of functional organization resembling the activity of synaptic networks of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1975586323,"MRS. L. B., the mother of two children, had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis for which a lobectomy had been performed in 1950 when a blood transfusion was given. In November 1961 it was decided to perform a thoracoplasty, but difficulty was encountered by the hospital's laboratory in selecting blood for transfusion during the operation. All available donor bloods proved incompatible, and the Transfusion Centre was asked to help."

https://openalex.org/W2003508946,"Injections of 20 μg of adrenaline, dissolved in 10 μl of Tyrode solution, directly into the brain stem reticular formation, are followed by a transient increase in the amplitude of the cortical-evoked response obtained from single-shock stimulation of the optic chiasma, while injections of the same amount of acetylcholine produce a transient decrease. Furthermore, injections of procaine in the medial region of the rostral pontine reticular formation are followed by a long-lasting increase in the amplitude of these evoked responses, while the same injections at mesencephalic levels produce a marked decrease. These findings are interpreted in terms of the presence, in the reticular formation, of two antagonistic ascending systems: one adrenergic, the other cholinergic, whose tonic activity originates in the mesencephalic tegmentum in one case and in the caudal regions of the brain stem in the other."

By replacing the carboethoxy group by carbomethoxy, the 60-fold resistance to malathion is abolished. The results confirm the importance of carboxyesterase action in determining susceptibility to malathion."

https://openalex.org/W2017705977,"Adult mice [CBA/J (H-2k)], which received either a single sublethal dose of x-radiation (500 rad) or urethan plus 500 rad, were given intravenous injections of C3H/HeJ (H-2k) spleen or bone marrow cells (18 to 42 × 106 cells per mouse) or both, for 3 days. C3H/HeJ tail-skin homografts were retained (over 130 days) by these mice, whereas BALB/cJ (H-2d) homografts all were rejected within 33 days. Similarly irradiated or urethan-treated controls (or controls treated with a combination of both), which did not receive C3H cells, rejected both homografts. Specific homograft tolerance is induced in adult mice by this procedure."

https://openalex.org/W1970576370,"IT is often desirable to deliver pregnant sheep by Caesarean section under epidural or spinal anæsthesia so that the respiratory and cardiovascular functions of the new-born lamb will not be depressed by a general anæsthetic. A single injection of the local anæsthetics at present available is sometimes not enough to provide anæsthesia of sufficient duration for experimental purposes. A new local anæsthetic, 2(2,6 dichlorophenoxy) ethyl dimethylamine hydrobromide (SK and F 90,054)1 has proved to have a substantially longer duration of action."
https://openalex.org/W2010153917,"IN previous communications1–3 the existence of precorticotrophin—a precursor of corticotrophin—was demonstrated in the anterior pituitary tissue of the ox. Later, I4 reported the presence of a material behaving like precorticotrophin in normal rabbit blood serum. Young5 observed that the insulin-like activity of the serum or plasma from arterial blood, or from blood oxygenated in vitro, was higher than that of serum or plasma from comparable venous blood, or blood deoxygenated in vitro. In view of this, it appeared worth while to investigate the presence of precorticotrophin-like material in sera obtained individually from arterial and venous blood."
