https://openalex.org/W2039417241,"Red cells dispersed in a continuous medium of high viscosity possess the flow properties of fluid drops. The cells at rest are biconcave, while under shear they become progressively deformed into prolate ellipsoids, their long axis aligned parallel to the flow direction. The red cell membrane rotates around the hemoglobin like a tread of a tank. At high rates of shear this mechanism greatly reduces viscosity at all hematocrit values."

Whereas enzyme studies indicate that sialic acid is a determinant of the nephritogenic antigen, the physicochemical properties of this nephritogenic glycoprotein suggest that sialic acid may have an important role in the filtration mechanism."

An analysis of the crystallographic structure of the principal components of bone and its piezoelectric and pyroelectric behavior showed that bone is a texture that has the same elastic coeffcient matrix as a hexagonal single crystal. The five elastic stiffness coefficients of fresh phalanx are: C(1l), 1.97; C(12), 1.21; C(13), 1.26; C(33), 3.20; and C(44), 0.54 (all in units of 10(11) dynes per square centimeter). Value of axial and transverse Young's and shear moduli, compressibility, and the three Poisson's ratios were calculated."
https://openalex.org/W1561422105,"The activity of the enzyme system which converts hepatic glycogen synthetase to the active form disappears from the livers of fasted, adrenalectomized rats. The level of active synthetase in such preparations is nil. After the administration of glucocorticoid there is a return of activating enzyme activity and gradual increases in the level of active glycogen synthetase, the rate of glycogen synthesis, and the glycogen content of the liver. We propose that the changes in activating enzyme activity are the proximate cause of the changes in the level of active synthetase and the consequent alterations in hepatic glycogen content in response to the glucocorticoid state of the animal."

https://openalex.org/W2092640260,"THE absorption of calcium from the gastro-intestinal tract is one of the chief regulators of calcium metabolism and is known to be disturbed in a variety of clinical disorders. Despite its importance, however, no rapid, accurate procedure is available for its measurement, which normally requires the estimation of dietary and faecal calcium over a period of weeks. Several workers have therefore sought to establish an isotopic procedure which would enable calcium absorption to be calculated from the plasma radioactivity1,2 or residual faecal activity3,4 following an oral dose of radioactive calcium. It has been found, however, that although plasma radioactivity is inversely related to faecal recovery, it is not, by itself, a reliable measure of calcium absorption3,4. This is not surprising in view of the fact that the concentration of tracer at any given time after administration must be determined not only by the rate of its absorption into plasma, but also by the rate of its removal, and some workers have used double isotope techniques to overcome this difficulty5."

A low renin activity in plasma as well as a low rate of aldosterone secretion is demonstrated in these patients. Renin activity in the plasma is further decreased by treatment with L-dihy-droxyphenylalanine, thus partially accouinting for the hypotensive episodes seen with this form of therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2023742376,"Eight cats with implanted electrodes were trained to obtain food on presentation of one flicker frequency and to avoid shock on presentation of a second flicker frequency. A third flicker frequency, midway between the first and the second, was then presented. Differential generalization ensued, in which either the food response or the avoidance response was performed. Average evoked potentials from generalization trials with different outcomes were significantly different. The wave shape elicited by the stimulus for generalization closely resembled the usual response to the appropriate signal for the behavior which was displayed. This constitutes evidence for release of a neural process representing previous experience. The release of this process begins about 35 milliseconds after stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1504820765,"Abstract A study was carried out on the effect of a large number of B12 analogues on the coenzyme B12-dependent enzyme ethanolamine deaminase. The analogues tested included MeB12, EtB12, AB12, RB12, BB12, IB12, DB12, UB12, CNB12, and OHB12. DB12 was found to be capable of replacing the coenzyme. In contrast, all the rest of the analogues were inhibitors. With all the inhibitors except IB12, the inhibition was progressive, with the reaction velocity decaying exponentially with time to a final, constant value. The extent of inhibition by IB12 was independent of time; kinetics showed that this inhibition was competitive with respect to the coenzyme. Inhibition by MeB12 was also found to be competitive with DMBC, when its effect of the initial reaction rate was considered. Studies of the time-dependent increase in the extent of inhibition observed with MeB12 showed that the rate constant for this process (the deactivation constant) followed saturation kinetics with respect to the concentration of inhibitor. A similar dependence of the deactivation constant on the inhibitor concentration was observed with RB12. The time-dependent decrease in the reaction rate caused by this derivative was found to be irreversible. Kinetic studies performed at the end of the decay period showed that RB12 behaved as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the coenzyme, but that its Ki at the end of this period was much lower than the Ki estimated for the beginning of the reaction. Furthermore, the Vm for ethanolamine deaminase at the end of the decay period was only one-sixth of the Vm of the uninhibited enzyme. Light scattering studies and studies of the effect of enzyme concentration on the characteristics of the decay indicated that the inhibition is not associated with polymerization or depolymerization of the enzyme. Experiments with tritiated MeB12 showed that the progressive inhibition induced by this derivative is not accompanied by cleavage of the carbon-cobalt bond. Titration experiments with RB12 have shown that the progressive inhibition is fully expressed at an inhibitor to enzyme ratio of 2:1. These results can be explained by a model in which the presence of inhibitor induces a change in the enzyme from the form isolated in the purification to a form with a lower Vm and a much greater affinity for the inhibitor. The abbreviations used are: MeB12, methylcobalamin; EtB12, β-hydroxyethylcobalamin; AB12, β-(2-tetrahydropyryloxy)ethylcobalamin; RB12, 1-O-methyl-5-deoxyribosylcobalamin; BB12, δ-(9-adenyl)butylcobalamin; IB12, 5'-deoxyinosylcobalamin; DB12, 2',5'-dideoxyadenosylcobalamin; UB12, 5'-deoxyuridylcobalamin; CNB12, cyanocobalamin; OHB12, hydroxocobalamin; DMBC, 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin."

The same effects were obtained during cold block of A fiber conduction in the appropriate peripheral nerve. We conclude that adequate noxious activation of cutaneous C fibers depolarizes cutaneous A fibers."

Studies with inhibitors indicate that the synthesis of RNA and protein is required for enhanced zinc uptake. When protein synthesis is blocked in the presence of the steroid, an intermediate, presumably messenger RNA, which specifies enhanced zinc uptake accumulates and is expressed when the inhibition of protein synthesis is removed."

Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain the mechanism by which certain foods cause enzyme synthesis and/or release into the gut lumen: (a) certain foods might act as secretagogues, that is, chemicals which elicit enzyme synthesis in the gut cells with which they come in contact, or (b) food intake might trigger the release of hormones which in turn stimulate enzyme synthesis. We tested these two proposed mechanisms with the fleshfly Sarcophaga."

https://openalex.org/W1985741340,THERE have been many experiments in which the limited channel capacity of the human organism has been demonstrated by interference between two simultaneous tasks1. Brown2 used this interference of a secondary task as a measure of the difficulty of a primary perceptual or control task; and in a recent study3 he used a cognitive secoridary task. The experiment described here was devised to investigate the effect of a secondary verbal task on a primary cognitive one.

The observations are not inconsistent with other evidence indicating the association of plutonium with lysosomal components. Early results with a quantitative electron-microscopic technique may lead to microdosimetry of cells and cellular components.
