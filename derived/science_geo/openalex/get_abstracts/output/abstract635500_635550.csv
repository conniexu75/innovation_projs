https://openalex.org/W2955902629,"Pinpointing a single fast radio burst Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are flashes of radio emission from distant astronomical sources. Two FRBs are known to have repeated, but most last just a few milliseconds and are never seen again. Most telescopes that are sensitive to single FRBs have poor angular resolutions, so the FRB host galaxies remain unknown. Bannister et al. used a dedicated observing mode on a radio interferometer to detect and localize the nonrepeating FRB 180924, then followed up with optical telescope observations (see the Perspective by Petroff). They found that the FRB came from a medium-sized galaxy at a cosmological distance. Localizing FRBs will help determine their causes and allow them to be used as cosmological probes.

This composite contains a small amount of organic material that toughens brittle ceramics, such that a highly regular three-dimensional brick-and-mortar assembly of microscopic mineral tablets is bonded together with biopolymers. Synthetic nacres have not been able to capture the large-scale sliding of the bricks that is key to enhancing toughness. Yin et al. applied this model to toughening glass, where square or hexagonal borosilicate glass sheets were bonded together using ethylene-vinyl acetate interlayers (see the Perspective by Datsiou). This generated a structure that allows glass plates to slide past each other. The resulting five-layered glass composite was deformable and impact resistant, while maintaining high stiffness, flexural strength, surface hardness, and transparency.

https://openalex.org/W2953968681,"The Cdc48 adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) (p97 or valosin-containing protein in mammals) and its cofactor Ufd1/Npl4 extract polyubiquitinated proteins from membranes or macromolecular complexes for subsequent degradation by the proteasome. How Cdc48 processes its diverse and often well-folded substrates is unclear. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Cdc48 ATPase in complex with Ufd1/Npl4 and polyubiquitinated substrate. The structures show that the Cdc48 complex initiates substrate processing by unfolding a ubiquitin molecule. The unfolded ubiquitin molecule binds to Npl4 and projects its N-terminal segment through both hexameric ATPase rings. Pore loops of the second ring form a staircase that acts as a conveyer belt to move the polypeptide through the central pore. Inducing the unfolding of ubiquitin allows the Cdc48 ATPase complex to process a broad range of substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2954501369,"The cellular machine Cdc48 functions in multiple biological pathways by segregating its protein substrates from a variety of stable environments such as organelles or multi-subunit complexes. Despite extensive studies, the mechanism of Cdc48 has remained obscure, and its reported structures are inconsistent with models of substrate translocation proposed for other AAA+ ATPases (adenosine triphosphatases). Here, we report a 3.7-angstrom-resolution structure of Cdc48 in complex with an adaptor protein and a native substrate. Cdc48 engages substrate by adopting a helical configuration of substrate-binding residues that extends through the central pore of both of the ATPase rings. These findings indicate a unified hand-over-hand mechanism of protein translocation by Cdc48 and other AAA+ ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W2955723825,"Genetic regulation of gene expression is dynamic, as transcription can change during cell differentiation and across cell types. We mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) throughout differentiation to elucidate the dynamics of genetic effects on cell type-specific gene expression. We generated time-series RNA sequencing data, capturing 16 time points during the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, in 19 human cell lines. We identified hundreds of dynamic eQTLs that change over time, with enrichment in enhancers of relevant cell types. We also found nonlinear dynamic eQTLs, which affect only intermediate stages of differentiation and cannot be found by using data from mature tissues. These fleeting genetic associations with gene regulation may explain some of the components of complex traits and disease. We highlight one example of a nonlinear eQTL that is associated with body mass index."
https://openalex.org/W2989885190,"Adding energy to a system through transient stirring usually leads to more disorder. In contrast, point-like vortices in a bounded two-dimensional fluid are predicted to reorder above a certain energy, forming persistent vortex clusters. Here we realize experimentally these vortex clusters in a planar superfluid: a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensate confined to an elliptical geometry. We demonstrate that the clusters persist for long times, maintaining the superfluid system in a high energy state far from global equilibrium. Our experiments explore a regime of vortex matter at negative absolute temperatures, and have relevance to the dynamics of topological defects, two-dimensional turbulence, and systems such as helium films, nonlinear optical materials, fermion superfluids, and quark-gluon plasmas."

https://openalex.org/W2955745769,"Tuberculosis, caused by the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains the world's deadliest infectious disease. Sterilizing chemotherapy requires at least 6 months of multidrug therapy. Difficulty visualizing the subcellular localization of antibiotics in infected host cells means that it is unclear whether antibiotics penetrate all mycobacteria-containing compartments in the cell. Here, we combined correlated light, electron, and ion microscopy to image the distribution of bedaquiline in infected human macrophages at submicrometer resolution. Bedaquiline accumulated primarily in host cell lipid droplets, but heterogeneously in mycobacteria within a variety of intracellular compartments. Furthermore, lipid droplets did not sequester antibiotic but constituted a transferable reservoir that enhanced antibacterial efficacy. Thus, strong lipid binding facilitated drug trafficking by host organelles to an intracellular target during antimicrobial treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2954080332,"The current obesity epidemic is a major worldwide health concern. Despite the consensus that the brain regulates energy homeostasis, the neural adaptations governing obesity are unknown. Using a combination of high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and longitudinal in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we surveyed functional alterations of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA)-a highly conserved brain region that orchestrates feeding-in a mouse model of obesity. The transcriptional profile of LHA glutamatergic neurons was affected by obesity, exhibiting changes indicative of altered neuronal activity. Encoding properties of individual LHA glutamatergic neurons were then tracked throughout obesity, revealing greatly attenuated reward responses. These data demonstrate how diet disrupts the function of an endogenous feeding suppression system to promote overeating and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3102423910,"Clustering vortices Many-body systems generally become more disordered as more energy is pumped into them. A curious exception to this rule was predicted in the context of turbulent flow by the physical chemist Lars Onsager. He suggested that the entropy of certain two-dimensional (2D) systems can decrease with increasing energy, corresponding to an effective negative temperature. Using 2D Bose-Einstein condensates of atoms, Gauthier et al. and Johnstone et al. put Onsager's theory to the test. They provided energy to the system by perturbing the condensate, creating vortices and antivortices. With increasing energy, the system became more ordered as clusters containing either only vortices or only antivortices emerged. Science , this issue p. 1264 , p. 1267"

The presently dominant model suggests that color and orientation are separately extracted in the primate primary visual cortex. These characteristics are thought to be represented by neurons located in different cortical columns that project separately to higher visual areas for further processing. Working with macaques, Garg et al. recorded from thousands of neurons using two-photon calcium imaging with single-neuron resolution. Nearly half of sampled hue-selective neurons responded more strongly to equiluminant colored stimuli than to full-contrast achromatic stimuli. A majority of strongly color-preferring neurons were also orientation selective. Processing of orientation and color is thus combined at the earliest stages of visual processing, which challenges existing models. Science , this issue p. 1275"

https://openalex.org/W4241434933,"Positive reinforcement in a GPCR Many drug discovery efforts focus on G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), a class of receptors that regulate many physiological processes. An exemplar is the β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR), which is targeted by both blockers and agonists to treat cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Most GPCR drugs target the primary (orthosteric) ligand binding site, but binding at allosteric sites can modulate activation. Because such allosteric sites are less conserved, they could possibly be targeted more specifically. Liu et al. report the crystal structure of β 2 AR bound to both an orthosteric agonist and a positive allosteric modulator that increases receptor activity. The structure suggests why the modulator compound is selective for β 2 AR over the closely related β 1 AR. Furthermore, the structure reveals that the modulator acts by enhancing orthosteric agonist binding and stabilizing the active conformation of the receptor. Science , this issue p. 1283"
https://openalex.org/W2954309427,"Drugs targeting the orthosteric, primary binding site of G protein–coupled receptors are the most common therapeutics. Allosteric binding sites, elsewhere on the receptors, are less well-defined, and so less exploited clinically. We report the crystal structure of the prototypic β 2 -adrenergic receptor in complex with an orthosteric agonist and compound-6FA, a positive allosteric modulator of this receptor. It binds on the receptor’s inner surface in a pocket created by intracellular loop 2 and transmembrane segments 3 and 4, stabilizing the loop in an α-helical conformation required to engage the G protein. Structural comparison explains the selectivity of the compound for β 2 - over the β 1 -adrenergic receptor. Diversity in location, mechanism, and selectivity of allosteric ligands provides potential to expand the range of receptor drugs."

Activation of the secretin (Sct)/secretin receptor (SR) axis, expressed only by cholangiocytes, increases biliary proliferation, liver fibrosis, and bicarbonate secretion. We evaluated the effectiveness of SR antagonist treatment for early-stage PBC. Male and female dominant-negative TGF-β receptor II (dnTGF-βRII) (model of PBC) and wild-type mice at 12 wk of age were treated with saline or the SR antagonist, Sec 5-27, for 1 wk. dnTGF-βRII mice expressed features of early-stage PBC along with enhanced Sct/SR axis activation and Sct secretion. dnTGF-βRII mice had increased biliary proliferation or senescence, inflammation, and liver fibrosis. In dnTGF-βRII mice, there was increased microRNA-125b/TGF-β1/TGF-β receptor 1/VEGF-A signaling. Human early-stage PBC patients had an increase in hepatobiliary Sct and SR expression and serum Sct levels.

https://openalex.org/W2954225497,"Cannabis use has not been well characterized in athletes. Studies primarily examine problematic use or its categorization by anti-doping bodies as a banned substance. Patterns of use, reasons for use, and responses to cannabis consumption have not been studied in a community-based sample of adult athletes. The Athlete PEACE Survey examined cannabis use patterns and subjective effects to cannabis in a community-based cohort of adult athletes. We used mainly social media and email blasts to recruit and SurveyGizmo to collect data. 1,161 (91.1%) of the 1,274 athletes taking the survey completed it. Current cannabis use was evaluated by asking “In the past two weeks, have you used marijuana (including THC and/or CBD)?” and cannabis type used was assessed by asking “What do you primarily use THC, CBD, or both?”. Cannabis benefits and adverse effects (i.e. subjective effects) and patterns of use were reported. 302 athletes (26%) currently use cannabis of whom 301 had complete data for cluster analysis. Cluster analysis was used to determine cannabis user phenotypes and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to create subjective effects factors. Associations between cannabis user phenotype clusters and the subjective effects factors were explored using multivariate analysis. Cluster analysis identified three statistically distinct cannabis user phenotypes: (1) older athletes who primarily use medical CBD, (2) mixed age athletes who use cannabis mainly recreationally with both THC and CBD use, and (3) mixed age athletes who used cannabis the longest with primary THC and CBD use. EFA showed three subjective effects factors: (1) Well-being, (2) Calm, and (3) Adverse. Mean positive subjective were higher than mean adverse subjective effects (p<0.001). The cluster using THC and CBD showed the highest mean scores for all three subjective effects factors (p<0.001). Athletes who use a combination of THC and CBD exhibited the most benefit to well-being and calm with minimal adverse effects. Our methodology can be used to develop real-world evidence to inform future use of medical cannabis products."
https://openalex.org/W2955760301,"The aim of this work was to analyze the genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium in a collection of 168 durum wheat accessions (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) of different origins. Our collection was mainly composed of released and unreleased Argentinian germplasm, with additional genotypes from Italy, Chile, France, CIMMYT, Cyprus, USA and WANA region. To this end, the entire collection was characterized with 85 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers obtained by Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP), giving a heterozygosity (He) mean value of 0.183 and a coefficient of genetic differentiation (Gst) value of 0.139. A subset of 119 accessions was characterized with six Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) primer combinations. A total of 181 polymorphic markers (125 AFLP and 56 SNP) amplified across this subset revealed He measures of 0.352 and 0.182, respectively. Of these, 134 were selected to estimate the genome-wide linkage disequilibrium obtaining low significant values (r2 = 0.11) in the subset, indicating its suitability for future genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The structure analysis conducted in the entire collection with SNP detected two subpopulations. However, the structure analysis conducted with AFLP markers in the subset of 119 accessions proved to have greater degree of resolution and detect six subpopulations. The information provided by both marker types was complementary and showed a strong association between old Argentinian and Italian germplasm and a contribution of CIMMYT germplasm to modern Argentinian, Chilean and Cypriot accessions. The influence of Mediterranean germplasm, mainly from Italy, on part of the modern Argentinian cultivars or breeding lines was also clearly evidenced. Although our analysis yields conclusive results and useful information for association mapping studies, further analyses are needed to refine the number of subpopulations present in the germplasm collection analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2955811376,"Global temperatures are predicted to increase by 1.5–5.9°C during this century, and this change is likely to impact average rainfall, with predictions that water deficit will perhaps be the most severe threat to sustainable agriculture. In this respect, invasive weeds, which have traits better adapted to drought stress than crops, add to concerns regarding crop sustainability. Lactuca serriola, an aggressive agronomic weed is thought to be a successful weed because of its ability to maintain high water use efficiency under drought conditions. In this study, experiments were conducted to examine the influence of different soil moisture regimes (100%, 75%, 50% and 25% water holding capacity (WHC)) on growth, photosynthetic capacity, leaf biochemistry and reproduction of this species. Soil moisture significantly affected plant’s height, stem diameter, number of leaves and biomass. The highest plant height (115.14 cm ± 11.64), shoot diameter (9.4 mm ± 0.18), leaf area (1206.5 mm2 ± 73.29), plant fresh weight (83.1 ± 3.98) and dry weight (22.38 ± 1.24) were recorded at 75% soil moisture content. A fundamental adaptation to drought was observed as plants in the 25% WHC treatment had the highest root: shoot ratio. Soluble sugars and total phenolic content were highest in the 25% WHC treatment and significantly different to 100% WHC which was a response to soil moisture stress to ameliorate the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species produced under stress conditions. Results also indicate that L. serriola can survive and produce seeds under water stress as more than 6000 seeds were produced per plant in all WHC treatments. In this study, there was no significant difference in the seed weight, number of seeds produced and their germination ability. This can have a huge impact on agricultural systems as the species can survive both under low and high soil moisture conditions. We therefore suggest that the demonstrated ability of L. serriola to complete its life cycle and produce biomass and seeds under water stressed conditions leads to the introduction of strategies that minimize weed survival while maximizing irrigation efficiency for the crop. A clear understanding of the ecological and biological characteristics of this weed will help land managers take appropriate control measures to mitigate the effect of this species on economic crop productivity."

The study quantified cortical and hippocampal fatty acid and phospholipid profiles along with select eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)- and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) in 2-, 9-, and 18-mo-old APOE3 and APOE4 male and female mice. A 10% lower cortical DHA was evident in APOE4 females at 18 mo compared with 2 mo, with no significant decrease in APOE3 or APOE4 males. This decrease was associated with a reduction in DHA-phosphatidylethanolamine. Older APOE4 females had a 15% higher oleic acid content compared with young mice.

Despite these innovations, technological advances are needed to address unmet medical needs with new pharmacological mechanisms. Age-related eye diseases are among the most common causes of blindness and poor vision in the world. Many such diseases affect the back of the eye, where the inaccessibility of the site of action necessitates therapeutic delivery via intravitreal (IVT) injection. Treatments administered via this route typically have vitreal half-lives <10 days in humans, requiring frequent administration. Since IVT injection is burdensome to patients, there exists a strong need to develop therapeutics with prolonged residence time in the eye. We report here a strategy to increase retention of a therapeutic fragment antibody (Fab) in the eye, using an anti-complement factor D Fab previously optimized for ocular delivery. Polyethylene glycol structures, varying in length, geometry and degree of branching, were coupled to the Fab via maleimide-activated termini. A screening strategy was developed to allow for key determinants of ocular half-life to be measured in vitro. After compound selection, a scalable process was established to enable tolerability and pharmacokinetic studies in cynomolgus monkeys, demonstrating an increase in vitreal half-life with no associated adverse events. Further, we show that the technique for compound selection, analytical characterization, and scalable production is general for a range of antibody fragments. The application of the technology has broad impact in across many therapeutic areas with the first major advancement in the treatment of an important ocular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2955371678,"The objective of the study was to find out the prophylactic efficacy of Quercetin in ameliorating the hypoxia induced vascular leakage in lungs of rats. Male SD rats received different doses of quercetin @ 25mg, 50mg, 100mg and 200mg/Kg BW, 1h prior to hypobaric hypoxia exposure (7,620m, for 6h). Quercetin 50 mg/kg BW supplemented orally 1h prior to hypoxia exposure was considered to be the optimum dose, due to significant reduction (p<0.001) in lung water content and lung transvascular leakage compared to control (hypoxia, 6h). Further, biochemical analysis (ROS, MDA, GSH, GPx, LDH, and albumin) and differential expressions of proteins (IKK-α/β, NFĸB, Nrf-2,TNF-α, ICAM-1, VCAM, P-selectin, Hif-1α, VEGF, TNF-α, TGF-β, INF-γ and IL-4) were determined by western blotting and ELISA. Changes in lung parenchyma were assessed by histopathology. Quercetin (50 mg/kg BW) prophylaxis under hypoxia showed significant reduction in oxidative stress (ROS and MDA), concomitant increase in antioxidants (GSH, GPx and SOD) followed by decreased LDH and albumin extravasation in BAL fluid over hypoxia. Quercetin prophylaxis significantly down regulated hypoxia induced increase in IKKα/β and NFĸB expressions leading to reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and INF-γ) followed by up regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and INF-γ) in lungs. Further, hypoxia mediated increase in HIF-1α was stabilized and VEGF levels in lungs were significantly down regulated by quercetin supplementation, leading to reduction in vascular leakage in lungs of rats under hypoxia. However, Quercetin has also enacted as Nrf-2 activator which significantly boosted up the synthesis of GSH under hypoxic condition compared to hypoxia. Histopathological observations further confirmed that quercetin preconditioning has an inhibitory effect on progression of oxidative stress and inflammation via attenuation of NFκB and stabilization HIF-1α in lungs of rats under hypoxia.These studies indicated that quercetin prophylaxis abrogates the possibility of hypobaric hypoxia induced pulmonary edema in rats."

Coupled matrix-tensor factorization (CMTF) is an important tool for this purpose. Designing an accurate and efficient CMTF method has become more crucial as the size and dimension of real-world data are growing explosively. However, existing methods for CMTF suffer from lack of accuracy, slow running time, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose S3CMTF, a fast, accurate, and scalable CMTF method. In contrast to previous methods which do not handle large sparse tensors and are not parallelizable, S3CMTF provides parallel sparse CMTF by carefully deriving gradient update rules. S3CMTF asynchronously updates partial gradients without expensive locking. We show that our method is guaranteed to converge to a quality solution theoretically and empirically. S3CMTF further boosts the performance by carefully storing intermediate computation and reusing them. We theoretically and empirically show that S3CMTF is the fastest, outperforming existing methods. Experimental results show that S3CMTF is up to 930× faster than existing methods while providing the best accuracy. S3CMTF shows linear scalability on the number of data entries and the number of cores. In addition, we apply S3CMTF to Yelp rating tensor data coupled with 3 additional matrices to discover interesting patterns."

Relatively little is known about the effects of smoking cessation on these biomarkers. To investigate this, current cigarette smokers interested in quitting were recruited and invited to participate in a smoking cessation study where varenicline (Chantix) and brief supportive behavioral counseling were offered at each visit after baseline. Subjects returned to the clinic during the 12 week treatment phase for 9 visits post cessation on days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84. Urine samples were collected at each visit and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for PGE-M, 8-iso-PGF2α, and cotinine. Cotinine values demonstrated that 15 of 38 subjects quit smoking for the entire 84 day period. Significant decreases in mean levels of PGE-M and 8-iso-PGF2α per milligram creatinine were observed in these subjects, by 44% (p = 0.0014) and 27% (p<0.001), respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that cessation of smoking for 84 days results in modest but significant declines in urinary PGE-M and 8-iso-PGF2α indicating reductions in systemic inflammation and oxidative damage. Given that levels were only modestly decreased, these markers are not specific to tobacco-smoke exposure. The modest declines in these biomarkers should be considered when planning studies with ex-smokers. There is a “hangover” from smoking that lasts at least 3 months."
https://openalex.org/W2954858506,"The Symbiodinaceae are paradoxical in that they play a fundamental role in the success of scleractinian corals, but also in their dismissal when under stress. In the past decades, the discovery of the endosymbiont’s genetic and functional diversity has led people to hope that some coral species can survive bleaching events by associating with a stress-resistant symbiont that can become dominant when seawater temperatures increase. The variety of individual responses encouraged us to scrutinize each species individually to gauge its resilience to future changes. Here, we analyse the temporal variation in the Symbiodinaceae community associated with Leptoria phrygia, a common scleractinian coral from the Indo-Pacific. Coral colonies were sampled from two distant reef sites located in southern Taiwan that differ in temperature regimes, exemplifying a ‘variable site’ (VS) and a ‘steady site’ (SS). We investigated changes in the relative abundance of the dominant symbiont and its physiology every 3–4 months from 2016–2017. At VS, 11 of the 12 colonies were dominated by the stress-resistant Durusdinium spp. (>90% dominance) and only one colony exhibited co-dominance between Durusdinium spp. and Cladocopium spp. Every colony displayed high photochemical efficiency across all sampling periods, while showing temporal differences in symbiont density and chlorophyll a concentration. At SS, seven colonies out of 13 were dominated by Cladocopium spp., five presented co-dominance between Durusdinium spp./Cladocopium spp. and only one was dominated by Durusdinium spp. Colonies showed temporal differences in photochemical efficiency and chlorophyll a concentration during the study period. Our results suggest that VS colonies responded physiologically better to high temperature variability by associating with Durusdinium spp., while in SS there is still inter-colonial variability, a feature that might be advantageous for coping with different environmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W2956140411,"Histone Lys-specific demethylases (KDMs) play a key role in many biological processes through epigenetic mechanisms. However, the role of KDMs in inflammatory responses to oral bacterial infection is poorly understood. Here, we show a novel regulatory role of KDM3C in inflammatory responses to oral bacterial infection. KDM3C expression is transiently suppressed in human and mouse macrophages exposed to LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg LPS). Loss of KDM3C in both human and mouse macrophages led to notable induction of proinflammatory cytokines in response to Pg LPS stimulation. Also, KDM3C depletion led to strong induction of p65 phosphorylation and accelerated nuclear translocation in cells exposed to Pg LPS. Kdm3C knockout (KO) in mice led to increased alveolar bone destruction upon induction of experimental periodontitis or pulp exposure compared with those of the wild-type (WT) littermates. The Kdm3C KO mice also revealed an increased number of osteoclasts juxtaposed to the bony lesions. We also confirmed enhanced osteoclastogenesis by bone marrow–derived macrophages isolated from the Kdm3C KO compared with the WT controls. These findings suggest an anti-inflammatory function of KDM3C in regulating the inflammatory responses against oral bacterial infection through suppression of NF-κB signaling and osteoclastogenesis.—Lee, J.

Using the ADHD-200 consortium, we characterized the time course of latent state changes using Hidden Markov Modeling, and compared state changes between boys and girls with ADHD along with typically developing controls. Sex differences were found in latent state switching, with boys dwelling longer in a given state than girls, and concurrently having fewer overall state transitions. These sex differences were found in children with ADHD and in typically developing controls. Children with ADHD were also found to be more variable in terms of state transitions than controls. These findings add to the growing literature on neural sex differences and may be related to the sex difference in focal versus diffuse attention."
https://openalex.org/W2956142313,"Humanoid robots will become part of our everyday lives. They have biologically inspired features and psychologically complex properties. How will children interpret these ambiguous objects, discriminating between living and nonliving kinds? Do the biologically and psychologically inspired characteristics affect children’s understanding of the robots? How firm is the distinction that children make between living and nonliving objects? To address these questions, 120 children ranging three to five years initially viewed video clips that depicted humanoid robots interacting with a human experimenter on two different dimensions (mobility and, psychologically contingent behavior). The subjects then answered simple questions that probed their animacy judgments and property projections about the robot. The results showed that children’s animacy assessments about humanoid robots differed by age. When judging the robot’s life status, its mobility was important for four-year-olds and, the psychological contingency for five-year-olds. In terms of the robot’s reasoning abilities, the majority of four-year-old children clearly understood biological properties, regardless of the robots’ features. However, when reasoning about psychological properties, even five-year-olds occasionally relied on robots’ features such as their contingent behaviors. Moreover, the children attributed some but not all animate properties to the robots. Although rent findings show that children possess naïve theories, they do not seem to have a consistent and logical theory of “aliveness,” and they apparently develop the concept of a robot by acquiring knowledge about how this boundary object differs from living entities."
https://openalex.org/W2956060371,"In unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), both oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are related to cell death. The aim of this study has been to characterize profiles of enzyme antioxidant activities and mitochondrial functioning of the contralateral (CL) compared to UUO and Sham (false-operated) kidneys of Balb/c mice. Kidneys were resected 14 days after obstruction for immunohistochemical and cortical mitochondrial functioning assays. Antioxidant enzymes activities were investigated in mitochondria and cytosol. Oxygen consumption (QO2) and formation of O2 reactive species (ROS) were assessed with pyruvate plus malate or succinate as the respiratory substrates. QO2 decreased in CL and UUO in all states using substrates for complex II, whereas it was affected only in UUO when substrates for complex I were used. Progressive decrease in mitochondrial ROS formation-in the forward and reverse pathway at complex I-correlates well with the inhibition of QO2 and, therefore, with decreased electron transfer at the level of complexes upstream of cytochrome c oxidase. CL and UUO transmembrane potential responses to ADP were impaired with succinate. Intense Ca2+-induced swelling was elicited in CL and UUO mitochondria. Important and selective differences exist in CL antioxidant enzymes with respect to either Sham or UUO kidneys: CL kidneys had increased mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase and cytosolic catalase activities, indicative of compensatory responses in the face of an early altered ROS homeostasis (as detected by 4-hydroxynonenal), and of a significant tendency to apoptosis. In CL and UUO, upregulation of nuclear (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 transcription factor (Nrf2), as well as of cytoplasmic and nuclear Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in opposition to decreased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), suggest impairment of the Nrf2/Keap1/HO-1 system. It is concluded that chronic obstruction impairs mitochondrial function in CL and UUO, preferentially affecting complex II."
https://openalex.org/W2954619489,"Background Self-medication is the use of any drug or medication to treat an illness or ailment without the supervision of a licensed medical doctor/health care providers. Self-medication practice in Eastern Ethiopia is quite common. However, there is little information with regard to magnitude and associated factors. The objective of this study was to assess the magnitude of self-medication practice and associated factors among adult community members of Jigjiga town, Eastern Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross-sectional study was conducted from June 27- July 12, 2017. Multistage sampling method was used and the number of kebeles and Sub-kebeles were selected using simple random sampling technique. Finally, sampled households in the Sub-kebeles were selected using systematic random sampling. Data were collected using face to face interview with 547 adult (≥18 years) participants. It was entered and cleaned using EPI-Data version 3.02 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 23 for further analysis. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression models were carried out to identify factors associated with the self-medication. Result The magnitude of self-medication was found to be 37.5% (95% CI: (33.6%–41.7%). Educational status of secondary school [(AOR = 0.46; 95% CI: (0.22–0.98)], high income [(AOR = 3.00; 95% CI: (1.77–5.06)], advised by neighbors, friends or relatives to take drug for their complaint [(AOR = 2.59; 95% CI: (1.62–4.14)], used old prescription /past experience to bought drugs [(AOR = 12.19; 95% CI: (6.65–22.35)], follow advertisements of drugs by television [(AOR = 0.21; 95% CI: (0.05–0.85)], and perception about Hospital drugs (clinics, health centers and hospitals) do not work [(AOR = 2.36; 95% CI: (1.39–3.99)] were significantly associated with self-medication. Conclusion High income, advice by neighbors, friends or relatives to take drug for their complaint, old prescription/past experience use to bought drugs, and perception of hospital drugs do not work was positively associated with self-medication. Therefore, health education should be given to the community on the importance of hospital drugs (clinics, health centers and hospitals) to shift their perception."
https://openalex.org/W2955099376,"The human serotonin transporter hSERT facilitates the reuptake of its endogenous substrate serotonin from the synaptic cleft into presynaptic neurons after signaling. Reuptake regulates the availability of this neurotransmitter and therefore hSERT plays an important role in balancing human mood conditions. In 2016, the first 3D structures of this membrane transporter were reported in an inhibitor-bound, outward-open conformation. These structures revealed valuable information about interactions of hSERT with antidepressant drugs. Nevertheless, the question remains how serotonin facilitates the specific conformational changes that open and close pathways from the synapse and to the cytoplasm as required for transport. Here, we present a serotonin-bound homology model of hSERT in an outward-occluded state, a key intermediate in the physiological cycle, in which the interactions with the substrate are likely to be optimal. Our approach uses two template structures and includes careful refinement and comprehensive computational validation. According to microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations, this model exhibits interactions between the gating residues in the extracellular pathway, and these interactions differ from those in an outward-open conformation of hSERT bound to serotonin. Moreover, we predict several features of this state by monitoring the intracellular gating residues, the extent of hydration, and, most importantly, protein-ligand interactions in the central binding site. The results illustrate common and distinct characteristics of these two transporter states and provide a starting point for future investigations of the transport mechanism in hSERT."
https://openalex.org/W2955334674,"Multidrug Transporters (MDTs) are major contributors to the acquisition and maintenance of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), a growing public health threat of broad concern. Despite the large number of MDTs, the overwhelming majority of the studies performed thus far in Gram-negative bacteria emphasize the supremacy of the AcrAB-TolC complex. To unveil the potential role of other MDTs we studied the behavior of a null AcrB Escherichia coli strain when challenged with chloramphenicol, a bacteriostatic antibiotic. We found that such a strain developed an extremely high-level of resistance to chloramphenicol, cross resistance to quinolones and erythromycin and displayed high levels of expression of the single component MFS transporter MdfA and multiple TolC-dependent transporters. The results suggest that the high versatility of the whole ensemble of transporters, the bacterial Effluxome, is an essential part of a strategy of survival in everchanging, at times noxious, environments. The concept of a functional Effluxome presents an alternative to the existing paradigms in the field and provides novel targets for the search for inhibitors of transporters as adjuvants of existing antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W2955420281,"Novel strategies have been proposed for articular cartilage damage occurring during osteoarthritis (OA) and -among these- Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT), intra-articular injections of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) or Hyaluronic Acid (HA) revealed encouraging results. To investigate the possible mechanisms responsible for those clinical benefits, we established primary cultures of human chondrocytes derived from cartilage explants and measured the in vitro effects of ESW, PRP and HA therapies. After molecular/morphological cell characterization, we assessed those effects on the functional activities of the chondrocyte cell cultures, at the protein and molecular levels. ESWT significantly prevented the progressive dedifferentiation that spontaneously occurs during prolonged chondrocyte culture. We then attested the efficiency of all such treatments to stimulate the expression of markers of chondrogenic potential such as SOX9 and COL2A, to increase the Ki67 proliferation index as well as to antagonize the traditional marker of chondrosenescence p16INK4a (known as Cdkn2a). Furthermore, all our samples showed an ESW- and HA-mediated enhancement of migratory and anti-inflammatory activity onto the cytokine-rich environment characterizing OA. Taken together, those results suggest a regenerative effect of such therapies on primary human chondrocytes in vitro. Moreover, we also show for the first time that ESW treatment induces the surface expression of major hyaluronan cell receptor CD44 allowing the increase of COL2A/COL1A ratio upon HA administration. Therefore, this work suggests that ESW-induced CD44 overexpression enhances the in vitro cell susceptibility of human chondrocytes to HA, presumably favouring the repair of degenerated cartilage."

Vaccination against S. pneumoniae is implemented in many developed countries. The presently used vaccines are safe, well tolerated but relatively expensive and require modification due to the immunological changes of the epidemic strains. This paper describes the development of a new pneumococcal vaccine candidate for immunization on mucosal surfaces. For this purpose the antigens of chimeric protein PSPF, previously suggested for an injectable S. pneumoniae vaccine, were expressed on the surface of the live probiotic strain Enterococcus faecium L3. Experiments on laboratory mice vaccinated with live bacteria demonstrated the appearance of the specific IgA and IgG which provide protection against the lethal S. pneumoniae infection."
https://openalex.org/W2954826423,"Background The electrocardiographically quantified QRS duration measures ventricular depolarization and conduction. QRS prolongation has been associated with poor heart failure prognosis and cardiovascular mortality, including sudden death. While previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 32 QRS SNPs across 26 loci among European, African, and Asian-descent populations, the genetics of QRS among Hispanics/Latinos has not been previously explored. Methods We performed a GWAS of QRS duration among Hispanic/Latino ancestry populations (n = 15,124) from four studies using 1000 Genomes imputed genotype data (adjusted for age, sex, global ancestry, clinical and study-specific covariates). Study-specific results were combined using fixed-effects, inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. Results We identified six loci associated with QRS (P<5x10-8), including two novel loci: MYOCD, a nuclear protein expressed in the heart, and SYT1, an integral membrane protein. The top SNP in the MYOCD locus, intronic SNP rs16946539, was found in Hispanics/Latinos with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.04, but is monomorphic in European and African descent populations. The most significant QRS duration association was with intronic SNP rs3922344 (P = 1.19x10-24) in SCN5A/SCN10A. Three other previously identified loci, CDKN1A, VTI1A, and HAND1, also exceeded the GWAS significance threshold among Hispanics/Latinos. A total of 27 of 32 previously identified QRS duration SNPs were shown to generalize in Hispanics/Latinos. Conclusions Our QRS duration GWAS, the first in Hispanic/Latino populations, identified two new loci, underscoring the utility of extending large scale genomic studies to currently under-examined populations."
https://openalex.org/W2954232616,"The direct cytopathic effects of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) on subsequent liver damage are not fully understood in HBV-infected patients. However, associations between the prevalence of various HBV genotypes and the extent of liver damage have been reported from different parts of the world. The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of HBV genotypes in patients with chronic HBV infection in Bangladesh, a country of 160 million people, of which approximately 3–6 million are chronically infected HBV patients. In addition, whole and partial genome sequencing of HBV was performed to evaluate the relationship between HBV mutations and genotypes. We found that 42% of the patients with low HBV DNA and normal levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had HBV genotype D. In contrast, the HBV genotype C was dominant among patients with high HBV DNA levels (>2000 IU/ml) and elevated ALT and in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Whole and partial genome sequences of HBV revealed that most patients with LC and HCC had HBV genotype C with mutations at the T1762/A1764 positions. It seems that Bangladesh represents a borderline country, situated within East Asia, which mainly consists of individuals with HBV genotypes B and C, whereas in the western parts of Asia, HBV genotypes A and D are prevalent. Bangladesh is, therefore, an excellent model for the comparison of the pathophysiology of three major HBV genotypes in a single population. The findings of this study suggest a possible association between HBV viral factors and the extent of liver damage in chronic HBV-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2955644915,"Foraminiferal propagule banks occur in fine sediment fractions that contain small individuals of benthic foraminifera. These sediments include locally sourced juveniles and propagules, as well as allochthonous propagules that have dispersed from surrounding areas. Such propagules can remain viable even under unfavorable local conditions. When exposed to more favorable conditions, they may grow to adult stages. Accordingly, during environmental changes, propagule banks have the potential to function as species pools and allow quick assemblage reactions. The propagule method was designed to study responses of foraminiferal assemblages by exposing propagule banks to controlled conditions in the laboratory, an approach that is applicable to a variety of ecological questions. Therefore it is important to understand the nature and dynamics of propagule banks, including local and seasonal influences. To obtain insights into the composition of local propagule banks, we studied experimentally grown assemblages from two shallow-water lagoons on Corfu Island in western Greece, and compared the results with in situ assemblages. We sampled in spring and autumn of 2017 and experimental treatments included the use of different substrates in our experiments to account for potential effects on assemblage compositions. Results revealed that sediments from each lagoon contained a distinct propagule bank. We found abundant allochthonous taxa among specimens grown in all experimental treatments, indicating dispersal of propagules, and possibly also juveniles, from adjacent regions into both lagoons. The time of sampling had a significant effect on experimental assemblages, indicating that the composition of propagule banks can vary throughout the year. However, no significant differences were found in assemblages grown in different substrata, suggesting a stronger influence of water variables (e.g., temperature or salinity) on assemblage compositions. Moreover, the experimental set-ups favored small, fast-growing, sediment-dwelling species tolerant of relatively high organic content. Our findings highlight the potential of propagule banks as species pools and will help to refine and improve future applications of the method."
https://openalex.org/W2953854758,"Iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) cluster proteins have essential functions in many biological processes. [Fe-S] homeostasis is crucial for bacterial survival under a wide range of environmental conditions. IscR is a global transcriptional regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa; it has been shown to regulate genes involved in [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis, iron homeostasis, resistance to oxidants, and pathogenicity. Many aspects of the IscR transcriptional regulatory mechanism differ from those of other well-studied systems. This study demonstrates the mechanisms of IscR Type-1 binding to its target sites that mediate the repression of gene expression at the isc operon, nfuA, and tpx. The analysis of IscR binding to multiple binding sites in the promoter region of the isc operon reveals that IscR first binds to the high-affinity site B followed by binding to the low-affinity site A. The results of in vitro IscR binding assays and in vivo analysis of IscR-mediated repression of gene expression support the role of site B as the primary site, while site A has only a minor role in the efficiency of IscR repression of gene expression. Ligation of an [Fe-S] cluster to IscR is required for the binding of IscR to target sites and in vivo repression and stress-induced gene expression. Analysis of Type-1 sites in many bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, indicates that the first and the last three AT-rich bases were among the most highly conserved bases within all analyzed Type-1 sites. Herein, we first propose the putative sequence of P. aeruginosa IscR Type-1 binding motif as 5'AWWSSYRMNNWWWTNNNWSGGNYWW3'. This can benefit further studies in the identification of novel genes under the IscR regulon and the regulatory mechanism model of P. aeruginosa IscR as it contributes to the roles of an [Fe-S] cluster in several biologically important cellular activities."
https://openalex.org/W2955129287,"Background PfEMP1 is the major protein from parasitic origin involved in the pathophysiology of severe malaria, and PfEMP1 domain subtypes are associated with the infection outcome. In addition, PfEMP1 variability is endless and current publicly available protein repositories do not reflect the high diversity of the sequences of PfEMP1 proteins. The identification of PfEMP1 protein sequences expressed with samples remains challenging. The aim of our study is to identify the different PfEMP1 proteins variants expressed within patient samples, and therefore identify PfEMP1 proteins domains expressed by patients presenting uncomplicated malaria or severe malaria in malaria endemic setting in Cotonou, Benin. Methods We performed a multi-omic approach to decipher PfEMP1 expression at the patient’s level in different clinical settings. Using a combination of whole genome sequencing approach and RNA sequencing, we were able to identify new PfEMP1 sequences and created a new custom protein database. This database was used for protein identification in mass spectrometry analysis. Results The differential expression analysis of RNAsequencing data shows an increased expression of the var domains transcripts DBLα1.7, DBLα1.1, DBLα2 and DBLβ12 in samples from patients suffering from Cerebral Malaria compared to Uncomplicated Malaria. Our approach allowed us to attribute PfEMP1 sequences to each sample and identify new peptides associated to PfEMP1 proteins in mass spectrometry. Conclusion We highlighted the diversity of the PfEMP1 sequences from field sample compared to reference sequences repositories and confirmed the validity of our approach. These findings should contribute to further vaccine development strategies based on PfEMP1 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2953703974,"Motivation Disease progression originates from the concept that an individual disease may go through different changes as it evolves, and such changes can cause new diseases. It is important to find a progression between diseases since knowing the prior-posterior relationship beforehand can prevent further complications or evolutions to other diseases. Furthermore, the series of progressions can be represented in the form of a chain, which enables us to readily infer successive influences from one disease to another after many passages through other diseases. Methods In this paper, we propose a systematic approach for finding a disease progression chain from a source disease to a target one via exploring a disease network. The network is constructed based on various sets of biomedical data. To find the most influential progression chains, the k-shortest path search algorithm is employed. The most representative algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra, and Yen’s are incorporated into the proposed method. Results A disease network consisting of 3,302 diseases was constructed based on four sources of biomedical data: disease-protein relations, biological pathways, clinical history, and biomedical literature information. The last three sets of data contain prior-posterior information, and they endow directionality on the edges of the network. The results were interesting and informative: for example, when colitis and respiratory insufficiency were set as a source disease and a target one, respectively, five progression chains were found within several seconds (when k = 5). Each chain was provided with a progression score, which indicates the strength of plausibility relative to others. Similarly, the proposed method can be expanded to any pair of source-target diseases in the network. This can be utilized as a preliminary tool for inferring complications or progressions between diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2955318564,"Glioblastomas are the most common primary brain tumours. They are known for their highly aggressive growth and invasion, leading to short survival times. Treatments for glioblastomas commonly involve a combination of surgical intervention, chemotherapy, and external beam radiation therapy (XRT). Previous works have not only successfully modelled the natural growth of glioblastomas in vivo, but also show potential for the prediction of response to radiation prior to treatment. This suggests that the efficacy of XRT can be optimized before treatment in order to yield longer survival times. However, while current efforts focus on optimal scheduling of radiotherapy treatment, they do not include a similarly sophisticated spatial optimization. In an effort to improve XRT, we present a method for the spatial optimization of radiation profiles. We expand upon previous results in the general problem and examine the more physically reasonable cases of 1-step and 2-step radiation profiles during the first and second XRT fractions. The results show that by including spatial optimization in XRT, while retaining a constant prescribed total dose amount, we are able to increase the total cell kill from the clinically-applied uniform case."
https://openalex.org/W2954398492,"Background Prisoners in French Guiana, a French territory located in South America, have a HIV and hepatitis B prevalence of 4%. Body modifications such as penile implants, tattoos, and body piercings are common among detainees, increasing the risk of blood-borne virus transmission. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional randomised survey in which the primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of high risk ‘bloody practices’ (penile implants, tattoos, body piercings) in French Guiana’s only correctional facility. The secondary objective was to describe the risk factors for penile implants, the procedures and motivations for insertion, the reported complications, their risk factors and adverse impact on condom use. Results Of the 221 male inmates interviewed, 19% had tattoos or body piercings while incarcerated, and 68% had penile implants, of which, 85% had been inserted inside the correctional facility. Addictive behaviors such as cannabis use and alcohol addiction (positive AUDIT-C score), early age at first sexual intercourse, and the number of incarcerations correlated positively with having inserted one or more penile implants while incarcerated. In contrast, having reported previous psychiatric hospitalizations and having a high knowledge score for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were negatively correlated with the insertion of penile implants while incarcerated. Penile implants were inserted in poor hygienic conditions, usually using the sharp lid of a canned food container, with 18% of early complications, mostly haemorrhage and edema. Condom use was negatively impacted for 52% of men with penile implants. Conclusions Our results highlight the need for prevention interventions which should aim at increasing knowledge levels and at implementing comprehensive risk-reduction measures."
https://openalex.org/W2956032860,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a failure in the mechanisms of apoptosis that leads to an accumulation of mature B cells in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid organs. The molecular basis of CLL remains unknown. Certain cytogenetic and molecular markers determine a bad prognosis in CLL. Fanconi anemia complementation (FANC) proteins have been related to chromosomal instability and alterations in the mechanisms of p53 activation, control of cell cycle, and apoptosis. We investigated the role of certain FANC proteins in CLL. Our data identified a group of patients with CLL with high expression of FANCA in peripheral B-CLL cells and we established its relationship with the deletion of 11q23 and a worse prognosis. When we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this bad prognosis, we observed a reduction in the expression of 2 p53 target genes, p21 and ∆Np73, in CLL primary cells transfected with FANCA. Functional studies demonstrated an impairment of p53 by FANCA. Moreover, we obtained evidence of a cooperation between FANCA and the NEDD8-interacting protein NUB1L in the destabilization of p53. For the first time, FANCA is reported as a bad prognosis marker by a mechanism other than its role in the Fanconi anemia-breast cancer DNA repair pathway.-Bravo-Navas, S., Yáñez, L., Romón, Í., Pipaón, C. Elevated FANCA expression determines a worse prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and interferes with p53 function."
https://openalex.org/W2953974424,"A new method is introduced allowing seamless assembly of independent, functionally tested, blunt-end double strand nucleic acid parts (DNA fragments not supplied in vectors such as plasmids) into more complex biological devices (e.g. protein expression vectors) and higher order multi-device systems (e.g. biochemical pathways). Individual parts include bacterial selection markers and origins of replication, promoters useful in a variety of species, transcription terminators, shuttle sequences and a variety of ""N"" and ""C"" terminal solubility/affinity protein tags. Parts are not subjected to pre-assembly manipulation with nucleic acid modifying enzymes. Instead, they are simply mixed in appropriate pre-defined combinations and concentrations and then seamlessly linked into devices employing a specialized thermostable enzyme blend. Combinatorial assembly of parts is an inherent time-saving feature of the new method, in contrast to hierarchical binary assembly (""one part at a time"") methods. This feature substantially simplifies and speeds optimization of device and system development. The versatility and functionality of the new method was shown by combinatorial assembly of parts into vector devices, one of which optimally expressed protein from a model gene. Also, a four-enzyme biosynthetic pathway system was re-created by combinatorial construction from parts and devices. Concepts discussed in this paper provide synthetic biologists, chemists and bio-engineers with improved and expanded capability to create novel biological molecules and systems."

Using near-isogenic lines, several significant QTLs were confirmed; three co-localized QTL regions were responsible for determining several cytokinin metabolites. Using a knock-out plant, a functional role of zeatin N-glucosyltransferase gene (UGT76C2) underlying a large-effect QTL for levels of tZ-N-glucosides and tZRMP was evaluated in the metabolism of cytokinins. Pleotropic effects of this gene were found for cytokinin levels in both roots and leaves, but significant changes of morphological traits were observed only in roots.

https://openalex.org/W2954308238,"Prenatal nicotinic exposure (PNE) reportedly sensitizes bronchopulmonary C-fibers (PCFs) and prolongs PCF-mediated apnea in rat pups, contributing to the pathogenesis of sudden infant death syndrome. Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), induces apnea via acting on 5-HT receptor 3 (5-HT3R) in PCFs, and among the 5-HT3R subunits, 5-HT3B is responsible for shortening the decay time of 5-HT3R—mediated currents. We examined whether PNE would promote pulmonary 5-HT secretion and prolong the apnea mediated by 5-HT3Rs in PCFs via affecting the 5-HT3B subunit. To this end, the following variables were compared between the control and PNE rat pups: 1) the 5-HT content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, 2) the apneic response to the right atrial bolus injection of phenylbiguanide (a 5-HT3R agonist) before and after PCF inactivation, 3) 5-HT3R currents and the stimulus threshold of the action currents of vagal pulmonary C-neurons, and 4) the immunoreactivity (IR) and mRNA expression of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B in these neurons. Our results showed that PNE up-regulated the pulmonary 5-HT concentration and strengthened the PCF 5-HT3R-mediated apnea. PNE significantly facilitated neural excitability by shortening the decay time of 5-HT3R currents, lowering the stimulus threshold, and increasing 5-HT3B IR. In summary, PNE prolongs the apnea mediated by 5-HT3Rs in PCFs, likely by increasing 5-HT3B subunits to enhance the excitability of 5-HT3 channels.—Zhao, L., Gao, X., Zhuang, J., Wallen, M., Leng, S., Xu, F.

https://openalex.org/W2955518840,"One of the most important challenges in live video streaming in mobile vehicular networks is the optimal use of broadband and point-to-point packet delay. Recent studies show that the sheer use of frames flow compression methods (such as H.264 or HEVC) and the proper communication overlay, such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P), has no absolute influence on increasing the quality of received video in VANET networks. Therefore, the use of an appropriate data exchange method, such as network coding, seems to be of great importance. Compared to Random Network Coding (RNC), XoR Network Coding (XNC) method has the least computational load for the network which is an important factor in optimal use of limited energy of nodes in a wireless network. The basic problem in XNC is that when a node is supposed to combine several frames and transmit them through an encoded frame, how this combination could be made to enable other nodes of the network to be broadcasted through receiving this packet and how can the available packets in their buffers decode as well as extract the largest number of frames in order to experience a higher video quality. To fulfil this aim, an encoding intelligent method is required which is based on the buffers' status of neighbours. In the proposed method in this article, the best frame combination is reached through buffers status of neighbours and AHP methods or AHP-TOPSIS methods, and the encoded frames are broadcasted through XNC. Simulation results show that due to the reduction in number of transmitted packets in the network, parameters such as congestion and point-to-point delay are significantly reduced and vehicles experience a higher video quality compared with other similar methods."
https://openalex.org/W2955432392,"Murray Gell-Mann, one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century, died on 24 May in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He was 89. Endowed with a photographic memory, Gell-Mann was an intellectual powerhouse who coupled insatiable curiosity with a Humboldtian urge to explain everything on his horizon. He came close to doing just that in elementary particle physics, a field he led for more than a quarter of a century, a feat unequaled in modern times.

Gell-Mann was born in New York City on 15 September 1929. As a prodigy, he grew up out of sync with his peers, and was much affected by his father's remark that his birth, a month before the great stock market crash, came at an inconvenient time. At 15 years old, he began his freshman year at Yale University. Although he preferred archeology, linguistics, and biology, he heeded his father's suggestion and graduated with a B.S. in physics in 1948. He then joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's graduate school as physicist Victor Weisskopf's assistant and earned his Ph.D. in physics in just 3 years.

Gell-Mann spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and a short time as an instructor at the University of Chicago. In 1955, he became a professor at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he remained until his retirement from particle physics. Gell-Mann then embarked on a second career. Returning to his childhood interests in linguistics, ecology, and archeology, he cofounded the Santa Fe Institute, a research center devoted to studying correlations and deciphering principles behind apparently independent complex systems.

At the time Gell-Mann graduated, the structure of matter seemed understood: The periodic table described matter as combinations of atoms, consisting of heavy nuclei of electrically neutral neutrons and positively charged protons, surrounded by clouds of negative electrons. Nuclear forces treat neutrons and protons equally, resulting in the isospin symmetry. However, new particles were being discovered, first in cosmic rays, and then by particle accelerators of ever-increasing energy. All were unstable, but some decayed very fast, and others stayed around much longer.

Observing that “nature is most easily described by a sequence of approximations,” Gell-Mann found that when weak and electromagnetic interactions were “turned off,” simplicity emerges from chaos: A judicious isospin assignment to the new particles is enough to forbid some rapid decays mediated by the (strong) nuclear force. Gell-Mann then identified a universal connection between the electric charges and the isospin values of the new particles, by introducing a new attribute he coined “strangeness.” In 1961, Gell-Mann showed that all strongly interacting particles fit into representations of the Lie group SU(3). The proton and neutron, together with six of the new particles, form an octet representation.

With style and panache, Gell-Mann named his scheme “The Eightfold Way,” in reference to the Buddha's teachings. Of the other unstable particles, some assemble in an octet, and the rest seem to fit in a decuplet: Consistency with the Eightfold Way requires a tenth particle. An experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory soon discovered the tenth particle at the exact mass that Gell-Mann had predicted. For these contributions, Gell-Mann was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Gell-Mann then further categorized the particles, inspired by the mathematics of group theory: The octet and decuplet are compound representations, built out of products of triplet and antitriplet representations of the group SU(3). He identified the triplet representation as one state (u) with fractional charge two-thirds and two states (d,s) with charge minus one-third.

He called them quarks. A proton and neutron were each a bound state of three quarks. He noted that the currents made out of quarks had the same algebraic properties as the V-A currents, in which weak interactions appear as the product of the difference of vectors and axial vectors currents, written in terms of the observed particles. Quarks acquired reality with extra attributes that Gell-Mann called color, and he named the theory that glues them together “quantum chromodynamics.” Several of the conceptual advances were not Gell-Mann's alone (George Zweig posited the same constituents, which he called “aces”), but no one contributed more to our modern view of the fundamental interactions.

The scope of Gell-Mann's contributions did not stop there. With his colleague Richard Feynman, he wrote the seminal V-A theory. With Francis Low, he invented the renormalization group that expresses the scale dependence of couplings in quantum field theory. With Maurice Levy, he introduced the nonlinear sigma model for the effective description of strong interactions. With Abraham Pais, in a paper he called “the hardest I ever wrote,” he analyzed the neutral kaon duo as an entangled quantum mechanical system. All of these papers found relevance in later years, in particular by inspiring Bruno Pontecorvo to introduce quantum oscillations in neutrino physics.

Murray was a great partner in one-on-one conversations, although in groups some found him overbearing. He and I often worked together. As I scribbled furiously on the blackboard, I would occasionally stop, suddenly aware of a mistake. “Oh good,” Murray would say from his desk, “for a moment I thought you were faster than me!” We often worked at the Aspen Center for Physics, which Murray's intellectual charisma had established as a premier place to do physics. Murray's perfect recall was amazing. When shown a picture of the Lascaux Paleolithic cave, which he had visited 51 years earlier, Murray immediately declared “It is not Lascaux! There is only one human drawing at Lascaux, and that is not the one.” Of course, he was right.

Murray's greatest legacy was to show the central role of symmetry in the universe of the very small, hinting of simplicity at its origin. Later in life, he applied his belief that the natural world is determined by organizational principles to linguistics and ecology at the Santa Fe Institute. At my last visit to Murray, I mentioned his enormous footprints in establishing the standard model of particle physics and fostering new symmetry-based approaches to fundamental physics. He replied, with a twinkle in his eyes, “Bigfoot.”

https://openalex.org/W2953772652,"I was meeting my new colleagues at a wine and cheese reception. Some of us early-career academics—all members of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups—started to talk about salaries. I shared how, after years of feeling undervalued, I had doubled my salary in my new job as assistant professor compared with what I was earning as a lecturer a year prior. Jaws dropped. There were lots of questions. We all agreed that we were ill-prepared to negotiate. No classes had taught us that skill, and people didn't really talk about it. This is probably a challenge for many, but it particularly affects underrepresented minorities who may be first-generation college students and are less likely to have academic mentors with similar experiences. We often find ourselves navigating academia blindly.

> “I thought I deserved more, but … I had no idea how to negotiate.” 

I didn't enter public health research to make millions of dollars, but I hoped not to struggle. I grew up in a single-parent household, with my amazing mother working multiple jobs to make ends meet. I thought academia was my ticket to financial stability.

But when I started my postdoc, I was surprised at how low the salary was after so many years of education. Then it came time to apply for faculty jobs. I got an offer—for less than I had earned as a postdoc. I thought I deserved more, but my internal impostor syndrome voice told me I was lucky to be offered any job in academia. I had no idea how to negotiate. I didn't know that negotiation was even possible. When I voiced concern about the salary, I received a handshake and a verbal promise that it would increase in a year. I trusted this promise and signed on the dotted line.

I jumped into gear, creating teaching materials for eight courses, taking on administrative roles, starting a new campus global health center, conducting research, supervising staff, and mentoring students. My energy was boundless, but not my time. I began to understand the invisible labor of mentoring students from underrepresented groups who came to me for support—requests that would probably be even more frequent if I were a woman or sexual or gender minority. I was also asked to join several committees that wanted to diversify their makeup. I believed all my efforts would be rewarded in line with the original handshake agreement, and I waited.

After 2 years, I finally got the nerve to ask for a raise. I went in prepared with documentation of strong teaching, administrative work, research grants, staff supervised, students mentored, and other faculty members' salaries—which I had recently learned were available online because I worked at a public university. But my efforts were for naught. I was told that if I wanted a higher salary, I needed to go out and get an offer from another school. I felt betrayed. I thought I brought enough value to warrant an increase. Did they not care if I left? And what about that handshake?

Once I was on the job market, I realized my true value. I learned from mentors that I could negotiate for much more than salary, including startup funds, moving expenses, parking, laboratory space, graduate research assistants, administrative support, teaching load, and more. I took my best offer back to my institution and they matched it. However, other problems persisted. Six months later I accepted an offer—which I had negotiated well, resulting in that doubling of my salary from a year prior—for a tenure-track job at my current institution.

I now frequently lecture about academic negotiation—and share my mistakes. I try to emphasize a few key points. Salary is negotiable, and it's not the only part of an academic contract that you can negotiate. Verbal agreements are easily forgotten; if something is not in writing, it doesn't exist. Offer letters set your market worth in academia. And committing time and energy to service such as committee work and indispensable mentoring—even if substantially above and beyond the norm—doesn't usually pay off in terms of salary. To help one another grow and prosper, we need to talk about these things and share our stories.
