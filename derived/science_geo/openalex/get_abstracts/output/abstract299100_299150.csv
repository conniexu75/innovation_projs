https://openalex.org/W2004714782,"Cutin, a biopolyester composed of hydroxy and epoxy fatty acids, is the barrier between the aerial parts of higher plants and their environment. Suberin a polymer containing aromatics and polyesters, functions as a barrier in underground parts, wound surfaces, and a variety of internal organs. The composition and probable structure of these polymers are discussed. The biosynthesis of the hydroxy, epoxy, and dicarboxylic acids of the polyesters from the common cellular fatty acids is elucidated. An extracellular enzyme transfers the hydroxy and epoxyacyl moieties from their coenzyme A derivatives to the growing polyester. The enzymes acting in the biodegradation of the polyesters have been isolated from fungi, pollen, and mammals and characterized. The function and possible practical implications of these polyester barriers are briefly discussed."

Gemini surfactants, with two quaternary ammonium head groups separated by a methylene chain of variable length and with each head group attached to a hydrophobic tail, can be used to control organic charge sitting relative to the bivariable hydrophobic tail configurations. This approach has led to the synthesis of a mesophase (SBA-2) that has three-dimensional hexagonal (P6(3)/mmc) symmetry, regular supercages that can be dimensionally tailored, and a large inner surface area. This mesostructure analog of a zeolite cage structure does not appear to have a lyotropic surfactant or lipid liquid crystal mesophase counterpart. Through the modification of gemini charge separation and each of the two organic tails, these syntheses can be used to optimize templating effects, including the synthesis of MCM-48 at room temperature."

Cosmogenic beryllium-10 measurements in the Wind River Range indicate that the last glacial maximum (marine oxygen isotope stage 2) was achieved there by 21,700 +/- 700 beryllium-10 years and lasted 5900 years. Ages of a sequence of recessional moraines and striated bedrock surfaces show that the initial deglaciation was rapid and that the entire glacial system retreated 33 kilometers to the cirque basin by 12,100 +/- 500 beryllium-10 years."
https://openalex.org/W2012547949,"Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry shows that the magnitude 6.1 Eureka Valley earthquake of 17 May 1993 produced an elongated subsidence basin oriented north-northwest, parallel to the trend defined by the aftershock distribution, whereas the source mechanism of the earthquake implies a north-northeast-striking normal fault. The Â±3-millimeter accuracy of the radar-observed displacement map over short spatial scales allowed identification of the main surface rupture associated with the event. These observations suggest that the rupture began at depth and propagated diagonally upward and southward on a west-dipping, north-northeast fault plane, reactivating the largest escarpment in the Saline Range."
https://openalex.org/W1967570608,"The sun-weather problem is placed within an electrical framework subject to experimental investigation. An explanation is suggested for how solar variability modulates the earth's electric field. The solar wind velocity is inversely correlated with the electrical potential of the ionosphere, a measure of the overall intensity of the earth's fair-weather atmospheric electric field. In seeking a physical cause of this relationship, galactic cosmic radiation was studied and it was also found to be inversely correlated with solar wind velocity. Thus, the earth's electric field intensity which is maintained by worldwide thunderstorm currents-a meteorological phenomenon-varies in phase with cosmic radiation. Since cosmic radiation is the primary source of atmospheric ionization, these findings support a proposed mechanism in which solar control of ionizing radiation modulates atmospheric electrification and thus possibly cloud physical processes. If the latter occurred, atmospheric energetics would be affected. Sun-weather research need no longer only consist of statistical correlations; an experimental approach is described. Establishment of a proposed geoelectric index would add a new dimension to solar-terrestrial studies."

Global availability of raw materials is relevant to policy decisions regarding mineral development and land use. Justification for environmental protection may exceed that for mining a specific ore body. Demand for environmental accountability is rising worldwide, and new technologies are enabling internalization of costs. Mineral-rich developing nations plagued by inefficient state-owned mining enterprises, high population growth rates, and environmental degradation could realize substantial benefit by reforming government policies to encourage foreign investment in resources and by appropriate allocation of mineral rents."
https://openalex.org/W2029630460,"The arthropod Fuxianhuia from the Chengjiang fauna displays primitive aspects of cephalic segmentation and trunk limb morphology that indicate a basal position within Euarthropoda. The cephalon consists of an eye-bearing sclerite that articulates with a head shield bearing antennules and subchelate appendages. Eye stalks, antennules, and subchelate appendages are proto-, deuto-, and tritocerebral limbs and organs, respectovely. The anterior position of the eye-bearing sclerite parallels the embryonic origin of arthropod eye lobes. The head of Fuxianhuia includes the acron and one somite and is regarded as a protocephalon. The definitive head of arthropods may have fused separate eye-bearing and appendage-bearing sclerites."

The new account is the first within the national income accounts to be organized along geographic, rather than productive, sectors. If properly updated and disseminated, this new account will give government and business interests a solid and consistent data base to measure, and choose among, the alternative uses of the oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2007366482,"Fermi resonance was observed between the OH stretch and the overtone of the OH bending modes of HDO molecules contaminated in phase VII of D(2)O ice over the pressure range from 17 to 30 gigapascals. An anharmonic coupling constant, which is related to the potential energy surface on which hydrogen-bonded protons oscillate, was found to range around 50 wave numbers through the resonant pressure range. Its experimentally obtained magnitude and pressure-insensitive behavior will be useful for theoretical studies of the potential energy surface and hence of the nature of hydrogen bonding in ice."

https://openalex.org/W2069686088,"Because of instrumental sensitivity limits and stellar distances, the types of x-ray flares observable on stars have been intrinsically much more energetic than those on the sun. Such enormous events are a useful extrapolation of the solar phenomenon if the underlying assumption is correct that they form a continuous sequence involving similar physical processes as on the sun. The Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA), with its greater sensitivity and high-energy response, is now able to test this hypothesis. Direct comparison with solar flares measured by the x-ray-monitoring Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) is possible. The detection of flares on Proxima Centauri that correspond to GOES M-class events on the sun are reported."
