https://openalex.org/W2063893203,"Glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a recently cloned new member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, promotes survival of cultured fetal mesencephalic dopamine neurons and is expressed in the developing striatum. There have, however, been no reports about effects of GDNF in situ. We have used the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which produces parkinsonian symptoms in man, to determine whether GDNF might exert protective or regenerative effects in vivo in the adult nigrostriatal dopamine system in C57/B1 mice. GDNF injected over the substantia nigra or in striatum before MPTP potently protects the dopamine system, as shown by numbers of mesencephalic dopamine nerve cell bodies, dopamine nerve terminal densities and dopamine levels. When GDNF is given after MPTP, dopamine levels and fibre densities are significantly restored. In both cases, motor behaviour is increased above normal levels. We conclude that intracerebral GDNF administration exerts both protective and reparative effects on the nigrostriatal dopamine system, which may have implications for the development of new treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2065692248,"Genetic studies demonstrate that two Arabidopsis genes, CAULIFLOWER and APETALA1, encode partially redundant activities involved in the formation of floral meristems, the first step in the development of flowers. Isolation of the CAULIFLOWER gene from Arabidopsis reveals that it is closely related in sequence to APETALA1. Like APETALA1, CAULIFLOWER is expressed in young flower primordia and encodes a MADS-domain, indicating that it may function as a transcription factor. Analysis of the cultivated garden variety of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) reveals that its CAULIFLOWER gene homolog is not functional, suggesting a molecular basis for one of the oldest recognized flower abnormalities."

Affected individuals in three families exhibited drastically reduced keratinocyte transglutaminase (TGK) activity. In two of these families, expression of TGK transcripts was diminished or abnormal and no TGK protein was detected. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of the TGK gene were identified in all families. These data suggest that defects in TGK cause lamellar ichthyosis and that intact cross-linkage of cornified cell envelopes is required for epidermal tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2030291352,"Terminal Schwann cells overlying the neuromuscular junction sprout elaborate processes upon muscle denervation. We show here that motor axons use these processes as guides/substrates during regeneration; in so doing, they escape the confines of endplates and grow between endplates to generate polyneuronal innervation. We also show that Schwann cells in the nerve provide similar guidance. Axons extend from the cut end of a nerve in association with Schwann cell processes and appear to navigate along them. The processes extend from axotomized nerves at the same rate and in the same manner as they do from axon-containing nerves. The rate of process extension limits the rate at which axons regenerate. Thus, Schwann cell processes lead and guide peripheral regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1982685209,"TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1999076238,"Although both protein and mRNAs for kainate receptor subunits are abundant in several brain regions, the responsiveness of AMPA receptors to kainate has made it difficult to demonstrate the presence of functional kainate-type receptors in native cells. Recently, however, we have shown that many hippocampal neurons in culture express glutamate receptors of the kainate type. The large nondesensitizing response that kainate induces at AMPA receptors precludes detection and analysis of smaller, rapidly desensitizing currents induced by kainate at kainate receptors. Consequently, the functional significance of these strongly desensitizing glutamate receptors remains enigmatic. We report here that the family of new noncompetitive antagonists of AMPA receptors (GYKI 52466 and 53655) minimally affects kainate-induced responses at kainate receptors while completely blocking AMPA receptor-mediated currents, making it possible to separate the responses mediated by each receptor. These compounds will allow determination of the role played by kainate receptors in synaptic transmission and plasticity in the mammalian brain, as well as evaluation of their involvement in neurotoxicity."

The subunit to be purified is coexpressed with an associated subunit bearing a hexahistidine tag. After adsorption of the oligomer to a Ni2+-containing column, the subunit to be purified is eluted specifically by promoting subunit dissociation with AlF4-.

Each G protein oligomer contains a guanine nucleotide-binding α subunit, which can be palmitoylated and, in some cases, myristoylated, and a high affinity dimer of β and γ subunits; γ is prenylated. Sixteen genes are known to encode G protein α subunits, while four β and six γ subunits have been described to date. The α subunits are commonly classified as members of four subfamilies: αs and αolf (stimulators of adenylyl cyclases); αi1, αi2, αi3, αo, αt1, αt2, αz, and αg (a functionally diverse group; pertussis toxin substrates, with the exception of αz); αq, α11, α14, and α15/α16 (activators of phospholipase C-βs); and α12 and α13.

Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The two proteins appear to be expressed ubiquitously(6Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc.

Although little is known about the identity of the receptors that activate these G proteins or the effectors that they regulate, it has been reported recently that overexpression of wild type or constitutively activated α12 causes transformation of NIH 3T3 cells(9Chan A.M.L.

In addition, the Drosophila gene concertina, whose product is highly homologous to both α12 and α13, is involved in ventral furrow formation and posterior midgut invagination during gastrulation(12Parks S. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1991; 64: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Purification of G proteins from natural sources is problematic because of limiting quantities (in most cases) and difficulty of resolution from closely related family members. Expression of certain α subunits (αs, αi, and αo) in Escherichia coli yields large amounts of protein that can be myristoylated where appropriate (αi and αo) (13Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), but the proteins are not palmitoylated and may be missing other unknown modifications (particularly αs).

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have expressed G protein α and βγ subunits in Sf9 cells after infection with recombinant baculoviruses, but yields of appropriately modified protein are often low and purification is laborious. We describe herein a general and substantially improved method for purification of several G protein α and βγ subunits from Sf9 cells. The protein to be purified is coexpressed with an associated hexahistidine-tagged subunit. The oligomer is adsorbed to a Ni2+-containing column, and the desired protein is eluted by subunit dissociation (activation with AlF4-). This combination of specific adsorption and elution yields a highly enriched product that can be brought to essential homogeneity by one step of ion exchange chromatography. We have applied this method to permit characterization of α12 and further investigation of αz. To construct a plasmid encoding a hexahistidine-tagged γ2 subunit, the plasmid pBSγ2 encoding the bovine γ2 subunit (19Robishaw J.D. Kalman V.K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with BglII and MscI. Synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the amino-terminal hexahistidine tag were annealed and ligated into this site. The oligonucleotides utilized had the following sequence. Bgl II _5′-GATCTCCATGGCCCATCACCATCACCATCACG-3′ AGGTACCGGGTAGTGGTAGTGGTAGTGC The resulting plasmid was digested with BglII and XbaI, and the fragment containing the His6-γ2 cDNA was ligated into the BglII and XbaI sites of baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392. The amino acid sequence of His6-γ2 is MAHHHHHHA-γ2(3-71). To construct a transfer vector for α12, a 1.4-kilobase pair cDNA fragment that encodes murine α12 was isolated from pG12-5 (6Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI and SacI; the SacI site was blunt-ended (Klenow). This fragment was ligated into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pVL1392. To remove two Bsu36I sites from the 5′-noncoding region of the α12 cDNA, this plasmid was digested with EcoRI and Bsu36I and self-ligated after both sites were blunt-ended (Klenow). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pVLHis6-γ2 or pVLα12 was cotransfected (Lipofectin, Life Technologies, Inc.) into Sf9 cells with BacPac6 viral DNA (Clontech) linearized with Bsu36I. Recombinant viruses were plaque-purified and amplified as described (20Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Texas Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; : 1555Google Scholar). Positive viral clones were identified by immunoblotting extracts of infected cells with α12 antiserum J168 or γ2 antiserum X263. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding αi1, αq, and β1 subunits have been described(14Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

A recombinant baculovirus encoding αz was generously provided by Patrick Casey and Tim Fields (Duke University). Sf9 cells were cultured in suspension in IPL-41 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1% Pluronic F68, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 27°C with constant shaking (125 rpm). For large scale cultures, the concentration of serum was reduced to 1% and 1% lipid mix (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added. Sf9 cells (4-liter culture; 1.5 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with amplified recombinant baculoviruses encoding the desired G protein α subunit, the β1 subunit, and the His6-γ2 subunit (1 plaque-forming unit/cell for each virus). Cells were harvested 48 h later by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min and suspended in 600 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM NaCl, 10 μM GDP, 0.02 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.03 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.02 mg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 0.02 mg/ml L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), and 0.03 mg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor). Remaining procedures were carried out at 4°C unless otherwise specified. Cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation (Parr bomb) at 500 p.s.i. for 30 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min to remove intact cells and nuclei. The supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the resultant pellets were suspended in 300 ml of wash buffer (50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM NaCl, 10 μM GDP, and proteinase inhibitors as above) using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and centrifuged again as above. The pellets (1.6-2.4 g of protein suspended in 160 ml of wash buffer) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Membranes (40-60 ml, 600 mg of protein) were thawed and diluted to 5 mg/ml with wash buffer containing fresh proteinase inhibitors. Sodium cholate was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and the mixture was stirred on ice for 1 h prior to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatants (membrane extract) were collected, diluted 5-fold with buffer A (20 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μM GDP, and 0.5% C12E10), and loaded onto a 4-ml Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column (1.5 × 2.3 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A containing 5 mM imidazole. The column was then warmed to room temperature for 15 min prior to washing with 12 ml of buffer A containing 5 mM imidazole at 30°C and 32 ml of buffer B (20 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μM GDP, 0.5% C12E10, 30 μM AlCl3, 50 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaF, and 5 mM imidazole) at 30°C. Finally, the column was washed with 12 ml of buffer C (buffer A containing 150 mM imidazole). Fractions (4 ml) were collected during washing with buffers B and C. The fractions were analyzed by silver staining and immunoblotting after electrophoresis through 9% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. α12 was eluted during washing with buffer B, while β1His6-γ2 was eluted with buffer C. The peak fractions of α12 (about 20 ml) were pooled and diluted 3-fold with buffer D (20 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM dithiothreitol, 0.7% CHAPS). This solution was then applied to a Mono S HR 5/5 cation exchange column for FPLC (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which had been equilibrated with buffer D. α12 was eluted (at approximately 300 mM NaCl) with a 20-ml gradient of NaCl (0-400 mM). GDP (1 μl of a 5 mM solution) was put in the tubes used to collect fractions, which were each 0.5 ml. Fractions were assayed by immunoblotting and by measurement of [35S]GTPγS binding activity. Peak fractions were concentrated, and the buffer was changed to buffer D containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.5 μM GDP using a Centricon 30 (Amicon). Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Differences from the procedure utilized for α12 are described. In the case of αz, the Ni-NTA column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A containing 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole after application of the diluted membrane extract. αz was eluted from the column at room temperature with buffer E (buffer B except with 1% sodium cholate instead of 0.5% C12E10). αz was further purified by Mono S HR 5/5 column chromatography. The pH of buffer D was 7.4 instead of 8.0, and the NaCl gradient (25 ml) was 0-550 mM. Fractions were assayed for [35S]GTPγS binding activity (0.5 mM MgSO4 total; 1 μM free Mg2+) and by immunoblotting (using αz antiserum P961). αz was eluted in fractions containing 400-450 mM NaCl. The pH of the final buffer was 7.4. For purification of αq, the concentration of GDP in the buffers was raised to 50 μM. The Ni-NTA column was washed with buffer A containing 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole. The column was then incubated at room temperature with buffer F (20 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 5 μM GTPγS, 0.2% sodium cholate, and 5 mM imidazole) and washed with 32 ml of the same buffer. This step is utilized to elute an endogenous (Sf9 cell) αi-like protein. αq was eluted with buffer E. The peak fractions from the Ni-NTA column were diluted 3-fold with buffer D and loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column that had been equilibrated with buffer D. αq was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-400 mM; 20 ml). Fractions were assayed by immunoblotting with αq/α11 antiserum Z811 and α11 antiserum B825. Recombinant αq is recognized by both antisera and was eluted in fractions containing about 220 mM NaCl. An endogenous Sf9 cell αq-like protein is recognized by antiserum Z811 but not by antiserum B825 and eluted later in the gradient (about 280 mM NaCl)(14Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peak fractions that contained only recombinant αq were pooled and concentrated, and the buffer was changed to buffer D containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.5 μM GDP. For purification of αi1, the Ni-NTA column was processed as described for αz. The peak fractions from the Ni-NTA column were diluted 3-fold with buffer D and loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column that had been equilibrated with buffer D. αi1 was eluted with a NaCl gradient (0-400 mM; 20 ml). Fractions were assayed for [35S]GTPγS binding activity and by immunoblotting using αs/αi antiserum P960. αi1 was eluted in fractions containing about 200 mM NaCl. The peak fractions were processed as described for αq. This αi1 preparation contained a very small amount of an Sf9 cell αi-like protein (about 1%). To purify the recombinant β1γ2 subunit complex, Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding β1, γ2, and His6-αi1. His6-αi1 has an insertion of 6 histidine residues at position 121 of αi1 (where the yeast α subunit GPA 1 has a long insert compared with mammalian α subunits). Ni-NTA column chromatography and Mono Q column chromatography were performed as described for purification of αi1. β1γ2 was eluted from the Mono Q column in fractions containing about 180 mM NaCl. The peak fractions were concentrated, and the buffer was changed to buffer D containing 100 mM NaCl. [35S]GTPγS and [γ-32P]GTP binding assays were performed as described by Northup et al.(22Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained HEDL buffer (50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.05% C12E10) with the indicated concentrations of MgSO4 and [35S]GTPγS (3000-8000 cpm/pmol) or [γ-32P]GTP (10,000 cpm/pmol). Reactions were terminated by addition of 2 ml of ice-cold 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 20 mM MgCl2. Steady state GTPase activity was measured as described in the figure legends. Reactions were terminated by addition of 20-μl aliquots to 780 μl of ice-cold 5% (w/v) Norit in 50 mM NaH2PO4, and 32Pi was determined as described previously(23Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 757-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured as described by Smigel (24Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified G proteins were reconstituted with 10 μg of membranes from Sf9 cells expressing type I, II, or V adenylyl cyclase in a final volume of 20 μl for 3 min at 30°C prior to assay. All assays were performed for 7 min at 30°C in a volume of 50 μl. The concentration of MgCl2 was 4 mM, and that of CHAPS was 0.12%. To prepare GTPγS-bound α subunits, proteins were incubated with 200 μM GTPγS for 60 min (αs, αz, and α12) or 120 min (αi1) at 30°C in the presence of 4 mM free Mg2+ (αs, αi1, or α12) or 5 μM free Mg2+ (αz). Free nucleotide was removed by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-50 spin column. The concentrations of α subunits were calculated from [35S]GTPγS binding data. α12 was diluted with HEDL buffer (to 1 μM) and was incubated with 100 μM GDP or 100 μM GDP, 30 μM AlCl3, 50 mM MgSO4, and 10 mM NaF at 0°C for 10 min or with 100 μM GTPγS and 10 mM MgSO4 at 30°C for 60 min. TPCK-treated trypsin (10% of the α12 mass) was then added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 or 30 min at 30°C. Reactions were terminated by addition of trypsin inhibitor (10-fold mass excess of trypsin) and transfer to ice. The samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9% gels) and immunoblotting with α12 antiserum J168. α12 antisera J168 and J169 were made by immunization of rabbits against the synthetic 12-amino acid peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of α12. αs/αi antiserum P960(25Casey P.J.

The following reagents were kindly provided by colleagues at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center: α13 purified from Sf9 cells by William D. Singer; membranes from Sf9 cells expressing type I, II, or V adenylyl cyclase by Ronald Taussig; αs purified from E. coli by Wei-Jen Tang; antisera P960, P961, and X263 by Susanne Mumby; antisera Z811 and B825 by Paul C. Sternweis; and [γ-32P]GTP by Elliott M. Ross. The cDNA encoding α12 was generously provided by Dr. Melvin I. Simon (California Institute of Technology). We have previously described the purification of relatively small amounts of αq, α11, and α16 from Sf9 cells following their coexpression with G protein β and γ subunits(14Hepler J.R. Kozasa T.

Expression of the heterotrimer increases the amount of active α subunit in membrane fractions and prevents the aggregation of αq and α11. However, difficulty with purification of α12 prompted the present effort to improve and generalize this technology. The resulting method for purification of Gα subunits takes advantage of the high specificity, affinity, and capacity of Ni-NTA resin (33Hochuli E. Dobeli H. Schacher A. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 411: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 34Hochuli E. Bannwarth W. Dobeli H. Gentz R. Stuber D. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1320-1325Google Scholar) for hexahistidine-tagged βγ and specific elution of a coexpressed α subunit following activation with AlF4-. Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding α12, β1, and His6-γ2. A cholate extract containing the hexahistidine-tagged heterotrimer was diluted with buffer containing C12E10 before application to the Ni-NTA column. Addition of this detergent improved the stability of the heterotrimer on the resin. After extensive washing, α12 could be activated and eluted with AlF4- if buffers were warmed to 30°C. Silver-stained fractions from the Ni-NTA column are shown in Fig. 1. Most of the protein in the cholate extract flows through the column (lanes 1 and 2) or is removed by washing with buffer containing low concentrations of imidazole (lanes 3-5). α12 is seen as the major protein in fractions eluted in the presence of AlF4- (lanes 6-10). The β1His6-γ2 complex can then be eluted with 150 mM imidazole (lanes 11 and 12). β1 is negatively stained because of its high concentration. α12 was further purified by Mono S cation exchange chromatography using CHAPS as the detergent (Fig. 2). The final sample of α12 was visualized as a homogeneous silver-stained band in polyacrylamide gels with an apparent molecular weight of 43,000 (Fig. 3, lane 1). The yield of purified protein was 600 μg from 600 mg of Sf9 cell membrane protein, which is obtained from a 1-1.5-liter culture (Table 1). The relatively low enrichment of GTPγS binding activity is undoubtedly due to the presence of other GTP-binding proteins in the membrane extract. The actual stoichiometry of binding of GTPγS to α12 is approximately 0.5 mol/mol (approximately 10 nmol/mg protein) (see below). The fractions from the Ni-NTA column that were eluted with AlF4- also contained Sf9 cell proteins that were detected with αs/αi antiserum P960 (Sf9 αi) or αq/α11 antiserum Z811 (Sf9 αq). However, both immunoreactive proteins flow through the Mono S column. When the purification procedure was followed using membranes from Sf9 cells expressing only β1His6-γ2, immunoreactive proteins were not detected with α12 antiserum J168 or broadly reactive antisera in the fractions corresponding to those where α12 is normally found. We conclude that the final preparation of α12 is essentially free of other G protein subunits. The β1His6-γ2 method was also used successfully to purify recombinant Gα subunits from two other subfamilies: αz, αq, and αi1. For these subunits, the Ni-NTA column was washed with buffer containing high concentrations of salt (300 mM NaCl), and the Gα proteins were eluted with AlF4- in buffer containing 1% sodium cholate at room temperature. Cholate facilitates the dissociation of αz, αq, and αi1 from β1His6-γ2. By contrast, α12 could not be eluted from the Ni-NTA column in the presence of 1% sodium cholate and AlF4-. Mono S chromatography was also used to complete the purification of αz, and the yield of αz was 250 μg from 600 mg of Sf9 cell membranes (Table 1; Fig. 3, lane 3). To purify αq, the Ni-NTA column was also washed with buffer containing 5 μM GTPγS to remove Sf9 αi. This wash takes advantage of the relatively poor affinity of αq for GTPγS in order to activate and remove endogenous Gα subunits with high affinity for the nucleotide. Sf9 αq was resolved from recombinant αq by Mono Q chromatography (Fig. 3, lane 2). To purify αi1 (Fig. 3, lane 4), endogenous αq was removed by Mono Q chromatography, but it was not possible to resolve Sf9 αi from recombinant αi1. However, performance of the purification protocol for αi1 in the absence of expression of this subunit suggests that the level of contamination by Sf9 αi is only about 1%. The yields of αq and αi1 were 110 and 1400 μg, respectively, from 600 mg of Sf9 cell membrane (Table 1). Reciprocal hexahistidine tagging was also utilized to purify the β1γ2 subunit complex. In this case the hexahistidine tag was inserted into αi1 at a position corresponding to a large insertion in the GPA1 Gα subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Membrane extracts containing His6-αi1, β1, and γ2 were applied to the Ni-NTA column, washed with buffer containing a high concentration of NaCl, and eluted with AlF4-. βγ was further purified by Mono Q column chromatography. Gα subunits were not detected as contaminants of this preparation. The yield of β1γ2 was 2 mg from 600 mg of Sf9 cell membranes (Table 1; Fig. 3, lane 5), and the product was able to support ADP-ribosylation of αi1 and stimulation of αs-activated type II adenylyl cyclase activity in a manner characteristic of βγ subunits purified by other methods (data not shown). The specificities of antisera J168 and J169 were assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acid residues of α12 was used as the antigen. This sequence has 8 amino acid residues that are identical with the corresponding sequence of α13 and 7 identities with αq. Antiserum J168 reacts weakly with α13, while antiserum J169 is specific for α12. Neither antiserum recognizes the same amount of αq, α16, αz, αi1, or αs. αs/αi antiserum P960 and αq/α11 antiserum Z811 do not recognize either α12 or α13. αz is recognized by αz antiserum P961 and very weakly by antiserum P960. The time course of binding of [35S]GTPγS to purified α12 at 30°C is shown in Fig. 5A. The rate of binding is slow, and maximal values are not achieved even after 150 min of incubation. The data can, however, be fit to a single exponential for estimation of maximal binding values. Binding of GTPγS to α12 is slightly faster in the presence of 9 mM free Mg2+ than at lower concentrations of the divalent cation (100 μM or 10 nM free Mg2+). At 10 mM Mg2+ and 5 μM GTPγS, the rate of GTPγS binding is approximately 0.01 min−1. This rate is independent of nucleotide concentratio"
https://openalex.org/W2065624887,"C. elegans male mating behavior comprises a series of steps: response to contact with the hermaphrodite, backing along her body, turning around her head or tail, location of the vulva, insertion of the two copulatory spicules into the vulva, and sperm transfer. By ablation of male-specific copulatory structures and their associated neurons, we have identified sensory structures and neurons that participate in each of these steps: the sensory rays mediate response to contact and turning; the hook, the postcloacal sensilla, and the spicules mediate vulva location; the spicules also mediate spicule insertion and regulate sperm transfer. Generally, successful completion of each step places the male in a position to receive a cue for the next step in the pathway. However, the high degree of sensory regulation allows the male to execute some steps independently."

These processes were associated with every nerve sprout and in some cases were longer than the sprouts that appeared to be growing along them. Following partial denervation, more than 70% of the nerve sprouts that grew to innervate nearby denervated endplates were associated with Schwann cell processes that had extended from the denervated endplates, i.e., in the direction opposite to nerve growth. Implantation of Schwann cells into an innervated muscle induced sprouting upon contact of an axon or nerve terminal by Schwann cell processes. These observations show that Schwann cells induce and guide axonal sprouting in muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2059028264,"Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an intermediate filament protein specifically expressed in astrocytes in the CNS. To examine the function of GFAP in vivo, the Gfap gene was disrupted by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. Mice homozygous for the mutation were completely devoid of GFAP but exhibited normal development and showed no obvious anatomical abnormalities in the CNS. When inoculated with infectious scrapie prions, the mutant mice exhibited neuropathological changes typical of prion diseases. Infectious prions accumulated in brains of the mutant mice to a degree similar to that in control littermates. These results suggest that GFAP is not essential for the morphogenesis of the CNS or for astrocytic responses against neuronal injury. The results argue against the hypothesis that GFAP plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2031912570,"Early olfactory axons follow a specific pathway to reach the developing telencephalon. We observed that a subpopulation of these axons, the pioneer olfactory axons, penetrate into the ventricular zone of a highly restricted region of the telencephalon at E13 and E14. At E15, this same telencephalic region evaginates to form the olfactory bulb. To investigate the possibility that the pioneer olfactory axons induce the olfactory bulb by influencing precursor cell populations, we compared cell cycle kinetics and differentiation in the olfactory bulb primordium and the adjacent neocortex using cumulative bromdeoxyuridine labeling. The results showed that, 24 hr after the arrival of the first pioneer axons, the duration of the cell cycle is prolonged significantly in the olfactory bulb primordium. In addition, twice as many cells have exited the mitotic cycle in the olfactory bulb primordium versus the adjacent cortex. These findings suggest that pioneer olfactory axons play a role in the induction of the olfactory bulb by selectively modulating cell cycle kinetics in the olfactory bulb primordium. Afferent axons may influence target morphogenesis by modulating target precursor cell proliferation in other developing neural structures."

The distribution of 3F12 immunoreactive neurons closely matches that of Alzheimer's disease (AD) targeted neurons in these areas. In some hippocampal neurons of AD patients, this antigen colocalizes with ALZ-50, indicating the presence of AD pathology in these neurons. Molecular characterization of the 3F12 cDNA revealed it to be a member of the MAP kinase family, showing 43% amino acid sequence identity to human extracellular related kinase 2 (p42mapk). We have confirmed that p493F12 kinase autophosphorylates both threonine and tyrosine residues, as expected for a MAP kinase. The p49 mRNA is expressed exclusively in the nervous system. In the brain, the distribution of these neurons closely corresponds to 3F12 antigen-bearing neurons. The p493F12 gene maps to the human chromosome 21q21 region, a region that may be important in the pathogenesis of AD and Down's syndrome."

First, it is hydroxylated in the liver at C-25 to produce 25-OH-D3, the major circulating form of the vitamin. Subsequently, 25-OH-D3 is further hydroxylated in the kidney by the 1α-hydroxylase to produce 1,25-(OH)2D3(1DeLuca H.F.

The present study demonstrates the synergistic importance of the DREs in this promoter and the requirement of a fifth half-site 3′ from DRE closest to the transcriptional start site. Furthermore, we determined the relative affinities of both DREs for the VDR. Several synthetic oligonucleotides were generated by a DNA synthesizer (ABI, La Jolla, CA) as shown in Fig. 1A. These oligonucleotides were designed to have XbaI termini for labeling and subcloning. The larger oligonucleotides (over 100 bp) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers shown in Fig. 1B. The 24-hydroxylase promoter region was used as template (14Zierold C. Darwish H.M. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 900-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). DRE1 and DRE2 separated by 93 bp of nonspecific DNA were constructed using primers shown in Fig. 1C and chicken 24-hydroxylase cDNA 2R. Ismail and H. F. DeLuca, unpublished results. as template. The DRE sequences were included in the primers as shown in Fig. 1. The recombinant reporter gene constructs were obtained by cloning the oligonucleotides mentioned above into the XbaI site of the pBLCAT2 vector(19Luckow B. Schuetz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). 2.5 μg/60-mm dish of these constructs were transfected into NRK-52E rat kidney cells using the Lipofectin method (Life Technologies, Inc.); the Lipofectin:DNA ratio was 3:1. Transfected cells were dosed with 1,25-(OH)2D3 to a final concentration of 10 nM and incubated for 20-24 h. The cells were then harvested, and the activity of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) enzyme was measured as described before(14Zierold C. Darwish H.M. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 900-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). All Kddeterminations were done by gel retardation assays. Probes were prepared synthetically or amplified by polymerase chain reaction as explained above. Labeling of each probe was done by repairing XbaI-recessed ends utilizing [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN) and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Promega). The probe obtained by polymerase chain reaction using chicken 24-hydroxylase cDNA was end-labeled utilizing [γ-32P]dATP (DuPont NEN) and the T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The labeled probes were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroelution. The final probe concentrations after purification were 0.5 or 1 ng/μl. Binding of the VDR to the labeled DNA probes was performed as previously described (11Darwish H.M. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, porcine intestinal nuclear extract containing VDR and the labeled DNA were incubated at 4°C for 2 h, the time needed for maximal binding. The final KCl concentration was 75 mM, the concentration at which maximal binding occurs in the absence of 1,25-(OH)2D3. When 1,25-(OH)2D3 was added to the reaction, determinations were made at both 75 and 150 mM KCl, the latter being the concentration at which maximal binding occurs in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3. The VDR•DNA complexes and unbound DNA were quantitated from the dried gels using the Betascope Analyzer (Betagen, Waltham, MA). All affinity measurements were calculated using computer-assisted graphics. Fig. 2 shows the structure of each pBLCAT2 construct used and their respective reporter gene activity induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3. The entire DRE unit including 5′-half-sites produced a dramatic stimulation of CAT activity. Since this includes the DRE at −262 and the 3 half-sites at −154, the contribution of each was examined. The half-site at −262 is responsive to 1,25-(OH)2D3 by itself but to a much lesser degree than the entire DRE system. The DRE at −154 is not responsive to 1,25-(OH)2D3 by itself but requires the presence of a third half-site located at the 3′-end. All 3 half-sites are required for 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent activity as shown in Fig. 3.Figure 3CAT activities resulting from different combinations of half-sites of DRE2 (−154 to −125). The small letters correspond to the half-sites depicted in Fig. 2. Activities are expressed as total counts of acetylated chloramphenicol obtained in 19 h on the Betascope analyzer. All reactions contained 100 μg of protein. The CAT assays were carried out as explained under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the intact promoter, a 93-base pair segment separates the two DREs. When this is deleted, the transactivation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 is unchanged. Our results suggest that these two DREs containing a total of 5 half-sites account for most if not all of the transactivation potential of the intact promoter of the rat 24-hydroxylase. The somewhat higher +D/−D ratio seen with the intact 24-hydroxylase promoter and a promoterless CAT reporter is likely because of the lower base-line activity found in the cells without 1,25-(OH)2D3. Kd values were determined for each DRE separately and together with their natural flanking sequences (separated by 93 bp) (Table 1). Multiple determinations were done, and a representative gel shift for each fragment is shown in Fig. 4. Increasing amounts of the indicated DNA probes were incubated with 24 fmol of VDR. Fig. 4 shows the only complexes detected in the assays. The amount of complex formed was plotted versus the amount of unbound probe as shown in Fig. 5, A-C. These saturation plots show that the DREs separately (Fig. 5, A and B) reach saturation at a 250-fold higher concentration than both together (Fig. 5C). The dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated from Scatchard analysis as shown in the accompanying plots in Fig. 5(D-F)(20Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17731) Google Scholar). All Scatchard plots in Fig. 5 show biphasic binding. Two Kd values were calculated for each fragment. Table 1 presents the Kd determined for the DREs by themselves, their half-sites, and the entire D-responsive region of the 24-hydroxylase promoter. No cooperative binding of the VDR to the 2 half-sites of the DREs was detected (Fig. 6A), which could have explained the biphasic binding; there also seemed to be no cooperativity of VDR binding between both DREs (Fig. 6B). The tightest binding was observed with the intact DRE system. Substitution of the 93-bp fragment separating the two DREs with an irrelevant chicken DNA had little effect. The DRE at −268 to −238 had approximately [1/100] the binding affinity of the two DRE systems, while the DRE at −154 to −125 had [1/500] the affinity. Half-sites were bound poorly or about 10,000 times lower than the DRE complex and were not responsible for the biphasic binding pattern, since they seemed to have equal binding affinities for the VDR.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 4Electrophoretic gels of DREs and porcine intestinal nuclear extracts.

The total concentrations loaded per lane (free + bound) is indicated above each lane. Radiolabeled probe was the only source of DNA in lanes containing less than 10 nM.

A, DRE1 and DRE2 assayed separately; B, DRE1 and DRE2 separated by their natural promoter sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Kd values in the presence of ligand were also determined, and these values are also shown in Table 1. Binding proved to be 2-3-fold weaker in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3, regardless of the salt concentration at which they were determined. However, the salt concentration at which maximal binding was achieved was higher (75 mM KCl versus 150 mM KCl) (data not shown). The fact that, in the absence of ligand, less salt is needed to destabilize the DNA-receptor complex would suggest that this complex is less stable than the complex with 1,25-(OH)2D3, yet the dissociation constant is 2-3 times lower, which indicates greater affinity. We have no explanation for this interesting anomaly. We then compared Kd values with their respective 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent transcriptional activities (Fig. 2 and Table 1). There was no such correlation between transcriptional activity and Kd for any of the DNA fragments. This report demonstrates that the promoter region of the 1,25-(OH)2D-24-hydroxylase gene of the rat contains the most powerful vitamin D-responsive element system reported to date. This system includes two distantly separated response elements, one of which contains 2 half-sites separated by 3 nonspecific bases in accordance with Umesono et al.(21Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar), and the other response element contains 3 half-sites that are essential for the transactivation activity by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and its receptor. The DRE site closest to the transcriptional start site contains 3 half-sites, each separated by 3 base pairs, which is an unusual arrangement for vitamin D-responsive genes. The most significant fact, however, is that there are two distinct D-responsive elements found in the promoter region of this gene, and both are required for maximal transactivation activity. These two DREs are separated by a 93-base pair fragment, which can be deleted without significantly reducing the transactivation potential of the system. It is important to note that the presence of two hormone-responsive elements in the same promoter is unique for 1,25-(OH)2D3 but not unusual, since, for example, the vitellogenin gene has two estrogen response elements(22Burch J.B.E. Evans M.I. Friedman T.M. O'Malley P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), while the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat contains multiple copies of the glucocorticoid response elements(23Scheidereit C. Geisse S. Westphal H.M. Beato M. Nature. 1983; 304: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In dissecting the transactivation potential of this system, our results demonstrate that the DRE, more distal to the transcriptional start site, is capable of responding in the reporter gene system to 1,25-(OH)2D3. The DRE proximal to the transcriptional start site did not respond to 1,25-(OH)2D3 until a third half-site was included. Each of the DREs alone could not approach the activity of the entire system. Finally, it is apparent from our results that the total 5 half-sites can account for virtually all of the transactivation potential of the VDR system found in the intact 24-hydroxylase promoter. Since the intact promoter was placed in a promoterless reporter gene system, the results are not entirely comparable with the data obtained using a reporter gene system containing the thymidine kinase promoter used to analyze fragments and constructs. Furthermore, the 24-hydroxylase promoter in the promoterless CAT reporter system shows low basal activity, which accounts for the higher ratio of +D/−D response. Because of these findings, we attempted to learn whether the transactivation of each of these elements is related to their ability to bind to the receptor and the accessory protein. The Kd values determined for each component of the VDR system did not correlate with its activity in the reporter gene system. However, the tightest binding occurred with the intact double responsive element system, and it was this system that gave maximum transactivation. In general, when examining the many oligonucleotides studied, no correlation between binding and transactivation was detected. The 24-hydroxylase VDR system found in the promoter region represents an important new tool in deciphering the molecular mechanism whereby 1,25-(OH)2D3 elicits an increased transcription of a target gene. We have also been able to utilize the DREs in the 24-hydroxylase promoter as an affinity resin for the isolation of the VDR and its nuclear accessory factor. This VDR system, therefore, represents an important advance in the molecular biology of vitamin D action."

The response was inhibited by pretreating neurons with antibodies to L1 or antibodies to the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor. The response could also be inhibited by a range of pharmacological reagents that inhibit various steps in the signal transduction cascade which underlie a neurite outgrowth response to basic FGF. The response was of a similar magnitude and not additive with that induced by L1 expressed in a cellular substrate. These data show that L1 in neurons is capable of directing a neurite outgrowth response to a soluble L1-Fc chimera, and that neuronal FGF receptor function is required for this response. The data also show that the ability of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) to stimulate neurite outgrowth can be dissociated from their ability to function as substrate-associated adhesion molecules and point to the potential of using CAM-Fc chimeras to promote nerve regeneration."

Point mutations of the GlyR, substituting Arg-271 with either Leu or Gln, have been shown to underlie the inherited neurological disorder startle disease (hyperekplexia). We show that these substitutions result in the redistribution of GlyR single-channel conductances to lower conductance levels. Additionally, the binding of the glycinergic agonists beta-alanine and taurine to mutated GlyRs does not initiate a chloride current, but instead competitively antagonizes currents activated by glycine. These findings are consistent with mutations of Arg-271 resulting in the uncoupling of the agonist binding process from the channel activation mechanism of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2041157953,"The modulation of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels by neurotransmitters and peptides is very likely a primary means of regulating Ca(2+)-dependent physiological functions such as neurosecretion, muscle contraction, and membrane excitability. In neurons, N-type Ca2+ channels (defined as omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive) are one prominent target for transmitter-mediated inhibition. This inhibition is widely thought to result from a shift in the voltage independence of channel gating. Recently, however, voltage-independent inhibition has also been described for N channels. As embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion neurons express both of these biophysically distinct modulatory pathways, we have utilized these cells to test the hypothesis that the voltage-dependent and -independent actions of transmitters are mediated by separate biochemical pathways. We have confirmed this hypothesis by demonstrating that the two modulatory mechanisms activated by a single transmitter involve not only different classes of G protein but also different G protein subunits."

At this point, it is not possible to identify the time of commitment, but the time that differentiation begins can be identified. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling coupled with immunohistochemistry with a ganglion cell-specific antibody was used to fix the time of the beginning of ganglion cell differentiation relative to the time of mitosis in the developing chick retina. It was found that ganglion cells can begin to differentiate in less than 15 min after the end of mitosis. This suggests that the retinal ganglion cell fate may be determined before or during mitosis."

Patch-clamp recordings from isolated photoreceptor cells of InaDp215 show a slow deactivation of the light-induced current. This defective deactivation of InaD appears dependent on calcium influx; removal of extracellular calcium masks its abnormal phenotype.

McLachlan S.M. Furmaniak J. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 106-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar)). Large amounts of conformationally intact TSH receptor protein are a fundamental requirement for future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this disease. Generating a functional TSH receptor in stably transfected eukaryotic cells has been straightforward (reviewed in (2Nagayama Y. Rapoport B. Mol.

There has also been no difficulty in expressing large amounts of the TSH receptor extracellular domain in prokaryotic cells(3Takai O. Desai R.K. Seetharamaiah G.S. Jones C.A. Allaway G.P. Akamizu T.

However, in this case, most of the protein is present in inclusion bodies, and attempts at renaturation have failed to produce protein capable of specific binding by TSH and TSH receptor autoantibodies(3Takai O.

A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures. Texas A & M University, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar) has been viewed as a promising solution to this dilemma. Unlike in prokaryotes, proteins expressed in insect cells are glycosylated, albeit not identically to eukaryotic cells. However, all attempts to generate the full-length TSH receptor in the baculovirus system failed(8Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Gout I. Taylor A.H. Waterfield M.D. Nussey S.S. Mol. Cell.

A number of laboratories, including our own, failed to produce functional protein (5Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Others have described the generation of receptor protein incapable of physiological, high affinity ligand binding (9Huang G.C. Page M.J. Nicholson L.B. Collison K.S. McGregor A.M. Banga J.P. J. Mol.

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).In this study, we have attempted to express a functional TSH receptor using a baculovirus vector with the late basic protein promoter. This promoter is active earlier than the very late polyhedrin promoter, which functions at a time when expression of the enzymes involved in post-translational protein modification is suppressed(12Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Procedures and Methods Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar). In contrast to experience with conventional baculovirus vectors, we generated a more highly glycosylated, soluble, and functional TSH receptor, although with a very low yield. These data carry important implications for the expression by baculovirus vectors of functional highly glycosylated proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSTruncation of the 5′-Untranslated Region of the TSH Receptor cDNAFalse ATG initiation codons in frame with a stop codon in the 5′-untranslated region of the TSH receptor were removed by generating a 0.23-kilobase fragment of the TSH receptor by the polymerase chain reaction (13Saiki R.K.

The upstream primer (with SalI and EcoRI restriction sites) was 5′TAAGTCGACGAATTCCCCGAGTCCCGTGGAAAATGAGG, and the downstream primer (with an SnaBI site) was 5′-ATCTATAGATACGTAGATTCTGGA. The polymerase chain reaction was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The 0.23-kilobase fragment was restricted with SalI and SnaBI and used to replace the same fragment in the full-length TSH receptor cDNA in pSV2-NEO-ECE-TSHR(14Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Russo D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide termination method(15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52361) Google Scholar).Baculovirus Expression Vector ConstructionA cassette formed by two oligonucleotides (5′-CTAGTGGGAGGTGGACATCACCATCACCATCACTGATAATCTA and 5′-GATCTAGATTATCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTCCACCTCCCA) was used to introduce 3 glycine and 6 histidine residues followed by two stop codons at the carboxyl terminus of the 420-amino acid residue TSH receptor extracellular domain (including the signal peptide). This cassette was inserted into the SpeI and BglII sites in the modified human TSH receptor cDNA in pBluescript (pBS-hTSHR-mod)(14Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Russo D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The 1.6-kilobase MluI-XbaI fragment including the 6-His cassette was excised and used to replace the corresponding fragment of the modified pSV2-NEO-ECE-TSHR (see above). From this plasmid, the 1.3-kilobase TSH receptor extracellular domain cDNA with the 6-His tag was released with EcoRI and BglII and subcloned into the same sites in the baculovirus transfer vectors pAcMP3 and pVL1393 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) to generate the plasmids pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H and pVL1393-TSHR-EX-6H, respectively.Expression of TSH Receptor Extracellular Domain (TSHR-EX-6H) ProteinPurified pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H or pVL1393-TSHR-EX-6H plasmid (2 μg) was cotransfected with 0.5 μg of BaculoGold viral DNA (Pharmingen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Monolayers of Sf9 insect cells were cultured at 27°C in Hink's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. After 5 days of incubation, the virus in the supernatant was titered, and individual plaques were isolated and amplified 2-4 times using Sf9 cell suspensions (Pharmingen)(16O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). TSHR-EX-6H protein was generated by infecting Sf9 or High Five insect cells (Pharmingen) in monolayer for different periods of time as indicated in the text for individual experiments. Infections were performed with viral stocks of 0.5-2 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml at multiplicities of infection of 10-20 plaque-forming units/cell.To generate radiolabeled TSH receptor, infected cells in 25-cm2 flasks were preincubated for 4 h in Ex-Cell 401 methionine-free medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). The medium was then replaced with the same medium (1.5 ml) containing 100-250 μCi of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN). After a 4-h pulse, the medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed once and then either lysed or a chase was performed for ∼16 h in Hink's medium. Intact cells were lysed directly in 1.5 ml of 8 M urea, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.01 M Tris, pH 8.0, and centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was retained.The distribution of the [35S]methionine-labeled TSH receptor between the particulate and cytosolic fractions of the cells was determined by a modification of the above approach, using guanidine to dissolve the insoluble fraction. After infection and labeling (see above), the Sf9 cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (2 μg/ml) (all from Sigma). The cells were disrupted by two freeze-thaw cycles and centrifuged (4°C) for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was retained, and the pellet was dissolved in 6 M guanidine HCl, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.01 M Tris, pH 8.0.Larger scale preparations of soluble TSH receptor protein were made in the same manner, except that the cells were not pulsed with [35S]methionine, and we used High Five insect cells in 175-cm2 flasks. These cells were cultured in serum-free Ex-Cell 400 medium (JRH Biosciences).Nickel Chelate Column Purification of the TSH Receptor ProteinAffinity purification of [35S]methionine-labeled TSHR-EX-6H from (i) urea-solubilized intact cells, (ii) culture medium following chase (secreted protein), (iii) the cytosolic fraction of disrupted cells, and (iv) the guanidine-solubilized particulate fraction of disrupted cells was performed by adding 50 μl of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) to 1.5 ml of these solutions. After mixing for 60 min at room temperature, the resin was washed three times with 1 ml of buffer B (8 M urea, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.01 M Tris, pH 6.3), and protein was released with 40 μl of buffer B containing 0.1 M EDTA. Aliquots (20 μl) in Laemmli buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) containing 0.7 M β-mercaptoethanol were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography (XAR-5 film, Eastman Kodak Co.).Larger scale purification of nonradioactive soluble protein involved the addition of 0.5 ml of resin slurry to 10-20 ml of High Five cell cytosolic proteins (see above). The resin was poured into a column and rinsed with 20 volumes of 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by the same volume of 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. Protein was eluted in two steps with phosphate buffer, pH 5.9 and 4.5 (10 ml each), and immediately neutralized to pH 7.0. Both eluted fractions were pooled and concentrated by Centriprep-30 (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) to ∼0.7 ml.Enzymatic Deglycosylation of TSHR-EX-6H ProteinFollowing Ni-NTA affinity purification, radiolabeled samples (∼10 μl in buffer B with 0.1 M EDTA) were added to 0.25 ml of 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Samples were incubated for 16 h at 37°C with 2 units of endoglycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography.Effect of TSHR-EX-6H Protein on 125I-TSH BindingRadiolabeled TSH binding to the wild-type human TSH receptor stably expressed on the surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells in monolayer culture was performed as described previously (18Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20970-20975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Dilutions of affinity-purified TSHR-EX-6H in 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were prepared (see “Results”). Fifty μl of each dilution was preincubated for 1 h at room temperature with ∼10,000 cpm 125I-TSH in 450 μl of TSH binding buffer(18Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20970-20975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (230 μl) were then added to the CHO cells for 8 h at 4°C, and the cells were then processed as described previously(18Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20970-20975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific TSH binding was calculated by subtraction of nonspecific binding in the presence of 10−6M TSH (2-5% of total counts).TSH Receptor Autoantibody Neutralization by TSHR-EX-6H ProteinA standard TSH binding inhibition assay (19Filetti S. Foti D. Costante G. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1991; 72: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was used, with the addition of a preincubation step to test for autoantibody neutralization. IgG was prepared from the sera of patients containing TSH receptor autoantibodies by ammonium sulfate precipitation; dialyzed against 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; and diluted to 1.5 mg/ml in TSH binding buffer (see above). Dilutions of affinity-purified TSHR-EX-6H protein (50 μl each) were added to 450 μl of IgG in TSH binding buffer and preincubated for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was then added to the CHO TSH receptor cells for 8 h at 4°C. The IgG/TSHR-EX-6H mixture was removed, the cells were rinsed once with 1 ml of ice-cold TSH binding buffer, and ∼10,000 cpm 125I-TSH in 0.25 ml of TSH binding buffer was added for 12-16 h at 4°C. Specifically bound TSH was then determined as described above.RESULTSTSH Receptor Extracellular Domain Expression in Intact Insect CellsWe approached the problem of high level expression of a functional TSH receptor extracellular domain by using a new baculovirus transfer vector (pAcMP3) with a late basic protein promoter active at an earlier stage than the conventional very late polyhedrin promoter. After removing the 5′-untranslated region, we inserted the cDNA for the TSH receptor extracellular domain into the pAcMP3 transfer vector and generated by homologous recombination the baculovirus pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H. This cDNA (TSHR-EX-6H) encodes the first 420 amino acid residues of the TSH receptor followed by a 3-Gly spacer and a 6-His tag at its 3′-end.Ten individual viral plaques were selected for protein expression in Sf9 insect cells. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins extracted from intact cells with 6 M urea buffer were subjected to Ni-NTA affinity purification. Relative to control cells infected with baculovirus without the TSH receptor cDNA, all 10 TSHR-EX-6H clones expressed (9/10 strongly) a labeled protein of ∼68 kDa (Fig. 1). Typically, in different experiments, a protein of smaller size (∼63 kDa) and variable intensity was also affinity-purified with the Ni-NTA resin (Fig. 1). Consistent with the relatively uniform levels of expression by most of the individual clones, the signal with the uncloned viral stock (viral “pool”) was similar to that of the clones. All subsequent experiments with the pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H construct were performed with viral stock amplified from clone 2.The time course of radiolabeled TSHR-EX-6H protein expression in intact Sf9 cells was determined. Consistent with the time of activity of the basic protein promoter, the major 68-kDa band, affinity-purified by Ni-NTA chromatography, was apparent only after 1 day of infection with the pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H virus (Fig. 2). For comparison, insect cells were infected with virus generated by the same TSH receptor cDNA in the transfer vector, pVL1393, with the standard very late polyhedrin promoter. In contrast to the earlier expression of labeled protein with the pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H virus, specific protein expression was maximal on the second post-infection day and was still evident 3 days after infection (Fig. 2). Of note, the cellular protein generated with the polyhedrin promoter was smaller (∼63 kDa) than the major protein generated under the influence of the basic protein promoter (∼68 kDa) (Fig. 2).Figure 2Left panel, time course of radiolabeled TSH receptor extracellular domain protein in insect cells. Sf9 cells were infected for up to 4 days with recombinant baculovirus generated either with the pAcMP3 (late basic protein promoter) or pVL1393 (very late polyhedrin promoter) transfer vector. Both transfer vectors contained the same cDNA insert (TSHR-EX-6H) coding for the TSH receptor extracellular region with a 6-His tag at its carboxyl-terminal end. Infected cells were pulsed for 4 h with [35S]methionine. Urea extracts of intact cells were subjected to Ni-NTA affinity purification, and aliquots were electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Autoradiography was for ∼16 h. Right panel, comparison of the sizes of affinity-purified radiolabeled protein generated in Sf9 cells infected with the pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H and pVL1393-TSHR-EX-6H viruses. In this experiment, infections were for 1 and 2 days, respectively, prior to a 4-h pulse with [35S]methionine and extraction of intact cells with buffer containing 6 M urea (see “Materials and Methods”). Autoradiography was for 16 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Secretion of the TSH Receptor Extracellular Domain by Insect CellsAn extracellular protein that has traversed the secretory pathway is most likely to be correctly processed and folded. It was therefore important to determine whether the extracellular domain of the TSH receptor could be secreted by infected insect cells. For this purpose, Sf9 cells infected for 1-4 days were pulsed for 4 h with [35S]methionine. Medium harvested after a 16-h chase was subjected to affinity purification with Ni-NTA resin.Cells infected with virus generated with pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H did secrete recombinant protein into the culture medium, but only in very small amounts (Fig. 3). Autoradiograph exposures of weeks, rather than hours, were required for detection. A single protein of ∼68 kDa was present in the medium in maximal amounts after 1 day of infection, consistent with the time course of synthesis of cellular protein (Fig. 2). Mainly, degradation products were present in the medium 2-4 days post-infection. In contrast, no TSH receptor extracellular domain was detectable in the medium when insect cells were infected with baculovirus containing the polyhedrin promoter in the pVL1393-TSHR-EX-6H transfer vector (Fig. 3).Figure 3Secretion of the TSH receptor extracellular domain by insect cells. Sf9 cells were infected for 1-4 days with virus that had recombined with either the pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H or pVL1393-TSHR-EX-6H transfer vector. Cells were then pulsed for 4 h with [35S]methionine. Medium was harvested after a 16-h chase and subjected to affinity purification with Ni-NTA resin (see “Materials and Methods”). Aliquots of affinity-purified material were electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Autoradiography was for 3 weeks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Particulate and Cytosolic Distribution of the TSH Receptor Extracellular DomainThe very low level of secretion of TSH receptor extracellular domain protein by infected insect cells suggested that most of this protein was retained within the cells. Regardless of whether the pAcMP3- or pVL1393-derived virus was used, most of the affinity-purified, [35S]methionine-labeled TSH receptor protein was in the particulate fraction of the infected insect cells (Fig. 4). This material could not be solubilized with detergent (1% Triton X-100; data not shown). As seen with urea extracts of whole cells (Fig. 2), the major labeled protein obtained with the pAcMP3-derived virus (∼68 kDa) was larger than that obtained with the pVL1393-derived virus (∼63 kDa). Coomassie Blue staining of these proteins revealed a similar pattern (data not shown).Figure 4Particulate and cytosolic distribution of the TSH receptor extracellular domain in infected insect cells. Sf9 cells were infected with virus obtained by recombination with either the pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H or pVL1393-TSHR-EX-6H transfer vector. Infections were for 1 and 2 days, respectively. Cells were pulsed for 4 h with [35S]methionine, rinsed, and disrupted by freeze-thaw cycles (see “Materials and Methods”). The 100,000 × g supernatants and pellets were subjected to affinity purification with Ni-NTA resin, with elution in similar volumes (40 μl) (see “Materials and Methods”). Equal aliquots (∼18 μl) were electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. A, affinity-purified material from pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H-infected cells; B, affinity-purified material from pVL1393-TSHR-EX-6H-infected cells. In the middle lane, the particulate fraction was diluted 20-fold. Autoradiography in this representative experiment was for 2 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Enzymatic Deglycosylation of the TSH Receptor Extracellular DomainWe examined whether or not the different sizes of the TSH receptor extracellular domain generated in insect cells under the influence of the two different promoters (Fig. 2) could be explained by different degrees of glycosylation. This was indeed the case. Radiolabeled TSH receptor was affinity-purified with Ni-NTA resin and subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F (see “Material and Methods”). The proteins generated by both the pAcMP3- and pVL1393-derived viruses were reduced to the same size, ∼54 kDa (Fig. 5).Figure 5Enzymatic deglycosylation of the TSH receptor extracellular domain. Sf9 insect cells were infected with virus obtained by recombination with either the pAcMP3-TSHR-EX-6H or pVL1393-TSHR-EX-6H transfer vector. Infections were for 1 and 2 days, respectively. Cells were pulsed for 4 h with [35S]methionine, proteins were extracted from the intact cells with buffer containing 6 M urea, and specific proteins were purified with Ni-NTA resin (see “Materials and Methods”). Aliquots were treated with endoglycosidase F (Endo F) for 16 h (see “Materials and Methods”), followed by electrophoresis on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Autoradiography was for 4 days. Con, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional Activity of the TSH Receptor Extracellular Domain Generated in Insect CellsAlthough high levels of TSH receptor protein can be generated in insect cells under the influence of the very late polyhedrin promoter, this material is nonfunctional, or poorly functional, in terms of ligand and autoantibody binding (see above). Because of the greater extent of glycosylation of TSH receptor extracellular protein generated with the pAcMP3-derived virus, we tested the functional activity of this material. To generate larger amounts of unlabeled TSH receptor protein, we used High Five insect cells, which were more efficient in generating the protein than Sf9 cells (data not shown). Despite this greater efficiency, the yield with the pAcMP3 vector remained small. Typically, guanidine solubilization of 3 × 107 intact High Five cells yielded ∼20 μg of affinity-purified TSH receptor protein. Furthermore, the inability to remove urea from the eluting buffer without loss of solubility precluded testing the protein in a functional assay.We therefore tested for the presence of TSH receptor functional activity in affinity-purified soluble protein from the 100,000 × g supernatant of infected insect cells. Despite the fact that the yield of unlabeled TSH receptor extracellular domain was too low to quantitate, TSH binding activity was clearly observed in a standard radiolabeled TSH binding assay. Thus, the column eluate inhibited in a dose-dependent manner 125I-TSH binding to the wild-type TSH receptor expressed on the surface of CHO cells (Fig. 6). A 20-fold dilution of the eluate reduced TSH binding by ∼50%. Control affinity column buffer was without effect."
https://openalex.org/W2001382894,"Neurons engage in two distinct types of cell-cell interactions: they receive innervation and establish synapses on target tissues. Regulatory events that influence synapse formation and function on developing neurons are largely undefined. We show here that nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunit transcript levels are differentially regulated by innervation and target tissue interactions in developing chick ciliary ganglion neurons in situ. Using ganglia that have developed in the absence of pre- or postganglionic tissues and quantitative RT-PCR, we demonstrate that alpha 3 and beta 4 transcript levels are increased by innervation and target tissue interactions. In contrast, alpha 5 transcript levels are increased by innervation, but target tissues have little effect. Whole-cell ACh-induced currents, used to estimate the number of functional AChRs, change in correlation with alpha 3 and beta 4, but not alpha 5, transcript levels. A model is proposed in which the changes in AChR subunit expression regulate levels of synaptic activity, which is a critical determinant of synapse stabilization and elimination, and neuronal cell death."

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role for NCp7 in both genomic RNA packaging and reverse transcription. Furthermore, NCp7 was also shown to bind to strong stop cDNA and promote the annealing of this cDNA to the 3′ end of the genomic RNA (10Lapadat-Tapolsky M. De Rocquigny H. Van Gent D. Roques B. Plasterk R. Darlix J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Finally, NCp7 was reported to possess nucleic acid unwinding (11Khan R. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol.

Clearly all NCp7 activities rely on interactions with nucleic acids. Hence, to further understand the biochemical basis of NCp7 biological functions, it was critical to investigate the first step of these interactions, the binding step. Most reports suggest that nucleocapsid proteins (NC) bind preferentially to single-stranded RNAs(13Leis J. Jentoft J. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 361-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Karpel R.L.

In contrast, NCp7 has been specifically cross-linked to an U-track in the genomic RNA 5′ end (7Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol.

Moreover, NCp7 was shown to interact with both the heterologous tRNAphe(4Summers M.F. Henderson L.E. Chance M.R. Bess Jr., J.W. South T.L. Blake P.R. Sagi I. Perez-Alvarado G. Sowder III, R.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6689-6695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a strong Mg2+-dependent way, but the binding parameters have not been reported. Finally, peptides corresponding to the amino-acid sequences of the two isolated zinc fingers have also been reported to bind to tRNAphe but with marginal affinity (21Mély Y. Piémont E. Sorinas-Jimeno M. De Rocquigny H. Jullian N. Morellet N. Roques B.P. Gérard D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1513-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this context, to further delineate NCp7 functions, the binding parameters of the zinc-saturated 72-amino acid synthetic NCp7 to tRNA3Lys were investigated in various NaCl and MgCl2 conditions. Moreover to assess the importance of the sequence and the three-dimensional structure of tRNA3Lys in the binding process, we investigated the binding parameters of NCp7 to two modified forms of tRNALys, the heterologous tRNAphe and the structurally unrelated RNA 5 S from Escherichia coli. Finally, performing experiments at low protein concentrations, we tested the existence of a putative high affinity binding site in the anticodon domain. Solid phase synthesis of the 72-amino acid NCp7 protein (Fig. 1) was carried out as described previously (22De Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Darlix J.-L. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To preserve the highly oxidizable cysteine residues (purity >99%), the lyophilized peptides were dissolved in freshly degassed buffer and poured immediately into anaerobic quartz cells, which maintain an inert argon atmosphere. In all experiments, zinc was added to the protein in a 2.5 molar ratio. An extinction coefficient of 12,700 M−1 cm−1 at 280 nm was used to determine the protein concentration. Natural tRNA3Lys with sequence identical to that of human tRNA3Lys was prepared and purified from beef liver(23Keith G. Pixa G. Fix C. Dirheimer G. Biochimie. 1983; 65: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Dethiolated tRNA3Lys (dStRNA3Lys) and a tRNA3Lys lacking modified nucleotides (utRNA3Lys) were obtained as described previously(24Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25269-25272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). tRNAphe from brewers' yeast was purchased from Sigma. All RNAs were checked for purity and integrity on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Extinction coefficients at 260 nm of 6.25 × 105M−1 cm−1 and 9.6 × 105M−1 cm−1 were used to determine the concentration of the various tRNA and RNA 5 S, respectively. Titrations of NCp7 with the various nucleic acids were performed while monitoring the quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of NCp7 in an SLM 48000 spectrofluorometer. Excitation wavelength was set at either 280 or 295 nm, and emission wavelength was set at 350 nm. The temperature was controlled at 20.0 ± 0.5°C, and the fluorescence intensities were corrected for dilution, buffer fluorescence, and screening effects by added nucleic acids(25Hélène C. Brun F. Yaniv M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 58: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The absence of light scattering due to high molecular weight aggregate formation during titration was systematically checked by comparing the measured absorbances at 260 and 280 nm with the calculated ones using the extinction coefficients of NCp7 and the nucleic acid at these wavelengths. The general method of analysis of Bujalowski and Lohman (26Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was used to determine rather than assume the relationship between the fluorescence quenching and the fraction of bound protein from a titration of NCp7 with RNA. Let Lt be the total protein concentration and Dt be the total nucleotide concentration for which we measure the fluorescence quenching Qobs = (I0 - I)/I0, where I0 and I correspond to NCp7 fluorescence intensities in the absence and in the presence of Dt, respectively. This method uses the fact that, at equilibrium, the value of the quantity Qobs (Lt/Dt) is dependent only upon the binding density ν = Lb/Dt (mol of bound protein/mol of nucleotide). As a result, when several titrations are performed at different protein concentrations and the data are plotted as Qobs (Lt/Dt) versusDt, then for all titrations, ν and the free protein concentration, Lf are constant at a given value of Qobs (Lt/Dt). From the set of Lt and Dt values, determined from each titration at a given Qobs (Lt/Dt), one can deduce Lf and ν from a plot of LtversusDt by using the relationship Lt = Lf+ν•Dt. Repeating this at a number of values of Qobs (Lt/Dt) yields ν as a function of Lf from which the concentration of bound protein Lb = ν•Dt can be calculated. Finally, Qobs is plotted versusLb/Lt (Fig. 2) to prove the proportionality between these two quantities. The plot of QobsversusLb/Lt also allows one to straightforwardly determine the maximum extent of fluorescence quenching Qmax when all NCp7 proteins are bound to RNA, from a linear extrapolation to Lb/Lt = 1. To determine the NCp7-RNA binding parameters, the intrinsic fluorescence quenching, Qobs, of a fixed concentration, Lt, of NCp7 was monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations, Dt, of nucleotides. An example of such a titration is given in Fig. 3A. Once it has been rigorously proven that Lb/Lt is directly proportional to Qobs, then one can simply calculate the concentration of bound and free protein, Lb and Lf, respectively, using Equation 1 and 2. Lb=Lt(Qobs/Qmax)(Eq. 1) Lf=Lt−Lb(Eq. 2) The binding site size, n, the observed affinity, Kobs, and the cooperativity parameter, ω, were then recovered using the equations of McGhee and von Hippel (27McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar) for noncooperative ν/Lf=Kobs(1−nν)n/[1−(n−1)v]n−1(Eq. 3) or cooperative binding ν/Lf=Kobs⋅(1−nν)⋅{[(2ω−1)(1−nν)+ν−R]n−1/[2(ω−1)(1−nν)]n−1}⋅{[1−(n+1)ν+R]2/[2(1−nν)]2}(Eq. 4) with R = {[1 - (n + 1)ν]2+ 4ων(1 - nν)}1/2. Nonlinear least-squares fit of these equations to experimental data was performed using the algorithm of Kowalczykowski et al. (28). In the noncooperative model, all the parameters (n, Kobs, and Qmax) were allowed to vary. In the cooperative model, Qmax was fixed, whereas n,Kobs, and ω were allowed to vary. The ion and pH dependence of Kobs in the presence of an excess of monovalent (M+, X-) or divalent (M2+, 2X-) salt, at constant temperature and pressure, may be written as log⁡Kobs=log⁡KT(M)−rlog((1+KH[H+])/KH[H+]}−alog(1+KX[X−])−m′ΨMlog[M](Eq. 5) where KT(M) is the thermodynamic association constant in the presence of cation M, r is the number of independent and identical sites, with a binding constant KH, on the protein that must be protonated as a prerequisite for binding, a is the number of independent and identical binding sites for anions with a binding constant KX, m′ is the number of ion pairs between protein and nucleic acid, and ψM is the fraction of cation M thermodynamically bound per phosphate group(29de Haseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4783-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To analyze the ion dependence of Kobs at constant pH, is differentiated with respect to log [M]. (δlog⁡Kobs/δlog[M])=−(m′ΨM+aKX[X−]/(1+KX[X−]))(Eq. 6) Salt-reversal of the binding of the protein to an excess of nucleic acid was monitored by following the protein fluorescence increase brought about by the addition of a concentrated solution of either NaCl, CH3COONa or MgCl2. Assuming that n and ω were constant, the Kobs values were calculated from or for each salt concentration. Then, reporting Kobsversus [M] in a log-log plot (30Record Jr., M.T. Lohman T.M. de Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 31Record Jr., M.T. Anderson C.F. Lohman T.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 103-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar) allows one to determine the parameters m′, a and KX from. Similarly, to analyze the pH dependence of Kobs at a given salt concentration, is differentiated with respect to pH. δlog⁡Kobs/δpH=−{r/(1+KH[H+])}(Eq. 7) Hence, increasing amounts of either diluted HCl or NaOH were added to NCp7 in the presence of an excess of nucleic acid. The Kobs values for each pH value were calculated as in the salt-reversal experiments and then reported versus pH in a semi-log plot to recover r and KH. To characterize the putative high affinity binding site, the titration curves were performed in the classical “forward” sense by adding increasing protein concentrations to a fixed nucleic acid amount. As the signal originates from the protein, similar amounts of protein were added in parallel to a blank without nucleic acid. As protein concentrations used in these experiments were very low, adhesion of the protein to the quartz cells was suspected to be no more negligible. Experiments were thus performed either in the absence or in the presence of 0.04% polyethylene glycol 20000 (Merck) as described in the case of Moloney murine leukemia virus NC(14Karpel R.L. Henderson L.E. Oroszlan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4961-4967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of tRNA3Lys to NCp7 induced a very large fluorescence decrease. Irrespective of the initial protein concentration, the residual fluorescence of NCp7 at the highest concentrations of tRNA3Lys added was less than 15% (Fig. 3A), suggesting that both Trp residues (at positions 37 and 61) were largely quenched in the protein-tRNA3Lys complex. To straightforwardly analyze this fluorescence quenching in terms of fraction of bound protein, the linearity of the relationship between these two quantities was rigorously assessed according to the general method of Bujalowski and Lohman (26Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”). As reported for NCp7•poly(A) complexes(12Dib-Hajj F. Khan R. Giedroc D.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), a critical problem was the appearance of aggregates during titration due to the formation of high molecular weight complexes. This aggregation was found to be basically dependent on the protein concentration and could be avoided if protein concentrations lower than 1.5 × 10−6M were used. In these conditions, the relationship between Qobs and Lb/Lt (Fig. 2) was clearly linear and thus the binding parameters could be confidently deduced from a titration at a single protein concentration. Moreover, a linear extrapolation to Lb/Lt = 1 allowed one to straightforwardly determine a 0.87 (±0.02) value of the maximum extent of fluorescence quenching, Qmax, when all NCp7 proteins are bound to tRNA. The binding experiments were performed in 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5 and 0.1 M NaCl. Mg2+ was omitted in a first step since the simultaneous presence of both Mg2+ and Na+ largely complicated the thermodynamic analysis(32Record Jr., M.T. de Haseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4791-4796Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A typical titration of NCp7 with tRNA3Lys is seen in Fig. 3A. Analysis of these data according to and yielded the binding parameters given in Table 1. The binding was noncooperative, and Qmax was in very good keeping with the value obtained from Fig. 2.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The binding site size could be independently confirmed using the intersection of the tangential to the low [tRNA3Lys]/[NCp7] ratios (where the binding is approximately stoichiometric) with the straight line Qobs/Qmax = 1 in Fig. 3B. The intersection is about 8 (±1) in good keeping with the calculated value. To provide further molecular information about the binding process, the pH and ion concentration dependence of Kobs was investigated. The addition of concentrated NaCl or CH3COONa to NCp7•tRNA3Lys complexes brought about a partial reversal of the protein fluorescence quenching, suggesting that the complex formation partly depends on ionic interaction (Fig. 4A). Assuming that the binding site size does not change with the salt concentration, the Kobs value for each salt concentration was recovered from and was reported versus salt concentration in a log-log plot (Fig. 4B). A linear decrease of logKobs in a rather large range of Na+ concentrations was observed for both NaCl or CH3COONa suggesting from that for both anions, KX[X-]≫1, and thus reduced to (δlog⁡Kobs/δlog[Na+])=−(m′ΨNa++α)(Eq. 8) Despite a significant shift toward higher cation concentration in the case of acetate, the slope was identical for both anions. To further delineate the contribution of anion binding, a salt-back titration was performed in the presence of MgCl2 only. As expected, Mg2+ competed more efficiently than Na+ (Fig. 4, A and B) with NCp7 binding to tRNA3Lys and thus shifted the range of Cl- concentrations to substantially lower concentrations. Despite this shift, the slope ratio, (δlogKobs/δlog[Mg2+])/(δlogKobs/δlog[Na2+]), was in keeping with the ψMg2+/ψNa+ ratio, suggesting that the number, a, of anions released was close to zero. The number of ion pairs, m′, between NCp7 and tRNAkys3 could thus be easily deduced from Equation 8 (Table I) assuming that ψNa+ = 0.71 and ψMg2+ = 0.43 as for single-stranded DNA (30). The pH dependence of Kobs at 0.1 M NaCl was then investigated to provide molecular information about the number of sites, r, with a binding constant, KH, on the protein that must be protonated as a prerequisite for binding. Clearly no pH dependence could be observed for Kobs in the pH 5.5-9 range (Fig. 5) suggesting from that either r = 0 or KH > 1010M−1. Thus at pH 7.5, reduced to log⁡Kobs=log⁡KT(M)−m′ΨMlog[M](Eq. 9) and thus logKT(M) corresponded to the intercept of Fig. 4B at 1 M cation M. The KT(Na+) and KT(Mg2+) values were consistent according to the relationship(29de Haseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4783-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) : logKT(Na+) = logKT(Mg2+) + (m′/2)logKMg,T using a thermodynamic binding constant of Mg2+ for tRNALys, logKMg,T = 0.5, close to that observed for DNA (29de Haseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4783-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). As a final check of the consistency of our preceding conclusions, a salt-back titration was performed with MgCl2 in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl. According to Record et al.(32Record Jr., M.T. de Haseth P.L. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4791-4796Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and our previous conclusions, the following equation should apply log⁡Kobs=log⁡KT(Na+)−m′{ΨNa+log[Na+]+log⁡1/2[1+1+4KMgobs[Mg2+]]}(Eq. 10) with logKMg,obs = logKMg,T - 2ψNa+ log [Na+]. Thus a plot of logKobsversusf([MgCl2]) = -(ψNa+ log [Na+] + log1/2[1 + (1 + 4KMg,obs[Mg2+])1/2]) should give a straight line with a slope, m′, and a y axis intercept, logKT(Na+). This was clearly the case (Fig. 4C), and both m′ and logKT(Na+) were in good agreement with the values of Table 1. Since the modified and hypermodified nucleosides of tRNAs are well known to be critical in numerous biological properties of tRNAs, we checked their influence in the binding process by investigating the binding parameters of NCp7 for dethiolated natural tRNA3Lys (dStRNA3Lys) and unmodified synthetic tRNA3Lys (utRNA3Lys). For both dStRNA3Lys and utRNA3Lys, the maximum extent of fluorescence quenching and the binding parameters were largely similar to those of tRNA3Lys (Table 1). The only noticeable difference was a 2-fold affinity decrease for utRNA versus tRNA3Lys. Unfortunately, salt-reversal experiments were not accurate enough to pinpoint the origin of this slight difference. Thus our data suggested that the modified bases were not critical in the NCp7•tRNA3Lys binding process. To check if there was any influence of the primary structure at all, the binding of NCp7 to the heterologous yeast tRNAphe was investigated (Table 1). The maximum extent of fluorescence quenching of NCp7 was clearly independent of the tRNA nature. In contrast, both the binding site size and the affinity for tRNAphe were slightly reduced. These moderate differences with tRNA3Lys were significant as the binding experiments were repeated more than 10 times with protein concentrations ranging from 4.10−7 to 1.2. 10−6M. Salt-reversal titrations suggested that the differences in Kobs were primarily related to differences in Kobs (1 M) and thus on nonelectrostatic interactions. Finally, to check the influence of the RNA tertiary structure on the binding process, we investigated the binding of NCp7 to RNA 5 S from E. coli, which differed from tRNA3Lys in both primary and tertiary structures (33Brunel C. Romby P. Westhof E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The binding site size for RNA 5 S was similar to the tRNA3Lys one, but the affinity was about 4 times lower due essentially to differences in the number of ion pairs formed and thus to electrostatic interactions. To further validate the comparison between tRNA3Lys and tRNAphe binding to NCp7, we investigated the binding parameters of NCp7 for both tRNAs at various NaCl concentrations in the absence or in the presence of Mg2+. To increase the validity of this investigation, the binding parameters were directly obtained from titration curves (like those in Fig. 3A) rather than simply from salt-reversal experiments. In doing so, we were able to determine not only Kobs but also the binding site size and the cooperativity parameter. Moreover, as a control, we checked that the protein fluorescence was unaffected by NaCl or MgCl2 in the concentration range used. The results, collected in Table 2 for tRNA3Lys and Table 3 for tRNAphe were largely similar. For both tRNAs, the binding site size was constant over the NaCl and MgCl2 concentrations investigated, whereas, in contrast, the cooperativity parameter was not, since a moderate cooperativity appeared at high concentrations of MgCl2 (≥10 mM) in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl or at high concentrations of NaCl (≥0.3 M). As Kobs and ω were highly correlated, the product Kobs×ω was preferred to Kobs to compare the binding affinities of both tRNAs. The (Kobs×ω)Lys/(Kobs×ω)phe ratio was always between 0.25 and 6 (Table 3), suggesting that whatever the NaCl or MgCl2 concentrations used, no large preferential binding of NCp7 to tRNALysversus tRNAphe could be achieved.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab As cross-linking experiments suggested the existence of a single high affinity binding site located in the anticodon domain of tRNA3Lys(20Barat C. Schatz O. Le Grice S. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), experiments were performed to test the existence of such a site. To this end, we assumed that this putative site, of size n, binds NCp7 according to a classical Scatchard equation; ν2 = [Lb1]/[Nst] = K2Lf/(1 + K2Lf), where [Lb1] is the concentration of protein bound to this site, [Nst] is the concentration of the high affinity site and thus of tRNA3Lys, Lf is the concentration of free protein, and K2 is the association binding constant. The other nucleotides of tRNA3Lys were assumed to bind to NCp7 independently and nonspecifically with an association binding constant, K1, according to. As the anticodon domain is approximately located in the middle of the tRNA3Lys sequence, the nonspecific binding sequences on both sides were of similar length. If effects of finite lattice length are neglected, it can be easily demonstrated that this is equivalent to a unique lattice of length N - n, where N is the total number of nucleotides of tRNA3Lys. At the protein concentrations used in the former sections of this paper, theoretical binding curves indicated that the modifications in the binding curves induced by the presence of a single strong binding site (even with a K2/K1 ratio of 106) were below experimental uncertainty (Fig. 3A). Thus the affinities measured in these conditions were clearly those of the nonspecific binding sites. To magnify the putative strong-binding site, lower protein concentrations were needed. Unfortunately, fluorescence was then low and furthermore the low-bindin"

In both KA and KC mutant embryos, specific growth cones exhibit dosage-dependent stalls in axon extension and errors in axon guidance, including both defects in fasciculation and abnormal crossings of the midline.

Other neural tube cells are thought to contribute only to structures within the CNS. In contrast to this idea, we report a second wave of migration of cells away from the spinal cord occurring after the emigration of crest cells is complete. Neuroepithelial cells from spinal cords in E5 chicken embryos migrate into the periphery and differentiate into neurons and satellite cells within sensory ganglia and into melanocytes in skin and feathers. These results show that some cell types previously considered to be the descendants exclusively of neural crest cells are also derived from neuroepithelial cells in the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2045658250,"Two distinct mechanisms have been previously identified for the transport of proteins across the chloroplast thylakoid membrane, one of which is unusual in that neither soluble factors nor ATP are required; the system requires only the transthylakoidal ΔpH. We have examined this mechanism by studying the properties of one of its substrates: the extrinsic 23-kDa protein (23K) of photosystem II. Previous work has shown that this protein can be transported into isolated thylakoids as the full-length precursor protein; we show that the stromal import intermediate form of this protein is similarly translocation-competent. Gel filtration tests indicate that the stromal intermediate is probably monomeric. Protease sensitivity tests on both the initial in vitro translation product and the stromal import intermediate show that the presequence is highly susceptible to digestion whereas the mature protein is resistant to high concentrations of trypsin. The mature protein becomes very sensitive to digestion if unfolded in urea, or after heating, and we therefore propose that the natural substrate for this translocation system consists of a relatively unfolded presequence together with a tightly folded passenger protein. The ability of thylakoids to import pre-23K is destroyed by prior treatment of the thylakoids with low concentrations of trypsin, demonstrating the involvement of surface-exposed proteins in the import process. However, we can find no evidence for the binding of pre-23K or i23K to the thylakoid surface, and we therefore propose that the initial interaction of these substrates with the thylakoidal translocase is weak, reversible, and probably ΔpH-independent. In the second phase of the translocation mechanism, the ΔpH drives either the translocation and unfolding of proteins, or the translocation of a fully folded protein.

However, we can find no evidence for the binding of pre-23K or i23K to the thylakoid surface, and we therefore propose that the initial interaction of these substrates with the thylakoidal translocase is weak, reversible, and probably ΔpH-independent. In the second phase of the translocation mechanism, the ΔpH drives either the translocation and unfolding of proteins, or the translocation of a fully folded protein."

Likewise, rhythmic calcium fluctuations within dendrites and axons were seen during ""fictive swimming"" and were directly correlated with electrical activity.

https://openalex.org/W2051155591,"The effect of profilin, a G-actin binding protein, on the mechanism of exchange of the tightly bound metal ion and nucleotide on G-actin, has been investigated. 1) In low ionic strength buffer, profilin increases the rates of Ca2+ and Mg2+ dissociation from G-actin 250- and 50-fold, respectively. On the profilin-actin complex as well as on G-actin alone, nucleotide exchange is dependent on the concentration of divalent metal ion and is kinetically limited, at low concentration of metal ion, by the dissociation of the metal ion. 2) Under physiological ionic conditions, nucleotide exchange on G-actin is 1 order of magnitude faster than at low ionic strength.

The dependences of the exchange rates on profilin concentration are consistent with a high affinity (5 × 106 to 107M−1) of profilin for ATP-G-actin, and a 20-fold lower affinity for ADP-Gactin.

Monomeric actin (G-actin) tightly binds a nucleotide (ATP or ADP) in complex with a divalent metal ion (Ca2+ or Mg2+). The metal-ATP is bound as a β,γ-bidentate chelate in the Λ-configuration(1Valentin-Ranc C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20871-20880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kabsch, W., Mannherz, H. G., Suck, D., Pai, E. F., Holmes, K. C., Nature, 347, 37–44Google Scholar, 3McLaughlin P.J.

Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar); conversely, the metal-ADP is bound as a βmonodentate. The interaction between bound nucleotide and metal ion is responsible for the long-recognized regulation of the binding of nucleotide to G-actin by divalent metal ions (see Refs. 5 and 6, for review). Kinetic data of metal ion and nucleotide exchange on G-actin are consistent with Fig. SI, according to which dissociation of the tightly bound divalent cation (M) is kinetically limiting for nucleotide(N) dissociation and binding of the divalent metal ion to actin (A) increases the affinity of nucleotide by 4-6 orders of magnitude. Recent extensive kinetic analysis of Ca2+ or Mg2+ dependences of the rates of nucleotide exchange in low ionic strength buffer (6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have brought full confirmation for the validity of this scheme with either ATP or ADP as bound nucleotide. The ratio of the dissociation rate constants for M2+ (k12) and MN (k13) is 30 for CaATP, but only about 2 for MgATP, which indicates that the kinetics of nucleotide exchange are much less affected by Mg2+ ion than by Ca2+ ion. Under all conditions, ADP dissociates from G-actin about 10-fold faster than ATP (6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that all nucleotide exchange measurements have been thoroughly performed only at low ionic strength; available scattered evidence indicates that rates of exchange are about 1 order of magnitude higher under physiological ionic conditions(7Carlier M.-F. Jean C. Rieger K.-J. Lenfant M. Pantaloni D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5034-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Whether nucleotide exchange on G-actin, which partly regulates the ATP-G-actin:ADP-G-actin ratio, is important in the regulation of actin assembly in living cells, is not known. Many G-actin binding proteins are known to influence the rate of nucleotide exchange on G-actin. Cofilin(8Nishida E.

This property of profilin is corroborated by the observed 5° rotation of the two domains of the G-actin molecule crystallized in complex with profilin(4Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C.W. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). A model was proposed (9Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Furman M.I. Wachsstock D. Safer D.

Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 219-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) according to which profilin would catalyze the formation of polymerizable ATP-G-actin off a pool of ADP-G-actin maintained unpolymerizable by interaction with thymosin β4. However, experimental evidence thus far does not support this model, since thymosin β4, a major G-actin sequestering agent in vertebrates(14Safer D. Elzinga M. Nachmias V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4029-4032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nachmias V.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), has been shown to bind ATP-G-actin with high selectivity over ADP-G-actin(7Carlier M.-F. Jean C. Rieger K.-J. Lenfant M. Pantaloni D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5034-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Hence in vivo Tβ4 essentially sequesters ATP-G-actin, which inevitably increases the overall ratio of ATP/ADP bound to G-actin, and prevents the formation of ADP-G-actin under conditions leading to ATP depletion in cells. On the other hand, it has been shown that the ability of profilin to promote actin assembly in the presence of a pool of sequestered actin (16Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) was a consequence of the reported(17Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) participation of the profilin-actin complex to filament elongation at the barbed ends. In this process, the free energy of ATP hydrolysis associated to actin assembly is used by profilin to facilitate its dissociation from the barbed end following incorporation of an actin subunit(16Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Hence profilin might bind less well to an F-ADP than to an F-ADP-Pi end, or profilin could accelerate Pi release from an F-ADP-Pi end. To definitely assess whether the property of profilin to accelerate nucleotide exchange on G-actin is relevant in profilin function in living cells, it is necessary to provide a quantitative description of the mechanism of metal-nucleotide exchange on profilin-actin under physiological conditions. We have measured the change in affinity and in the kinetics of metal ion and nucleotide exchange on G-actin as a function of profilin concentration, at low ionic strength and in physiological ionic conditions. The results show that the effect of profilin on nucleotide binding to actin cannot account for the function of profilin in actin assembly.

Actin was purified from rabbit muscle (19Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated as CaATP-G-actin by Sephadex G-200 chromatography (20McLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) in standard G buffer (5 mM Tris-Cl-, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.2 mM DTT, 0.01% NaN3). Profilin was purified from bovine spleen as described previously (21Perelroizen I. Marchand J.-B. Blanchoin L. Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8472-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and stored on ice at 200-300 μM in 5 mM Tris-Cl-, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT. The concentrations of G-actin and profilin were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients of 0.617 mg−1 cm2 at 290 nm for G-actin (22Gordon D.J. Boyer J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8300-8309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 15,000 M−1 cm−1 at 277 nm for profilin(23Tseng P.C.-H. Runge M.S. Cooper J.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ca∊ATP-G-actin was prepared as follows. The CaATP-G-actin complex (∼30 μM) freed of unbound ATP by Dowex 1 treatment was incubated overnight on ice in the presence of 0.25 mM ∊ATP. About 80-90% of free nucleotide was removed by one rapid Dowex 1 treatment (0.2 ml of a 50% Dowex 1 suspension/ml of actin solution). The slurry (∼1-1.5 ml) was immediately filtered onto a Millipore (0.22 μm) filter and loaded on a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in G buffer containing the desired amounts of CaCl2 and ∊ATP (5-100 μM, as indicated in text). MgATP-G-actin was prepared as described (24Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10785-10792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by simultaneous addition of 0.2 mM EGTA and 50 μM MgCl2 to a solution of G-actin (≤20 μM) in standard G buffer. After 3 min incubation, the MgATP-actin solution was equilibrated by gel filtration (PD-10) at 0°C in G buffer containing no CaCl2, 25 μM EGTA, and the desired concentrations of MgCl2 and ATP. The concentration of MgCl2 in buffer was at most 10 μM in excess of ATP, to avoid formation of actin oligomers(25Attri A.K. Lewis M.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6815-6824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MgADP-G-actin and Mg∊ADP-G-actin were prepared as described previously(26Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9983-9986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Static fluorescence measurements or slow kinetics were carried out at 20°C using a Spex Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorimeter. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 350 and 410 nm, respectively, for ∊ATP, 340 and 500 nm for Quin2, 295 and 330 nm for tryptophan. Small square quartz cells (3-mm light path) were used to minimize the inner filter effect, which nevertheless was taken into account and corrected at high concentration (≥100 μM) of Quin2, by performing titration curves of fluorescence change versus [Ca2+]tot at different concentrations of Quin2. The kinetics of metal ion or nucleotide exchange on G-actin were carried out using a stopped-flow apparatus (DX.17 MV, Applied Photophysics) operated either in absorbance or fluorescence mode. The instrument was thermostatted at 20°C. The excitation slit was 1 mm in absorbance mode, and 0.5 mm in fluorescence mode. The dead time of the instrument was 0.8 ms. The rate of Ca2+ dissociation from CaATP-G-actin in the presence of different amounts of profilin was monitored using the change in absorbance at 254 nm due to the formation of the BAPTA-Ca complex(27Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). It was checked that the reaction of 50 μM BAPTA with Ca2+, at concentrations as low as 0.25 μM, was complete within the stopped-flow dead time. The specific absorbance change of BAPTA was 0.010 cm−1μM−1. The experiment was conducted as follows. The two solutions containing the reagents to be mixed were placed in drive syringes A and B. Syringe A contained CaATP-G-actin (5-12 μM, equilibrated in G buffer containing 20 μM ATP and 5 μM CaCl2) and variable amounts of profilin in the range 0 to 30 μM. Syringe B contained 120 μM BAPTA and 20 μM MgCl2 in 5 mM Tris-Cl-, pH 7.6, buffer. Identical volumes of A and B were mixed. The rate of Mg2+ dissociation from MgATP-G-actin in the presence of profilin was monitored spectrophotometrically using the change in fluorescence of 8OH-Q upon reaction with Mg2+ as described(28Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4952-4957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was 327 nm, and a 430-nm cut off filter was placed on the emission beam. The rate of ∊ATP dissociation from G-actin in the presence of profilin was monitored by fluorescence. A KV 380 Schott cut-off filter was placed on the emission beam. Syringe A contained Ca∊ATP-G-actin (2-5 μM) in G buffer containing 10 μM ∊ATP and CaCl2 as indicated. Syringe B contained 100-400 μM ATP in 5 mM Tris-Cl-, pH 8.0. The final free Ca2+ ion concentration was calculated taking into account the formation of the CaATP complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 5 μM(29Frieden C. Patane K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3812-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The rate of ∊ATP dissociation from Mg∊ATP-G-actin was studied in a similar fashion as follows. A stock solution of Ca∊ATP-G-actin was prepared at 20-30 μM in 5 mM Tris, 0.2 mM DTT, 5 μM CaCl2, 5 μM ∊ATP, pH 8.0. At time 0, actin was diluted to 1.5 μM (1 ml) in a buffer containing 5 mM Tris, 0.2 mM DTT, 100 μM EGTA, 20 μM MgCl2, 10 μM ∊ATP, pH 8.0, and a given amount of profilin. After 2 min incubation for calcium-magnesium exchange, this solution was placed in syringe A of the stopped-flow. Syringe B contained 5 mM Tris, 0.2 mM DTT, 100 μM EGTA, 20 μM MgCl2 (or as indicated), and 200-2000 μM ATP, pH 8.0. When physiological ionic conditions were investigated, syringe B (ATP chase) also contained 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 M KCl, and the same amounts of MgCl2 and KCl were added, from a [4 M KCl, 40 mM MgCl2] stock solution, to the Mg∊ATP-G-actin-profilin sample immediately prior to filling the drive syringe A. For each (profilin + Mg∊ATP-G-actin) sample, 4 to 6 shots were performed, the traces were checked to be superimposable, averaged, and analyzed within monoexponentials using the software attached to the DX.17 MV instrument. The rate of Mg∊ADP dissociation from G-actin in the presence of profilin was investigated in a similar fashion. Mg∊ADP-G-actin was in the presence of 20 μM ∊ADP in syringe A, and ADP (200 μM) was present in syringe B. The analysis of the kinetics and amplitude of either metal ion or nucleotide exchange routinely revealed the existence of a small proportion (10-25%) of the G-actin molecules which did not bind profilin, presumably due to oxidation of Cys-374(31Malm B. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This part of the population exchanged metal ion and nucleotide at the slow rate specific of G-actin alone, at all concentrations of profilin. All data shown in this article concern the 75-90% proportion of actin which truly binds profilin. It should be noted that since most kinetic experiments of metal-nucleotide exchange on G-actin in the presence of profilin were carried out in the stopped-flow, the pH was chosen to be 7.5-8.0 in most cases, because the rates of divalent metal ion and nucleotide are known to be about 1 order of magnitude faster at pH 8.0 than at pH 7.0 (30Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochemistrry. 1988; 27: 7759-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which made experiments technically more convenient at 0 or low amounts of profilin. Additional controls showed that the main conclusions concerning the effect of profilin on the rate constants apply at pH 7.0 too, with lower rate constants. The time course of Ca2+ dissociation from G-actin was monitored by the change in BAPTA absorbance using the stopped-flow. In the absence of profilin, the release of Ca2+ upon simultaneous addition of Mg2+ and BAPTA was a simple exponential process, with rate constant k−Ca = 0.087 ± 0.005 s−1 at pH 8.0 and 20°C, in satisfactory agreement with published values (6Kinosian H.J.

Furman M.I. Wachsstock D. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 34Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Gershman L.C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). At saturation by profilin, a higher limit rate constant of 19 ± 2 s−1 was obtained (Fig. 1), which corresponded to the rate constant k′−Ca for dissociation of Ca2+ from the profilin-actin complex. The rate of Ca2+ dissociation from G-actin is known to depend on pH(28Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4952-4957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Frieden C. Patane K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3812-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This dependence was also observed on the profilin-actin complex. Typically the rate constants k−Ca and k′−Ca were 0.05 s−1 and 12 s−1 at pH 7.5, and 0.04 s−1 and 10 s−1 at pH 7.0. Hence at all pH values profilin accelerated 250-fold the release of Ca2+ from G-actin. However, the process was truly first order only in the absence and presence of saturating amounts of profilin. In the concentration range where profilin partially saturated G-actin, the dissociation process of Ca2+ was not very well fitted by a single exponential and appeared biphasic, as can be seen in Fig. 1; in addition, the profilin concentration dependence of the reciprocal of t1/2 was not a simple Michaelian titration curve, rather it exhibited a strongly sigmoidal behavior, displayed in Fig. 2. These results indicate that one cannot consider that profilin is in rapid equilibrium with G-actin, in which case the release of Ca2+ would be a monoexponential process of rate constant. kobs=Kpk−Ca+[P]k′−Ca[P]+Kp(Eq. 1) The middle curve is calculated within Fig. SIIwith k−Ca = 0.08 s−1, k′−Ca = 19 s−1, k+−p = 45 μM−1 s−1, k−p = 15 s−1. The rightmost curve (thick line) is calculated within Fig. SIII using the same values as above of all rate constants and ki = 0.5 s−1. Different values of ki could be found that would better fit each time course separately, however, the value of 0.5 s−1 provides the best global fit to all time courses. In, KP represents the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding profilin to G-actin, [P] the free profilin concentration, and k−Ca and k′−Ca the rate constants for Ca2+ dissociation from actin and profilin-actin, respectively. In the present case, the rate constants for profilin association to and dissociation from G-actin are known to be 45 μM−1 s−1 and 10 ± 3 s−1, respectively(21Perelroizen I. Marchand J.-B. Blanchoin L. Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8472-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), so that the overall association-dissociation rates are not very fast as compared to the rates of Ca2+ dissociation from profilin-actin; in particular at low saturation levels of G-actin by profilin, the shuttling process of profilin from one actin monomer to the other limits the rate of Ca2+ release. The above kinetic Fig. SII(subscript P represents profilin) was suggested by the data. The kinetics of Ca2+ dissociation from actin in the presence of profilin, upon addition of BAPTA + Mg2+ were simulated according to the above scheme using KINSIM 2KINSIM software versions were kindly supplied to us by C. Frieden and T. Pollard. with values of rate constants k+P and k-P experimentally determined in our previous work (21Perelroizen I. Marchand J.-B. Blanchoin L. Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8472-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and values of k−Ca and k′−Ca measured in the present work. The simulated exchange kinetics did show a biphasic appearance in the presence of profilin, and the reciprocal of t1/2 of simulated time courses varied in a sigmoidal fashion with profilin concentration, however, the resulting curve did not fit experimental data satisfactorily (Fig. 1, thin curve). Comparison with the data indicates that at substoichiometric amounts of profilin, the shuttling of profilin from one actin molecule to the other is slower than expected within Fig. SII. Using lower values of k-P yielded a plot of simulated values of 1/t1/2 which was more steeply cooperative than the latter (with k-P = 10 s−1) but did not fit the data either. A better fit to the data was obtained by introducing a supplementary slow step (ki) in the recycling of profilin, as described in Fig. SIII (subscript P represents profilin). Fig. 2 shows that the fit was improved by setting ki < 2.5 s−1. The slow step (ki) may be either the slow binding of Mg2+ ions to the profilin-actin complex following dissociation of Ca2+, or the isomerization of profilin-actin before or after Mg2+ binding. It is well established that at low Ca2+ concentration the dissociation of Ca2+ is rate-limiting in nucleotide dissociation from G-actin(32Nowak E. Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Goody R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether this compulsory order dissociation of Ca2+ followed by ATP also takes place on the profilin-actin complex, an experiment was designed in which the kinetics of either ∊ATP or Ca2+ dissociation from Ca∊ATP-G-actin (6 μM) were measured at different profilin concentrations. The experiment was carried out with Ca∊ATP-G-actin and profilin present in syringe A in G buffer containing 10 μM ∊ATP and 20 μM CaCl2. Syringe B contained 120 μM BAPTA, 20 μM MgCl2, and 50 μM ATP. Either the changes in BAPTA absorbance or ∊ATP fluorescence were recorded, in a parallel series of experiments in which profilin concentration was varied. The time courses of ∊ATP or Ca2+ dissociation, once expressed in concentration units, were strictly superimposable. Fig. 2 shows that the values of 1/t1/2 were the same for ∊ATP or Ca2+ dissociation, at all concentrations of profilin. Therefore, both in the presence and absence of profilin, the dissociation of nucleotide from calcium-G-actin is kinetically limited by the dissociation of Ca2+. This conclusion was further documented by examining the profilin concentration dependence of the rate of ∊ATP dissociation from G-actin, at different free Ca2+ concentrations shown in Fig. 3. At all Ca2+ concentrations, the rate constant for ∊ATP dissociation increased with profilin and reached a higher limit at saturation by profilin, which represented the apparent rate constant for ∊ATP dissociation from the profilin-actin complex. The maximum increase in ∊ATP dissociation rate was 150-200-fold, at all Ca2+ concentrations. The exchange rate constant kobs was a hyperbolic function of profilin concentration leading to a value of 0.13-0.15 μM for KP, the equilibrium profilin binding constant, in good agreement with the value derived from fluorescence measurements(21Perelroizen I. Marchand J.-B. Blanchoin L. Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8472-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The value of the rate constant for dissociation of ∊ATP from profilin-actin varied with free Ca2+ concentration, as has long been observed in the absence of profilin (28Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4952-4957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nowak E. Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Goody R.

Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10778-10784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3b shows that the reciprocal of kobs at saturation by profilin varied linearly with free Ca2+ concentration in the range 0-1 μM. In conclusion, the general scheme for Ca2+ and nucleotide dissociation from G-actin is not qualitatively different, on the profilin-actin complex, from Fig. SI, which has been established for G-actin alone(5Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following equation, initially proposed (31Malm B. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to describe the apparent rate constant for nucleotide exchange on G-actin as a function of free Ca2+ in a range of low Ca2+ concentrations, also applies to the profilin-actin complex. 1kobs=1k′−Ca+[Ca2+]k′−eATP⋅KCa′(Eq. 2) where k′−Ca represents the rate constant for calcium dissociation from the Ca∊ATP-G-actin-profilin complex, K′Ca the equilibrium dissociation constant for Ca2+ binding to ∊ATP-G-actin-profilin and k′−∊ATP the rate constant for dissociation of ∊ATP from ∊ATP-G-actin-profilin following Ca2+ release. The value of k′−Ca derived from the plot of 1/kobsversus [Ca2+] in Fig. 3b, was 12 s−1 at pH 7.5 in agreement with the value derived from direct measurement of Ca2+ dissociation from the profilin-actin complex using BAPTA. Measurement of the slope of the plot allows the determination of k′−∊ATP, providing that the value of K′Ca is known. In the presence of saturating amounts of profilin, as in the absence of profilin(6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8683-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the dissociation rate constant of ∊ATP decreased upon increasing the concentration of free Ca2+ ions. A lower value of 0.17 s−1 corresponding to the dissociation of Ca∊ATP from the profilin-actin-Ca∊ATP complex, was obtained at saturation by Ca2+ ions. In the absence of profilin, a value of 0.002 s−1 was obtained (data not shown). Hence the rate of dissociation of Ca∊ATP is also increased ∼100-fold by profilin. The affinity of Ca2+ for ATP-G-actin in the absence and presence of saturating amounts of profilin was measured at pH 7.0 using Quin2, essentially as described by Gershman et al.(38Gershman L.C. Selden L.A. Estes J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In full agreement with these authors, the partial dissociation of Ca2+ from G-actin observed in the presence of a large excess of Quin2 (500 μM) over G-actin (Fig. 4) was consistent with G-actin having a ∼50-fold higher affinity for Ca2+ than Quin2. The equilibrium dissociation constant of the Quin2-calcium complex, KQ−Ca was measured at low ionic strength by fluorescence titration of 10 μM calcium by Quin2 in the presence of a series of concentrations of EGTA as a competitive inhibitor. The data indicated that KQca = 0.5-0.6 × KEGTA-Ca. Using KEGTA-Ca = 140 nM at pH 7.0 and low ionic strength(39Tobacman L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 492-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), a value of 70-80 nM was der"

Previously, we have used a coupled cell-free translation/translocation system to investigate the membrane orientation of Pgp sequences and have made the unexpected observation that predicted transmembrane (TM) segments from both the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal halves inserted in microsomal membranes in two different orientations (Zhang, J.-T., Duthie, M., and Ling, V.(1993) J.

We discovered that the charged amino acids flanking TM4 are important in determining the membrane orientation of the NH2-terminal half molecule of Pgp. This is a novel observation demonstrating the existence of internal topogenic sequences in a mammalian polytopic membrane protein. These findings thus suggest A) that the topological structure of a mammalian polytopic membrane protein does not integrate into the membrane simply by following the lead of the first inserted TM segment but that internal TMs may have independent topogenic information and B) that the TM segments in a multi-spanning membrane protein may be more dynamic than have been previously anticipated, i.e. mutations in the amino acids surrounding internal TMs could drastically change the overall topology of the molecule.

Pgp belongs to a superfamily of ATP-binding cassette membrane protein transporters that includes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, peptide antigen presentation-associated transporters, yeast STE6, and Escherichia coli hemolysin transporter(4Juranka P.F.

Over 50 of these ATP-binding cassette transporters are known, and the list of transported substrates is extremely diverse including inorganic ions, amino acids, sugars, peptides, steroids, and hydrophobic anticancer drugs. Substrate specificities of these transporters are likely determined by their transmembrane domains. Hydropathy plot and amino acid sequence analysis of Pgp suggested that it has 12 transmembrane (TM) segments and 2 ATP-binding sites(7Gerlach J.H. Endicott J.A. Juranka P.F. Henderson G. Sarangi F.

However, nascent Chinese hamster pgp1 Pgp molecules synthesized in a cell-free translation system in the presence of microsomal membranes (rough microsomes) possess two different topological structures(10Zhang J.T.

Similar observations have been made with the COOH-terminal half of the molecule of human MDR1 Pgp expressed in frog oocytes(12Skach W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6903-6908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein transmembrane rough microsomes wild type polymerase chain reaction. Transmembrane proteins in eukaryotic cells are thought to acquire their final membrane orientations during or immediately after synthesis on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Two theories have been proposed to explain the orientation of membrane proteins. One is the “positive-inside rule” in which it is postulated that membrane proteins orient themselves with the most positively charged end in the cytoplasm(13von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The second is the “charge-difference rule” in which membrane proteins orient themselves according to the charge difference flanking the TM segment. In a multi-spanning membrane protein, the charge difference flanking the first (NH2 terminus) TM segment is thought to play a dominant role in determining the overall membrane topology of the protein. Subsequent TM segments are postulated to simply follow the lead of the first one(15Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In this respect, the Pgp molecule is unusual in that it occurs in more than one topological form. It has been speculated that this feature of Pgp may be associated with its multiple functions(11Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pgp not only transports anticancer drugs but may also function as an ATP channel (16Abraham E.H. Prat A.G. Gerweck L.

These two functions may be generated by two different conformations of Pgp. In this study, we analyze how the two orientations of the hamster pgp1 Pgp observed in an in vitro translation system (10Zhang J.T. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18224-18232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are regulated. Such in vitro systems have been used for studying in detail the topology of membrane proteins in a wide variety of systems(20Andrews D. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 960-967PubMed Google Scholar). These topological studies make use of physical and enzymatic properties of rough microsomes (RM) (derived from dog pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum) to detect the orientation and insertion of newly synthesized peptides. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the effects of charged amino acids on membrane orientation of Pgp sequences. Our results show that the charged amino acids surrounding the TM3 and TM4 determine their orientation in the membrane, independent of the first TM segment, TM1. This type of internal topogenic sequence may dictate the topologies of a wide range of polytopic transport proteins in mammalian cells. pGEM-4z plasmid, SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase, RNasin, ribonucleotides, RQ1 DNase, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and dog pancreatic microsomal membranes were obtained from Promega. [135S]Methionine and Amplify were purchased from DuPont NEN and Amersham Corp., respectively. m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap analog was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Peptide N-glycosidase F and restriction enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Perkin-Elmer. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. For convenience of analyzing the effect of mutations on the two topologies of Pgp, the truncated construct pGPGP-N4 was used. This construct encodes the NH2-terminal four TM segments attached with a COOH-terminal reporter ATP-binding domain (Fig. 1) and has been previously described (11Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The site-directed mutagenesis in pGPGP-N4 construct was performed using two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) steps. In the first PCR step, a universal T7 primer and an oligonucleotide carrying appropriate mutations were used as primers and wild type pGPGP-N4 DNA as templates. The DNA products generated in the first PCR carry the designed mutations. This DNA, together with a universal SP6 primer, were used as primer for the second PCR. The second PCR products were then cloned into a fresh pGEM-4z plasmid, and the mutant clones were identified by restriction mapping and sequencing. A DNA fragment (NcoI-BglII) of ∼700 base pairs carrying the mutation was then isolated and subcloned into the wild type pGPGP-N4 DNA to replace the wild type NcoI-BglII fragment. The final DNA was sequenced to confirm the mutations and to confirm that no other mutations were generated by the Taq DNA polymerase. The oligonucleotides carrying mutations used for PCR are R207E, 5′-ATTTACTGAAGGCTGG; R207N, 5′-GATTTACTAACGGCTGG; K210D, 5′-AGGCTGGGATCTAACCC; D238K, 5′-CATTTACTAAGAAAGAAC; D238K/E240R, 5′ACTAAGAAACGTCTTCAGGC; K231E, 5′-ATTTGGGCAGAAATATTATC. When the K210D oligonucleotide was used as primer and pGPGP-N4 constructs carrying R207N or R207E mutations were used as templates, double mutants R207K/K210D and R207V/K210D were produced. Double mutations carrying R207N and R207E were not generated as expected due to the addition of an extra oligonucleotide at the 3′-end of the first PCR product by the Taq DNA polymerase. R207E, R207N, R207K/K210D, and R207V/K210D mutations in pGPGP-N3 were constructed from the corresponding pGPGP-N4 mutants. A EcoRI-BalI fragment containing the mutations were released from the pGPGP-N4 DNA and purified. A RsaI-HindIII fragment encoding the ATP-binding reporter was released from the wild type hamster pgp1 cDNA and purified. These two fragments were ligated together and cloned into a new pGEM-4z vector. The final DNA was sequenced to confirm the mutations and correct linkage between the two DNA fragments. About 6 μg of recombinant DNA linearized with HindIII was transcribed in the presence of 5 A260 units/ml cap analog m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G as previously described(10Zhang J.T. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18224-18232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of DNA templates with RQ1 DNase after transcription and purification of RNA transcripts were carried out according to Zhang and Ling(10Zhang J.T. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18224-18232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-free translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate was performed as before(10Zhang J.T. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18224-18232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To enhance the translation efficiency in the absence of RM, 1% Triton X-100 was included in the translation mixture. Proteolysis/membrane protection assay and limited endoglycosidase treatment were performed as described by Zhang et al.(11Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane fraction of translation products was isolated by centrifugation and analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography as previously reported(10Zhang J.T. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18224-18232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, two orientations have been observed with the NH2-terminal half of the molecules of Chinese hamster pgp1 Pgp translated in vitro(11Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate determinants involved in the generation of the two orientations of Pgp, we have made use of site-directed mutagenesis and the pGPGP-N4 cDNA construct (11Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to identify sequences important for determining the topology of the NH2-terminal half of Pgp. Fig. 1A shows the linear diagram of the truncated Pgp molecule (named as PGP-N4) encoded by pGPGP-N4. The PGP-N4 protein has been previously shown to be expressed in two different orientations (Fig. 1B, see also (11Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). One orientation, representing about 25% of the molecules (Fig. 1B, model I), has all four TMs in the membrane whereas the other orientation, representing about 75% of the molecules (Fig. 1B, model II), has only three TM segments in the membrane, and the COOH terminus is located in the RM lumen. The model I molecule has three N-linked oligosaccharide chains in the extracellular loop linking TM1 and TM2, while the model II molecule has an extra sugar chain in the COOH-terminal tail (Fig. 1B). Thus, the model I molecule has a faster mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than model II due to one less oligosaccharide chain attached(11Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two major protein products (62 and 59.5 kDa) were translated from the pGPGP-N4 RNA transcript in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with RM (Fig. 1C, lane 1; see also (11Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The 62- and 59.5-kDa peptides represent model II and model I molecules, respectively(11Zhang J.T.

Limited digestion of translation products with peptide N-glycosidase F generated intermediate deglycosylated products attached with 1, 2, or 3 sugar chains (indicated by arrows in Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). The fully deglycosylated peptide is ∼52 kDa (Fig. 1C, lane 4). These results demonstrate that the 62-kDa peptide has four oligosaccharide chains while the 59.5-kDa peptide has three. Previously, we have shown that all of the COOH-terminal reporter peptides protected from proteolysis have an oligosaccharide chain(11Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility that the 59.5-kDa peptide represents the model II molecules that do not have an oligosaccharide chain in the COOH-terminal tail can be ruled out. The proportion of the 62- and 59.5-kDa peptides serves as a convenient indication for the relative amounts of model I and II molecules. To determine if the two positively charged amino acids (Arg-207 and Lys-210) between TM3 and TM4 (Fig. 1A) have topogenic information for the membrane orientation of the PGP-N4 molecule, we made mutations of these two amino acids using site-directed mutagenesis and generated PGP-N4-R207E, -R207N, -R207K/K210D, and -R207V/K210D mutant cDNAs (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows the cell-free translation product from wild type (WT) and mutant templates. About 25% of membrane-associated full-length products of WT have model I (59.5 kDa) orientation, and the remaining 75% have model II (62 kDa) orientation (Fig. 2B, lane 1; see also Table 1). The R207E and R207N mutants generated ∼70% model I and ∼30% model II molecules (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). The double mutant R207K/K210D generated 85% model I and 15% model II molecules (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Essentially no model II molecules were generated from the double mutant R207V/K210D (Fig. 2B, lane 5). These observations were confirmed by proteolysis/membrane protection assays of translation products. Upon protease K treatment, the WT, R207N, R207E, and R207K/K210D generated a ∼42-kDa protease-resistant and glycosylated fragment (COOH-terminal tail located in RM lumen), whereas the R207V/K210D did not (data not shown). Limited peptide N-glycosidase F treatment shows that the major product from R207K/K210D (Fig. 2D, lanes 1-4) and R207V/K210D (Fig. 2D, lanes 5-8) mutants has three oligosaccharide chains (Fig. 1B, model I). These results indicate that both the Arg-207 and Lys-210 between TM3 and TM4 affect the membrane orientation of PGP-N4 molecules. It has been previously suggested that Arg residues have more restrictive effects than Lys residues(21Boyd D. Beckwith J. Cell. 1990; 62: 1031-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This may explain why fewer model II molecules were generated from R207K/K210D than from R207E, although both have similar charge changes. R207E and R207N mutations have similar effects on the membrane topology of PGP-N4, suggesting that the addition of a negative charge does not significantly affect the membrane topology. The origin of the minor band below the major product of R207K/K210D mutant (lane 4) is not known, and it is not consistently observed (see Fig. 2D). Its presence does not affect our interpretation of the experimental data. It should be noted that the mobility difference observed with mutant PGP-N4-R207K/K210D and PGP-N4-R207V/K210D is likely due to charge changes (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). The effect of charges on the mobility of truncated Pgp peptides has also been previously observed(22Zhang J.T. Ling V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1153: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Sequencing the mutant PGP-N4 cDNA shows no mutation other than the designed ones. When the translation was per-formed in the absence of RM, the mobility of mutant precursors is also different from the WT (Fig. 2C). This shows that the difference in mobility is not due to modification caused by RM-associated enzymes.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The fact that a reduction in positive charge in the domain linking TM3 and TM4 generates more model I molecules suggests that these positive charges function as a restriction factor causing TM4 to insert into the membrane with its amino terminus in cytoplasm. This is consistent with previous studies on mammalian type II membrane proteins (23Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1990; 64: 777-787Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and asialoglycoprotein receptor H1 (24Beltzer J.P. Fiedler K. Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Handschin C. Wessels H.P. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 973-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where the positive charges at the NH2 terminus of the TM segment are retained in the cytoplasmic side. In both instances, a membrane protein with a single TM segment was used. The current study is the first to demonstrate that charged amino acids flanking an internal (or subsequent) TM segment of a mammalian polytopic membrane protein are important in determining the membrane topology. To investigate if the charged amino acids at the COOH terminus of TM4 also affect the membrane orientation of PGP-N4 molecules, we constructed PGP-N4-D238K, -D238K/E240R, and -K231E mutant molecules (Fig. 3A). The translation results of these mutant molecules are shown in Fig. 3B. It can be seen that while the WT molecule has about 75% model II orientation, the D238K and D238K/E240R mutants have 59 and 36% model II, respectively (Fig. 3B, Table 1). This suggests that adding positive charges in the COOH terminus of TM4 generates less model II molecules. The mutation at Lys-231 (mutant K231E) also appears to have increased slightly the proportion of model II molecules. These results, together with that in Fig. 2, indicate that the more positively charged domain tends to be retained in the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The nature and position of the charged amino acids may also play some role in determining membrane orientation. For example, a similar charge change across TM4 appears to generate different effects on the orientation of TM4. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the Δ(N-C) (total net charge of NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences of TM4) of both R207E and D238K mutants equals zero; however, these two mutations yielded molecules with different ratios between the two orientations (Table 1). Moreover, mutations at the NH2 terminus appear to affect the topology of PGP-N4 molecules more than mutations at the COOH terminus of TM4. This is probably due to the fact that the charges at the COOH terminus are farther away from TM4 and therefore have less effect than the ones at the NH2 terminus(25Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9446-9450Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the amino acids at the NH2 terminus of TM4 affect TM3 as well as TM4, while the charged amino acids at the COOH terminus affect only TM4. To study whether Arg-207 and Lys-210 affect the membrane orientation of TM3, we engineered mutations of Arg-207 and Lys-210 into PGP-N3 molecule, which has only TM1, TM2, and TM3 with an ATP-binding COOH-terminal tail (Fig. 4A). The wild type PGP-N3 is expressed as 40% model I and 60% model II molecules (Fig. 4B; see also Fig. 4C, lane 1, and Table 1). When only one positive charge (Arg-207 or Lys-210) was changed to neutral or negative charge, model I molecules were increased slightly compared with WT (Fig. 4C, lanes 2, 3, and 5; see also Table 1). When both positive charges were changed to neutral and negative charges (R207V/K210D), all of the molecules had the model I orientation. These results suggest that Arg-207 and Lys-210 also affect the membrane orientation of TM3 but to a lesser extent than TM4. Using Chinese hamster pgp1 Pgp sequences as a model system, we showed that internal TM segments of a mammalian polytopic membrane protein have topogenic information. We showed that the charged amino acids flanking the TM3 and TM4 of hamster pgp1 Pgp are very important in determining their relative membrane orientation in the in vitro translation system. Deletion of positive charges at the NH2-terminal side or addition of positive charges at the COOH-terminal side of the TM4 segment have similar effects on the membrane orientation of TM4. In both cases, more model I molecules were generated. This observation is unique and has not been previously demonstrated for other mammalian polytopic membrane proteins. Hartmann et al.(15Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) postulated that TM segments in a polytopic membrane protein simply follow the lead of the first inserted TM segment and insert sequentially into the membrane. This is supported by the observation that the membrane insertion of the subsequent TMs in an artificial polytopic membrane protein does not depend on the signal-recognition particle and the signal recognition particle receptor(26Wessels H.P. Spiess M. Cell. 1988; 55: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our current study, however, showed that the sidedness of membrane insertion of the TM3 and TM4 segments of Pgp can follow a different pathway. The orientation of TM3 and TM4 in the membrane is dependent on their surrounding charges and does not simply follow the lead of the first TM segment. We hypothesize that the presence of positive charges at the NH2 terminus of TM4 creates a cytoplasmic “retention signal” for the NH2 terminus of TM4, and thus, model II molecules of PGP-N4 are generated (see Fig. 1). The removal of this positive charge retention signal by site-directed mutagenesis defaults PGP-N4 to a model I probability. Lack of positive charges at the COOH terminus of TM4 may also decrease the potential for TM4 insertion into the membrane in model I orientation. These findings are not in agreement with the prevailing idea that TM segments in a polytopic membrane protein follow the lead of the first inserted TM and insert sequentially. Internal TM segments may have their own topogenic sequences, and mutations of these amino acids may drastically change their insertion and orientation in membrane. This type of internal topogenic sequence may dictate topologies of a wide range of polytopic transport proteins in mammalian cells. Although it remains to be demonstrated, our hypothesis that more than one topological structure of Pgp is expressed in mammalian cells has functional implications. It is possible that these different topological structures of Pgp are associated with its multiple functions(11Zhang J.T. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15101-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Skach W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6903-6908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pgp not only transports anticancer drugs but also functions as an ATP channel (16Abraham E.H. Prat A.G. Gerweck L. Seneveratne T. Arceci R.J. Kramer R. Guidotti G. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The F1 moiety of ATP synthases from animal cells have molecular masses near 370 kDa and contain five different subunit types in the unique stoichiometric ratio αβγδ∊. The presence of a single copy of the small subunits (γ, δ, and ∊) for three αβ pairs may impose asymmetry on the F1 molecule(2Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. J. Biol.

Third, the role of α subunits in contributing to both catalysis and reversible nucleotide binding to F1 remains controversial, with the preferred view being that the α subunit optimizes the structure of β for catalysis (16Senior A.E.

Fourth, although a role for one or more of the small subunits (γ, δ, and ∊) in altering nucleotide binding is inferred from current models(1Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Turina P. Wilkens S.

Biomembr. 1992; 24: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), experimental evidence is lacking, and it remains possible that nucleotide binding may direct small subunit interactions. Finally, few workers have given serious consideration to the possibility that at least two distinct states of F1, catalytically active and inhibited, with different structural features may be important, respectively, in the function and regulation of the enzyme. The latter possibility has taken on added interest in view of recent reports (21Bianchet M. Ysern S. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21197-21201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Abrahams J.P. Lutter R. Todd R.J. van Raaij M.J. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1775-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that rat liver and bovine heart F1 exhibit differences in their crystalline forms. The first x-ray map of an F1 preparation, obtained on the rat liver enzyme at 3.6 Å(21Bianchet M. Ysern S. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21197-21201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), revealed several important features of the molecule. First, subunits α and β were shown to interdigitate in an alternating arrangement. Second, evidence for a nucleotide binding region on α subunits near α/β interfaces was obtained. Finally, the small subunits, although not detected, were suggested to either reside in the center of the molecule or not to be ordered. An x-ray map of the bovine heart enzyme at 6.5-Å resolution (22Abrahams J.P. Lutter R. Todd R.J. van Raaij M.J. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1775-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), although not distinguishing α and β subunits, depicts a molecule with features very similar to those of the rat liver enzyme, but with some distinct asymmetrical features. These studies implicate two distinct forms of F1 ATPases. To help address some of the major questions described above, we have carried out a comprehensive study involving a variety of different approaches. The results obtained are discussed within the context of current views about the relationship of the unique substructure of F1 to its nucleotide binding properties, catalytic functions, active and inhibited states, and crystalline form. Rats (Sprague-Dawley, white males) were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories. ATP, ADP, AMP-PNP, 1The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNP5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphateHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tris, MgCl2, EDTA, phosphoenolpyruvic acid, pyruvate kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Pyrene maleimide was obtained from Molecular Probes. Ammonium sulfate and potassium phosphate were from J.T. Baker Chemical Co. Tuberculin syringes were from Becton-Dickinson Co., and the Protein Pak 300 column was from Waters-Millipore Corp. Sephadex G-50 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and the luciferase/luciferin kit was from LKB Pharmacia Wallac. [α-32P]AMP-PNP was from ICN, and [α-32P]ATP, [γ-32P]ATP, and [3H]ADP were from DuPont NEN. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate high performance liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was purified by the procedure of Catterall and Pedersen (23Catterall W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4987-4994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the modification described by Pedersen et al.(24Pedersen P.L. Hullihen J. Wehrle J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1362-1369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme, in 250 mM KPi and 5.0 mM EDTA, was divided into 100-μl aliquots and lyophilized to dryness and stored at −20°C until use. The purified enzyme, contained as lyophilized samples (100-200 μg) in Pyrex glass tubes, was redissolved in 100 μl of distilled water/tube to give a protein concentration of 1-2 mg/ml and a buffer concentration of 250 mM KPi and 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The enzyme was then precipitated twice with ammonium sulfate, redissolving with 100 μl, 200 mM K2SO4, and 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, between the first and second precipitation. The final pellets in several tubes were dissolved in 200 mM KPi and 5 mM ATP, pH 7.4, and combined to give a final F1 protein concentration of 5-10 mg/ml. Crystals obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation as described previously (25Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2067-2069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) belong to the space group R32 with hexagonal cell dimensions of a = b = 146 Å; c = 368 Å. A 3.6-Å map determined by x-ray diffraction analysis using these crystals has been described(21Bianchet M. Ysern S. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21197-21201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two methods were employed. In the first, the spectrophotometric procedure was used in which ADP formed was coupled to the pyruvate kinase and lactic dehydrogenase reactions (23Catterall W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4987-4994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained the following in a volume of 1 ml at pH 7.5 and 25°C: 4 mM ATP, 65 mM Tris-Cl, 4.8 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM KPi, 0.40 mM NADH, 0.60 mM phosphoenolpyruvic acid, 5 mM KCN, 1 unit of lactic dehydrogenase, 1 unit of pyruvate kinase, and amounts of F1 indicated in legends. In the second the chemiluminescent procedure was used. This method involved adding F1 to the 1- ml reaction system described below for determining nucleotide binding by a chemiluminescent assay. The assay contained 0.15 μM ATP; after adding F1, ATPase activity was monitored by following the decrease in the chemiluminescent signal. CD spectra were obtained at 20.9°C in a 0.10-mm path length cuvette (Suprasil) using an Aviv 60 HDS spectropolarimeter. F1 was present at a concentration of 3.1 μM in a 40-μl system containing 250 mM KPi, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The βδ∊ fraction was present at a concentration of 8.2 μM in a 40-μl system containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and 5 mM MgCl2. Electrophoresis was carried out at 25°C in cylindrical gels (0.5 × 10 cm) using 7.5% polyacrylamide and a Tris glycine buffer, pH 8.3, as described by Williams and Reisfeld(26Williams D.E. Reisfeld R.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 2067-2069Google Scholar). The conditions for stabilizing F1 prior to and during electrophoresis are indicated in the appropriate figure legend. ATPase activity was monitored by following the precipitation of Pb3(PO4)2(27Cox G.B. Downie J.A. Fayle D.R.H. Gibson F. Radik J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 287-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were incubated at 25°C in a solution containing 35 mM Tris-Cl, 270 mM glycine, 14 mM MgSO4, 0.2% Pb(NO3)2, and 8 mM ATP. Electrophoresis was carried out at 25°C in a Bio-Rad Protein I apparatus in slab gels (14 cm wide, 12.7 cm in length, and 0.2 cm in thickness) using the buffer, fixing, and staining methods described by Weber and Osborn(28Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular sieve chomatography was carried out at 25°C using a Waters Protein PAK 300 column. The eluting buffer was 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. The appearance of protein in the eluate was monitored at 280 nm using a Waters 740 data module. Binding assays were carried out at 25°C by incubating F1, or fractions derived therefrom, for 20 min in a final volume of 100 μl, containing concentrations of F1, nucleotide, MgCl2, and buffer indicated in legends to tables and figures. The entire reaction mixture was loaded onto a Sephadex G-50 “fine” column (1-cm3 tuberculin syringe with a filter at the bottom), which had been preequilibrated with 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and precentrifuged for 1.5 min at 2,500 rpm in an IEC model HN-SII clinical centrifuge. Centrifugation of the reaction mixture was carried out for 1.5 min at 2500 rpm to separate nucleotide bound to F1 from free nucleotide(10Williams N. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays for ATP were carried out in a 1-ml system containing 20 mM Hepes, 10 mM NaPi, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, and 20 μl of an ATP monitoring agent (LKB Pharmacia Wallac) containing luciferin and luciferase. The final pH was 7.5 and the final temperature was 25°C. The chemiluminescent signal was monitored on a LKB Wallac Luminometer 1250 interfaced with a LKB recorder. Assays for ADP were monitored as above in the presence of 0.6 mM phosphoenolpyruvic acid and 4 units of pyruvate kinase. Prior to all experiments, data were collected for a “standard” ATP or ADP curve. To remove bound nucleotides from F1, samples were boiled for 2 min and centrifuged to remove denatured F1. The supernatant was then added to the above assay mixtures for determination of ATP or ADP. Purified lyophilized F1 (∼125 μg) was suspended in 100 μl of 250 mM KPi+ 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, and precipitated twice with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was redissolved in 100 μl of 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and, where indicated, nucleotide or nucleotide + MgCl2 was added. Incubation was carried out for 20 min at 25°C, and the entire reaction mixture subjected to column centrifugation exactly as described above. The resultant F1 (∼50 μg in 40 μl), with and without bound nucleotide, was then added to a 1.5-ml quartz cuvette (designed for fluorescence) containing 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. The fluorescence probe pyrene maleimide that specifically labels the F1-α subunit was added to give a final concentration of 1 μM and the fluorescence intensity monitored at an excitation wavelength of 339 nm and an emission wavelength of 378 nm using a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B spectrometer. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after first precipitating with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Amino acid composition data verified that this method accurately reflects the mass of a given amount of rat liver F1. The rat liver F1 preparation used in these studies when purified as described under “Methods” exhibits average specific activities, respectively, in Tris-Cl and Tris bicarbonate buffers at 25°C of ∼24 and ∼55 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein(31Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 934-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is fully competent in restoring ATP synthesis to F1-depleted inner membrane vesicles (32Pedersen P.L. Hullihen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2176-2183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is free of the ATPase inhibitor peptide (33Cintron N.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3439-3443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) known to enhance nucleotide binding to F1(34Penin F. DiPietro A. Godinot C. Gautheron D.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8969-8974Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Milgrom Y.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Prior to all studies reported below, aliquots (150-250 μg) of purified, lyophilized F1 (see “Methods”) were dissolved at 25°C in 100 μl of water and precipitated twice with ammonium sulfate to remove loosely bound nucleotide. Between precipitations F1 was dissolved in 100 μl of 200 mM K2SO4+ 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, to preserve activity. Most experiments were carried out between 5 and 18 times on at least three different F1 preparations. Although previous studies from this laboratory(10Williams N. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Catterall W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7969-7976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that rat liver F1 binds ADP reversibly at a single site (KD = 1 μM) and AMP-PNP at three sites (KD = 1 μM for 1 site and ∼ 25 μM for the other two), the total capacity for nucleotide binding has not been assessed, nor has the relationship between the ADP and AMP-PNP sites. Table 1, part A, shows that purified F1 precipitated twice with ammonium sulfate retains about 1 mol of ADP and 1 mol of ATP/mol of F1. In part B, it is seen, consistent with our earlier findings(10Williams N. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Catterall W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7969-7976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that addition of [3H]ADP alone results in the net binding of ∼1 mol of ADP/mol of F1 whereas the addition of [32P]AMP-PNP alone results in the binding of ∼3 mol of AMP-PNP/mol of F1. Significantly, however, the combined addition of the two differentially labeled nucleotides also results in the net binding of ∼1 mol of ADP/mol of F1 and ∼3 mol of AMP-PNP/mol of F1 emphasizing that the single detectable ADP site is separate and distinct from the three sites for AMP-PNP. Previously, we had shown that ADP does not alter the net binding of AMP-PNP, nor does AMP-PNP alter the net binding of ADP(10Williams N. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, the addition of MgCl2 or CoCl2 does not alters the stoichiometry of ADP or AMP-PNP binding(10Williams N. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Catterall W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7969-7976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Results presented in Table 1, part C, address the question of whether the single ADP site (part B) detected by radiolabeling is distinct from the endogenous ADP site (part A) detected by the chemiluminescent assay. If the two sites are identical, then prior incubation of F1 with ADP followed by determination of total ADP by the chemiluminescent assay should reveal only 1 mol of ADP/mol of F1. Conversely, if the two sites are distinct, 2 mol of ADP/mol of F1 should be detected. As shown in part C the latter answer is obtained. As will be revealed in studies described below, these two ADP sites reside on different F1 subunits. (In studies not presented here the single endogenous ATP site was shown to be readily reversible accounting for one of the three AMP-PNP sites.) In summary (Table 1, part D), under nonhydrolytic conditions there are five readily detectable nucleotide binding sites on rat liver F1, one reversible ADP site, three reversible AMP-PNP sites, and one site for the nonexchangeable binding of ADP. These nucleotide binding characteristics, together with those described earlier (10Williams N. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Catterall W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7969-7976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) support the view that under the assay conditions employed, rat liver F1 behaves as an asymmetrical molecule. Addition of MgCl2 alone to rat liver F1 has been shown to promote dissociation of the α and γ subunits from the intact complex with a simultaneous loss of ATPase activity(37Pedersen P.L. Williams N. Hullihen J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8631-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Results presented in Fig. 1A show that incubation of F1 with MgCl2 for 20 h at room temperature instead of the 4 h previously used (37Pedersen P.L. Williams N. Hullihen J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8631-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) results in a complete loss of ATPase activity as monitored by a spectrophotometric assay (see “Methods”). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1B the β, δ, and ∊ subunits, which remain soluble, are separated completely from the α and γ subunits, which are insoluble and can be sedimented. (For simplicity, these two fractions are referred to below and throughout the paper as the βδ∊ fraction and the αγ fraction.) Results presented in Fig. 2A show that the βδ∊ fraction retains significant secondary structure as revealed by circular dichoism spectroscopy, and similar to intact F1, exhibits a high degree of α-helical character. However, no ATPase activity could be detected in the βδ∊ fraction even after electrophoresis under native conditions which resulted in retention of ATPase activity in control F1. The method used to detect ATPase activity within the gel following electrophoresis (see “Methods”) is based on the reaction of lead nitrate with the Pi produced in the ATPase reaction to give a white precipitate of lead phosphate. The sensitivity of the assay is limited only by time, and even after several days no precipitate was observed in the gel resulting from electrophoresis of the βδ∊ fraction. The finding that loss of ATPase activity of intact F1 occurs simultaneously with loss of the α subunit (Fig. 1A), and the additional finding that the fraction containing the β subunit exhibits no ATPase activity (Fig. 2B) while retaining significant structure (Fig. 2A), supports the view that the β subunit alone is not a catalytically active unit(38Al-Shawi M.K. Parsonage D. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5595-5601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address this question, F1 was incubated for 20 h at 25°C in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 and then sedimented to remove the αγ fraction. Control F1 and the βδ∊ fraction were then incubated in the presence of labeled ADP, AMP-PNP, or ADP + AMP-PNP exactly as described in Table 1 and subjected to column centrifugation (see “Methods”). Calculation of nucleotide binding was based on the original amount of F1. Results tabulated in Table 2 show that when 5 mM nucleotide is in the binding assay, the four reversible nucleotide binding sites on F1 (i.e. the one ADP site, and the three AMP-PNP sites) are accounted for within the βδ∊ fraction. Additionally, consistent with results obtained on intact F1 (Table 1), ADP does not alter AMP-PNP binding nor does AMP-PNP alter ADP binding. However, it will be noted that at 1 mM nucleotide, where the single ADP site is still recovered in the βδ∊ fraction, only one of the three AMP-PNP sites can now be accounted for (see values in parentheses in Table 2). The Kd for the one ADP site and the one AMP-PNP site remain near 1 μM (data not shown), values obtained for the intact enzyme(10Williams N. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Catterall W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7969-7976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2058195934,"Abstract A single mouse genomic locus encodes proteins catalyzing three steps of purine synthesis, glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase (GARS), aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase (AIRS), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GART). This gene has 22 exons and spans 28 kilobases. The existence of a second genetic locus and closely related pseudogenes was ruled out by Southern analysis. Mouse tissues express two related classes of messages encoded by this single locus: a trifunctional GARS-AIRS-GART mRNA and a monofunctional GARS mRNA. These transcripts used the same set of multiple transcriptional start sites, and both used the same first 10 exons. CCAAT and TATA elements were not found for this locus. Exon 11, which represented the last coding sequence of the GARS domain, was differentially utilized for the two messages. The trifunctional mRNA was generated by splicing exon 11 to exon 12, the first coding sequence for the AIRS domain with subsequent use of a polyadenylation signal at the end of exon 22. Genomic sequence corresponding to the 3′-UTR of the monofunctional GARS mRNA was contiguous with exon 11, so that the smaller message arose from the recognition of one of the multiple polyadenylation signals present within the intron between exons 11 and 12. Hence, polyadenylation of the primary transcript at a position corresponding to an intron of the genomic locus was responsible for the generation of the monofunctional GARS class of mRNAs. This utilization of an intronic polyadenylation site without alternative exon usage is comparable to the mechanism whereby both secreted and membrane-bound forms of the immunoglobulin μ heavy chain are made from a single genetic locus."
