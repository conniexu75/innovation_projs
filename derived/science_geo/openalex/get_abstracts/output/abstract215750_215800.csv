https://openalex.org/W2037197303,Membrane vesicles arising from the surface of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells were separated from the bulk of other microsomal components in Ficoll density gradients. Initial separation depends on the differential action of magnesium ion on various microsomal components. Immunologic and enzymic markers were used to monitor separation and purification steps.
https://openalex.org/W2077415787,"Using special techniques allowing for subject mobility, we obtained continuous electroencephalographic recordings of known sleepwalkers. Somnambulistic incidents occurred during periods of slow-wave sleep. The incidents were not related temporally to dream periods, nor did they affect the total time or the percentage of time spent dreaming during the nights on which the subjects were studied."
https://openalex.org/W2054126901,"Genetic mosaic mice can be produced by aggregating, during cleavage stages, the blastomeres of two embryos of different genotype into a single cluster, and by transferring the developing aggregates to the uterus of a surrogate mother. Substantial numbers of such composite embryos survive past birth. Among the living adult mosaic mice are individuals within which cells of markedly different immunogenetic constitution coexist. Through the incorporation of appropriate genetic markers into mosaics, many new possibilities now present themselves for analysis of biological problems during embryonic as well as adult life."
https://openalex.org/W2017801229,"The serums from animals with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and humans with multiple sclerosis produce, in addition to demyelination, rapid, reversible alterations in complex, evoked bioelectric (synaptic) responses of cultured cerebral cortex and spinal cord tissues of the mouse. The active factors are dependent on complement and are not present in serums from normal animals and humans."

https://openalex.org/W1972571332,"Cerebral responses to stimulation of the median nerve were recorded in 89 healthy subjects, aged 15 to 80 years. Relationships between response characteristics, age, sex, and Maudsley Personality Inventory variables were determined. Amplitudes increased significantly with age. Age interacted with ""extraversion"" so that more ""extraverted"" subjects under 20 and fewer ""extraverted"" subjects over 40 had larger responses."
https://openalex.org/W2067306781,"In monkeys, corticospinal fibers terminate on motoneurons and interneurons. Brainstem fibers, which may be grouped into medial and lateral pathways, terminate on the same interneurons. Observations following bilateral pyramidotomy indicate that motility can be adequately directed by the brainstem systems while cortical connections add speed and the capacity for further fractionating movements. Further experiments suggest that the medial and lateral brainstem pathways primarily direct proximal and distal movements, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1965512378,"Three ways in which electrical, intracranial reinforcement is reputed to differ from conventional reinforcement were tested in an experiment which equated the form of the responses being reinforced and the response-reinforcement relation. Four groups of rats performed instrumental or consummatory responses reinforced by intracranial reinforcement or sugar. In no comparison did the kind of reinforcement produce a difference, but in every comparison the kind of response reinforced did produce a difference. It is inferred that reputed differences between intracranial reinforcement and conventional reinforcement are artifacts."

https://openalex.org/W2051813903,"A dense concentration of RNA appears in the perinuclear cytoplasm of nerve cell bodies in the third thoracic ganglion of the cockroach within 12 hours after their axons are cut. The basiphilic material of the perinuclear ring reaches maximum development 2 to 3 days after axon injury and returns to normal at about 15 days. Ribonuclease removes the basiphilic material, indicating that it is RNA. The perinuclear ring of RNA provides a marker for linking an individual central nerve cell body to a particular peripheral axon and the muscle it innervates."
https://openalex.org/W1978313121,"Rats deprived of water were placed, for 4-minute sessions, into a chamber containing a hole in one wall. After several sessions the number of times these rats explored the hole markedly decreased. Rats given access to water at the hole for a brief period explored the hole more frequently than controls, when they were tested later. This increase in hole explorations was abolished when the water reinforcement was followed by electro-convulsive shock but not when followed by foot shock."
https://openalex.org/W2045376778,"A transplantable reticulum cell sarcoma with leukemic manifestations can be transmitted from one hamster to another by means of a mosquito, Aëdes aegypti (L.). The transmission seems to be by a transfer of tumor cells, and not by passage of some other oncogenic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2032461593,"Studies of the respiratory function of the bloods of seven species of squirrels suggest that, in the evolution and adaptive radiation of this group, the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin has changed in a manner to better adapt the various species to different ways of life and different habitats. These changes are shown by the relative positions of the oxygen-dissociation curves of bloods of several species having dissimilar habits and environments."
https://openalex.org/W2003675148,Hydra cells take up substantial amounts of tritiated thymidine if the label is injected into an animal's gastric cavity shortly after feeding. Autoradiographic analysis shows that the isotope becomes incorporated into cell nuclei. The distribution of labeled nuclei probably represents the pattern of cell proliferation and is similar to the distribution of mitotic figures in histological preparations. The data show that cell proliferation is distributed along the body column and that there is no localized growth zone.
https://openalex.org/W2018772576,"Visually evoked electrocortical responses were differentiated ontogenetically in young kittens by age of onset, latency, and polarity. A long-latency negative wave, present by 4 days of age and abolished later by lesions of the superior colliculus and pretectal region of the midbrain, is attributed to the non-specific sensory system. A short-latency, positive and negative, diphasic wave, developing by 10 to 15 days of age and blocked by lesion of the lateral geniculate body, is identified with the specific visual system."
https://openalex.org/W1982067844,"Electron micrographs of vertebrate and invertebrate smooth muscle indicate that the myofilaments are oriented obliquely to the long axis of the muscle fibers containing them and insert along the sides of the fibers. As a result, a greater proportion of the contractile elements are in parallel with one another and a smaller proportion are in series than would be possible if the myofilaments were strictly parallel to the fiber axis. From this ultrastructural organization it is possible to predict several well-known, but previously unexplained, physiological properties of smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2092457695,"Eighteen peptides from the α1 fraction and eight from the α2 fraction of rat skin collagen cleaved with cyanogen bromide have been identified by chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose. The isolated peptides show wide differences in amino acid composition, and their molecular weights vary from several thousand to about 23,000. The data indicate that there are two different chains in the α1 fraction, demonstrating the nonidentity of all three α-chains. The primary structure of each chain appears to be unique throughout its length."
https://openalex.org/W2087176238,"A herpes-like virus has been isolated from fetal and neonatal dogs that died with an acute hemorrhagic disease. The virus differs from the other herpes-like viruses in its immunologic and growth characteristics. It is capable of passing the placental barrier and of causing disease and death of some of the fetuses, but in other apparently healthy animals the virus may remain latent, becoming activated under certain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1983284134,"Although dizygotic cattle twins with erythrocyte chimerism exhibit complete tolerance to each other's hematopoietic tissues exchanged in utero by way of chorionic anastomoses, they may not be completely tolerant to each other's histocompatibility antigens. Skin grafts exchanged between partners of 21 pairs of chimeric twins were rejected by more than half of the twins in an average of 250 days."

https://openalex.org/W1980491343,"In cats, the paradoxical phase of sleep occupies about 33 percent of the total sleeping time. Cats which were deprived of paradoxical sleep, by being awakened at its onset, required an increased number of awakenings on successive days of deprivation in order to prevent paradoxical sleep. On the first day of recovery after deprivation, when sleep was not experimentally interrupted, the paradoxical phase occupied 53 percent of the total sleeping time."
https://openalex.org/W1991185669,"Rhesus monkeys in a colony were stimulated by means of intracerebral electrodes controlled by radio, for 5 seconds every minute, day and night, for periods up to 14 days. Stimulations of the red nucleus evoked a reliable sequence of behavior including bipedal locomotion, climbing, vocalization, and social interactions. During periods of spontaneous sleep, stimulations produced only a small head movement, but the whole behavioral sequence reappeared as soon as the animal awoke. In monkeys injected with chlorpromazine, the evoked behavior was inhibited in the same way as during spontaneous sleep, while the administration of atropine, Regitine, and Indurol which blocked both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, produced only minor modifications of the sequential response."
https://openalex.org/W1973974386,"Six strains representing three species of Mycoplasma were examined for susceptibility to lysis by staphylococcal and streptococcal toxins. All were sensitive to staphylococcal alpha-toxin, two to streptolysin S, and three to streptolysin O. The results support the concept that the limiting membrane of pleuropneumonia-like organisms is basically similar to those of many other cell types and provide additional evidence for the participation of cholesterol in cytolysis induced by streptolysin O."
https://openalex.org/W2027601008,"Minor modifications of a commercially available food cup permit automatic recording of a rat's contacts with common dry food. It is thus possible to measure the frequency and duration of the ""meals"" that rats take over extended periods of time, and, in conjunction with existing devices for measuring drinking, to record contingencies between eating and drinking."
https://openalex.org/W2043790430,"Administration of lithocholic acid (1 percent in the diet) consistently produces choledocholithiasis in 8 weeks in rats on an 8-percent protein diet. The gallstones consist predominantly of the calcium salts of free and glycine-conjugated lithocholic and 3alpha,6beta-dihydroxy-5beta-cholanic acids. Conjugation of bile acid with taurine can be enhanced and stone formation can be inhibited by an increase in the dietary protein or by a diet supplemented with taurine."
https://openalex.org/W2088172887,"During induction of chloroquine resistance, Plasmodium berghei developed resistance to quinine administered in doses near the maximum amounts tolerated by mice. Resistant parasites did not form malarial pigment. Normal sensitivity to both quinine and chloroquine returned and pigment formation resumed during serial passage of the parasites through untreated mice."
https://openalex.org/W2045476758,"Sexual sterilization of mammals by the production of an obstruction at the tubo-uterine junction has been reevaluated experimentally. The application of 0.15 ml of methyl 2-cyanoacrylate monomere to the junction in rabbits produced, at intervals from 1 to 6 weeks later, histological, hydrodynamic, and functional evidence of tubal obstruction."
https://openalex.org/W1970369405,"In the radiolysis of thymine in neutral air-saturated solutions the principal site of attack is at the 5,6 double bond; in strongly alkaline solutions the attack shifts to the 5-methyl group. The shift correlates well with a model based on two changes in the reaction path as the pH is increased."
https://openalex.org/W2070100740,"Amino acids of the aspartic acid family are synthesized in bacteria through a multistep branched pathway. In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas capsulatus, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step is specifically inhibited by a combination of two end-product amino acids. Evidence is presented for operation of this kind of ""concerted"" feedback control as a regulatory device in growing cells."

https://openalex.org/W2007237579,"On the assumption that the potassium content of the body cell mass is constant it should be possible to estimate body cell mass by measuring potassium-40 activity with a whole-body scintillation counter. Relations of body cell mass to weight, lean body mass, and total body water are demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2020137667,"Computer-averaged evoked potentials were recorded from subjects presented with pairs of flashes having equal light energy but differing in duration of the brief interval separating the flashes. For the experimental conditions studied, the pair was always subjectively fused. Although the brightness did not change noticeably as the interval was varied, the use of the forced-choice psychophysical technique showed that apparent brightness declined with increase in the interval. Analysis of the evoked potentials revealed a correlated change in amplitude and wave form previously demonstrated for changes in flash flux alone."
https://openalex.org/W2050450452,"Lewis rats, thymectomized at 5 weeks of age and irradiated at 8 weeks, received grafts of adult thymus and marrow, one or both grafts being derived from donors tolerant to bovine γ-globulin. Challenge 3 or 6 weeks after grafting showed that delayed sensitization could not be induced in animals which received a tolerant thymus or tolerant thymus and marrow, though sensitization to a heterologous antigen (chicken ovalbumin) occurred normally. Arthus reactivity was regained slowly in animals receiving normal thymus and marrow and, to an equal extent, in those receiving grafts from tolerant donors."
https://openalex.org/W2070574459,"Pure gastrin I of Gregory and Tracy stimulated secretion not only of gastric acid but also of pancreatic fluid and protein material. Similarly, endogenous release of gastrin from a transplanted pouch of the pyloric gland area of the stomach, initiated by irrigation with solutions of acetylcholine, stimulated gastric acid secretion and pancreatic flow and protein output in dogs with fistulas of both organs. The effect on the pancreas, like that on the stomach, was inhibited by acidification of the acetylcholine solution."

https://openalex.org/W2054825774,"An immunoadsorbent for the isolation of purine-specific antibody has been synthesized. The technique is applicable for isolating antibody to any purine or pyrimidine capable of being converted to a derivative which can be coupled to amine groups. The recovery of antibody from a serum sample is better than 82 percent, and the precipitability of the isolated antibody is as high as 89 percent."
https://openalex.org/W1964385988,Cats were conditioned to give a foot flexion in response to stimulation of the brain through implanted electrodes. The evoked electrical activity of an extracallosal interhemispheric pathway was much greater in the repeatedly stimulated direction than in the unstimulated direction in the brain. No difference in the two directions was observed in control animals that did not receive the unconditional foot shock.

https://openalex.org/W2081226210,"Serum collected at intervals from rabbits treated with Freund's complete adjuvant was injected together with fluid diphtheria toxoid into recipient rabbits. Control rabbits received toxoid alone or toxoid mixed with serum of untreated donors. There was no antibody response in the controls or in recipients of serum obtained from donors 3 days after adjuvant treatment. Recipients of serum obtained from donors 1 to 9 weeks after adjuvant treatment responded with antibody formation. The magnitude of the response of recipients was correlated with the increase in gamma-globulin concentration in the serums of the corresponding donor rabbits. Passive transfer of adjuvant action indicates that a serum factor, possibly natural antibody, is partially responsible for the immunity-enhancing activity of Freund's adjuvant."

https://openalex.org/W2079487712,The rate of glucose-supported respiration in cortical slices taken from control rats and rats with bilateral lesions in the caudate nucleus was increased by 92 to 95 percent after the addition of potassium chloride. In cortical slices taken from rats with bilateral lesions in the septal area the respiratory rate increased by only 40 percent.
