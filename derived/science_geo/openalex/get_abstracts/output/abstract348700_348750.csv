In the more recent past, the development of methods for the study and the characterization of high polymers has brought about a revival of interest in the chemistry of macro molecules occurring in nature. As regards the desoxyribonucleic acid of calf thymus, the high molecular character of this extremely asymmetric compoun’d has been demonstrated repeatedly (3-6). That this nucleic acid was considered as the prototype of all desoxypentose nucleic acids is understandable, since it is the only compound of its kind readily available for a detailed chemical investigation, but the implicit assumption on the part of many workers that desoxypentose nucleic acid is a single chemical individual, regardless of the source from which it is obtained, is incorrect. A comparison of the results contained in thk present communication with those submitted in an accompanying paper (7) will be of interest in this connection. A recent study from this laboratory (8), as well as a review article (9), has provided a fuller discussion of the pertinent literature. The problem of nucleic acid specificity also has been considered repeatedly (10, 11). The great part in the activities of the living cell, ascribed at present to the desoxypentose nucleic acids, makes it imperative to perfect a foundation that will make possible the direct consideration of problems of structure, composition, and specificity. Whatever chemical changes are produced in nucleic acids in the course of cellular development or by radiations or mutagens, such as the compounds of the mustard series, will hardly be of the kind that can be revealed by the mere inspection of optical or other physical characteristics."

It is possible that this last stage occurs in the suprarenal medulla; but hitherto noradrenaline has not been found in the normal suprarenal gland."

We immunized three rabbits and three dogs with rabbit‘s myosin prepared by the method of Szent-Györgyi1. We used intraperitoneal injections of 2·5 per cent myosin solution, the myosin being dissolved in 0·4 M potassium chloride. The animals received 0·5 gm. of myosin in increasing doses during seventeen days ; they lost no weight during the treatment. With these antisera, precipitation tests were performed with the following antigens : rabbit‘s myosin, F-actin, G-actin, F-actomyosin and normal rabbit serum. The same tests carried out before treatment with normal sera of animals afterwards immunized served as controls. The results are seen in ."

https://openalex.org/W4235222004,"IN an earlier communication1 we stated that by cultivating Proactinomyces roseus in a synthetic culture medium in which the only source of carbon and nitrogen was 2 per mille pyridine, and using up the superfluous nitrogen by emulsifying 0·1 per cent cholesterol in the medium and aerating it at 34° C., in two weeks we obtained 7-oxycholesterol and 4,5-cholestonone. Later, we received a letter from Dr. G. A. D. Haslewood, of the Physiological Laboratory, Guy's Hospital, London, S.E., expressing doubt that the occurrence of 7-oxycholesterol was the result of the microbiological oxidation; in his opinion, the result was analogous to the production of 7-oxycholesterol from cholesterol in alkali medium, by aeration and elevated temperature, as shown by Bergström and Wintersteiner2,3, in which case the micro-organism plays no part."

https://openalex.org/W2088052411,"IN a recent study of the transmutation of a number of elements by deuterons1, the emission of three groups of protons from magnesium under deuteron bombardment was reported. These groups were assigned to particular isotopes by arguments based chiefly on the value of the energy released in similar reactions with other elements and on differences between the excitation functions of the groups. We have now been able to bombard separated isotopes, and the accompanying graph shows the proton groups observed from targets of magnesium-24, -25 and -26 deposited on stainless steel. The deuteron energy was 930 keV. as in the earlier experiments, and the protons were observed at right-angles to the incident beam. The three targets for which the results are shown in the figure were cut from larger areas on which the magnesium was deposited; but since the deposits were not uniform, the target thicknesses could not be accurately estimated. In the case of the magnesium-24 target, observation of the width of a (ργ) resonance-level suggested an equivalent thickness of about 10 keV. ; the thickness of the magnesium-25 and -26 targets was unknown, and the relative intensities of the groups shown in the graph are therefore unlikely to be those which would be obtained from targets in the normal isotopic ratio of thickness."

https://openalex.org/W2065239437,"Mayer and Kull1 have demonstrated that ‘Pyribenzamine’ and ‘Antistin’ counteract the spreading effect of hyaluronidase, and have claimed, therefore, that these antihistamine drugs exhibit a strong anti-hyaluronidase action. In view of the failure by Swyer2, using an in vitro technique, to confirm a similar claim by Guerra3,4 with respect to a supposed anti-hyaluronidase property of salicylates, it was decided to investigate the effect in vitro of various concentrations of some antibistamine drugs upon the hyaluronidase system."

https://openalex.org/W2072568112,"IN the course of a study of the early development of the sensory placodes of the head region in some cartilaginous fishes from the Red Sea, namely, Carcharinus melanopterus (Quoy and Gaimard), Rhynchobatus djiddensis (Bloch and Scheider) and Rhinobatus halaui (Muller and Henle), it was found that in the embryos of length 5–10 mm., the epidermis is generally thickened on either side of the roof of the mouth invagination and in the neighbourhood of the hypophysis (see drawing). This ectodermal thickening is of the same structure as the epibranchial placodes which, in these embryonic stages, are situated at the dorsal edges of the corresponding branchial slits. In view of its particular situation over the mouth, it should be regarded as homonymous with these epibranchial placodes and as belonging to them. The structure in question should then have the same relation with the oral slit as the epibranchial placodes have with the spiracle and the following gill-slits. The term 'oral placode' was suggested for this structure, which is thus interpreted as providing an interesting confirmation and adding further evidence to Dohrn's1 well-known and much discussed2 theory considering the mouth of vertebrates as derived from a pair of anterior coalesced gill-slits."

The article ended on an optimistic note, as it was felt that it should not be difficult to reach agreement. Unfortunately, that agreement has not been reached, mainly as one side feels unable to accept any compromise and appears convinced that nothing short of constituting the whole 40,000 acres a national park of the type in which nothing may ever be touched would meet requirements."
