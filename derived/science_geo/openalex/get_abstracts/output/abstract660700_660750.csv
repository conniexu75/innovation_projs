These compositions can adversely affect the bandgap and produce lattice strain that creates trap sites for charge carriers. Kim et al. found that substituting small, equimolar amounts of cesium and methylenediammonium cations for formamidinium reduced the lattice strain and trap densities. The enhancement in open-circuit voltage led to a certified power conversion efficiency of 24.4%, and encapsulated devices retained 90% of their initial efficiency after 400 hours of maximal power point operating conditions.

Lu et al. found that a film of the yellow phase was converted to a highly crystalline black phase by vapor exposure to methylammonium thiocyanate at 100°C, and it retained this structure after 500 hours at 85°C. Solar cells fabricated with this material had a power conversion efficiency of more than 23%. After 500 hours under maximum power tracking and a period of dark recovery, 94% of the original efficiency was retained. Science , this issue p. eabb8985"

Hoang et al. found that tracking changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility upon injury revealed clues as to why retinal glial cells in zebrafish could generate new neurons but the same cell type in mice could not. In zebrafish, activated Müller glial cells shift into a proliferative phase, whereas in mice, a genetic network returns the glial cells to quiescence. A few transcription factors enforce quiescence in the mouse, and disruption of these allowed Müller glia to proliferate and generate new neurons after retinal injury.

https://openalex.org/W3089590915,"The extent of somatic mutation and clonal selection in the human bladder remains unknown. We sequenced 2097 bladder microbiopsies from 20 individuals using targeted (n = 1914 microbiopsies), whole-exome (n = 655), and whole-genome (n = 88) sequencing. We found widespread positive selection in 17 genes. Chromatin remodeling genes were frequently mutated, whereas mutations were absent in several major bladder cancer genes. There was extensive interindividual variation in selection, with different driver genes dominating the clonal landscape across individuals. Mutational signatures were heterogeneous across clones and individuals, which suggests differential exposure to mutagens in the urine. Evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis was found in 22% of the microbiopsies. Sequencing multiple microbiopsies from five patients with bladder cancer enabled comparisons with cancer-free individuals and across histological features. This study reveals a rich landscape of mutational processes and selection in normal urothelium with large heterogeneity across clones and individuals."

Wang et al. found that different mechanisms accommodated plasticity in a molybdenum-niobium-titanium multiprincipal element alloy (see the Perspective by Cairney). Instead of so-called “screw” dislocations, deformation is accommodated by multiple pathways that include “edge” dislocations and activation of crystallographic slip planes. These results offer a design paradigm for developing new high-strength alloys. Science , this issue p. 95 ; see also p. 37"

https://openalex.org/W3089408272,"Protein kinases intrinsically sample a number of conformational states with distinct catalytic and binding activities. We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to describe in atomic-level detail how Abl kinase interconverts between an active and two discrete inactive structures. Extensive differences in key structural elements between the conformational states give rise to multiple intrinsic regulatory mechanisms. The findings explain how oncogenic mutants can counteract inhibitory mechanisms to constitutively activate the kinase. Energetic dissection revealed the contributions of the activation loop, the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif, the regulatory spine, and the gatekeeper residue to kinase regulation. Characterization of the transient conformation to which the drug imatinib binds enabled the elucidation of drug-resistance mechanisms. Structural insight into inactive states highlights how they can be leveraged for the design of selective inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W3089746615,"The non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, plays an essential role in RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling during normal development. It has been perplexing as to why both enzymatically activating and inactivating mutations in PTPN11 result in human developmental disorders with overlapping clinical manifestations. Here, we uncover a common liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) behavior shared by these disease-associated SHP2 mutants. SHP2 LLPS is mediated by the conserved well-folded PTP domain through multivalent electrostatic interactions and regulated by an intrinsic autoinhibitory mechanism through conformational changes. SHP2 allosteric inhibitors can attenuate LLPS of SHP2 mutants, which boosts SHP2 PTP activity. Moreover, disease-associated SHP2 mutants can recruit and activate wild-type (WT) SHP2 in LLPS to promote MAPK activation. These results not only suggest that LLPS serves as a gain-of-function mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of SHP2-associated human diseases but also provide evidence that PTP may be regulated by LLPS that can be therapeutically targeted."

Lawson et al. and Li et al. examined the genetic composition of laser-dissected microbiopsies from normal and cancer cells collected from the urothelium, a specialized epithelium lining the lower urinary tract (see the Perspective by Rozen). These complementary studies identified the mutational landscape of bladder urothelium through various sequencing strategies and identified high mutational heterogeneity within and between individuals and tumors. Both studies identified mutational profiles related to specific carcinogens such as aristolochic acid and the molecules found in tobacco. These studies present a comprehensive description of the diverse mutational landscape of the human bladder in health and disease, unraveling positive selection for cancer-causing mutations, a diversity of mutational processes, and large differences across individuals.

Leal et al. tested this assumption by analyzing data from two locations in the Brazilian Amazon and found that it is far from accurate: Terrestrial systems confer little benefit to freshwater systems (see the Perspective by Abell and Harrison). However, the authors also found that integrating the needs of freshwater species into overall reserve planning increased freshwater benefits by 600% while only decreasing terrestrial outcomes by 1%.

Llorens- Bobadilla et al. studied mouse ependymal cells, which function as stem cells for the spinal cord (see the Perspective by Becker and Becker). Chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic assays revealed that these cells carry a latent ability to differentiate into oligodendrocytes, which is much needed for remyelination of axons around an injury. The ependymal cells were triggered to differentiate into oligodendrocytes by expression of the oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor OLIG2. Expression of OLIG2 in ependymal cells specifically and inducibly enabled the production of oligodendrocytes. The ependymal-derived oligodendrocytes aided axon remyelination and improved axon conduction after spinal cord injury. Science , this issue p. eabb8795 ; see also p. 36"
https://openalex.org/W3090637663,"Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely associated with the accumulation of pathologic tau aggregates in the form of neurofibrillary tangles. We found that a p.Asp395Gly mutation in VCP (valosin-containing protein) was associated with dementia characterized neuropathologically by neuronal vacuoles and neurofibrillary tangles. Moreover, VCP appeared to exhibit tau disaggregase activity in vitro, which was impaired by the p.Asp395Gly mutation. Additionally, intracerebral microinjection of pathologic tau led to increased tau aggregates in mice in which p.Asp395Gly VCP mice was knocked in, as compared with injected wild-type mice. These findings suggest that p.Asp395Gly VCP is an autosomal-dominant genetic mutation associated with neurofibrillary degeneration in part owing to reduced tau disaggregation, raising the possibility that VCP may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of AD."

In the zebrafish spinal cord, neural progenitors form stereotypic stripe patterns despite the noisy instructive signals and large-scale cellular rearrangement required during morphogenesis. Tsai et al. show that a cell type–specific adhesion code, regulated by a Shh morphogen gradient composed of three adhesion molecules, provides adhesion specificity for three neural progenitor types and mediates patterning robustness in the zebrafish spinal cord. Although insufficient on their own, the integration of the morphogen gradient and differential adhesion mechanisms enables robust pattern formation during tissue morphogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W3090626360,"Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is a devastating disease. Radiation therapy remains the mainstay for treatment of this disease. Unfortunately, its efficacy is limited by the dose that can be safely applied. One promising approach to overcoming this limitation is to sensitize BCBMs to radiation by inhibiting their ability to repair DNA damage. Here, we report a DNA repair suppressor, leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 31 (LRRC31), that was identified through a genome-wide CRISPR screen. We found that overexpression of LRRC31 suppresses DNA repair and sensitizes BCBMs to radiation. Mechanistically, LRRC31 interacts with Ku70/Ku80 and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) at the protein level, resulting in inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) recruitment and activation, and disruption of the MutS homologue 2 (MSH2)-ATR module. We demonstrate that targeted delivery of the LRRC31 gene via nanoparticles improves the survival of tumour-bearing mice after irradiation. Collectively, our study suggests LRRC31 as a major DNA repair suppressor that can be targeted for cancer radiosensitizing therapy."

Sry exon2 is composed of retrotransposon-derived sequences. The SRY-S carboxyl terminus contains a degradation sequence (degron), whereas the SRY-T carboxyl terminus encoded in the Sry exon2 is degron free, thereby conferring protein stability on SRY-T.

https://openalex.org/W3090280537,"Background Vaccination is proven to be one of the most cost-effective measures adopted to improve the health of children globally. Adhering to vaccines for children has the propensity to prevent about 1.5 million annual child deaths globally. This study sought to assess the trend and determinants of complete vaccination coverage among children aged 12–23 months in Ghana. Materials and methods The study was based on data from four rounds of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS 1998, 2003, 2008, and 2014). Information on 5,119 children aged 12–23 months were extracted from the children’s files. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the factors associated with complete vaccination and statistical significance was pegged at p<0.05. Results We found that complete vaccination coverage increased from 85.1% in 1998 to 95.2% in 2014. Children whose mothers were in rural areas [aOR = 0.45; CI = 0.33–0.60] had lower odds of getting complete vaccination, compared to those whose mothers were in urban areas. Also, children whose mothers had a secondary level of education [aOR = 1.87; CI = 1.39–2.50] had higher odds of receiving complete vaccination, compared to those whose mothers had no formal education. Children whose mothers were either Traditionalists [aOR = 0.60; CI = 0.42–0.84] or had no religion [aOR = 0.58, CI = 0.43–0.79] had lower odds of receiving complete vaccination, compared to children whose mothers were Christians. Conclusion The study revealed that there has been an increase in the coverage of complete vaccination from 1998 to 2014 in Ghana. Mother’s place of residence, education, and religious affiliation were significantly associated with full childhood vaccination. Although there was an increase in complete childhood vaccination, it is imperative to improve health education and expand maternal and child health services to rural areas and among women with no formal education to further increase complete vaccination coverage in Ghana."

Estrogen has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects as well as extensive organ protective role. However, whether estrogen alleviates sepsis-induced liver injury and the mechanisms involved remain unknown. Septic mice were constructed by intraperitoneal injection lipopolysaccharide, and the effect of estrogen on liver injury was investigated. Furthermore, the roles of NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 and mitochondrial ROS specific scavenger Mito-tempo, on the liver injury were explored in septic mice. Female septic mice exhibited liver damage with increased serum AST and ALT level as well as the existence of extensive necrosis, and which was more serious in male septic mice. Moreover, Ovariectomy (OVX) aggravated sepsis-induced liver damage and activation of pyroptosis signaling pathway, which was alleviated by estrogen as evidenced by decreased serum AST, ALT level and number of infiltrating inflammatory cell, as well as protein expression related to pyroptosis. OVX aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction and liver injury in septic mice was also partly reversed by Mito-tempo and MCC950. These results demonstrated that estrogen protected against sepsis-induced liver damage through alteration of mitochondrial function and activation of inflammatory-mediated pyroptosis signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3089783877,"Tactile shape recognition requires the perception of object surface angles. We investigate how neural representations of object angles are constructed from sensory input and how they reorganize across learning. Head-fixed mice learned to discriminate object angles by active exploration with one whisker. Calcium imaging of layers 2-4 of the barrel cortex revealed maps of object-angle tuning before and after learning. Three-dimensional whisker tracking demonstrated that the sensory input components that best discriminate angles (vertical bending and slide distance) also have the greatest influence on object-angle tuning. Despite the high turnover in active ensemble membership across learning, the population distribution of object-angle tuning preferences remained stable. Angle tuning sharpened, but only in neurons that preferred trained angles. This was correlated with a selective increase in the influence of the most task-relevant sensory component on object-angle tuning. These results show how discrimination training enhances stimulus selectivity in the primary somatosensory cortex while maintaining perceptual stability."
https://openalex.org/W3090160053,"In the research on mathematics education, numerous Likert-type instruments estimating attitudes toward mathematics are sometimes composed of factors with a high correlation, which can make it difficult to assign the statements from the scale to each estimated factor. Further, the measurement of attitudes is usually done by adding the scores but ignoring the existence of possible differences in the importance that each item can have in its factor estimation. A revision of the methodology for the study of attitudes toward mathematics for the correct validation of the instrument is carried out in this research, and an estimation of the factors of attitude is proposed using the calculation of the weighted average of scores based on the importance that each item has in the explanation of its factor, which is given by a structural equation model. This methodology has been applied to Auzmendi's scale of attitudes toward mathematics measurement in a sample of 1293 university students. The factors were estimated using simple and weighted averages; significant differences have been obtained in the measurements, as well on those shown with the organization proposed by Auzmendi."

Yet, the distribution of G. duodenalis genotypes among human patients and their clinical relevance remains controversial. This study aimed to detect G. duodenalis in children in Upper Egypt and identify causative genotypes and elucidate a possible correlation between genotype and clinical presentation. One hundred sixty-five children, regardless of symptoms, were tested for giardiasis. Giardia positive stool samples (40/165) were subjected to PCR amplification targeting the tpi gene with positive PCR results in only 35 cases (87.5%). Assemblage-specific amplification of genotypes (A, B, and the zoonotic E strains) revealed predominantly G. duodenalis Assemblage A (45.7%). Assemblage B and mixed A and B infections were detected in 31.4% and 22.8% of children, respectively. Assemblage E was not detected. G. duodenalis assemblage A was dominant in children who complained of diarrhea and abdominal cramps. In contrast, asymptomatic children with positive stool samples display a higher frequency of assemblage B and mixed infections. The study highlights the predominance of Giardia Assemblage A in our study locality. This study is the first for this endemic area to use the copro-PCR technique for diagnosis and genotyping of giardiasis. Study results show the value of simple species-specific primers for genotyping in communities with little access to laboratory resources. Further genetic studies are needed to clarify the association between parasite genetic diversity and patient symptomatology."

Using a qualitative approach, we conducted 49 interviews with parents (n = 29 mothers, n = 20 fathers) from 31 families with a child (<18 years) with leukemia or CNS tumor. Interviews were conducted about 16 to 24 months after the end of the treatment. We used a semi-structured interview guideline and analyzed the data using content analysis. Average age of pediatric cancer patients was 5.5 years at the time of diagnosis; mean time since diagnosis was 3.5 years. Parents reported immediate impact of the disease on their children. Reintegration had gone along with delayed nursery/school enrollment or social challenges. In most cases reintegration was organized with a gradual increase of attendance. Due to exhaustion by obligatory activities, reintegration in leisure time activities was demanding and parents reported a gradual increase of activity level for their children. Parents described several barriers and facilitators influencing the reintegration process into nursery/school and leisure time activities (structural support, social support, health status, intrapersonal aspects). Although many children reintegrate well, the process takes lots of effort from parents and children. Childhood cancer survivors and their families should be supported after the end of intensive treatment to facilitate reintegration."
https://openalex.org/W3091024941,"The fitness of a predator depends upon its ability to locate and capture prey; and thus, increasing dietary specialization should favor the evolution of species-specific foraging tactics tuned to taxon-specific habitats and cues. Within marine environments, prey detectability (e.g., via visual or chemical cues) is affected by environmental conditions (e.g., water clarity and tidal flow), such that specialist predators would be expected to synchronize their foraging activity with cyclic variation in such conditions. In the present study, we combined behavioral-ecology experiments on captive sea snakes and their prey (catfish) with acoustic tracking of free-ranging sea snakes, to explore the use of waterborne chemical cues in this predator-prey interaction. In coral-reef ecosystems of New Caledonia, the greater sea snake (Hydrophis major) feeds only upon striped eel catfish (Plotosus lineatus). Captive snakes became more active after exposure to waterborne chemical cues from catfish, whereas catfish did not avoid chemical cues from snakes. Movement patterns of tracked snakes showed that individuals were most active on a rapidly falling tide, which is the time when chemical cues from hidden catfish are likely to be most readily available to a foraging predator. By synchronizing foraging effort with the tidal cycle, greater sea snakes may be able to exploit the availability of chemical cues during a rapidly falling tide to maximize efficiency in locating and capturing prey."
https://openalex.org/W3091055453,"Optic-disc photography (ODP) has proven to be very useful for optic nerve evaluation in glaucoma. In real clinical practice, however, limited patient cooperation, small pupils, or media opacities can limit the performance of ODP. The purpose of this study was to propose a deep-learning approach for increased resolution and improved legibility of ODP by contrast, color, and brightness compensation. Each high-resolution original ODP was transformed into two counterparts: (1) down-scaled ‘low-resolution ODPs’, and (2) ‘compensated high-resolution ODPs’ produced via enhancement of the visibility of the optic disc margin and surrounding retinal vessels using a customized image post-processing algorithm. Then, the differences between these two counterparts were directly learned through a super-resolution generative adversarial network (SR-GAN). Finally, by inputting the high-resolution ODPs into SR-GAN, 4-times-up-scaled and overall-color-and-brightness-transformed ‘enhanced ODPs’ could be obtained. General ophthalmologists were instructed (1) to assess each ODP’s image quality, and (2) to note any abnormal findings, at 1-month intervals. The image quality score for the enhanced ODPs was significantly higher than that for the original ODP, and the overall optic disc hemorrhage (DH)-detection accuracy was significantly higher with the enhanced ODPs. We expect that this novel deep-learning approach will be applied to various types of ophthalmic images."

Recent developments in the field of radar technology, partly empowered by the demand for sensors for autonomous cars, have improved the size and power consumption of available hardware. Today, the hardware exists to build a portable primary radar system for situation awareness. In this paper the results are presented of efforts to build the first portable primary radar for general, which has to be lightweight, cheap and have a low power consumption. The focus in this paper is on the software design of such a radar system. The physical principles of radar sensing are described, as well as the scientific steps needed to provide situation awareness. The hardware and software for the radar are both built and tested, and the results of these tests are presented. A flight experiment is performed with a small aircraft flying past a stationary radar on a small hill. It is found that the radar is capable of detecting the aircraft up to a distance of at least 3 kilometers. 3D localization is performed and the location determined by the radar was on average 46 meters away from the aircraft position as measured by satellite navigation, relative to a total distance of about 1000 meters from the radar.

This study uses theory of authoritarianism and democracy in ecopolitics to explore the impact of authoritarian ecopolitical discourse (AED) and democratic ecopolitical discourse (DED) on environmental quality in China. After analysis using panel data and comparison of three main regions, results suggest a negative relationship between AED of the central government and environmental quality. By contrast, a positive relationship exists between AED of local governments and environmental quality. A positive relationship exists between DED, which measures the proposals of People's Congress deputies and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and environmental quality. Nevertheless, the positive effect of DED is weaker than that of AED. The impact is also different among the regions. Our interpretations are as follows. China's current governance mechanism is a top-down decision-making mechanism, rather than a bottom-up information transmission mechanism. The concentration of power keeps decision-making power and resources away from levels with considerably accurate information and capabilities in problem solving. Therefore, we suggest that governments should change their decision-making process and exert effort to be transparent to the entire society. A bottom-up mechanism of information collection and transmission should be established, such as environmental inspection mechanism and checking on cadres' achievements with green GDP."
https://openalex.org/W3090941842,"Dose assessment is an important issue for radiation emergency medicine to determine appropriate clinical treatment. Hematopoietic tissues are extremely vulnerable to radiation exposure. A decrease in blood cell count following radiation exposure is the first quantitative bio-indicator using hematological techniques. We further examined induction of oxidative stress biomarkers in residual lymphocytes to identify new biomarkers for dosimetry. In vivo whole-body radiation to mice exposed to 5 Gy significantly induces DNA double-strand breaks, which were visualized by γ-H2AX in mouse blood cells. Mouse blood smears and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from irradiated mice were used for immunostaining for oxidative biomarkers, parkin or Nrf2. Parkin is the E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is normally localized in the cytoplasm, is relocated to abnormal mitochondria with low membrane potential (ΔΨm), where it promotes clearance via mitophagy. Nrf2 transcription factor controls the major cellular antioxidant responses. Both markers of oxidative stress were more sensitive and persistent over time than nuclear DNA damage. In conclusion, parkin and Nrf2 are potential biomarkers for use in radiation dosimetry. Identification of several biological markers which show different kinetics for radiation response is essential for radiation dosimetry that allows the assessment of radiation injury and efficacy of clinical treatment in emergency radiation incidents. Radiation-induced oxidative damage is useful not only for radiation dose assessment but also for evaluation of radiation risks on humans."

Moreover, anti-PLA2R Ab levels were significantly higher in PMN patients (134.85 [41.25-256.97] RU/ml) than in SLE patients (3.35 [2.3-4.35] RU/ml) and controls (2 [2-2.3]), p<0.0001. Consequently, a ROC curve showed for 100% specificity a sensitivity of 94.1% at a threshold of 2.6 RU/ml. Besides, Anti-PLA2R antibodies levels were significantly associated to non-remission; p = 0.002. The rs4664308*A wild-type allele was significantly more frequent in PMN patients (0.809) than in controls (0.633) and SLE patients (0.65); p = 0.008, OR [95% CI] = 2.44 [1.24-4.82] and p = 0.016, OR [95% CI] = 2.27 [1.15-4.5], respectively. Renal PLA2R mRNA levels were significantly higher in PMN patients (218.29 [66.05-486.07]) than in TIN patients (22.09 [13.62-43.34]), p<0.0001. Moreover, PLA2R mRNA levels were significantly higher in non-remission patients (fold-factor vs. partial remission = 2.46 and fold-factor vs. complete remission = 12.25); p = 1.56 10E-8. In addition, PLA2R mRNA and anti-PLA2R Ab levels were significantly correlated, Spearman Rho = 0.958, p<0.0001.Anti-PLA2R Ab and renal PLA2R mRNA could be useful markers for PMN outcome predicting. The PLA2R rs6446308 SNP is associated with PMN susceptibility in Tunisians."
https://openalex.org/W3090240642,Hydrocephalus occurs more often in brachycephalic individuals of different species. Detailed analysis of rostral cranial fossa-region of cerebrospinal fluid outflow-is necessary to understand causes leading to hydrocephalus in specimens with shortened skull. The objective of the study was to determine morphology and morphometry of rostral cranial fossa in brachycephalic dogs. Skulls of 126 dogs of different breeds and morphotypes were examined using computed tomography. Linear and volumetric measurement in the region of rostral cranial fossa and skull base were made. In brachycephalic dogs there is shortening of rostral cranial fossa which is linked with the volume reduction of this region. There are differences in skull base shape between brachycephalic dogs and other morphotypes. Similarities between brachycephalic dogs and patients with craniosynostoses were noted.
https://openalex.org/W3090363788,"Daily milk production and reproductive performance of cows vaccinated with a live double-deleted Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV) vaccine were compared to those of non-vaccinated cows, cohabitating in endemic BVDV herds. All animals in the treatment group were vaccinated on study day 0 irrespective of lactation or gestation status, while control animals did not receive any treatment. 1463 animals were enrolled in the study from four different farms in three different countries (UK, Italy, France). Endemic presence of BVDV in study herds was demonstrated by the detection of BVDV in the bulk tank milk, and seroconversion was evaluated at the beginning of the study. For individual animals, the day of calving was taken to be the start of lactation for the calculation of days in milk (DIM). The standard lactation period of 305 days was divided into three periods: early lactation (EL, from DIM 8 to DIM 102), mid lactation (ML, from DIM 103 to DIM 204 and late lactation (LL, from DIM 205 to DIM 305). For each farm and each lactation period, a mixed model statistical analysis was performed with daily milk production as response, and group, day as well as the interaction between those two factors as fixed factors. Chi-square test was used to compare abortion rate and prolonged inter-oestrous interval rate between treatment and control groups. A significant increase in milk production in the vaccinated group was observed in farms 1 (1.023 L/day) and 3 (0.611 L/day) during EL (p<0.001) and in farm 2 (1.799 L/day) during ML (P<0.001). In addition, at farm 2, vaccinated cows produced more milk than non-vaccinated cows starting from 80 DIM. No differences were found between groups in abortion rates or prolonged inter-oestrous interval rates. Data demonstrate that cows in herds endemically infected with BVDV and vaccinated with live double-deleted BVDV vaccine produce more milk; the difference in milk production occurs during early lactation."
https://openalex.org/W3091321817,"PURPOSE To investigate the relationships between global and sectoral macular vascular microcirculation parameters in the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) assessed by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and global and sectoral visual field (VF) central mean sensitivity (CMS) assessed by standard automated perimetry. METHODS Fifty-four eyes with open angle glaucoma were scanned using a swept-source OCTA (Plex Elite 9000, Zeiss, Dublin, CA) and macular vascular microcirculation was measured by calculating the overall flux and vessel area density (VAD) over the entire 6mm x 6mm area, excluding large retinal vessels. Central 10-degree VF CMS was calculated based on 24-2 VF. Pearson correlation was used to investigate the correlation between global and sectoral OCTA parameters and global and sectoral VF CMS. RESULTS Both global GCIPL flux and VAD were significantly correlated with VF CMS (p<0.001). For the sectoral analysis, sectoral VAD was significantly correlated with sectoral VF CMS in all comparisons except for the inferonasal VF CMS with supero-temporal (ST) GCIPL VAD (p = 0.097). Although highest correlation was observed for both ST VF CMS with inferior GCIPL VAD and infero-temporal VF CMS with superior GCIPL VAD (r = 0.683, p<0.001), there was no significant difference in correlation when compared to the global VAD and other sectors' correlation coefficients (p≥ 0.091), except for the ST GCIPL VAD (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Global and sectoral macular vascular microcirculation in the GCIPL, as determined by OCTA, was significantly correlated with global and sectoral VF CMS in glaucomatous patients. OCTA can aid in the understanding of the structure-function relationships of the macular region."
https://openalex.org/W3089364844,"Transgenic cotton expressing Cry51Aa2.834_16 Bt toxin (hereafter referred to as MON 88702) has the potential to be an important tool for pest management due to its unique activity against tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca. Unlike other Bt toxins targeting lepidopteran cotton pests, MON 88702 does not cause direct mortality but has an antixenotic effect that suppresses F. fusca oviposition. Previous work has shown neonicotinoid seed treated (NST) crops have similar behavioral effects on thrips. This study used non-choice and common garden experiments to examine how the presence of MON 88702 cotton and soybean (another F. fusca host) with and without NSTs might alter F. fusca infestation distributions. In a no-choice environment, significant larval establishment differences were observed, with untreated soybean plants becoming most heavily infested. In choice experiments, plants expressing MON 88702 or were neonicotinoid treated had significantly lower larval establishment. Larval density decreased as dispersal distance increased, suggesting reproductive decisions were negatively related to distance from the release point. Understanding how F. fusca responds to MON 88702 in an environment where adults can choose among multiple host plants will provide valuable context for projections regarding design of MON 88702 resistance refuges. Reduced larval establishment on NST cotton and soybean suggests that area-wide use of NSTs could reduce the number of susceptible F. fusca generated in unstructured crop refuges for MON 88702. These results also suggest that although the presence of NST MON 88702 could suppress reproduction and resistance selection, over time this benefit could erode resulting in increased larval establishment on NST cotton and soybean due to increased frequency of neonicotinoid resistant F. fusca populations."
https://openalex.org/W3089971081,"Background 
In the 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines, a 10-year risk of more than 10% is considered for initiation of intensive blood pressure reduction. The current study aimed to determine which cut off limit of cardiovascular risk for starting intensive blood pressure reduction is beneficial.


Design 
A Secondary Analysis of Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).


Methods 
Data from the SPRINT Trial was obtained from the NHLBI Data Repository Center. In the SPRINT, non-diabetic participants with SBP of ≥ 130 mmHg were randomly assigned to intensive and standard treatment arms with SBP targets of < 120 and < 140 mmHg, respectively. This study analyzed data from non-diabetic participants less than 75 years of age without cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease. The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, and other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. Cox regression models were used to examine the risk of the occurrence of the SPRINT primary composite outcome. To identify the relationship between BP values and the log hazards, natural cubic spline functions were performed.


Results 
In the analysis, 4292 patients were enrolled. The results demonstrated a clear J-shaped relationship between the effect of intensive blood pressure control and the risk of CVD events and 10-year Framingham cardiovascular risk levels at a cut-off limit of approximately <7%.


Conclusions 
This post-hoc secondary analyses of the SPRINT trial showed that a cut off value of more than 7% may be useful in selecting patients suitable for initiation of blood pressure reduction."

https://openalex.org/W3091590504,"Sri Lanka has a low-level HIV epidemic. This study aims to provide evidence on HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B (HBV) prevalence, sexual risk behaviours and utilisation of HIV prevention interventions among female sex workers (FSW) in the cities Colombo, Galle, and Kandy. Using respondent-driven sampling (RDS), we recruited a total of 458 FSW in Colombo, 360 in Galle and 362 in Kandy from November 2017 to March 2018. Participants provided biological specimens for testing for infections and completed a behavioural questionnaire. We found no HIV nor HBV infections in Galle and Kandy, and low HIV (0.4%) and HBV surface antigen (0.6%) prevalence in Colombo. FSW in Colombo had higher positivity on Treponema pallidum-particle agglutination test (8.4%) compared to Galle (2.0%) and Kandy (2.5%). About two thirds of FSW heard of HIV in each of the cities. Around 90% of FSW used condom at last sex with a client in both Colombo and Galle, but considerably less in Kandy (57.1%). However, lower proportion of FSW used condoms every time during sex with clients in the past 30 day: 22.9% of FSW in Colombo, 26.6% in Kandy and 68.4% in Galle. Across cities, 17.5%-39.5% of FSW reported being tested for HIV in the past 12 months or knowing HIV positive status. The commonest reasons for never testing for HIV was not knowing where to test (54.2% in Colombo, 41.8% in Galle, 48.1% in Kandy) followed by inconvenient testing location (23.7% in Colombo and 31.1% in Kandy). HIV has not yet been firmly established among FSW in three cities in Sri Lanka, but the vulnerability towards HIV and STIs is substantial. HIV interventions should be intensified by expanding community-based HIV testing approaches, increasingawareness of HIV risks and addressing socio-structural vulnerabilities of FSW to HIV."

https://openalex.org/W3089927616,"After the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) disqualifies them from clinical research, some doctors still get compensated by the drug industry for teaching or consulting. Disqualification is a rare FDA sanction reserved for when the agency finds major problems or misconduct in clinical trials that researchers have led. Using a federal database of pharmaceutical compensation to physicians, Science identified two physicians who after their FDA disqualification received vast sums from multiple drug companies. The companies declined to say whether they knew of the FDA sanctions. Among the 42 other physicians FDA disqualified since 2005, data from 2013 to 2019 show five others took in about $10,000 to $36,000 in drug company payments after their bans."
https://openalex.org/W3090170429,"Since the inferior rectus muscle (IRM) is a secondary adductor, it is expected to commonly observe esotropia in thyroid-associated inferior rectus myopathy, but this can be improved after the IRM recession. However, variable outcomes regarding the changes in horizontal strabismus after IRM recession ± IRM nasal transposition have been encountered in patients with thyroid eye disease (TED). We, therefore, examined the changes in 62 patients with TED in this retrospective, observational, comparative study. The patients were classified into 3 groups based on the results of postoperative changes in horizontal strabismus: Groups A (reduced esotropia), B (unchanged esotropia), and C (increased esotropia). Consequently, Groups A, B, and C included 23 (38.7%), 11 (17.7%), and 27 (43.5%) patients, respectively. In the multivariate linear regression analysis, the angle of preoperative esotropia (P < 0.001) and the amount of IRM nasal transposition (P = 0.049) were significant predictors of postoperative changes in horizontal strabismus. The results of our study will be helpful to ophthalmologists for formulating an effective preoperative surgical plan."

I was on a flight to visit family and had decided to watch the documentary about climber Alex Honnold's extraordinary, rope-free ascent of the 900-meter sheer cliff face of El Capitan. I have no head for heights, and maneuvering up a rock face is the last thing you'd find me doing. Yet one moment gave me an odd jolt of recognition. In it, Honnold has to let go of one set of handholds, step out over the void, and land on the next hold—just knowing that it will work out. It's a true leap of faith that made me think of the step into the unknown I had just made in my own career."
