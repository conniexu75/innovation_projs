https://openalex.org/W1975749117,"Electric fields can be manipulated by a method in which multiple electrodes are arranged along a closed contour and clamped to predetermined electric potentials. This method may be applied to a broad range of problems in the separation of macromolecules by gel electrophoresis. DNA molecules as large as 2 megabases can be well separated with a contour-clamped homogeneous electric field alternating between two orientations 120 degrees apart. The pattern of separation is independent of position in the gel, which is an advantage over previous methods. DNA less than 50 kilobases can be separated without distortion even at high voltage with a nonalternating contour-clamped homogeneous field. Decreased band broadening in DNA less than 200 bases can be achieved with a contour-clamped inhomogeneous field."

https://openalex.org/W2106126132,"In this paper, we investigate the role of a short repeated sequence (CACGA4) in the cell-cycle regulation of HO. We show that this sequence activates transcription of a heterologous gene in a cell-cycle-dependent fashion indistinguishable from that of the wild-type HO promoter. We also show that, in addition to SWI1 through SWI5, at least five other genes (SWI6 through SWI10) are required for HO transcription. These genes fit into three distinct classes with respect to their targets within the HO promoter. SWI4 and SWI6 are specifically required for CACGA4-mediated activation of transcription. SWI1, SWI2, and SWI5 are required for transcription from sequences physically separate from and independent of the CACGA4 sequences. SWI3 may be required for both. Since all the SWI genes are required for HO transcription, the HO promoter must contain at least two essential upstream activation sequences, which are affected by different trans-acting factors and are subject to different types of control."

The limits of variation permitted for functional signal sequences were determined by replacement of the normal signal sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase with essentially random peptide sequences. Since about one-fifth of these sequences can function as an export signal the specificity with which signal sequences are recognized must be very low."

The protein contains 574 amino acids per subunit and nine carbohydrate chains attached to 9 asparagines. The four subunits of cholinesterase appear to be identical. The active site serine is the 198th residue from the amino terminus. The sequence of human serum cholinesterase is 53.8% identical with the sequence of acetylcholinesterase from Torpedo californica and 28% identical with the carboxyl-terminal portion of bovine thyroglobulin."
https://openalex.org/W2040323778,"In the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the c-abl gene on chromosome 9 is translocated to bcr on chromosome 22. This results in the expression of a chimeric bcr-abl message that encodes the P210bcr-abl tyrosine kinase. The cells of 10% of acute lymphocytic leukemia patients (ALL) carry a cytogenetically similar Ph1 translocation. We report that Ph1-positive ALL cells express unique abl-derived tyrosine kinases of 185 and 180 kilodaltons that are distinct from the bcr-abl-derived P210 protein of CML. The appearance of the 185/180-kilodalton proteins correlates with the expression of a novel 6.5-kilobase messenger RNA. Thus, similar genetic translocations in two different leukemias result in the expression of distinct c-abl-derived products."

https://openalex.org/W2415213076,"Hydroxyurea inactivates ribonucleotide reductase from mammalian cells and thereby depletes them of the deoxynucleoside triphosphates required for DNA replication. In cultures of exponentially growing 3T6 cells, with 60-70% of the cells in S-phase, 3 mM hydroxyurea rapidly stopped ribonucleotide reduction and DNA synthesis (incorporation of labeled thymidine). The pool of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) decreased in size primarily, but also the pools of the triphosphates of deoxyguanosine and deoxycytidine (dCTP) were depleted. Paradoxically, the pool of thymidine triphosphate increased. After addition of hydroxyurea this pool was fed by a net influx and phosphorylation of deoxyuridine from the medium and by deamination of intracellular dCTP. An influx of deoxycytidine from the medium contributed to the maintenance of intracellular dCTP. 10 min after addition of hydroxyurea, DNA synthesis appeared to be completely blocked even though the dATP pool was only moderately decreased. As possible explanations for this discrepancy, we discuss compartmentation of pools and/or vulnerability of newly formed DNA strands to nuclease action and pyrophosphorolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1605680188,"We have previously shown in primary cultured rat adipocytes that insulin acts at receptor and multiple postreceptor sites to decrease insulin's subsequent ability to stimulate glucose transport. To examine whether D-glucose can regulate glucose transport activity and whether it has a role in insulin-induced insulin resistance, we cultured cells for 24 h in the absence and presence of various glucose and insulin concentrations. After washing cells and allowing the glucose transport system to deactivate, we measured basal and maximally insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake rates (37 degrees C) and cell surface insulin binding (16 degrees C). Alone, incubation with D-glucose had no effect on basal or maximal glucose transport activity, and incubation with insulin, in the absence of glucose, decreased maximal (but not basal) glucose transport rates only 18% at the highest preincubation concentration (50 ng/ml). However, in combination, D-glucose (1-20 mM) markedly enhanced the long-term ability of insulin (1-50 ng/ml) to decrease glucose transport rates in a dose-responsive manner. For example, at 50 ng/ml preincubation insulin concentration, the maximal glucose transport rate fell from 18 to 63%, and the basal uptake rate fell by 89%, as the preincubation D-glucose level was increased from 0 to 20 mM. Moreover, D-glucose more effectively promoted decreases in basal glucose uptake (Ki = 2.2 +/- 0.4 mM) compared with maximal transport rates (Ki = 4.1 +/- 0.4 mM) at all preincubation insulin concentrations (1-50 ng/ml). Similar results were obtained when initial rates of 3-O-methylglucose uptake were used to measure glucose transport. D-glucose, in contrast, did not influence insulin-induced receptor loss. In other studies, D-mannose and D-glucosamine could substitute for D-glucose to promote the insulin-induced changes in glucose transport, but other substrates such as L-glucose, L-arabinase, D-fructose, pyruvate, and maltose were without effect. Also, non-metabolized substrates which competitively inhibit D-glucose uptake (3-O-methylglucose, cytochalasin B) blocked the D-glucose plus insulin effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1490220406,"G inversion in bacteriophage Mu requires the product of the DNA invertase gene gin and an Escherichia coli host factor termed FIS (factor for inversion stimulation). A recombination substrate must contain two recombination sites, arranged as inverted repeats, and a recombinational enhancer sequence termed sis. FIS has been purified to homogeneity. The purified protein has a relative molecular weight of 12,000 when analyzed under denaturing conditions. The intact protein behaves as a dimer of relative molecular weight 25,000 in gel filtration analysis. The purified protein does not possess any recombinogenic activity when assayed in the absence of the DNA-invertase Gin. In the presence of purified Gin FIS is the only additional protein required for efficient inversion. By performing gel retention assays, we show that FIS is a DNA-binding protein, which specifically binds to DNA fragments containing the recombinational enhancer sis."
https://openalex.org/W1843926618,"Abstract A genetic approach was taken to test the function of yeast metallothionein in metal ion detoxification. A yeast strain was constructed in which the metallothionein locus was deleted (cup1 delta). The cup1 delta strain was complemented with normal or mutant metallothionein genes under normal or constitutive regulatory control on high copy episomal plasmids. Metal resistance of the cup1 delta strain with and without the metallothionein-expressing vectors was analyzed. The normally regulated metallothionein gene conferred resistance only to copper (1000-fold); constitutively expressed metallothionein conferred resistance to both copper (500-fold) and cadmium (1000-fold), but not to mercury, zinc, silver, cobalt, nickel, gold, platinum, lanthanum, uranium, or tin. Two mutant versions of the metallothionein gene were constructed and tested for their ability to confer metal resistance in the cup1 delta background. The first had a deletion of a highly conserved amino acid sequence (Lys-Lys-Ser-Cys-Cys-Ser). The second was a hybrid gene consisting of the sequences coding for the first 20 amino acids of the yeast protein fused to the monkey metallothionein gene. Expression of these genes under the CUP1 promoter provided significant protection from copper, but none of the other metals tested. These results demonstrate that there is significant flexibility in the structural requirements for metallothionein to function in copper detoxification and that yeast metallothionein is also capable of detoxifying cadmium under conditions of constitutive expression."
https://openalex.org/W1565549817,"Glucose transport activity was found to increase over 5 h in rat epitrochlearis muscle in response to a moderate concentration (50-100 microunits/ml) of insulin. This process was examined using 3-methylglucose. The increase in permeability to 3-methylglucose was 2- to 4-fold greater after 5 h than after 1 h in muscles incubated with 50 microunits/ml of insulin and 1 or 8 mM glucose. The increase in permeability to 3-methylglucose during the period between 1 and 5 h of exposure to 50 microunits/ml of insulin and 1 mM glucose was due to an increase in the apparent Vmax of sugar transport. There were two components to this activation of glucose transport. One, which was not influenced by inhibition of protein synthesis, resulted in activation of sugar transport to the same extent by 50 microunits/ml as by 20,000 microunits/ml of insulin; however, this activation took approximately 20 times longer with 50 microunits/ml insulin. The other, which was blocked by cycloheximide, resulted in a further activation of sugar transport to a level higher than that attained in response to 20,000 microunits/ml of insulin. Glucose had no effect on activation of sugar transport during the first hour, but a high concentration (20-36 mM) of glucose prevented the further activation of glucose transport during prolonged treatment with 50 microunits/ml of insulin. It appears from these results that prolonged exposure to a moderate concentration of insulin has previously unrecognized effects that include: a progressive activation of glucose transport over a long time that eventually results in as great a response as a supramaximal insulin concentration, and in the presence of low glucose concentration, further activation of glucose transport by an additional, protein synthesis-dependent mechanism. The results also show that a high concentration of glucose can, under some conditions, inhibit stimulation of its own transport."
https://openalex.org/W1504739504,"The absolute action spectrum of Escherichia coli DNA photolyase was determined in vitro. In vivo the photoreactivation cross-section (epsilon phi) is 2.4 X 10(4) M-1 cm-1 suggesting that the quantum yield (phi) is about 1.0 if one assumes that the enzyme has the same spectral properties (e.g. epsilon 384 = 1.8 X 10(4) M-1 cm-1) in vivo as those of the enzyme purified to homogeneity. The relative action spectrum of the pure enzyme (blue enzyme that contains FAD neutral semiquinone radical) agrees with the relative action spectrum for photoreactivation of E. coli, having lambda max = 384 nm. However, the absolute action spectrum of the blue enzyme yields a photoreactivation cross-section (epsilon phi = 1.2 X 10(3) at 384 nm) that is 20-fold lower than the in vivo values indicative of an apparent lower quantum yield (phi approximately equal to 0.07) in vitro. Reducing the enzyme with dithionite results in reduction of the flavin semiquinone and a concomitant 12-15-fold increase in the quantum yield. These results suggest that the flavin cofactor of the enzyme is fully reduced in vivo and that, upon absorption of a single photon in the 300-500 nm range, the photolyase chromophore (which consists of reduced FAD plus the second chromophore) donates an electron to the pyrimidine dimer causing its reversal to two pyrimidines. The reduced chromophore is regenerated at the end of the photochemical step thus enabling the enzyme to act catalytically.+"
https://openalex.org/W2106573607,"Peroxisomal matrix proteins are imported into the organelle posttranslationally. Here we report that proton ionophores disrupt the import and assembly of alcohol oxidase, a homo-octameric flavoprotein of the induced peroxisome from the methylotrophic yeast Candida boidinii. When drug is added to cells containing newly synthesized monomeric alcohol oxidase, octamerization fails to occur and a membrane-associated complex is formed instead. The formation of the complex, which appears to face the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, is reversed when drug is removed, leading to the generation of octamer. Surprisingly, when drug is added to cells containing newly assembled octamers, they dissociate into monomers. We suggest that both the complex and the labile octamer are intermediates in the normal assembly pathway of alcohol oxidase and that energy is required for import and maturation of this peroxisomal protein."
https://openalex.org/W102091409,"At maximally active concentrations with 20-min exposure, insulin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated hexose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by 11- and 2-fold, respectively. The potential role of phosphorylation of the glucose transporter (GT) in these stimulations was investigated by the isolation of GT through immunoprecipitation from ortho[32P]phosphate-labeled 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It was found that there was no significant 32P incorporation into GT from basal adipocytes after 2- or 18 h-labeling in the presence of 0.5 mCi of 32Pi/ml. Furthermore, under these labeling conditions, insulin treatment for 1, 4, or 30 min failed to stimulate the phosphorylation of GT. Also, there was no detectable phosphate incorporation into GT upon reversal of insulin-stimulated hexose transport by the removal of insulin (half-time for reversal approximately 8 min). In contrast to these results, exposure of adipocytes to PMA (1 microM) for 20 min elicited a phosphorylation of GT to the extent of about 0.1 phosphate/GT molecule. Exposure of cells to both insulin and PMA resulted in a 3-fold increase in the level of phosphate in GT compared to that seen with PMA alone. Possibly this increase is due to the translocation of GT to the plasma membrane where it is a better substrate for activated protein kinase C. Stimulation of hexose transport was the same with the combined treatment of insulin and PMA compared to that seen with insulin alone. These results indicate that neither a change in the phosphorylation state of the GT nor activation of protein kinase C is involved in the mechanism by which the insulin receptor stimulates glucose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1580449107,"For study of hormonal regulation of gene expression of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1. 13. 11. 11, TO), a DNA clone containing a sequence complementary to TO mRNA was prepared with TO mRNA from rat liver enriched 62-fold by immunoadsorption. Primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes were treated with dexamethasone, and the amount of TO mRNA was measured by RNA dot-blot hybridization with this TO cDNA. Dexamethasone induced this TO mRNA 7-fold, while their treatments with dexamethasone plus glucagon induced the TO mRNA 18-fold. This induction of TO mRNA by dexamethasone plus glucagon was inhibited by insulin or epinephrine. Studies on transcription in isolated nuclei showed that these hormonal changes in the level of TO mRNA were caused by changes in the rate of transcription of the TO gene. Thus, expression of TO in the liver is regulated multihormonally at the transcriptional step. There was a long lag period before stimulation of transcription of the TO gene by dexamethasone in hepatocytes cultured for 20 h: the maximal rate was attained after 6-8 h. The lag time depended on the culture time without dexamethasone and was shorter after shorter culture of the cells. This finding suggested that a transcriptional factor that was lost during culture mediated the action of glucocorticoids. Consistent with this idea, cycloheximide or puromycin almost completely blocked enhanced transcription of the TO gene by dexamethasone after a 20-h culture, but not after a 2-h culture. These findings indicate that a short-lived transcriptional protein, which is also regulated by glucocorticoids, mediates their effect on expression of the TO gene."
https://openalex.org/W1602599685,"The effects of Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (V8) on the multimeric structure of human von Willebrand factor (vWF) were studied to test and expand our model for the substructure of vWF. Electron microscopy of V8 digests of vWF revealed that the multimers were cleaved where the flexible rod (R) domains join the large elongated globular (G) domains. The resulting two major fragments, which were purified by affinity and hydrophobic interaction chromatography and by glycerol-gradient ultracentrifugation, are disulfide-linked homodimers of these domains (i.e. RR and GG) and are morphologically identical to the alternating RR and GG domains of intact vWF. The glycoprotein fragment GG (6.5 X 35 nm) has mass 343 kDa by sedimentation equilibrium and the amino-terminal sequence of intact plasma vWF. It contains the binding site for heparin within 300 residues of its amino terminus and a separate site for the platelet GPIb receptor responsible for platelet agglutination in the presence of ristocetin. With approximately 18% alpha-helix and approximately 15% beta-pleated sheet, fragment GG accounts for most of the ordered secondary structure present in whole vWF. The two thin flexible rod domains (1.8-2.0 X 30-34 nm) of fragment RR are joined at a small central nodule (approximately 5 nm diameter) and also have a small nodule at each free end. Fragment RR contains an extraordinarily high cystine content, lower than average amounts of other hydrophobic residues, and essentially no alpha-helix, as judged by circular dichroism. The amino-terminal sequence and amino acid composition of fragment RR corresponded to that of the COOH-terminal 685 residues of the intact vWF subunit (Titani, K., Kumar, S., Takio, K., Ericsson, L. H., Wade, R. D., Ashida, K., Walsh, K. A., Chopek, M. W., Sadler, J. E., and Fujikawa, K. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 3171-3184). This sequence analysis gives a mass of 180 kDa for glycosylated fragment RR, somewhat higher than the 130 kDa we obtained by sedimentation equilibrium. Our sequence analysis of a 110-kDa plasmic vWF peptide also permitted identification of a major plasmin cleavage site 705 residues from the COOH terminus and a half-cystine residue (1360) involved in maintaining the multimeric structure of plasmin-degraded vWF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1511645940,"DNA photolyase repairs pyrimidine dimers in DNA in a reaction that requires visible light. Photolyase from Escherichia coli is normally isolated as a blue protein and contains 2 chromophores: a blue FAD radical plus a second chromophore that exhibits an absorption maximum at 360 nm when free in solution. Oxidation of the FAD radical is accompanied by a reversible loss of activity which is proportional to the fraction of the enzyme flavin converted to FADox. Quantitative reduction of the radical to fully reduced FAD causes a 3-fold increase in activity. The results show that a reduced flavin is required for activity and suggest that flavin may act as an electron donor in catalysis. Comparison of the absorption spectrum calculated for the protein-bound second chromophore (lambda max = 390 nm) with fluorescence data and with the relative action spectrum for dimer repair indicates that the second chromophore is the fluorophore in photolyase and that it does act as a sensitizer in catalysis. On the other hand, enzyme preparations containing diminished amounts of the second chromophore do not exhibit correspondingly lower activity. This suggests that reduced flavin may also act as a sensitizer in catalysis. The blue color of the enzyme is lost upon reduction of the FAD radical. The fully reduced E. coli enzyme exhibits absorption and fluorescence properties very similar to yeast photolyase. This indicates that the two enzymes probably contain similar chromophores but are isolated in different forms with respect to the redox state of the flavin."
https://openalex.org/W1490104408,"The secretory granules of rat serosal mast cells are able efficiently to degrade the apolipoprotein B component of low density lipoproteins (LDL) Kokkonen, J. O., and Kovanen, P. T. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14756-14763). The granules are known to contain two neutral proteases with complementary specificities: a chymotrypsin-like endopeptidase called chymase, and an exopeptidase, the granule carboxypeptidase A. The role of this enzyme pair in the proteolytic degradation of LDL was studied with the aid of specific enzyme inhibitors. Incubation of LDL with intact granules (both enzymes active) led to the formation of numerous low molecular weight peptides and the liberation of free amino acids, most of which (95%) were aromatic (Phe, Tyr, Trp) or branched-chain aliphatic (Leu, Ile, Val). Selective inhibition of granule carboxypeptidase A (leaving chymase active) blocked the liberation of free amino acids, but left the formation of peptides uninhibited. On the other hand, selective inhibition of granule chymase (leaving carboxypeptidase A active) totally abolished the proteolytic degradation of LDL. The results are consistent with a model according to which the proteolytic degradation of LDL by mast cell granules results from coordinated action of the two granule-bound enzymes, whereby the chymase first cleaves peptides from the apolipoprotein B of LDL, and thereafter the carboxypeptidase A cleaves amino acids from the peptides formed."

https://openalex.org/W1490906767,"A mixture of threonine dehydrogenase and aminoacetone synthetase will catalyze the conversion of L-threonine to glycine. The overall reaction likely involves the conversion of L-threonine, NAD+, and CoA to glycine, NADH, and acetyl-CoA. Physical separation of L-threonine dehydrogenase from aminoacetone synthetase results in the formation of aminoacetone and CO2 from their substrates. A physical interaction between threonine dehydrogenase and aminoacetone synthetase has been demonstrated by gel permeation chromatography and fluorescence polarization. Polarization of fluorescence measurements of threonine dehydrogenase and aminoacetone synthetase labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate indicated the formation of a soluble active complex, with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 5-10 nM and an apparent stoichiometry of 2 aminoacetone synthetase dimers/1 threonine dehydrogenase tetramer. Chemical experiments have identified aminoacetone as the enzymatic product of L-threonine dehydrogenase acting on L-threonine. These experiments involved trapping pyrrole derivatives, [3H]NaBH4 reduction, and coupling with plasma amine oxidase. Kinetic experiments also showed NADH, CO2, and aminoacetone to inhibit threonine dehydrogenase in a manner consistent with an ordered Bi-Ter kinetic mechanism. NAD+ is the lead substrate followed by threonine, and the products are released in the order: CO2, aminoacetone, and NADH."
https://openalex.org/W1551484668,"Cycloheximide, a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis, has been used to examine the relationship between recruitment of hexose carriers and the activation of glucose transport by insulin in rat adipocytes. Adipocytes were preincubated +/- cycloheximide for 90 min then +/- insulin for a further 30 min. We measured 3-O-methylglucose uptake in intact cells and in isolated plasma membrane vesicles. The concentration of glucose transporters in plasma membranes and low density microsomes was measured using a cytochalasin B binding assay. Cycloheximide had no affect on basal or insulin-stimulated 3-O-methylglucose uptake in intact cells or in plasma membrane vesicles. However, the number of glucose carriers in plasma membranes prepared from cells incubated with cycloheximide and insulin was markedly reduced compared to that from cells incubated with insulin alone (14 and 34 pmol/mg protein, respectively). Incubation of cells with cycloheximide alone did not change the concentration of glucose carriers in either plasma membranes or in low density microsomes compared to control cells. When isolated membranes were analyzed with an antiserum prepared against human erythrocyte glucose transporter, decreased cross-reactivity was observed in plasma membranes prepared from cycloheximide/insulin-treated cells compared to those from insulin cells. The present findings indicate that incubation of adipocytes with cycloheximide greatly reduces the number of hexose carriers in the plasma membrane of insulin-stimulated cells. Despite this reduction, insulin is still able to maximally stimulate glucose uptake. Thus, these data suggest an apparent dissociation between insulin stimulation of glucose transport activity and the recruitment of glucose carriers by the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1554150300,"Escherichia coli DNA photolyase (photoreactivating enzyme) is a flavoprotein. The enzyme binds to DNA containing pyrimidine dimers in a light-independent step and, upon illumination with 300-600 nm radiation, catalyzes the photosensitized cleavage of the cyclobutane ring thus restoring the integrity of the DNA. We have studied the binding reaction using the techniques of nitrocellulose filter binding and flash photolysis. The enzyme binds to dimer-containing DNA with an association rate constant k1 estimated by two different methods to be 1.4 X 10(6) to 4.2 X 10(6) M-1 S-1. The dissociation of the enzyme from dimer-containing DNA displays biphasic kinetics; for the rapidly dissociating class of complexes k2 = 2-3 X 10(-2) S-1, while for the more slowly dissociating class k2 = 1.3 X 10(-3) to 6 X 10(-4) S-1. The equilibrium association constant KA, as determined by the nitrocellulose filter binding assay and the flash photolysis assay, was 4.7 X 10(7) to 6 X 10(7) M-1, in reasonable agreement with the values predicted from k1 and k2. From the dependence of the association constant on ionic strength we conclude that the enzyme contacts no more than two phosphodiester bonds upon binding; this strongly suggests that the pyrimidine dimer is the main structural determinant of specific photolyase-DNA interaction and that nonspecific ionic interactions do not contribute significantly to substrate binding."

https://openalex.org/W1629726870,"We have identified a genetic locus, pho4, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe which encodes a minor expressed cell surface acid phosphatase that is repressed by low concentrations (0.5 microM) of thiamin. The enzyme was purified from a strain that overproduces the enzyme. It is an Asn-linked glycoprotein. Removal of the carbohydrates by endoglycosidase H does not abolish enzymatic activity. The molecular mass of deglycosylated and unglycosylated enzyme that accumulates in membranes when cells are grown in the presence of tunicamycin is 56 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Thiamin regulation, at least in part, operates by reducing the level of pho4-mRNA. Pho4 is not genetically linked to the phosphate repressible acid phosphatase gene pho1. Phosphate and thiamin repressible acid phosphatase differ in their substrate specificity. Their protein moieties are immunologically related. Pho4 and pho1 are the only genes in S. pombe that express cell surface acid phosphatases being enzymatically active with nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. S. pombe is not unique in having a thiamin repressible acid phosphatase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae this enzyme is encoded by PHO3."
https://openalex.org/W1518833435,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is commonly used as an anesthetic agent. Prolonged exposure to N2O leads to megaloblastic anemia in humans and to loss of methionine synthase activity in vertebrates. We now report that purified preparations of cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.13) from both Escherichia coli and pig liver are irreversibly inactivated during turnover in buffers saturated with N2O. Inactivation by N2O occurs only in the presence of all components required for turnover: homocysteine, methyltetrahydrofolate, adenosylmethionine, and a reducing system. Reisolation of the inactivated E. coli enzyme after turnover in the presence of N2O resulted in significant losses of bound cobalamin and of protein as compared to controls where the enzyme was subjected to turnover in N2-equilibrated buffers before reisolation. However, N2O inactivation was not associated with major changes in the visible absorbance spectrum of the remaining enzyme-bound cobalamin. We postulate that N2O acts by one-electron oxidation of the cob(I)alamin form of the enzyme which is generated transiently during turnover with the formation of cob(II)alamin, N2, and hydroxyl radical. Generation of hydroxyl radical at the active site of the enzyme could explain the observed irreversible loss of enzyme activity."

An amino-terminal sequence and total amino acid composition of the purified AlkB protein were in accord with the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the alkB gene, determined by the phage M13 dideoxy method. It was concluded that the AlkB protein is comprised of 216 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 23,900. The nucleotide sequence analysis also revealed that the ada and alkB genes are adjacent on the E. coli chromosome and that the first initiation codon for AlkB protein overlaps with the termination codon for Ada protein. We constructed hybrid plasmids carrying an alkB'-lacZ' fusion, with or without the ada control region, and investigated expression of the alkB gene in response to the alkylating agent. We obtained evidence that the ada and alkB genes constitute an operon."

Folates were extracted from E. coli grown with [7-14C] p-aminobenzoate and cleaved to p-aminobenzoyl polyglutamates of varying chain lengths (pAB(Glu)n) by the method of Foo et al. (Foo, S. K., Cichowicz, D. J., and Shane, B. (1980) Anal. Biochem. 107, 109-115). The pAB(Glu)n derived from E. coli did not co-chromatograph with chemically synthesized pAB(gamma-Glu)n-Glu on several high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems, except for the triglutamate which did elute with pAB(gamma-Glu)2-Glu. E. coli-derived pAB(Glu)3-8 were purified by HPLC on C18 columns eluted with acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid, and the structures were determined through mass spectrometry, chiral amino acid analysis, and peptidase digestion experiments. Molecular weight determinations on the methyl ester derivatives of E. coli-derived pAB(Glu)n by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry and sequence analysis using collision-activated dissociation on a tandem mass spectrometer confirmed the structures as pAB(Glu)3-8. Chiral HPLC of hydrolyzed and dansylated E. coli-derived materials, on a beta-cyclodextrin column, identified the glutamate as the L-enantiomer. pAB(Glu)n were digested with carboxypeptidase Y, which specifically cleaved glutamates linked at their alpha-carboxyls; E. coli-derived pAB(Glu)4-8 (but not synthetic pAB(gamma-Glu1-6-Glu) were sequentially digested to pAB(gamma-Glu)2-Glu. Thus, in E. coli folylpolyglutamates, glutamate residues 4-8 were each linked to the polyglutamate chain at the alpha-carboxyl of the preceding glutamate."
https://openalex.org/W1511132416,"CheW is an essential component of the system which mediates chemotaxis in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of the cheW gene as well as the purification and characterization of the CheW protein. The DNA sequence predicts a protein of 18,000 molecular weight. The pure protein exhibits an apparent molecular weight of 18,000 during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Molecular sieve chromatography under nondenaturing conditions indicates a molecular weight of approximately 35,000, however. This result suggests that CheW is a homodimer. The predicted amino acid sequence between Thr-128 and Asp-160 fits a consensus exhibited by many proteins which bind purine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1560055314,"Abstract Insulin receptors from chicken liver and brain were studied following alterations in the nutritional state. Chickens were either fasted for 48 h, fasted for 48 h and then refed for 24 h, or fed a regular diet ad libitum. 125I-Porcine insulin binding was significantly elevated in liver membranes from the fasted animals and lowered in refed chickens when compared to preparations from ad libitum fed chickens. These changes in 125I-insulin binding were inversely related to the levels of plasma insulin and since receptor affinities for insulin were similar in each group, they probably represent alterations in receptor number. Apparent Mr of alpha subunits of the insulin receptors was unaffected by alterations in the nutritional states. The presence of ATPase-like activities that co-eluted with liver insulin receptors from wheat germ agglutinin lectin columns but not from pea lectin columns necessitated the use of both pea and wheat germ agglutinin for liver insulin receptor purification. The insulin receptors purified from both lectin columns were recognized by anti-insulin receptor antiserum and had similar affinities for insulin which were unaltered by the nutritional state. Insulin-stimulatable autophosphorylation of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor was lower in livers from fasted chickens and intermediate in refed chickens. Furthermore, basal and insulin-induced phosphorylation of the artificial substrate poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 was significantly less in the fasting state and intermediate in the refed state compared to the ad libitum fed state. Insulin sensitivity (measured as the dose of insulin required for 50% maximal stimulation of kinase activity) was similar in all three states suggesting that the differences in insulin-induced phosphorylation are due to a change in maximal stimulation and not a change in insulin sensitivity. In contrast to the alterations seen with liver receptors, brain insulin receptors were unaffected by these alterations in nutritional state. These findings suggest that: liver insulin receptors are affected by altering the nutritional state; insulin binding to liver membranes is inversely related to plasma insulin levels; and tyrosine kinase is decreased both in fasted and refed animals suggesting an uncoupling of the normal interaction between alpha subunit and beta subunit in liver insulin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1542742832,"Extracts of Escherichia coli contained an enzymatic activity which catalyzed the addition of L-glutamate to the alpha-carboxyl of various polyglutamate substrates, including folylpolyglutamates. Much of the enzyme activity was separated by DE52 chromatography and gel filtration from the enzyme which adds the first three glutamates in the biosynthesis of folylpolyglutamates, dihydrofolate synthetase-folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The two enzyme activities differed in many properties. Whereas dihydrofolate synthetase-folylpolyglutamate synthetase preferred pteroate or pteroylmonoglutamate substrates, the folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase preparations effectively utilized tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates, pteroylpolyglutamates, p-aminobenzoylpolyglutamates (pAB(Glu)n), and even a polyglutamate tripeptide. Several di- and triglutamyl peptides were inhibitory to folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase activity, but not to dihydrofolate synthetase-folylpolyglutamate synthetase. Conversely, dihydropteroate noncompetitively inhibits the folylpolyglutamate synthetase reaction of the dihydrofolate synthetase-folylpolyglutamate synthetase protein, but did not inhibit the folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase reaction. Potassium chloride was inhibitory to folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase activity (as were other salts and several polyanions), in contrast to the absolute requirement of dihydrofolate synthetase-folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity for a monovalent cation such as K+. Incubation of a folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase preparation with (6S)-tetrahydropteroyltri(gamma)glutamate generated products which after chemical cleavage to pAB(Glu)n were identical to those from growing E. coli, in high performance liquid chromatography retention times and in pattern of digestion by alpha-COOH bond-specific carboxypeptidase Y. High performance liquid chromatography and mass spectral analysis of the products of the in vitro reactions of folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase with several substrates also demonstrated the addition of glutamate residues via alpha-COOH linkages. Thus, there appear to be two folylpolyglutamate synthetase activities in E. coli, dihydrofolate synthetase-folylpolyglutamate synthetase which adds the first three glutamate residues by gamma-COOH linkages and the folylpoly-alpha-glutamate synthetase activity which extends the folylpolyglutamate chain via gamma-COOH peptide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1515219794,"Angiotensinogen gene expression has a broad tissue specificity. Whereas angiotensinogen mRNA is undetectable in normal rat pancreas, we have identified angiotensinogen mRNA in all tumors and cell lines derived from a rat islet cell line, RIN-r. A subclone with the highest angiotensinogen mRNA levels, 1056A, secreted N-glycosylated angiotensinogen. Angiotensinogen mRNA of 1056A cells was approximately 200 nucleotides longer than that of liver, and this was shown to be due to an extension of the 3'-untranslated region. Dexamethasone increased angiotensinogen mRNA levels approximately 9-fold above control, and this increase was linear over 110 h, indicating a half-life of greater than 55 h for angiotensinogen mRNA during dexamethasone induction. This effect of dexamethasone was inhibited by the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 38486. Dexamethasone increased angiotensinogen gene transcription approximately 5-fold in a nuclear run-on assay. These results demonstrate that dexamethasone induction of angiotensinogen mRNA levels in 1056A cells is due, at least in part, to a transcriptional response and that 1056A cells will be useful for the study of angiotensinogen gene regulation and the identification of glucocorticoid regulatory sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1924519659,"We report here by using stopped-flow fluorometry with three different fluorescent probes that a serine protease triggers the initial step of transmembrane signalling in cytotoxic T cells. When cytotoxic T cells (mouse LC7, H-2b anti H-2d) bound to the specific target cells (mouse mastocytoma P815, H-2d), cytotoxic T cells first increased their membrane fluidity, and calcium then was released from intracellular stores. After that, there was a calcium influx from the external medium into the T cells. All of these steps, however, were blocked by serine protease inhibitors (soybean trypsin inhibitor, N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone). Bovine pancreatic trypsin and chymotrypsin in the external medium mimicked the signalling events which were triggered by the serine protease on the T cell surfaces. From the reaction time (within 1 s) and its specificity, this serine protease in cytotoxic T cells was considered to be different from a protease which works at the killing stage."
https://openalex.org/W1531735209,"Methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS, 2 X 75 kDa) was purified to homogeneity from an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB8. The polypeptide chain of MetRS was cleaved by limited digestion with trypsin into four domains: T1 (29 kDa), T2 (23 kDa), T3 (14.5 kDa), and T4 (7.5 kDa), which were aligned in that order. MetRS was also cleaved into similar fragments with a variety of other proteases. Domains T1, T2, T3, and T4 were isolated by column chromatography. Tandem T1-T2 (56 kDa) is fully active in the aminoacylation of tRNA and is further cleaved with trypsin into domains T1 and T2. Domain T1 is the smallest aminoacylation unit so far reported. Domain T2 (enzymatically inactive) interacts with tRNAMetf, as found by UV-induced cross-linking. Isolated domain T3 forms a dimer and is responsible for the dimer assembly of two protomers in MetRS. Domain T4 is a flexible tail of MetRS. These domains, in particular T1 and T2, will be important for detailed structure analyses in relation to aminoacylation activity."
https://openalex.org/W1563473939,"Peroxisomes have been purified from Candida tropicalis grown on oleic acid and shown to be nearly pure by marker enzyme analysis, electron microscopy, and comparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They contain approximately 20 polypeptides, among which acyl-CoA oxidase, trifunctional hydratase-dehydrogenase-epimerase, and catalase have been identified. Rabbit antisera have been elicited that react with these three proteins. When C. tropicalis is grown on alkanes, a dozen mRNAs are strikingly induced. Nine of the 12 induced mRNAs code for polypeptides that comigrate in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with peroxisomal proteins, among which three have been identified immunochemically as the acyl-CoA oxidase, the trifunctional protein, and catalase. These results indicate that some genes coding for peroxisomal proteins are strongly expressed during growth of C. tropicalis on alkanes. The data are consistent with evidence in other species that peroxisomes form by the post-translational incorporation of newly made proteins into pre-existing peroxisomes, generally without proteolytic processing, followed by peroxisome division."
https://openalex.org/W1498289098,"Ricin is a heterodimeric toxin of the form AB, where B is a lectin which binds cell surfaces, triggering endocytosis. The B chain then aids the A chain in escaping from the endosome. The A chain enzymatically attacks and inactivates ribosomes, thereby killing the intoxicated cell. We have recently solved the three-dimensional structure of whole ricin. Here we report that the A chain, expressed from a gene cloned into Escherichia coli has been crystallized in a suitable form for high resolution x-ray analysis. The crystals are monoclinic space group P2(1) with a = 42.6, b = 68.1, c = 50.2 A and beta = 112.9 degrees. There is evidence that the A chain undergoes a conformational change, resulting in activation, when it is released from the B chain. Comparison of the two structures should facilitate an analysis of this process."
https://openalex.org/W2149180296,"Derivatization of Tyr198 in carboxypeptidase A (CPA) results in lowered catalytic activity toward peptide substrates (Cueni, L., and Riordan, J.F. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 1834-1842). We have synthesized via directed mutagenesis a rat CPA variant [Phe198] CPA containing a Tyr198-to-Phe substitution in order to test whether the phenolic hydroxyl plays a critical role in catalysis. A double mutant [Phe193, Phe248]CPA in which both Tyr198 and Tyr248 have been replaced by phenylalanine has also been engineered. Enzymatic characterization of [Phe198]CPA indicates that the Tyr198 hydroxyl is not obligatory for the hydrolysis of peptide and ester substrates. Furthermore, parallel studies with [Phe198, Phe248]CPA show that simultaneous removal of both the Tyr198 and Tyr248 hydroxyls does not abolish catalytic activity. Analysis of the acetylated derivatives of [Phe198]CPA, [Phe248]CPA, and [Phe198, Phe248]CPA establishes that Tyr198 and Tyr248 are the active site tyrosines which are modified by N-acetylimidazole. In addition, the perturbations of enzymatic activity which accompany acetylation of native CPA can be largely assigned to derivatization of Tyr248. The changes in the kinetic constants of substrate hydrolysis due to the Tyr198-to-Phe substitution are manifested as small decreases in the kcat values, but the Km values are essentially unaffected. This exclusive effect on the kcat values suggests that the Tyr198 hydroxyl participates in catalysis by stabilizing the rate-determining transition-state complex."
https://openalex.org/W1580690560,"Abstract The human gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) precursor consists of the GnRH sequence followed by a 59-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension. A 56-amino acid peptide within this extension has been shown to stimulate gonadotropin release, and this activity has been localized to its amino-terminal region. A series of seven overlapping peptide fragments corresponding to the first 24 amino acids of the carboxyl-extension of the GnRH precursor were synthesized and tested for their ability to stimulate luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone release from cultured human anterior pituitary cells. All active peptide fragments were found to incorporate the decapeptide sequence Asn-Leu-Ile-Asp-Ser-Phe-Gln-Glu-Ile-Val which is regarded as a minimal structural requirement delineated for gonadotropin-releasing activity. A further flanking sequence extending this active region from its carboxyl terminus was found to enhance gonadotropin-releasing activity although the flanking sequence itself was inactive. The gonadotropin release stimulated by the active peptides wa shown to be a dose- dependent, specific, and calcium-dependent phenomenon which occurred independently of the GnRH receptor on the pituitary gonadotrophs as a GnRH antagonist did not inhibit activity."
https://openalex.org/W1577744900,"We report an example of the enzymic cleavage of an apoprotein B (apoB), the main apoprotein in the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) of laying hens' blood, in a normal biological process, the formation of egg yolk. Plasma VLDL was labeled in vivo with 3H-amino acids, isolated by centrifuging, and injected into another laying hen. Yolk VLDL was isolated and its apoproteins were separated. ApoB was not detected in this lipoprotein. Most of the label originally in apoB was distributed among four smaller yolk apoproteins, apovitellenins III to VI, which are a large proportion of the apoproteins of VLDL in yolk. This distribution of 3H suggested that 80% of apoB was cleaved at three places. One yolk apoprotein, apovitellenin II, was not labeled, indicating that it did not originate from an apoprotein in plasma VLDL. The site for cleavage of apoB in the ovarian tissue has not been determined, but cleavage may occur during receptor-mediated endocytosis. The pattern of cleavage of apoB during transfer to yolk was not imitated by some known proteolytic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1503778801,"A kinetic study was carried out to assess the stability of the intracellular signal(s) generated by insulin in quiescent cells for the stimulation of DNA synthesis. Using murine lens epithelial cells and Swiss 3T3 cells in culture, it was found that insulin stimulated DNA synthesis after a lag of 14.5 h. If, however, 6 h after the addition of insulin to the cells, the insulin-containing media were totally removed, followed by the addition of fresh media (even if insulin was returned to the medium within approximately 10 min), a 14.5-h lag still remained after insulin readdition before DNA synthesis started. In another set of experiments, the insulin was removed after 6 h by diluting its concentration approximately 60,000-fold. In this case, if insulin was at the diluted concentration for approximately 60 min before being added back, a full 14.5 h was necessary for the start of DNA synthesis. The half-time for loss of signal was 2 +/- 1 min for total washout and 18.4 +/- 0.5 min for the dilution experiment. These results indicate that the intracellular signal(s) for DNA synthesis produced by the binding of insulin to its cellular receptor are extremely transitory in nature. The signal disappears at approximately the same rate that insulin dissociates from the receptor. Thus, insulin must be constantly binding to the membrane receptor in order to keep the key signal(s) at a high enough level for the cell to progress on to S phase. Early events, such as specific protein synthesis, changes in ion flux, changes in cellular metabolism, and changes in cellular pH, may be essential, but they are not sufficient to cause a cell to progress on to S phase. Addition of sodium vanadate to the cell is found to stabilize the messenger such that there is no loss of signal when insulin is removed. These data are consistent with the tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor or a product of its action being the signal."
https://openalex.org/W1529453228,"The x-ray structure of the unliganded aspartate transcarbamylase reveals that Arg-113 of the catalytic chain is involved in an important set of interactions at the interface between the catalytic and regulatory subunits (Honzatko, R.B., Crawford, J.L., Monaco, H.L., Ladner, J.E., Edwards, B.F.P., Evans, D.R., Warren, S.G., Wiley, D.C., Ladner, R.C., and Lipscomb, W. N. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 160, 219-263). In order to disturb this interaction, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to replace Arg-113 with glycine. This modification results in a substantial weakening of the interface between the catalytic and regulatory subunits leading to a high tendency for dissociation. The unliganded mutant enzyme exhibits a pH dependence and a sensitivity toward mercurials analogous to that obtained for the relaxed conformation of the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, the presence of saturating concentrations of aspartate is accompanied by only a slight shift in the optimal pH for activity. The bisubstrate analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate induces a 2-fold increase in the sulfhydryl reactivity as compared to the 4-fold increase observed for the wild-type enzyme. Despite this change in the interactions at the interface between the catalytic and regulatory subunits, the mutant enzyme still retains homotropic and heterotropic effects and exhibits a normal affinity for aspartate. Together these data show that a substantial weakening of the catalytic-regulatory interface can occur without altering the allosteric properties of the enzyme. These results also indicate that the intersubunit interactions involving Arg-113, between the polar domain of the catalytic chain and the zinc domain of the regulatory chain, do not participate in the homotropic cooperativity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1519917963,"The specific interaction of yeast citrate synthase with yeast mitochondrial inner membranes was characterized with respect to saturability of binding, pH optimum, effect of ionic strength, temperature response, and inhibition by oxalacetate. The binding ability of the inner membranes is inhibited by proteolysis and heat treatment, which implies that the membrane component(s) responsible for binding is a protein. A protein fraction from inner membranes when added to liposomes will bind citrate synthase. In addition, the binding of yeast fumarase, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase to yeast inner membranes was examined. For these studies the yeast mitochondrial matrix enzymes, citrate synthase (from two types of yeast), malate dehydrogenase, and fumarase, as well as cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, were purified using rapid new techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2120738980,"The CheB methylesterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamyl methyl esters in bacterial chemoreceptor proteins. Studies with residue-specific inhibitors suggest that a cysteine residue is required. The nucleotide sequence of the cheB gene predicts a 349-amino acid protein with cysteine residues at positions 207 and 309. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to change each cysteine to an alanine. Whereas the Cys207-Ala mutation had essentially no effect on esterase activity, the Cys309-Ala mutation caused a complete inactivation of the enzyme. Cys309 is located adjacent to a sequence of amino acids which is characteristic of the beta-alpha-beta motif found in a number of nucleotide binding proteins associated with receptor function in vertebrate tissues. A central feature of this structure is Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly. Mutation of the second glycine in this region (Gly284) to a valine also caused a complete loss of esterase activity."

Steady-state analysis gives a Vmax of 1.5 mumol min-1 mg-1, 9% of the value with MgATP as substrate, and indicates that ATP gamma S binds as tightly (based on Km and Ki versus ATP) to rho as does ATP. (gamma-S)[beta gamma-17O,gamma-17O,gamma-18O]ATP gamma S was used as substrate to produce chiral product inorganic [17O,18O]thiophosphate and determine the stereochemical course of the hydrolysis. The results of this determination, inversion at the thiophosphoryl phosphorus, indicate that the enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP by rho consists of a direct transfer of the phospho group to water without the existence of a phosphoenzyme or phospho-RNA intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1544634331,"The structural gene encoding a mutant Escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase deficient in regulation by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-P2) was isolated from total E. coli PpcI genomic DNA. This mutant gene is located on a 4.4-kilobase SalI DNA fragment which, when ligated to SalI-digested pBR322, resulted in the generation of the plasmid pFS16. Detailed restriction mapping of the wild-type and mutant genes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase revealed the presence of a ClaI restriction site at position 563 of the mutant gene only. This ClaI site is located on a 289 PvuII/DdeI fragment which codes for amino acid residues 174-270 of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase enzyme. When this portion of the mutant gene is present in chimeras of the wild-type and mutant genes, the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase produced cannot be activated by Fru-P2. The mutation resulting in the generation of the ClaI site in the mutant gene has also resulted in an amino acid substitution at residue 188; threonine in the wild-type enzyme has been replaced by isoleucine in the mutant enzyme. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of this 289-base pair PvuII/DdeI region of the mutant gene with its homologous region in the wild-type gene verified that this mutation, which resulted in the generation of the ClaI site, is the only change that has occurred on this 289-base pair fragment of the mutant gene, and thus the amino acid replacement of threonine by isoleucine is the only change that could be linked to the inability of the mutant enzyme to be activated by Fru-P2."

Subcomplexes were prepared in vitro by incubating the resolved E2, a 24-subunit cube-shaped molecule, with E1 (dimeric). The morphology and mass of the subcomplexes were determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained and of freeze-dried specimens. Images of both negative stained and freeze-dried subcomplexes were consistent with E1 binding at or near the midpoints of the edges of the E2 molecule. Mass analysis of the freeze-dried specimen showed that at least 95% of E1 remains in the dimeric state (or as two closely juxtaposed monomers) when it binds to E2."
