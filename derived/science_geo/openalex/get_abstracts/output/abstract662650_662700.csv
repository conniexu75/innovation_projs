https://openalex.org/W3097338697,"Low concordance between studies that examine the role of microbiota in human diseases is a pervasive challenge that limits the capacity to identify causal relationships between host-associated microorganisms and pathology. The risk of obtaining false positives is exacerbated by wide interindividual heterogeneity in microbiota composition1, probably due to population-wide differences in human lifestyle and physiological variables2 that exert differential effects on the microbiota. Here we infer the greatest, generalized sources of heterogeneity in human gut microbiota profiles and also identify human lifestyle and physiological characteristics that, if not evenly matched between cases and controls, confound microbiota analyses to produce spurious microbial associations with human diseases. We identify alcohol consumption frequency and bowel movement quality as unexpectedly strong sources of gut microbiota variance that differ in distribution between healthy participants and participants with a disease and that can confound study designs. We demonstrate that for numerous prevalent, high-burden human diseases, matching cases and controls for confounding variables reduces observed differences in the microbiota and the incidence of spurious associations. On this basis, we present a list of host variables that we recommend should be captured in human microbiota studies for the purpose of matching comparison groups, which we anticipate will increase robustness and reproducibility in resolving the members of the gut microbiota that are truly associated with human disease."
https://openalex.org/W3095310253,"Lymphotoxin β-receptor (LTβR) signalling promotes lymphoid neogenesis and the development of tertiary lymphoid structures1,2, which are associated with severe chronic inflammatory diseases that span several organ systems3–6. How LTβR signalling drives chronic tissue damage particularly in the lung, the mechanism(s) that regulate this process, and whether LTβR blockade might be of therapeutic value have remained unclear. Here we demonstrate increased expression of LTβR ligands in adaptive and innate immune cells, enhanced non-canonical NF-κB signalling, and enriched LTβR target gene expression in lung epithelial cells from patients with smoking-associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and from mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke. Therapeutic inhibition of LTβR signalling in young and aged mice disrupted smoking-related inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, induced regeneration of lung tissue, and reverted airway fibrosis and systemic muscle wasting. Mechanistically, blockade of LTβR signalling dampened epithelial non-canonical activation of NF-κB, reduced TGFβ signalling in airways, and induced regeneration by preventing epithelial cell death and activating WNT/β-catenin signalling in alveolar epithelial progenitor cells. These findings suggest that inhibition of LTβR signalling represents a viable therapeutic option that combines prevention of tertiary lymphoid structures1 and inhibition of apoptosis with tissue-regenerative strategies. Blockade of lymphotoxin β-receptor (LTβR) signalling restores WNT signalling and epithelial repair in a model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
https://openalex.org/W3097534263,"Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by the activation of cardiac fibroblasts and accumulation of extracellular matrix. METTL3, a component of methyltransferase complex, participates in multiple biological processes associated with mammalian development and disease progression. However, the role of METTL3 in cardiac fibrosis is still unknown. We performed fibroblasts activation with TGF-β1 (20 ng/mL) in vitro and established in vivo mouse models with lentivirus to assess the effects of METTL3 on cardiac fibroblasts proliferation and collagen formation. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) was used to define the potential fibrosis-regulated gene. The expression level of METTL3 was increased in cardiac fibrotic tissue of mice with chronic myocardial infarction and cultured cardiac fibroblats (CFs) treated with TGF-β1. Enforced expression of METTL3 promoted proliferation and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and collagens accumulation, while silence of METTL3 did the opposite. Silence of METTL3 by lentivirus carrying METTL3 siRNA markedly alleviated cardiac fibrosis in MI mice. Transcriptome and N6-methyladenosine (m6 A) profiling analyses revealed that the expression and m6 A level of collagen-related genes were altered after silence of METTL3. METTL3-mediated m6 A modification is critical for the development of cardiac fibrosis, providing a molecular target for manipulating fibrosis and the associated cardiac diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3097395693,"Transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 are aerosol, droplet and touching infected material. The diffusion of the virus contagion among people is easier in indoor location, but direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in air or on surfaces is quite sparse, especially regarding public transport, while it would be important to know how and if it is safe to use them. To answer these questions we analysed the air and the surfaces most usually touched by passengers inside a city bus during normal operation, in order to understand the possible spreading of the virus and the effectiveness of the protective measures. The measurements were carried out across the last week of the lockdown and the first week when, gradually, all the travel restrictions were removed. The air and surface samples were analysed with the RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. After two weeks of measurements and more than 1100 passenger travelling on the bus the virus was never detected both on surfaces and on air, suggesting that the precautions adopted on public transportation are effective in reducing the COVID-19 spreading."
https://openalex.org/W3097360030,"Objective There is dearth of information on the timeliness of antenatal care (ANC) uptake. This study aimed to determine the timely ANC uptake by a medically trained provider (MTP) as per the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and the country guideline. Methods Cross-sectional survey was done with 2,731 women having livebirth outcome in last one year in Dinajpur, Nilphamari and Rajshahi districts, Bangladesh from August-November,2016. Results About 82%(2,232) women received at least one ANC from a MTP. Overall, 78%(2,142) women received 4 or more ANCs by any provider and 43%(1168) from a MTP. Only 14%(378) women received their first ANC at the 1 st trimester by a MTP. As per 4 schedule visits by the WHO FANC model and the country guideline 8%(203) and 20%(543) women respectively received the first 2 timely ANC by a MTP; where only 1%(32) and 3%(72) received the first 3 visits timely and 0.6%(17) and 1%(29) received all the four timely visits. Factors significantly associated with the first two timely visits are: 10 or above years of schooling of women [adj. OR 2.13 (CI: 1.05, 4.30)] and their husbands [adj. OR 2.40 (CI: 1.31, 4.38)], women’s employment [adj. OR 2.32 (CI: 1.43, 3.76)], urban residential status [adj. OR 3.49 (CI: 2.46, 4.95)] and exposure to mass media [adj. OR 1.58 (CI: 1.07, 2.34)] at 95% confidence interval. According to the 2016 WHO ANC model, only 1.5%(40) women could comply with the first two ANC contacts timely by a MTP and no one could comply with all the timely 8 contacts. Conclusion Despite high coverage of ANC utilization, timely ANC visit is low as per both the WHO recommendations and the country guideline. For better understanding, further studies on the timeliness of ANC coverage are required to design feasible intervention for improving maternal and child health."
https://openalex.org/W3097274327,"The COVID-19 is rapidly scattering worldwide, and the number of cases in the Eastern Mediterranean Region is rising. Thus, there is a need for immediate targeted actions. We designed a longitudinal study in a hot outbreak zone to analyze the serial findings between infected patients for detecting temporal changes from February 2020. In a hospital-based open-cohort study, patients are followed from admission until one year from their discharge (the 1st, 4th, 12th weeks, and the first year). The patient recruitment phase finished at the end of August 2020, and the follow-up continues by the end of August 2021. The measurements included demographic, socio-economics, symptoms, health service diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and psychological variables. The signs improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were considered primary, and impaired pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were considered main secondary outcomes. Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory functions are being determined in such follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, 490 patients with complete information (39% female; the average age of 57±15 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these patients died. The three main leading causes of admission were: fever (77%), dry cough (73%), and fatigue (69%). The most prevalent comorbidities between COVID-19 patients were hypertension (35%), diabetes (28%), and ischemic heart disease (14%). The percentage of primary composite endpoints (PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit was 18%. The Cox Proportional-Hazards Model for PCEP indicated the following significant risk factors: Oxygen saturation &lt; 80% (HR = 6.3; [CI 95%: 2.5,15.5]), lymphopenia (HR = 3.5; [CI 95%: 2.2,5.5]), Oxygen saturation 80%-90% (HR = 2.5; [CI 95%: 1.1,5.8]), and thrombocytopenia (HR = 1.6; [CI 95%: 1.1,2.5]). This long-term prospective Cohort may support healthcare professionals in the management of resources following this pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3094815618,"Kuwait is a country with a very high dust loading; in fact it bears the world’s highest particulate matter concentration in the outdoor air. The airborne dust often has associated biological materials, including pathogenic microbes that pose a serious risk to the urban ecosystem and public health. This study has established the baseline taxonomic characterization of microbes associated with dust transported into Kuwait from different trajectories. A high volume air sampler with six-stage cascade impactor was deployed for sample collection at a remote as well as an urban site. Samples from three different seasons (autumn, spring and summer) were subjected to targeted amplicon sequencing. A set of ~ 50 and 60 bacterial and fungal genera, respectively, established the core air microbiome. The predominant bacterial genera (relative abundance ≥ 1%) were Brevundimonas (12.5%), Sphingobium (3.3%), Sphingopyxis (2.7%), Pseudomonas (2.5%), Sphingomonas (2.4%), Massilia (2.3%), Acidovorax (2.0%), Allorhizobium (1.8%), Halomonas (1.3%), and Mesorhizobium (1.1%), and the fungal taxa were Cryptococcus (12%) followed by Alternaria (9%), Aspergillus (7%), Candida (3%), Cladosporium (2.9%), Schizophyllum (1.6%), Fusarium (1.4%), Gleotinia (1.3%) and Penicillium (1.15%). Significant spatio-temporal variations were recorded in terms of relative abundances, α-diversities, and β-diversities of bacterial communities. The dissimilarities were less pronounced and instead the communities were fairly homogenous. Linear discrimant analysis revealed three fungal genera known to be significantly differentially abundant with respect to different size fractions of dust. Our results shed light on the spatio-temporal distribution of airborne microbes and their implications in general health."
https://openalex.org/W3097063644,"Objectives This study aimed to examine patterns and determinants of modern contraceptive discontinuation among women in Kenya. Methods Secondary analysis was conducted using national representative Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys of 2003, 2008/9, and 2014. These household cross-sectional surveys targeted women of reproductive age from 15 to 49 years who had experienced an episode of modern contraceptive use within five years preceding the surveys from 2003 (n = 2686), 2008/9 (n = 2992), and 2014 (5919). The contraceptive discontinuation rate was defined as the number of episodes discontinued divided by the total number of episodes. Weighted descriptive statistics, multivariable logistic regression analysis, and Cox proportional hazards analysis were used to examine the determinants of contraceptive discontinuation. Results The 12-month contraceptive discontinuation rate for all methods declined from 37.5% in 2003 and 36.7% in 2008/9 to 30.5% in 2014. Consistently across the three surveys, intrauterine devices had the lowest 12-month discontinuation rate (6.4% in 2014) followed by implants (8.0%, in 2014). In 2014, higher rates were seen for pills (44.9%) and male condoms (42.9%). The determinants of contraceptive discontinuation among women of reproductive age in the 2003 survey included users of short-term contraception methods, specifically for those who used male condoms (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.13–5.11) and pills (HR = 2.68; 95CI = 1.79–4.00); and younger women aged 15–19 year (HR = 2.07; 95% CI = 1.49–2.87) and 20–24 years (HR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.61–2.35). The trends in the most common reasons for discontinuation from 2003 to 2014 revealed an increase among those reporting side effects (p = 0.0002) and those wanting a more effective method (p&lt;0.0001). A decrease was noted among those indicating method failure (p&lt;0.0001) and husband disapproval (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions Family planning programs should focus on improving service quality to strengthen the continuation of contraceptive use among those in need. Women should be informed about potential side effects and reassured on health concerns, including being provided options for method switching. The health system should avail a wider range of contraceptive methods and ensure a constant supply of commodities for women to choose from. Short-term contraceptive method users and younger women may need greater support for continued use."
https://openalex.org/W3095834558,"Kaempferol, a natural flavonoid compound, possesses potent myocardial protective property in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. The present study was aimed to explore whether miR-21 contributes to the cardioprotective effect of kaempferol on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9c2 cell injury via regulating Notch/phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)/Akt signaling pathway. Results revealed that kaempferol obviously attenuates H/R-induced the damages of H9c2 cells as evidence by the up-regulation of cell viability, the down-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, the reduction of apoptosis rate and pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) expression, and the increases of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) expression. In addition, kaempferol enhanced miR-21 level in H9c2 cells exposed to H/R, and inhibition of miR-21 induced by transfection with miR-21 inhibitor significantly blocked the protection of kaempferol against H/R-induced H9c2 cell injury. Furthermore, kaempferol eliminated H/R-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory response as illustrated by the decreases in reactive oxygen species generation and malondialdehyde content, the increases in antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, the decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level, while these effects of kaempferol were all reversed by miR-21 inhibitor. Moreover, results elicited that kaempferol remarkably blocks H/R-induced the down-regulation of Notch1 expression, the up-regulation of PTEN expression, and the reduction of P-Akt/Akt, indicating that kaempferol promotes Notch1/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, and knockdown of Notch1/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway induced by Notch1 siRNA also abolished the protection of kaempferol against H/R-induced the damage of H9c2 cells. Notably, miR-21 inhibitor alleviated the promotion of kaempferol on Notch/PTEN/Akt signaling pathways in H9c2 cells exposed to H/R. Taken together, these above findings suggested thatmiR-21 mediates the protection of kaempferol against H/R-induced H9c2 cell injuryvia promoting Notch/PTEN/Akt signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3088692141,"The 2013-15 Ebola epidemic in West Africa was the largest so far recorded, and mainly affected three adjacent countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The worst affected country (in terms of confirmed cases) was Sierra Leone. The present paper looks at the epidemic in Sierra Leone. The epidemic in this country was a concatenation of local outbreaks. These local outbreaks are not well characterized through analysis using standard numerical techniques. In part, this reflects difficulties in record collection at the height of the epidemic. This paper offers a different approach, based on application of field-based techniques of social investigation that provide a richer understanding of the epidemic.In a post-epidemic study (2016-18) of two districts (Bo and Moyamba) we use ethnographic data to reconstruct local infection pathways from evidence provided by affected communities, cross-referenced to records of the epidemic retained by the National Ebola Response Commission, now lodged in the Ebola Museum and Archive at Njala University. Our study documents and discusses local social and contextual factors largely missing from previously published studies.Our major finding is that the epidemic in Sierra Leone was a series of local outbreaks, some of which were better contained than others. In those that were not well contained, a number of contingent factors helps explain loss of control. Several numerical studies have drawn attention to the importance of local heterogeneities in the Sierra Leone Ebola epidemic. Our qualitative study throws specific light on a number of elements that explain these heterogeneities: the role of externalities, health system deficiencies, cultural considerations and local coping capacities.Social issues and local contingencies explain the spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone and are key to understanding heterogeneities in epidemiological data. Integrating ethnographic research into epidemic-response is critical to properly understand the patterns of spread and the opportunities to intervene. This conclusion has significant implications for future interdisciplinary research and interpretation of standard numerical data, and consequently for control of epidemic outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3094728966,"Pakistan’s total estimated snow leopard habitat is about 80,000 km 2 of which about half is considered prime habitat. However, this preliminary demarcation was not always in close agreement with the actual distribution—the discrepancy may be huge at the local and regional level. Recent technological developments like camera trapping and molecular genetics allow for collecting reliable presence records that could be used to construct realistic species distribution based on empirical data and advanced mathematical approaches like MaxEnt. The current study followed this approach to construct an accurate distribution of the species in Pakistan. Moreover, movement corridors, among different landscapes, were also identified through circuit theory. The probability of habitat suitability, generated from 98 presence points and 11 environmental variables, scored the snow leopard’s assumed range in Pakistan, from 0 to 0.97. A large portion of the known range represented low-quality habitat, including areas in lower Chitral, Swat, Astore, and Kashmir. Conversely, Khunjerab, Misgar, Chapursan, Qurumber, Broghil, and Central Karakoram represented high-quality habitats. Variables with higher contributions in the MaxEnt model were precipitation during the driest month (34%), annual mean temperature (19.5%), mean diurnal range of temperature (9.8%), annual precipitation (9.4%), and river density (9.2). The model was validated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots and defined thresholds. The average test AUC in Maxent for the replicate runs was 0.933 while the value of AUC by ROC curve calculated at 0.15 threshold was 1.00. These validation tests suggested a good model fit and strong predictive power. The connectivity analysis revealed that the population in the Hindukush landscape appears to be more connected with the population in Afghanistan as compared to other populations in Pakistan. Similarly, the Pamir-Karakoram population is better connected with China and Tajikistan, while the Himalayan population was connected with the population in India. Based on our findings we propose three model landscapes to be considered under the Global Snow Leopard Ecosystem Protection Program (GSLEP) agenda as regional priority areas, to safeguard the future of the snow leopard in Pakistan and the region. These landscapes fall within mountain ranges of the Himalaya, Hindu Kush and Karakoram-Pamir, respectively. We also identified gaps in the existing protected areas network and suggest new protected areas in Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan to protect critical habitats of snow leopard in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W3096278450,"To evaluate the pharmacist’s preparedness against the COVID-19 during its rapid rise period in Pakistan, an online cross-sectional study was carried out from March 30 to May 22, 2020 among the pharmacists using a pre-validated self-administered questionnaire. A total of 1149 participants completed the survey, amongst which 430(37.9%) were working as retail pharmacists, 216 (18.8%) as community pharmacists, and 213(18.5%) as hospital pharmacists. The mean COVID-19 knowledge score of the participants was 6.77±0.5, which indicated that 84% of them had good knowledge about COVID-19. The multiple linear regression model revealed that attitude was significantly associated with gender (p = 0.001), marital status (p&lt;0.0001) and resident (p = 0.013). The mean practice score was 2.85±0.4, showing that 94% of the participants were following adequate preventive practices against this infection. The results from this study suggest that Pharmacists demonstrated good knowledge, positive attitudes, and acceptable practices regarding COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3097568303,"In this study, municipal solid waste bottom ash (MSW-BA) and fly ash (MSW-FA) were used as a source of aluminosilicate to prepare geopolymer (GEO) adsorbents (GEO-MSWBA and GEO-MSWFA) for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from water. The effects of temperature, pH, and initial concentration on the MB adsorption onto GEO-MSWBA and GEO-MSWFA were evaluated. The adsorption isotherms parameters and thermodynamics were also determined. Detailed physical and chemical characterizations of the prepared adsorbents were carried out to further understand their impact on MB adsorption. The results from the scanning electron microscopy revealed a uniform granule-sphere like structure on both prepared geopolymers, which would facilitate the MB adsorption onto the adsorbents. The X-ray diffraction allowed observation of the microstructural transformations that occur after the alkaline activation. The surface areas of the GEO-MSWBA and the GEO-MSWFA were recorded as 32.78 m 2 /g and 4.5 m 2 /g, respectively. From the Fourier transform infrared, a stretching vibration of the aluminosilicate tetrahedral was observed, which indicated the success of geopolymerization. The prepared geopolymers showed a high capability of MB adsorption from an aqueous solution. The adsorption process was best suited and explained using the Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 666.7 mg/g for the GEO-MSWBA (at 25°C) and 769.2 mg/g for the GEO-MSWFA (at 35°C). The positive value of the enthalpy (ΔH o ) for the GEO-MSWBA suggested the reaction favored endothermic reaction while the negative value of entropy (Δ S o ) indicated a solid/liquid random interaction. On the other hand, the negative ΔH o value for the GEO-MSWFA indicated the reaction followed an exothermic reaction causing energy to be released, the positive Δ S o value indicated a good affinity at the solid-liquid surface. The overall negative value for Gibbs free energy (Δ G o ) for both adsorbents suggested the adsorption was spontaneous and feasible. It was also inferred that n - π interaction, direct and indirect hydrogen bond, and electrostatic interaction between the MB and the prepared geopolymers facilitated the adsorption process. The current study shows that the GEO-MSWBA and the GEO-MSWFA have a great potential of removing MB as a cationic dye from water without performing any sort of laborious pretreatments."
https://openalex.org/W3096526114,"Introduction Cervical cancer is a global leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The majority of cervical cancer deaths occur in developing countries including Nepal. Though knowledge of cervical cancer is an important determinant of women’s participation in prevention and screening for cervical cancer, little is known about this topic in Nepal. This study explores the experiences of cervical cancer survivors and assesses the attitude of family and community towards it and stigma related to this disease in Bharatpur, Nepal. Methods The study design was qualitative methods involving two focus-group discussions. A total of 17 cervical cancer survivors, who have completed two years of cancer treatment were selected purposively from Chitwan. All qualitative data were transcribed and translated into English and were thematically analyzed. Results The majority of the participants had scant knowledge about cervical cancer, its causative agent, showed less cervical cancer screening, delayed healthcare-seeking behavior despite having persistent symptoms before the diagnosis. The main reasons identified for not uptaking the cervical screening methods were an embarrassment and having no symptoms at all. Most of them endured social stigma related to cervical cancer in the form of physical isolation and verbal abuse. Conclusions There is an urgent need for interventions to make women and the public aware of cervical cancer and launch effective health education campaigns, policies for cervical cancer prevention programs. This implementation can save the lives of hundreds of women and help them avoid going through all the negative experiences related to cervical cancer. More studies are required to gain the perspectives, knowledge, experiences, and attitudes of cervical cancer survivors to add to the research."
https://openalex.org/W3097685500,"Recent studies have showed that Small nucleolar RNA host genes (SNHGs) acted as a subset of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have critical roles in human cancer carcinogenesis. However, the biological functions of SNHGs in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have not been fully investigated. In this study, we screened an oncogenic lncRNA termed SNHG6 using RNA-Seq data of ccRCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Quantitative real-time PCR was then used to demonstrate the expression of SNHG6 in ccRCC tissues. SNHG6 overexpression is highly associated with malignant features in patients and is a prognostic indicator. SNHG6 significantly promotes ccRCC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations identified that SNHG6 exerts oncogenic effects by interacting with YBX1, and then, enhancing HIF1α translation. Taken together, SNHG6 promotes ccRCC progression by binding YBX1 and may serve as a novel molecular target for ccRCC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3097849729,"Changes in precipitation patterns greatly impact regional drought/flood risk management and utilization of water resources. The main purpose of this paper was to investigate spatio-temporal variability of precipitation concentration in the transitional zone between Qinling Mountains (QDM), Guanzhong Plain (GZP) and the Loess Plateau (LPNS) in China, using monthly-scale precipitation concentration index (PCI) and daily-scale concentration index (CI) from daily rainfall records. The Mann-Kendall method was employed to illustrate the change in trend of PCI and CI, the Kriging interpolation method was adopted to measure spatial distribution, and the Wavelet transforms were used to explore their spatio-temporal correlation with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) &amp; Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) for revealing the potential attribution of precipitation concentration variation. Also, the regional implication of CI was investigated in the zone to provide local knowledge of the index application. Results showed that annual precipitation demonstrated a north-south increasing layered spatial distribution in the zone, representing a generally decreasing trend. The CI change generally exhibited a more significant decreasing trend than did PCI in LPNS and GZP due to AO slowly increasing over time, with a spatially weak layered or radial north-south decay, and an insignificant increasing trend in QDM impacted by the enhancing WPSH, with an obvious layered or radial spatial distribution. The spatiotemporal pattern of PCI variation represented similar characteristics in attribution with CI, but an inverse spatial distribution due to the phase difference (positive and negative effects) of AO and WPSH influencing seasonal precipitation. Regional analysis of CI showed that the CI value with over 0.62 indicated that approximately 80% of precipitation was contributed by 25% of the rainiest days in this zone. Fortunately, the area with this high CI has been getting smaller, implying a positive trend toward regional flash flood and debris flow control."
https://openalex.org/W3094735446,"Background Antiangiogenic therapy, although part of standard treatment in ovarian cancer, has variable efficacy. Furthermore, little is known about the prognostic biomarkers and factors influencing angiogenesis in cancer tissue. We evaluated the expression of angiopoietin-2 and two endothelial tyrosine kinase receptors, Tie-1 and Tie-2, and assessed their value in the prediction of survival in patients with malignant epithelial ovarian cancer. We also compared the expression of these factors between primary high grade serous tumors and their distant metastasis. Materials and methods We evaluated 86 women with primary epithelial ovarian cancer. Matched distal omental metastasis were investigated in 18.6% cases (N = 16). The expression levels of angiogenic factors were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 306 specimens and by qRT-PCR in 111 samples. Results A high epithelial expression level of Tie-2 is a significant prognostic factor in primary high grade serous ovarian cancer. It predicted significantly shorter overall survival both in univariate (p&lt;0.001) and multivariate survival analyses (p = 0.022). Low angiopoietin-2 expression levels in primary ovarian tumors were significantly associated with shorter overall survival (p = 0.015) in the univariate survival analysis. A low expression of angiopoietin-2 was also significantly related to high grade tumors, size of residual tumor after primary surgery and the recurrence of cancer (p = 0.008; p = 0.012; p = 0.018) in the whole study population. The expression of angiopoietin-2 and Tie-2 was stronger in distal omental metastasis than in primary high grade serous tumors in matched-pair analysis (p = 0.001; p = 0.002). Conclusions The angiogenic factor, angiopoietin-2, and its receptor Tie-2 seem to be significant prognostic factors in primary epithelial ovarian cancer. Their expression levels are also increased in metastatic lesions in comparison with primary tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3094664839,"Background Cervical Cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among Ethiopian women. Despite many interventions were conducted, there is low uptake of cervical cancer screening services. Also, limited evidence was available on the women’s intention and its predictors towards cervical cancer screening. Therefore, this study was aimed at determining the intention and predicators of behavioral intention toward cervical cancer screening. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Gomma district, Jimma, Ethiopia from August 1–30, 2019. The total sample sizes were 422 and a systematic random sampling technique was employed to select the samples. Data were collected through interviews using a structured questionnaire guide. Data were entered in epidata, and exported and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 software. Descriptive, correlation, and multicollinearity analysis were done. Also, simple and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to identify the predictors for behavioral intention. The p-value&lt;0.05 was used to declare a significant association. Result The response rate was 382 (90.5%). The mean age of the participants was of 26.45 (SD = 4.76). Direct attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control had a mean score of 16.78 (SD = 2.87), 15.61(SD = 1.92), and 12.86 (SD = 4.85), respectively. The intention has a mean score of 14.52 (SD = 4.01). From regression analysis, direct attitude (B = 0.346, p&lt;0.001), direct subjective norm (B = 0.288, p = 0.008), direct perceived behavioral control (B = 0.132, p = 0.002) indirect attitude (B = 0.015, p = 0.019) and the indirect perceived behavioral control (B = 0.132, p = 0.002) were statistically significant with intention. Conclusion From this study, it was understood that women’s intention towards cervical cancer screening was low. The predictors were the direct and indirect attitude, direct and indirect subjective norm, direct and indirect perceived behavioral control. This calls a need to develop strategies and take action to improve the attitude of women and their influential peoples and increase sense of control to improve their intention to screen for cervical cancer. Moreover, health care providers should have to conduct social and behavioral change communication to improve women’s health seeking behavior towards cervical cancer screening applying the concept of theory of planned behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3097811725,"Prevention of kidney fibrosis is an essential requisite for effective therapy in preventing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, we identify Old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS)/cAMP responsive element-binding protein 3-like 1 (CREB3l1), a CREB/ATF family transcription factor, as a candidate profibrotic gene that drives the final common pathological step along the fibrotic pathway in CKD. Although microarray data from diseased patient kidneys and fibrotic mouse model kidneys both exhibit OASIS/Creb3l1 upregulation, the pathophysiological roles of OASIS in CKD remains unknown. Immunohistochemistry revealed that OASIS protein was overexpressed in human fibrotic kidney compared with normal kidney. Moreover, OASIS was upregulated in murine fibrotic kidneys, following unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), resulting in an increase in the number of OASIS-expressing pathological myofibroblasts. In vitro assays revealed exogenous TGF-β1 increased OASIS expression coincident with fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and OASIS contributed to TGF-β1-mediated myofibroblast migration and increased proliferation. Significantly, in vivo kidney fibrosis induced via UUO or ischemia/reperfusion injury was ameliorated by systemic genetic knockout of OASIS, accompanied by reduced myofibroblast proliferation. Microarrays revealed that the transmembrane glycoprotein Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (Bst2) expression was reduced in OASIS knockout myofibroblasts. Interestingly, a systemic anti-Bst2 blocking antibody approach attenuated kidney fibrosis in normal mice but not in OASIS knockout mice after UUO, signifying Bst2 functions downstream of OASIS. Finally, myofibroblast-restricted OASIS conditional knockouts resulted in resistance to kidney fibrosis. Taken together, OASIS in myofibroblasts promotes kidney fibrosis, at least in part, via increased Bst2 expression. Thus, we have identified and demonstrated that OASIS signaling is a novel regulator of kidney fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3096493086,"eVIN is a technology system that digitizes vaccine stocks through a smartphone application and builds the capacity of program managers and cold chain handlers to integrate technology in their regular work. To effectively manage the vaccine logistics, in 2015, this technology was rolled-out in 12 states of India. This study assessed the programmatic usefulness of eVIN implementation in the areas of vaccine utilization, vaccine stock and distribution management and documentation across selected cold chain points. A pre-post study design was used, where cold chain points (CCPs) were selected using two-stage sampling technique in eVIN states. Pre-post comparative analysis was carried out on the identified indicators using both primary and secondary data sources. The vaccine utilization data reflects that the utilization had reduced from 305.3 million doses in pre-eVIN period to 215.0 million doses in post-eVIN period across 12 eVIN states, resulting into savings of approximately 90 million doses of vaccines. Number of facilities having stock-out of any vaccine showed a significant reduction by 30.4% in post-eVIN period (p&lt;0.001). There was a 4.0% drop in facilities reporting minimum stock of any vaccine after implementation of eVIN. Facilities with maximum stock of any vaccine had increased from 37.4% in pre-eVIN to 39.2% in post-eVIN. During the pre-eVIN period, only 38.6% facilities updated vaccine stock on a daily basis, while in post-eVIN period, 53.5% facilities updated vaccine stock on daily basis. The completeness of records in the vaccine stock registers, indent form and temperature logbook have been substantially improved in the post-eVIN period (p&lt;0.001). eVIN had helped in streamlining the vaccine flow network and ensured equity through better vaccine management practices. It is a powerful contribution to strengthen the vaccine supply chain and management. Upscaling eVIN in the remaining states of India will be crucial in improving the efficacy of vaccines and cold chain management."
https://openalex.org/W3094996204,"Marine organisms show population structure at a relatively fine spatial scale, even in open habitats. The tools commonly used to assess subtle patterns of connectivity have diverse levels of resolution and can complement each other to inform on population structure. We assessed and compared the discriminatory power of genetic markers and otolith shape to reveal the population structure on evolutionary and ecological time scales of the common sole ( Solea solea ), living in the Eastern English Channel (EEC) stock off France and the UK. First, we genotyped fish with Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms to assess population structure at an evolutionary scale. Then, we tested for spatial segregation of the subunits using otolith shape as an integrative tracer of life history. Finally, a supervised machine learning framework was applied to genotypes and otolith phenotypes to probabilistically assign adults to subunits and assess the discriminatory power of each approach. Low but significant genetic differentiation was found among subunits. Moreover, otolith shape appeared to vary spatially, suggesting spatial population structure at fine spatial scale. However, results of the supervised discriminant analyses failed to discriminate among subunits, especially for otolith shape. We suggest that the degree of population segregation may not be strong enough to allow for robust fish assignments. Finally, this study revealed a weak yet existing metapopulation structure of common sole at the fine spatial scale of the EEC based on genotypes and otolith shape, with one subunit being more isolated. Our study argues for the use of complementary tracers to investigate marine population structure."
https://openalex.org/W3096410340,"Sepsis is the leading cause of death in hospitalized patients and beyond the hospital stay and these long-term sequelae are due in part to unresolved inflammation. Metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis links metabolism to inflammation and such a shift is commonly observed in sepsis under normoxic conditions. By shifting the metabolic state from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, we hypothesized it would reverse unresolved inflammation and subsequently improve outcome. We propose a shift from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation as a sepsis therapy by targeting the pathways involved in the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Chemical manipulation of PDH using dichloroacetic acid (DCA) will promote oxidative phosphorylation over glycolysis and decrease inflammation. We tested our hypothesis in a Drosophila melanogaster model of surviving sepsis infected with Staphylococcus aureus. Drosophila were divided into 3 groups: unmanipulated , sham and sepsis survivors , all treated with linezolid; each group was either treated or not with DCA for one week following sepsis. We followed lifespan, measured gene expression of Toll , defensin , cecropin A , and drosomycin , and levels of lactate, pyruvate, acetyl-CoA as well as TCA metabolites. In our model, metabolic effects of sepsis are modified by DCA with normalized lactate, TCA metabolites, and was associated with improved lifespan of sepsis survivors, yet had no lifespan effects on unmanipulated and sham flies. While Drosomycin and cecropin A expression increased in sepsis survivors, DCA treatment decreased both and selectively increased defensin ."
https://openalex.org/W3097465870,"Speakers’ memory of sentence structure can persist and modulate the syntactic choices of subsequent utterances (i.e., structural priming). Much research on structural priming posited a multifactorial account by which an implicit learning process and a process related to explicit memory jointly contribute to the priming effect. Here, we tested two predictions from that account: (1) that lexical repetition facilitates the retrieval of sentence structures from memory; (2) that priming is partly driven by a short-term explicit memory mechanism with limited resources. In two pairs of structural priming and sentence structure memory experiments, we examined the effects of structural priming and its modulation by lexical repetition as a function of cognitive load in native Dutch speakers. Cognitive load was manipulated by interspersing the prime and target trials with easy or difficult mathematical problems. Lexical repetition boosted both structural priming (Experiments 1a–2a) and memory for sentence structure (Experiments 1b–2b) and did so with a comparable magnitude. In Experiment 1, there were no load effects, but in Experiment 2, with a stronger manipulation of load, both the priming and memory effects were reduced with a larger cognitive load. The findings support an explicit memory mechanism in structural priming that is cue-dependent and attention-demanding, consistent with a multifactorial account of structural priming."

Currently, no evidence-based treatment for CMD exists. We investigated whether reducing cardiovascular risk factors improves symptoms and microvascular function in women with non-endothelial dependent CMD and no obstructive CAD. Methods We randomized 62 women aged 40–75, with body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 kg/m 2 , angina ≥monthly, and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) ≤2.5 to a 24-week intervention comprising low energy diet, exercise training, and optimized treatment of hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes or to control. Patients were assessed before randomization and after 24 weeks. Primary outcomes were CFVR assessed by transthoracic Doppler stress-echocardiography and angina burden by Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ). Secondary outcomes were exercise capacity, body composition, glycemic control, myocardial function, and anxiety and depression symptoms. Results Fifty-six participants (90%) completed the study. Median (IQR) age was 65.2 (57.1;70.7) years, BMI was 30.1 (28.4;32.7) kg/m 2 . The intervention resulted in relevant improvement in angina symptoms (9-21-point increase on SAQ-scales (all p&lt;0.01)) but had no effect on CFVR (p = 0.468). Mean (CI) weight loss was 9.6 (7.80;11.48) kg, (p&lt;0.0001). There was a significant mean (CI) decrease in depression symptoms = 1.16 (0.22;2.12), triglycerides = 0.52 (0.25;0.78) mmol/L, total cholesterol = 0.55 (0.12;0.98) mmol/L, and HbA1c in diabetics = 27.1 (1.60;52.6) mmol/mol but no effect on other secondary outcomes. Conclusion A major weight loss and intensified risk factor control resulted in significantly improved angina burden but no improvement of coronary microvascular function among women with microvascular angina."
https://openalex.org/W3094831794,"Vitreous has been reported to prevent tumor angiogenesis, but our previous findings indicate that vitreous activate the signaling pathway of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, which plays a critical role in angiogenesis. The goal of this research is to determine which role of vitreous plays in angiogenesis-related cellular responses in vitro. We found that in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs) vitreous activates a number of receptor tyrosine kinases including Anexelekto (Axl), which plays an important role in angiogenesis. Subsequently, we discovered that depletion of Axl using CRISPR/Cas9 and an Axl-specific inhibitor R428 suppress vitreous-induced Akt activation and cell proliferation, migration, and tuber formation of HRECs. Therefore, this line of research not only demonstrate that vitreous promotes angiogenesis in vitro, but also reveal that Axl is one of receptor tyrosine kinases to mediate vitreous-induced angiogenesis in vitro, thereby providing a molecular basis for removal of vitreous as cleanly as possible when vitrectomy is performed in treating patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3094972821,"We assessed the virulence and anti-trypanosomal drug sensitivity patterns of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense ( Tbr ) isolates in the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization-Biotechnology Research Institute (KALRO-BioRI) cryobank. Specifically, the study focused on Tbr clones originally isolated from the western Kenya/eastern Uganda focus of human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). Twelve (12) Tbr clones were assessed for virulence using groups(n = 10) of Swiss White Mice monitored for 60 days post infection (dpi). Based on survival time, four classes of virulence were identified: (a) very-acute: 0–15, (b) acute: 16–30, (c) sub-acute: 31–45 and (d) chronic: 46–60 dpi. Other virulence biomarkers identified included: pre-patent period (pp), parasitaemia progression, packed cell volume (PCV) and body weight changes. The test Tbr clones together with KALRO-BioRi reference drug-resistant and drug sensitive isolates were then tested for sensitivity to melarsoprol (mel B), pentamidine, diminazene aceturate and suramin, using mice groups (n = 5) treated with single doses of each drug at 24 hours post infection. Our results showed that the clones were distributed among four classes of virulence as follows: 3/12 (very-acute), 3/12 (acute), 2/12 (sub-acute) and 4/12 (chronic) isolates. Differences in survivorship, parasitaemia progression and PCV were significant (P&lt;0.001) and correlated. The isolate considered to be drug resistant at KALRO-BioRI, KETRI 2538, was confirmed to be resistant to melarsoprol, pentamidine and diminazene aceturate but it was not resistant to suramin. A cure rate of at least 80% was achieved for all test isolates with melarsoprol (1mg/Kg and 20 mg/kg), pentamidine (5 and 20 mg/kg), diminazene aceturate (5 mg/kg) and suramin (5 mg/kg) indicating that the isolates were not resistant to any of the drugs despite the differences in virulence. This study provides evidence of variations in virulence of Tbr clones from a single HAT focus and confirms that this variations is not a significant determinant of isolate sensitivity to anti-trypanosomal drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3095575936,"Innovations in decision-making practice for allocation of funds in health research are emerging; however, it is not clear to what extent these are used. This study aims to better understand current decision-making practices for the allocation of research funding from the perspective of UK and international health funders. An online survey (active March-April 2019) was distributed by email to UK and international health and health-related funding organisations (e.g., biomedical and social), and was publicised on social media. The survey collected information about decision-making approaches for research funding allocation, and covered assessment criteria, current and past practices, and considerations for improvements or future practice. A mixed methods analysis provided descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages of responses) and an inductive thematic framework of key experiences. Thirty-one responses were analysed, representing government-funded organisations and charities in the health sector from the UK, Europe and Australia. Four themes were extracted and provided a narrative framework. 1. The most reported decision-making approaches were external peer review, triage, and face-to-face committee meetings; 2. Key values underpinned decision-making processes. These included transparency and gaining perspectives from reviewers with different expertise (e.g., scientific, patient and public); 3. Cross-cutting challenges of the decision-making processes faced by funders included bias, burden and external limitations; 4. Evidence of variations and innovations from the most reported decision-making approaches, including proportionate peer review, number of decision-points, virtual committee meetings and sandpits (interactive workshop). Broadly similar decision-making processes were used by all funders in this survey. Findings indicated a preference for funders to adapt current decision-making processes rather than using more innovative approaches: however, there is a need for more flexibility in decision-making and support to applicants. Funders indicated the need for information and empirical evidence on innovations which would help to inform decision-making in research fund allocation."

A DIA service is provided by using integrity tags (hereafter referred to tags). This paper proposes a novel tagging method, called Tagging of Outsourced Data (TOD), for generating and verifying tags of files. TOD has a number of unique properties: (i) it supports both public and private verifiability, and achieves this property with a low level of overhead at the user end, making it particularly attractive to mobile users with resource-constrained devices, (ii) it protects data confidentiality, supports dynamic tags and is resilient against tag forgery and tag tampering (i.e. by authorised insiders) at the same time in more secure and efficient, making the method more suited to the PCS environment, (iii) it supports tags deduplication, making it more efficient, particularly for the user who has many files with data redundancy. Comprehensive security analysis and performance evaluation have been conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the approach taken in the design."
https://openalex.org/W3096999915,"Objective We sought to identify seasonal variation in physical activity that different physical activity measurement tools can capture in children with congenital heart disease. Methods Data were collected as part of a prospective cohort study at BC Children’s Hospital, Vancouver, Canada. Daily step counts of children aged 9–16 years with moderate-to-severe CHD were assessed continuously for 1-year via a commercial activity tracker (Fitbit Charge 2 ™ ). Physical activity levels were also assessed conventionally at one time-point via accelerometers (ActiGraph) and physical activity questionnaires. Results 156 children (mean age 12.7±2.4 years; 42% female) participated in the study. Fitbit data (n = 96) over a 1-year period clearly illustrated seasonal peaks (late spring and autumn) and dips (winter and summer school holidays) in physical activity levels, with group mean values being below 12,000 steps per day throughout the year. According to conventional accelerometry data (n = 142), 26% met guidelines, which tended to differ according to season of measurement (spring: 39%, summer: 11%, fall: 20%, winter: 39%; p-value = 0.053). Questionnaire data (n = 134) identified that the most widely reported activities were walking (81%) and running (78%) with walking being the highest in summer and fall and running in winter and spring. Furthermore, regardless of overall activity levels the children exhibit similar seasonal variation. Conclusions We demonstrated that physical activity level changes across seasons in children with CHD. It is important to be aware of these fluctuations when assessing and interpreting physical activity levels. Season specific counselling for physical activity may be beneficial in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W3097110254,"Radiotherapy plays a major role in the curative treatment of head and neck cancer, either as a single modality therapy, or in combination with surgery or chemotherapy, or both. Despite advances to limit radiation-induced side-effects, the major salivary glands are often affected. This frequently leads to hyposalivation which causes an increased risk for xerostomia, dental caries, mucositis, and malnutrition culminating in a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Previous research demonstrated that loss of salivary function is associated with a decrease in polarity regulators and an increase in nuclear Yap localization in a putative stem and progenitor cell (SPC) population. Yap activation has been shown to be essential for regeneration in intestinal injury models; however, the highest levels of nuclear Yap are observed in irradiated salivary SPCs that do not regenerate the gland. Thus, elucidating the inputs that regulate nuclear Yap localization and determining the role that Yap plays within the entire tissue following radiation damage and during regeneration is critical. In this study, we demonstrate that radiation treatment increases nuclear Yap localization in acinar cells and Yap-regulated genes in parotid salivary tissues. Conversely, administration of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), known to restore salivary function in mouse models, reduces nuclear Yap localization and Yap transcriptional targets to levels similar to untreated tissues. Activation of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) using calpeptin results in increased Yap-regulated genes in primary acinar cells while inhibition of ROCK activity (Y-27632) leads to decreased Yap transcriptional targets. These results suggest that Yap activity is dependent on ROCK activity and provides new mechanistic insights into the regulation of radiation-induced hyposalivation."
https://openalex.org/W3094746005,"Screening asylum-seekers for active pulmonary tuberculosis is common practice among many European countries with low incidence of tuberculosis. The reported yields vary substantially, partly due to the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of asylum-seeking populations. Rather than screening all new arrivals (indiscriminate screening), a few countries apply targeted screening based on incidence of tuberculosis in asylum-seekers’ country of origin. However, evaluations of its cost-effectiveness have been scarce. The aim of this modelling study was to assess whether the introduction of a screening threshold based on the tuberculosis incidence in the country of origin is sensible from an economic perspective. To this end, we compare the current, indiscriminate screening policy for pulmonary tuberculosis in Germany with a hypothetical targeted screening programme using several potential screening thresholds based on WHO-reported incidence of tuberculosis in countries of origin. Screening data is taken from a large German federal state over 14 years (2002–2015). Incremental cost-effectiveness is measured as cost per case found and cost per case prevented. Our analysis shows that incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of screening asylum-seekers from countries with an incidence of 50 to 250/100,000 range between 15,000€ and 17,000€ per additional case found when compared to lower thresholds. The ICER for screening asylum-seekers from countries with an incidence &lt;50/100,000 is 112,000€ per additional case found. Costs per case prevented show a similar increase in costs. The high cost per case found and per case prevented at the &lt;50/100,000 threshold scenario suggests this threshold to be a sensible cut-off for targeted screening. Acknowledging that no screening measure can find all cases of tuberculosis, and that reactivation of latent infections makes up a large proportion of foreign-born cases, targeting asylum-seekers from countries with an incidence above 50/100,000 is likely to be a more reasonable screening measure for the prevention and control of tuberculosis than indiscriminate screening measures."
https://openalex.org/W3094981470,"Sexual signals play a central role in male-male competition in polygynous species. In red deer ( Cervus elaphus ), male’s ventral area become dark during the rutting season due to urine spraying behaviour and retains many chemical compounds potentially revealing individual features. Here we investigate the variation in size of this trait, exploring its relationship with age and male competitive features such as antlers or body size, as well as populational level of intrasexual competition for mates. We found that the size of the dark ventral patch followed a clearly bimodal distribution, i.e. males mostly expressed the full-size trait or just developed a very small one. For these two groups of males according to trait expression, the relationships of trait size with age and antler size differed. Populational level of intrasexual competition appeared to affect the relationship between antler size and the probability of a fully developed ventral patch. These results indicate that the trait encodes information on body size, antler size, age and populational level of mate competition, thus suggesting a role in signalling male’s competitive features and willingness to allocate reproductive effort within a particular season."
https://openalex.org/W3097101166,"25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] has been reported to be associated with several chronic liver diseases. The relationship between 25(OH)D and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) pathogenesis is incompletely understood. We investigated the association of serum total and free 25(OH)D levels with necroinflammatory activity and cytokine levels in 66 patients with AIH diagnosed in our hospital. The median age at AIH diagnosis was 57 years, and the male:female ratio was 7:59. The median serum total 25(OH)D level in therapy-naïve patients with AIH was 14.2 ng/mL (interquartile range [IQR], 11.4–17.9 ng/mL). Of the 66 patients with AIH, 36 had serum total 25(OH)D levels of &lt; 15 ng/mL and were considered to have vitamin D deficiency, and 30 had serum total 25(OH)D levels of ≥ 15 ng/mL. Patients with acute-onset AIH had significantly lower serum total 25(OH)D levels than those with chronic-onset AIH. In particular, serum total 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in patients with severe forms of AIH. Furthermore, the serum total 25(OH)D level was positively correlated with the serum albumin level and prothrombin time and negatively correlated with the serum total bilirubin level and necroinflammatory activity in AIH. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the serum total 25(OH)D level was an independent factor for severe necroinflammatory activity. Interestingly, AIH patients with serum total 25(OH)D levels of &lt; 15 ng/mL had higher levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ and interleukin-33. Free 25(OH)D levels were correlated with total 25(OH)D levels, and the percentage of free 25(OH)D was significantly associated with necroinflammatory activity. In conclusion, 25(OH)D deficiency may play an important role in predicting AIH severity via inflammatory cytokine production."

Current local therapies targeting these skin tumors remain challenging. Therefore, more feasible topical treatment options should be considered. In order to develop a topical therapy against ES and EMM, betulinyl-bis-sulfamate and NVX-207, derivatives of the naturally occurring betulin and betulinic acid, respectively, were evaluated for their antiproliferative (crystal violet staining assay), cytotoxic (MTS assay) and apoptotic (AnnexinV staining, cell cycle investigations) effects on primary ES cells, EMM cells and equine dermal fibroblasts in vitro . The more potent derivative was assessed for its in vitr o penetration and permeation on isolated equine skin within 30 min and 24 h using Franz-type diffusion cells and HPLC analysis. Betulinyl-bis-sulfamate and NVX-207 inhibited the proliferation and metabolism in ES cells, EMM cells and fibroblasts significantly (p &lt; 0.001) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. NVX-207 had superior anticancer effects compared to betulinyl-bis-sulfamate. Both compounds led to the externalization of phosphatidylserines on the cell membrane and DNA fragmentation, demonstrating that the effective mode of action was apoptosis. After 48 h of treatment with NVX-207, the number of necrotic cells was less than 2% in all cell types. Detected amounts of NVX-207 in the different skin layers exceeded the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations calculated by far. Even though data obtained in vitro are auspicious, the results are not unconditionally applicable to the clinical situation. Consequently, in vivo studies are required to address the antitumoral effects of topically applied NVX-207 in ES and EMM patients."
https://openalex.org/W3095844121,"Multimodal dialogue system, due to its many-fold applications, has gained much attention to the researchers and developers in recent times. With the release of large-scale multimodal dialog dataset Saha et al. 2018 on the fashion domain, it has been possible to investigate the dialogue systems having both textual and visual modalities. Response generation is an essential aspect of every dialogue system, and making the responses diverse is an important problem. For any goal-oriented conversational agent, the system’s responses must be informative, diverse and polite, that may lead to better user experiences. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural framework for generating varied responses in a multimodal dialogue setup capturing information from both the text and image. Multimodal encoder with co-attention between the text and image is used for focusing on the different modalities to obtain better contextual information. For effective information sharing across the modalities, we combine the information of text and images using the BLOCK fusion technique that helps in learning an improved multimodal representation. We employ stochastic beam search with Gumble Top K-tricks to achieve diversified responses while preserving the content and politeness in the responses. Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs significantly better compared to the existing and baseline methods in terms of distinct metrics, and thereby generates more diverse responses that are informative, interesting and polite without any loss of information. Empirical evaluation also reveals that images, while used along with the text, improve the efficiency of the model in generating diversified responses."
https://openalex.org/W3095852362,"In this study, we assessed the possible impacts of climate variability and change on growth and performance of maize using multi-climate, multi-crop model approaches built on Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) protocols in five different agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Embu County in Kenya and under different management systems. Adaptation strategies were developed that are locally relevant by identifying a set of technologies that help to offset potential impacts of climate change on maize yields. Impacts and adaptation options were evaluated using projections by 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project—Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Two widely used crop simulation models, Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to simulate the potential impacts of climate change on maize. Results showed that 20 CMIP5 models are consistent in their projections of increased surface temperatures with different magnitude. Projections by HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC-ESM tend to be higher than the rest of 17 CMIP5 climate models under both emission scenarios. The projected increase in minimum temperature (Tmin) which ranged between 2.7 and 5.8°C is higher than the increase in maximum temperature (Tmax) that varied between 2.2 and 4.8°C by end century under RCP 8.5. Future projections in rainfall are less certain with high variability projections by GFDL-ESM2G, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M suggest 8 to 25% decline in rainfall, while CanESM2, IPSL-CM5A-MR and BNU-ESM suggested more than 85% increase in rainfall under RCP 8.5 by end of 21 st century. Impacts of current and future climatic conditions on maize yields varied depending on the AEZs, soil type, crop management and climate change scenario. Impacts are largely negative in the low potential AEZs such as Lower Midlands (LM4 and LM5) compared with the high potential AEZs Upper Midlands (UM2 and UM3). However, impacts of climate change are largely positive across all AEZs and management conditions when CO 2 fertilization is included. Using the differential impacts of climate change, a strategy to adapt maize cultivation to climate change in all the five AEZs was identified by consolidating those practices that contributed to increased yields under climate change. We consider this approach as more appropriate to identify operational adaptation strategies using readily available technologies that contribute positively under both current and future climatic conditions. This approach when adopted in strategic manner will also contribute to further strengthen the development of adaptation strategies at national and local levels. The methods and tools validated and applied in this assessment allowed estimating possible impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies which can provide valuable insights and guidance for adaptation planning."
https://openalex.org/W3097536007,"Objective Inflammatory disease is catabolic and associated with insulin resistance, increased energy expenditure, lipolysis and muscle protein loss. The main contributors to these metabolic adaptations are inflammation, malnutrition and immobilisation. Controlled experimental models incorporating these central elements of hospitalisation are lacking. The aim of this study was to validate such a human experimental model. Methods In a randomized crossover design, six healthy young men underwent; (i) overnight fast (CTR), or (ii) exposure to systemic lipopolysaccharide (1 ng/kg) combined with 36-hour fast and bed rest (CAT). The difference in insulin sensitivity between CAT and CTR was the main outcome, determined by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp. Palmitate, glucose, urea, phenylalanine and tyrosine tracers were infused to estimate metabolic shifts during interventions. Indirect calorimetry was used to estimate energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Results Insulin sensitivity was 41% lower in CAT than in CTR (M-value, mg/kg/min): 4.3 ± 0.2 vs 7.3 ± 1.3, p&lt;0.05. The median (min max) palmitate flux (μmol/min) was higher during CAT than in CTR (257.0 (161.7 365.4) vs 131.6 (92.3 189.4), p = 0.004), and protein kinetics did not differ between interventions. C-reactive peptide (mg/L) was elevated in CAT compared with CTR (30.57 ± 4.08 vs 1.03 ± 0.19, p&lt;0.001). Energy expenditure increased by 6% during CAT compared with CTR (1869 ± 94 vs 1756 ± 58, p = 0.04), CAT having higher lipid oxidation rates (p = 0.01) and lower glucose oxidation rates (p = 0.03). Lipopolysaccharide caused varying abdominal discomfort 2 hours post-injection, which had disappeared the following day. Conclusion We found that combined systemic inflammation, fasting and bed rest induced marked insulin resistance and increased energy expenditure and lipolysis, rendering this controlled experimental model suitable for anti-catabolic intervention studies, mimicking clinical conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3095092300,"Faces that consistently shifted the gaze to subsequent target locations in a gaze cueing task were chosen as being more trustworthy than faces that always looked away from the target, suggesting that the validity of a gaze cue influenced the viewers’ judgments regarding the trustworthiness of human faces. We investigated whether the gaze cueing effect and judgments regarding the personality conveyed by a face would be affected by the valence of a target. A face image moved its eyes to the left or the right, and an emotional target image (positive, negative, or neutral) appeared to left or right of the face. Participants had to indicate the location of this target by pressing a key. The target image was preceded by a face that shifted its gaze to the target image (valid cue), a face that directed its gaze to the opposite side (invalid cue), or a face that did not move its eyes (no cue). The perceived trustworthiness of the face was evaluated after the gaze-cueing task. Results showed that faces that looked at positive targets were evaluated as more trustworthy than faces that looked at negative targets. However, the valence of the targets did not affect trustworthiness ratings in invalid and no-cue conditions. We suggest that integrated information about the predictability of the gaze cue and the valence of the gaze target modulates impressions about the personality of the face."
https://openalex.org/W3095481211,"Increasing urbanisation has led to a greater use of artificial structures by bats as alternative roost sites. Despite the widespread presence of bats, roost availability may restrict their distribution and abundance in urban environments. There is limited quantitative information on the drivers of bat roost selection and roosting preferences, particularly in African bats. We explore the factors influencing roost selection in the Mauritian tomb bat ( Taphozous mauritianus ), within an urban landscape in Lilongwe city, Malawi. Eight building and five landscape features of roosts were compared with both adjacent and random control buildings throughout the city. Bat occupied buildings were situated closer to woodland (mean 709m) compared to random buildings (mean 1847m) but did not differ in any other landscape features explored. Roosts were situated on buildings with larger areas and taller walls, suggesting bats select features for predator-avoidance and acoustic perception when leaving the roost. Bats preferred buildings with exposed roof beams which may provide refuge from disturbance. Whilst roosts are situated more often on brick walls, this feature was also associated with landscape features, therefore its importance in roost selection is less clear. These results are indicative that T . mauritianus selects roosts at both the building and landscape level. The selectivity of T . mauritianus in relation to its roost sites implies that preferred roosts are a limited resource, and as such, conservation actions should focus on protecting roost sites and the woodland bats rely on."

Recently, evidence indicates that other, non-muscle cells, also perform periodic motions that are either imperceptible under conventional lab microscope lens or practically not easily amenable for analysis of oscillation amplitude, frequency, phase of movement and its direction. Here, we create a real-time video analysis tool to visually magnify and explore sub-micron rhythmic movements performed by biological cells and the induced movements in their surroundings. Using this tool, we suggest that fibroblast cells perform small fluctuating movements with a dominant frequency that is dependent on their surrounding substrate and its stiffness."
https://openalex.org/W3095872938,"We showed the results of the first long-term analysis (1987–2019) of pesticide (herbicides, fungicides and insecticides) impact in the Rolling Pampa, one of the main agricultural areas of Argentina. Using a clear and meaningful tool, based not only on acute toxicity but also on scaling up the results to total sown area, we identified time trends for both pesticide impact and the ecoefficiency of modal pesticide profiles. By the end of the time series, soybean showed a pesticide impact four times greater than maize crop in the studied area. However, the time trend in the subperiod (2012–2019) showed a sustainable pattern of pesticide use in soybean crop, with an improvement in its ecoefficiency. Oppositely, maize showed a relatively constant ecoefficiency value during most of the time series, suggesting a possible path towards an unsustainable cropping system. Findings from this study suggest that some efforts have to be made to improve the pest management decisions towards a more efficient pesticide profiles in maize crop and to keep improving the ecotoxicity pesticide profile in soybean crops because of its large sown area in the studied area."
https://openalex.org/W3095028616,"Power can be applied in different domains (e.g., politics, work, romantic relationships, family etc.), however, we do not always reflect on which domains we have power in and how important power in these domains is. A dominant idea is that men have more power than women. This notion may be biased because the concept of power is associated with public life. We introduce the concept of preference-weighted power (PWP), a measure of power that includes different domains in life, weighted by the domains’ subjective importance. Two studies investigated power from this perspective. In Study 1, participants generated words related to power, which were quantified/categorized by latent semantic analysis to develop a semantic measure of the power construct. In Study 2, we computed a PWP index by weighting the participants' self-rated power in different power domains with the importance of having power in that domain. Together the studies suggest that men have more perceived power in the public domain, however, this domain has a lower preference weighting than the private domain where women have more power than men. Finally, when preferences for power in different domains were considered, no gender differences were observed. These results emphasize gender difference in different domains and may change how we perceive men’s and women’s power in our society."
https://openalex.org/W3095987445,"Background Wound closure is performed at the end of the procedure, when the attention of the surgical team may decrease due to tiredness. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of changing the surgical team for wound closure on the rate of surgical site infection (SSI). Methods A two-armed observational monocentric matched case-control study was performed in a time series design. During the baseline period, closure of the abdominal wall was performed by the main surgical team. The intervention consisted of closure of the abdominal wall and skin by an independent surgical team. Matching was based on gender, BMI, length of surgery, type of surgery, elective versus emergency surgery and ASA score. The primary outcome was SSI rate 30 days after surgery. Results A total of 72 patients in the intervention group were matched with 72 patients in the baseline group. The SSI rate after 30 days in the intervention group was 10% (n = 7) and in the baseline group 21% (n = 15) (p = 0.064). Redo-Surgery as result of infection (e.g. opening the wound, drainage or reoperation) was significantly higher in the baseline group (19.4% vs 2.7%; p = 0.014). Mortality, length of stay, rehospitalisation and complication rates 30 days after surgery did not differ significantly. Conclusion Changing the surgical team for wound closure did not reduce the overall rate of SSI, but the rate of redo-surgery as a result of SSI. Despite being potentially beneficial, organizational factors are a main limiting factor of changing the surgical team for the wound closure. Trial registration Clinicaltrial.gov NCT04503642 ."
https://openalex.org/W3096924504,"Hyperiid amphipod species from the Gulf of Ulloa, Baja California, and the adjacent region (from the shelf break to 200 km offshore) were analyzed to evaluate diversity and abundances. This productive area supports small-scale commercial fisheries, including sand bass ( Paralabrax nebulifer ), California spiny lobster ( Panulirus interruptus ), abalones, clams, and others. Strong coastal upwelling events were observed during summer seasons of the period 2002–2008 between Punta Eugenia and Punta Abreojos. The upwelling plumes at Punta Abreojos are transported southward in slope waters bordering the coastal shelf of the Gulf of Ulloa, contributing to the separation of coastal and oceanic regions, and explain differences in amphipod diversity and abundances between both regions. In the offshore region, the most abundant species were Vibilia armata , Lestrigonus schizogeneios , Primno brevidens , and Eupronoe minuta , similar to previous findings in northern regions of Baja California and southern California. However, abundances of these species were lower (10–30 individuals/1000 m 3 ), only reaching 20–50% of abundance levels reported off northern Baja California. In the coastal shelf of the Gulf of Ulloa, amphipods were virtually absent during 2002, 2003 and 2006. However, during 2004 and 2005, abundances of P . brevidens increased (54 and 20 ind/1000 m 3 , respectively). Moreover, during the late summer of 2007, abundances of L . schizogeneios , P . brevidens , Lycaea nasuta , Lycaea pulex , and Simorhynchotus antennarius increased considerably (261, 39, 31, 68, 416 ind/1000 m 3 , respectively), indicating occasional utilization of the coastal shelf by pelagic amphipods. Changes in gelatinous populations (medusae, siphonophores, ctenophores, doliolids, and salps) paralleled changes in hyperiid populations, with highest abundances in 2005–2008 in the coastal shelf. Significant correlations of 17 amphipod species with gelatinous taxa, which are often used as host organisms by hyperiid amphipods, suggest that gelatinous presence enhanced hyperiid abundance and promoted the progression of hyperiid amphipods onto the coastal shelf during parts of the 2002–2008 period."
https://openalex.org/W3097697436,"Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an autosomal dominant rare disease that causes the formation of angiogenic tumors. When functional, pVHL acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). Genetic mutations that perturb the structure of pVHL result in dysregulation of HIF, causing a wide array of tumor pathologies including retinal angioma, pheochromocytoma, central nervous system hemangioblastoma, and clear cell renal carcinoma. These VHL-related cancers occur throughout the lifetime of the patient, requiring frequent intervention procedures, such as surgery, to remove the tumors. Although VHL is classified as a rare disease (1 in 39,000 to 1 in 91,000 affected) there is a large heterogeneity in genetic mutations listed for observed pathologies. Understanding how these specific mutations correlate with the myriad of observed pathologies for VHL could provide clinicians insight into the potential severity and onset of disease. Using a select set of 285 ClinVar mutations in VHL, we developed a multiparametric scoring algorithm to evaluate the overall clinical severity of missense mutations in pVHL. The mutations were assessed according to eight weighted parameters as a comprehensive evaluation of protein misfolding and malfunction. Higher mutation scores were strongly associated with pathogenicity. Our approach establishes a novel in silico method by which VHL-specific mutations can be assessed for their severity and effect on the biophysical functions of the VHL protein."
https://openalex.org/W3096146795,"Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is a non-intrusive and cost-effective method capable of providing high-resolution, long-term information on the status and health of vocal populations and communities. To successfully monitor the same species over wide geographical and temporal scales, it is necessary to characterise the range of sound variability, as well as the consistency of sound features between populations. The meagre ( Argyrosomus regius , Asso 1801) is an interesting case study because recent investigations suggest a wider vocal repertoire than previously described. In this study, meagre vocalizations were recorded and analysed from a variety of settings, ranging from rearing facilities to wild populations to provide a comprehensive characterisation of its vocal repertoire, while investigating the consistency of spawning sound features between populations. All sounds presented a similar acoustic structure in their basic unit ( i . e . the pulse), while an important variability was found in the number of pulses; the meagre can emit sounds made of one single pulse or many pulses (up to more than 100). High level of overlap in the Principal Component Analysis made difficult to differentiate sound type clusters. Despite this, two sound types were identifiable: knocks (sounds from 1 to 3 pulses) and long grunts (sounds with more than 29 pulses). Discriminant Analysis carried out on PCA residuals showed that knock had the highest proportion of correct placement (92% of the observations correctly placed) followed by long grunts (80%). All other previously described sound types (intermediate grunt, short grunt and disturbance sounds) could not be separated and presented low levels of correct placement, suggesting that care should be taken when defining these as independent sound types. Finally, acoustic features consistency was found in meagre grunts emitted by different populations during spawning nights; statistical differences could be explained by recording settings and fish conditions. The results of this study provide important information for fostering PAM programs of wild meagre populations, while contributing to the discussion around the definition of fish sound types in vocal fish communities. Studies of this kind, which evaluate both variability and consistency of sound features, are of fundamental importance for maximising PAM efforts in the wild, at both the specific and the community level."
https://openalex.org/W3095178561,"In nonlinear multisensor system, abrupt state changes and unknown variance of measurement noise are very common, which challenges the majority of the previously developed models for precisely known multisensor fusion techniques. In terms of this issue, an adaptive cubature information filter (CIF) is proposed by embedding strong tracking filter (STF) and variational Bayesian (VB) method, and it is extended to multi-sensor fusion under the decentralized fusion framework with feedback. Specifically, the new algorithms use an equivalent description of STF, which avoid the problem of solving Jacobian matrix during determining strong trace fading factor and solve the interdependent problem of combination of STF and VB. Meanwhile, A simple and efficient method for evaluating global fading factor is developed by introducing a parameter variable named fading vector. The analysis shows that compared with the traditional information filter, this filter can effectively reduce the data transmission from the local sensor to the fusion center and decrease the computational burden of the fusion center. Therefore, it can quickly return to the normal error range and has higher estimation accuracy in response to abrupt state changes. Finally, the performance of the developed algorithms is evaluated through a target tracking problem."
https://openalex.org/W3095662249,"Purpose Alcohol concentration has traditionally been labeled in the form of alcohol by volume (ABV). This format can cause difficulty in evaluating accuracy of a pour because it doesn’t directly connect with recommendations related to “standard drinks,” the approach used by the US CDC and others organizations which intend to facilitate responsible drinking behaviors. Strategies which more directly connect guidelines related to healthy drinking behaviors to alcohol labeling are needed. Objective Assess how a label identifying the number of standard drinks per container impacts the ability of undergraduate students to accurately pour a standard drink. Design This study employed a 3 x 2 x 2 experimental design. Undergraduates were asked to pour a standard drink from mock products from three alcohol categories (beer, wine and liquor); products were presented in two types of label (traditional ABV vs. standard drinks/container) at two concentrations of alcohol content (high and low). Results We calculated standardized pour errors (pour errors in standard drink units). Analysis of these standardized pour errors suggested that 1) people tended to underpour beverages of low concentration across product categories and overpour those high in concentration. 2) When the standard drink label was present, pour accuracy was improved, when compared with pours from containers affixed with ABV labels in low alcohol concentrations across all product categories (beer, wine and liquor). 3) For treatments that comprised high concentrations of alcohol, the standard drink label significantly increased accuracy only for beer. However, it is worth noting that beer with an ABV label was the condition with the most dramatic overpours, and these problematic overpours were dramatically reduced by the addition of a standard drink label. Conclusions Our work empirically supports the notion that Undergraduate students are better able to accurately assess and pour a standard drink of alcohol from bottles incorporating a label which includes standard drinks/container vs. those with traditional ABV labeling. That said, the effect is quite different for each alcohol category: beer, wine, and liquor and depends on whether the product is high or low in concentration of alcohol for its category; as such, policy makers should consider alcohol categories and concentrations from a public health perspective when recommending changes to labeling."
https://openalex.org/W3097931900,"Cloud computing has evolved the big data technologies to a consolidated paradigm with SPaaS (Streaming processing-as-a-service). With a number of enterprises offering cloud-based solutions to end-users and other small enterprises, there has been a boom in the volume of data, creating interest of both industry and academia in big data analytics, streaming applications, and social networking applications. With the companies shifting to cloud-based solutions as a service paradigm, the competition grows in the market. Good quality of service (QoS) is a must for the enterprises, as they strive to survive in a competitive environment. However, achieving reasonable QoS goals to meet SLA agreement cost-effectively is challenging due to variation in workload over time. This problem can be solved if the system has the ability to predict the workload for the near future. In this paper, we present a novel topology-refining scheme based on a workload prediction mechanism. Predictions are made through a model based on a combination of SVR, autoregressive, and moving average model with a feedback mechanism. Our streaming system is designed to increase the overall performance by making the topology refining robust to the incoming workload on the fly, while still being able to achieve QoS goals of SLA constraints. Apache Flink distributed processing engine is used as a testbed in the paper. The result shows that the prediction scheme works well for both workloads, i.e., synthetic as well as real traces of data."
