https://openalex.org/W2895486342,"The UK Biobank project is a prospective cohort study with deep genetic and phenotypic data collected on approximately 500,000 individuals from across the United Kingdom, aged between 40 and 69 at recruitment. The open resource is unique in its size and scope. A rich variety of phenotypic and health-related information is available on each participant, including biological measurements, lifestyle indicators, biomarkers in blood and urine, and imaging of the body and brain. Follow-up information is provided by linking health and medical records. Genome-wide genotype data have been collected on all participants, providing many opportunities for the discovery of new genetic associations and the genetic bases of complex traits. Here we describe the centralized analysis of the genetic data, including genotype quality, properties of population structure and relatedness of the genetic data, and efficient phasing and genotype imputation that increases the number of testable variants to around 96 million. Classical allelic variation at 11 human leukocyte antigen genes was imputed, resulting in the recovery of signals with known associations between human leukocyte antigen alleles and many diseases. Deep phenotype and genome-wide genetic data from 500,000 individuals from the UK Biobank, describing population structure and relatedness in the cohort, and imputation to increase the number of testable variants to 96 million."
https://openalex.org/W2895126220,"Metal halide perovskite materials are an emerging class of solution-processable semiconductors with considerable potential for use in optoelectronic devices1–3. For example, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these materials could see application in flat-panel displays and solid-state lighting, owing to their potential to be made at low cost via facile solution processing, and could provide tunable colours and narrow emission line widths at high photoluminescence quantum yields4–8. However, the highest reported external quantum efficiencies of green- and red-light-emitting perovskite LEDs are around 14 per cent7,9 and 12 per cent8, respectively—still well behind the performance of organic LEDs10–12 and inorganic quantum dot LEDs13. Here we describe visible-light-emitting perovskite LEDs that surpass the quantum efficiency milestone of 20 per cent. This achievement stems from a new strategy for managing the compositional distribution in the device—an approach that simultaneously provides high luminescence and balanced charge injection. Specifically, we mixed a presynthesized CsPbBr3 perovskite with a MABr additive (where MA is CH3NH3), the differing solubilities of which yield sequential crystallization into a CsPbBr3/MABr quasi-core/shell structure. The MABr shell passivates the nonradiative defects that would otherwise be present in CsPbBr3 crystals, boosting the photoluminescence quantum efficiency, while the MABr capping layer enables balanced charge injection. The resulting 20.3 per cent external quantum efficiency represents a substantial step towards the practical application of perovskite LEDs in lighting and display. A strategy for managing the compositional distribution in metal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes enables them to surpass 20% external quantum efficiency—a step towards their practical application in lighting and displays."
https://openalex.org/W2895932308,"The food system is a major driver of climate change, changes in land use, depletion of freshwater resources, and pollution of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems through excessive nitrogen and phosphorus inputs. Here we show that between 2010 and 2050, as a result of expected changes in population and income levels, the environmental effects of the food system could increase by 50–90% in the absence of technological changes and dedicated mitigation measures, reaching levels that are beyond the planetary boundaries that define a safe operating space for humanity. We analyse several options for reducing the environmental effects of the food system, including dietary changes towards healthier, more plant-based diets, improvements in technologies and management, and reductions in food loss and waste. We find that no single measure is enough to keep these effects within all planetary boundaries simultaneously, and that a synergistic combination of measures will be needed to sufficiently mitigate the projected increase in environmental pressures. A global model finds that the environmental impacts of the food system could increase by 60–90% by 2050, and that dietary changes, improvements in technologies and management, and reductions in food loss and waste will all be needed to mitigate these impacts."

https://openalex.org/W2895693082,"The genetic architecture of brain structure and function is largely unknown. To investigate this, we carried out genome-wide association studies of 3,144 functional and structural brain imaging phenotypes from UK Biobank (discovery dataset 8,428 subjects). Here we show that many of these phenotypes are heritable. We identify 148 clusters of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and imaging phenotypes that replicate at P < 0.05, when we would expect 21 to replicate by chance. Notable significant, interpretable associations include: iron transport and storage genes, related to magnetic susceptibility of subcortical brain tissue; extracellular matrix and epidermal growth factor genes, associated with white matter micro-structure and lesions; genes that regulate mid-line axon development, associated with organization of the pontine crossing tract; and overall 17 genes involved in development, pathway signalling and plasticity. Our results provide insights into the genetic architecture of the brain that are relevant to neurological and psychiatric disorders, brain development and ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2897776677,"Probiotic nutrition is frequently claimed to improve human health. In particular, live probiotic bacteria obtained with food are thought to reduce intestinal colonization by pathogens, and thus to reduce susceptibility to infection. However, the mechanisms that underlie these effects remain poorly understood. Here we report that the consumption of probiotic Bacillus bacteria comprehensively abolished colonization by the dangerous pathogen Staphylococcus aureus in a rural Thai population. We show that a widespread class of Bacillus lipopeptides, the fengycins, eliminates S. aureus by inhibiting S. aureus quorum sensing-a process through which bacteria respond to their population density by altering gene regulation. Our study presents a detailed molecular mechanism that underlines the importance of probiotic nutrition in reducing infectious disease. We also provide evidence that supports the biological significance of probiotic bacterial interference in humans, and show that such interference can be achieved by blocking a pathogen's signalling system. Furthermore, our findings suggest a probiotic-based method for S. aureus decolonization and new ways to fight S. aureus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2896875037,"Tumours evade immune control by creating hostile microenvironments that perturb T cell metabolism and effector function1-4. However, it remains unclear how intra-tumoral T cells integrate and interpret metabolic stress signals. Here we report that ovarian cancer-an aggressive malignancy that is refractory to standard treatments and current immunotherapies5-8-induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and activates the IRE1α-XBP1 arm of the unfolded protein response9,10 in T cells to control their mitochondrial respiration and anti-tumour function. In T cells isolated from specimens collected from patients with ovarian cancer, upregulation of XBP1 was associated with decreased infiltration of T cells into tumours and with reduced IFNG mRNA expression. Malignant ascites fluid obtained from patients with ovarian cancer inhibited glucose uptake and caused N-linked protein glycosylation defects in T cells, which triggered IRE1α-XBP1 activation that suppressed mitochondrial activity and IFNγ production. Mechanistically, induction of XBP1 regulated the abundance of glutamine carriers and thus limited the influx of glutamine that is necessary to sustain mitochondrial respiration in T cells under glucose-deprived conditions. Restoring N-linked protein glycosylation, abrogating IRE1α-XBP1 activation or enforcing expression of glutamine transporters enhanced mitochondrial respiration in human T cells exposed to ovarian cancer ascites. XBP1-deficient T cells in the metastatic ovarian cancer milieu exhibited global transcriptional reprogramming and improved effector capacity. Accordingly, mice that bear ovarian cancer and lack XBP1 selectively in T cells demonstrate superior anti-tumour immunity, delayed malignant progression and increased overall survival. Controlling endoplasmic reticulum stress or targeting IRE1α-XBP1 signalling may help to restore the metabolic fitness and anti-tumour capacity of T cells in cancer hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2896617055,"Despite considerable efforts over the past decade, only 34 fast radio bursts-intense bursts of radio emission from beyond our Galaxy-have been reported1,2. Attempts to understand the population as a whole have been hindered by the highly heterogeneous nature of the searches, which have been conducted with telescopes of different sensitivities, at a range of radio frequencies, and in environments corrupted by different levels of radio-frequency interference from human activity. Searches have been further complicated by uncertain burst positions and brightnesses-a consequence of the transient nature of the sources and the poor angular resolution of the detecting instruments. The discovery of repeating bursts from one source3, and its subsequent localization4 to a dwarf galaxy at a distance of 3.7 billion light years, confirmed that the population of fast radio bursts is located at cosmological distances. However, the nature of the emission remains elusive. Here we report a well controlled, wide-field radio survey for these bursts. We found 20, none of which repeated during follow-up observations between 185-1,097 hours after the initial detections. The sample includes both the nearest and the most energetic bursts detected so far. The survey demonstrates that there is a relationship between burst dispersion and brightness and that the high-fluence bursts are the nearby analogues of the more distant events found in higher-sensitivity, narrower-field surveys5."
https://openalex.org/W2895492583,"The Paris Agreement promotes forest management as a pathway towards halting climate warming through the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions1. However, the climate benefits from carbon sequestration through forest management may be reinforced, counteracted or even offset by concurrent management-induced changes in surface albedo, land-surface roughness, emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, transpiration and sensible heat flux2–4. Consequently, forest management could offset CO2 emissions without halting global temperature rise. It therefore remains to be confirmed whether commonly proposed sustainable European forest-management portfolios would comply with the Paris Agreement—that is, whether they can reduce the growth rate of atmospheric CO2, reduce the radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere, and neither increase the near-surface air temperature nor decrease precipitation by the end of the twenty-first century. Here we show that the portfolio made up of management systems that locally maximize the carbon sink through carbon sequestration, wood use and product and energy substitution reduces the growth rate of atmospheric CO2, but does not meet any of the other criteria. The portfolios that maximize the carbon sink or forest albedo pass only one—different in each case—criterion. Managing the European forests with the objective of reducing near-surface air temperature, on the other hand, will also reduce the atmospheric CO2 growth rate, thus meeting two of the four criteria. Trade-off are thus unavoidable when using European forests to meet climate objectives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that if present-day forest cover is sustained, the additional climate benefits achieved through forest management would be modest and local, rather than global. On the basis of these findings, we argue that Europe should not rely on forest management to mitigate climate change. The modest climate effects from changes in forest management imply, however, that if adaptation to future climate were to require large-scale changes in species composition and silvicultural systems over Europe5,6, the forests could be adapted to climate change with neither positive nor negative climate effects. Simulations of commonly proposed forest-management portfolios for Europe show that no single portfolio would meet all the requirements of the Paris Agreement, and climate benefits from forest management would be modest and local."
https://openalex.org/W2895872801,"The mammalian cochlea contains two types of mechanosensory hair cell that have different and critical functions in hearing. Inner hair cells (IHCs), which have an elaborate presynaptic apparatus, signal to cochlear neurons and communicate sound information to the brain. Outer hair cells (OHCs) mechanically amplify sound-induced vibrations, providing enhanced sensitivity to sound and sharp tuning. Cochlear hair cells are solely generated during development, and hair cell death—most often of OHCs—is the most common cause of deafness. OHCs and IHCs, together with supporting cells, originate in embryos from the prosensory region of the otocyst, but how hair cells differentiate into two different types is unknown1–3. Here we show that Insm1, which encodes a zinc finger protein that is transiently expressed in nascent OHCs, consolidates their fate by preventing trans-differentiation into IHCs. In the absence of INSM1, many hair cells that are born as OHCs switch fates to become mature IHCs. To identify the genetic mechanisms by which Insm1 operates, we compared the transcriptomes of immature IHCs and OHCs, and of OHCs with and without INSM1. In OHCs that lack INSM1, a set of genes is upregulated, most of which are normally preferentially expressed by IHCs. The homeotic cell transformation of OHCs without INSM1 into IHCs reveals a mechanism by which these neighbouring mechanosensory cells begin to differ: INSM1 represses a core set of early IHC-enriched genes in embryonic OHCs and makes them unresponsive to an IHC-inducing gradient, so that they proceed to mature as OHCs. Without INSM1, some of the OHCs in which these few IHC-enriched transcripts are upregulated trans-differentiate into IHCs, identifying candidate genes for IHC-specific differentiation. Conditional deletion of Insm1 in mice demonstrates that INSM1 is the key switch that causes the maturation of outer hair cells in the cochlea, with its absence resulting in an increase in inner hair cells instead."

https://openalex.org/W2895920254,"Hsp90ab1 is upregulated in numerous solid tumors, which is thought to induce the angiogenesis and promote cancer metastasis. However, it’s actions in gastric cancer (GC) has not been exhibited. In this study, Hsp90ab1 was demonstrated to be overexpressed and correlated with the poor prognosis, proliferation and invasion of GC. Ectopic expression of Hsp90ab1 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro in cell line models of GC and in vivo using two different xenograft mouse models, while opposite effects were observed in Hsp90ab1 silenced cells. Moreover, the underlining molecular mechanism was explored by the co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, GST pull-down and in vitro ubiquitination assay. Namely, Hsp90ab1 exerted these functions via the interaction of LRP5 and inhibited ubiquitin-mediated degradation of LRP5, an indispensable coreceptor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, the crosstalk between Hsp90ab1 and LRP5 contributed to the upregulation of multiple mesenchymal markers, which are also targets of Wnt/β-catenin. Collectively, this study uncovers the details of the Hsp90ab1-LRP5 axis, providing novel insights into the role and mechanism of invasion and metastasis in GC."
https://openalex.org/W2896030446,"The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 (nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1) is the architectural component of nuclear paraspeckles, and it has recently gained considerable attention as it is abnormally expressed in pathological conditions such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. NEAT1 and paraspeckle formation are increased in cells upon exposure to a variety of environmental stressors and believed to play an important role in cell survival. The present study was undertaken to further investigate the role of NEAT1 in cellular stress response pathways. We show that NEAT1 is a novel target gene of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and is up-regulated when the heat shock response pathway is activated by sulforaphane (SFN) or elevated temperature. HSF1 binds specifically to a newly identified conserved heat shock element in the NEAT1 promoter. In line with this, SFN induced the formation of NEAT1-containing paraspeckles via an HSF1-dependent mechanism. HSF1 plays a key role in the cellular response to proteotoxic stress by promoting the expression of a series of genes, including those encoding molecular chaperones. We have found that the expression of HSP70, HSP90, and HSP27 is amplified and sustained during heat shock in NEAT1-depleted cells compared with control cells, indicating that NEAT1 feeds back via an unknown mechanism to regulate HSF1 activity. This interrelationship is potentially significant in human diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2896285889,"Ovarian carcinoma-associated mesenchymal stem cells (CA-MSC) produce not only high levels of interleukin-6 (IL6) but also the related cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). IL6-mediated activation of STAT3 is implicated as a critical therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Less is known about the role of LIF, which can similarly activate STAT3, in ovarian cancer. We therefore sought to evaluate the tumorigenic effects of CA-MSC paracrine LIF signaling and the redundancy of IL6 and LIF in activating ovarian cancer STAT3 mediated cancer growth. As expected, we found that both IL6 and LIF induce STAT3 phosphorylation in tumor cells. In addition, both IL6 and LIF increased the percentage of ALDH+ ovarian cancer stem-like cells (CSC). Supporting redundancy of function by the two cytokines, CA-MSC induced STAT3 phosphorylation and increased cancer cell ""stemness"". This effect was not inhibited by LIF or IL6 blocking antibodies alone, but was prevented by dual IL6/LIF blockade or JAK2 inhibition. Similarly, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated reduction of IL6 or LIF in CA-MSC partially decreased but could not completely abrograte the ability of CA-MSC to induce STAT3 phosphorylation and stemness. Importantly, the in vivo pro-tumorigenic effect of CA-MSC is abrogated by dual blockade with the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib to a much greater extent than treatment with anti-IL6 or anti-LIF antibody alone. Ruxolitinib treatment also improves survival in the immunocompetent ovarian cancer mouse model system with ID8 tumor cells plus MSC. Ruxolitinib-treated tumors in both the immunocompromised and immunocompetent animal models demonstrate decreased phospho-STAT3, indicating on-target activity. In conclusion, CA-MSC activate ovarian cancer cell STAT3 signaling via IL6 and LIF and increase tumor cell stemness. This functional redundancy suggests that therapeutic targeting of a single cytokine may be less effective than strategies such as dual inhibitor therapy or targeting shared downstream factors of the JAK/STAT pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2896841699,"Argonaute2 (AGO2) is an effector of small RNA mediated gene silencing. Increasing evidence show that post-translational modifications of AGO2 can change miRNA activity at specific or global levels. Among the six mature miRNAs that are encoded by miR-17-92, miR-19b1 is the most powerful to exert the oncogenic properties of the entire cluster. Here we identify that AGO2 can be acetylated by P300/CBP and deacetylated by HDAC7, and that acetylation occurs at three sites K720, K493, and K355. Mutation of K493R/K720R, but not K355R at AGO2, inhibits miR-19b biogenesis. We demonstrate that acetylation of AGO2 specifically increases its recruiting pre-miR-19b1 to form the miPDC (miRNA precursor deposit complex), thereby to enhance miR-19b maturation. The motif UGUGUG in the terminal-loop of pre-miR-19b1, as a specific processing feature that is recognized and bound by acetylated AGO2, is essential for the assembly of miRISC (miRNA-induced silencing complex) loading complex. Analyses on public clinical data, xenograft mouse models, and IHC and ISH staining of lung cancer tissues, further confirm that the high levels of both AGO2 acetylation and miR-19b correlate with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Our finding reveals a novel function of AGO2 acetylation in increasing oncogenic miR-19b biogenesis and suggests that modulation of AGO2 acetylation has potential clinical implications."

https://openalex.org/W2897240040,"Staphylococcal extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) such as extracellular DNA (eDNA) and poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide (PNAG) mediate numerous virulence traits including host colonization and antimicrobial resistance. Previous studies showed that EPS-degrading enzymes increase staphylococcal biocide susceptibility in vitro and in vivo, and decrease virulence in animal models. In the present study we tested the effect of EPS-degrading enzymes on staphylococcal skin colonization and povidone iodine susceptibility using a novel in vivo pig model that enabled us to colonize and treat 96 isolated areas of skin on a single animal in vivo. To quantitate skin colonization, punch biopsies of colonized areas were homogenized, diluted, and plated on agar for colony forming unit enumeration. Skin was colonized with either Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus. Two EPS-degrading enzymes, DNase I and the PNAG-degrading enzyme dispersin B, were employed. Enzymes were tested for their ability to inhibit skin colonization and detach preattached bacteria. The effect of enzymes on the susceptibility of preattached S. aureus to killing by povidone iodine was also measured. We found that dispersin B significantly inhibited skin colonization by S. epidermidis and detached preattached S. epidermidis cells from skin. A cocktail of dispersin B and DNase I detached preattached S. aureus cells from skin and increased their susceptibility to killing by povidone iodine. These findings suggest that staphylococcal EPS components such as eDNA and PNAG contribute to skin colonization and biocide resistance in vivo. EPS-degrading enzymes may be a useful adjunct to conventional skin antisepsis procedures in order to further reduce skin bioburden."
https://openalex.org/W2896827002,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a common cause of maternal morbidity, characterized by impaired trophoblast invasion and spiral artery transformation resulting in progressive uteroplacental hypoxia. Given the primary role of LIN28A and LIN28B in modulating cell metabolism, differentiation, and invasion, we hypothesized that LIN28A and/or LIN28B regulates trophoblast differentiation and invasion, and that its dysregulation may contribute to PE. Here we show that LIN28B is expressed ∼1300-fold higher than LIN28A in human term placenta and is the predominant paralog expressed in primary human trophoblast cultures. The expression of LIN28B mRNA and protein levels are significantly reduced in gestational age-matched preeclamptic vs. normal placentas, whereas LIN28A expression is not different. First trimester human placental sections displayed stronger LIN28B immunoreactivity in extravillous (invasive) cytotrophoblasts and syncytial sprouts vs. villous trophoblasts. LIN28B overexpression increased HTR8 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas LIN28B knockdown in JEG3 cells reduced cell proliferation. Moreover, LIN28B knockdown in JEG3 cells suppressed syncytin 1 (SYN-1), apelin receptor early endogenous ligand (ELABELA), and the chromosome 19 microRNA cluster, and increased mRNA expression of ITGβ4 and TNF-α. Incubation of BeWo and JEG3 cells under hypoxia significantly decreased expression of LIN28B and LIN28A, SYN-1, and ELABELA, whereas TNF-α is increased. These results provide the first evidence that LIN28B is the predominant paralog in human placenta and that decreased LIN28B may play a role in PE by reducing trophoblast invasion and syncytialization, and by promoting inflammation.-Canfield, J., Arlier, S., Mong, E.

We found that the circRNA expression profile of the healthy carotid arteries and the injured arteries were significantly different. We investigated the role of rno-circ_005717 (circDiaph3) in the differentiation of rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We found that knockdown of circDiaph3 up-regulated the level of diaphanous-related formin-3 and promoted the differentiation of VSMCs to contractile type. In addition, circDiaph3 up-regulated the transcription of Igf1r and supported the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. circDiaph3 could be a molecular target to combat intimal hyperplasia.—Xu, J.-Y., Chang, N.-B., Rong, Z.-H., Li, T., Xiao, L., Yao, Q.-P., Jiang, R., Jiang, J. circDiaph3 regulates rat vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration.

https://openalex.org/W2897095895,"Genetically modified mice are commonly generated by the microinjection of pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells into wild-type host blastocysts1, producing chimeric progeny that require breeding for germline transmission and homozygosity of modified alleles. As an alternative approach and to facilitate studies of the immune system, we previously developed RAG2-deficient blastocyst complementation2. Because RAG2-deficient mice cannot undergo V(D)J recombination, they do not develop B or T lineage cells beyond the progenitor stage2: injecting RAG2-sufficient donor ES cells into RAG2-deficient blastocysts generates somatic chimaeras in which all mature lymphocytes derive from donor ES cells. This enables analysis, in mature lymphocytes, of the functions of genes that are required more generally for mouse development3. Blastocyst complementation has been extended to pancreas organogenesis4, and used to generate several other tissues or organs5,6,7,8,9,10, but an equivalent approach for brain organogenesis has not yet been achieved. Here we describe neural blastocyst complementation (NBC), which can be used to study the development and function of specific forebrain regions. NBC involves targeted ablation, mediated by diphtheria toxin subunit A, of host-derived dorsal telencephalic progenitors during development. This ablation creates a vacant forebrain niche in host embryos that results in agenesis of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Injection of donor ES cells into blastocysts with forebrain-specific targeting of diphtheria toxin subunit A enables donor-derived dorsal telencephalic progenitors to populate the vacant niche in the host embryos, giving rise to neocortices and hippocampi that are morphologically and neurologically normal with respect to learning and memory formation. Moreover, doublecortin-deficient ES cells—generated via a CRISPR–Cas9 approach—produced NBC chimaeras that faithfully recapitulated the phenotype of conventional, germline doublecortin-deficient mice. We conclude that NBC is a rapid and efficient approach to generate complex mouse models for studying forebrain functions; this approach could more broadly facilitate organogenesis based on blastocyst complementation."
https://openalex.org/W2896095120,"Recently, we showed that tacrolimus-induced renal injury was closely associated with impairment of autophagy clearance, and Klotho deficiency aggravated tacrolimus-induced renal injury. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Klotho treatment on autophagy clearance in tacrolimus-induced renal injury. We evaluated the effect of Klotho on tacrolimus-induced renal injury in an experimental mouse model and in vitro by treatment with tacrolimus and/or recombinant mouse Klotho. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that tacrolimus treatment impaired lysosomal acidification and decreased cathepsin B activity, expression of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2, and expression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator for lysosomal biogenesis. These results were improved by Klotho treatment. Moreover, addition of bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of lysosomal function, abolished the protective effect of Klotho, indicating that the protective effect of Klotho was closely associated with lysosome function. Klotho induced nuclear translocation of TFEB through inhibition of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) by confirming using CHIR99021, a GSK3β inhibitor.

Mechanisms of HBV control by FXRα remain to be unveiled. FXRα silencing in HBV-infected HepaRG cells decreased the viral covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA pool size and transcriptional activity. Treatment with the FXRα agonist GW4064 inhibited FXRα proviral effect on cccDNA similarly for wild-type and hepatitis B viral X protein (HBx)–deficient virus, whereas agonist-induced inhibition of pregenomic and precore RNA transcription and viral DNA secretion was HBx dependent. These data indicated that FXRα acts as a proviral factor by 2 different mechanisms, which are abolished by FXRα stimulation. Finally, infection of C3H/HeN mice by a recombinant adeno-associated virus-2/8-HBV vector induced a sustained HBV replication in young mice in contrast with the transient decline in adult mice. Four-week GW4064 treatment of infected C3H/HeN mice decreased secretion of HBV DNA and HB surface antigen in adult mice only. These results suggest that the physiologic balance of FXRα expression and activation by bile acid is a key host metabolic pathway in the regulation of HBV infection and that FXRα can be envisioned as a target for HBV treatment.—Mouzannar, K., Fusil, F., Lacombe, B., Ollivier, A., Ménard, C., Lotteau, V., Cosset, F.-L., Ramière, C., André, P.

By removing such damaged proteins, the proteasome plays an essential role in maintaining the fidelity of oocyte meiosis. In this study, we established that decreased proteasome activity in naturally aged, germinal vesicle (GV) mouse oocytes positively correlates with increased protein modification by the lipid aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Furthermore, attenuation of proteasome activity in GV oocytes of young animals was accompanied by an increase in 4-HNE–modified proteins, including α-tubulin, thereby contributing to a reduction in tubulin polymerization, microtubule stability, and integrity of oocyte meiosis. A decrease in proteasome activity was also recapitulated in the GV oocytes of young animals following exposure to oxidative insults in the form of either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or 4-HNE. We also observed that upon oxidative insult, 4-HNE exhibits elevated adduction to multiple proteasomal subunits. Notably, the inclusion of the antioxidant penicillamine, to limit propagation of oxidative stress cascades, led to a complete recovery of proteasome activity and enhanced clearance of 4-HNE–adducted α-tubulin during a 6-h post-treatment recovery period. This strategy also proved effective in reducing the incidence of oxidative stress–induced aneuploidy following in vitro oocyte maturation, but was ineffective for naturally aged oocytes.

However, the structural properties of G4s in S. cerevisiae and the substrate preference of Pif1 for different G4s remain unknown. Here, using CD spectroscopy and 83 G4 motifs from S. cerevisiae ranging in length from 30 to 60 nucleotides, we first show that G4 structures can be formed with a broad range of loop sizes in vitro and that a parallel conformation is favored. Using single-molecule FRET analysis, we then systematically addressed Pif1-mediated unwinding of various G4s and found that Pif1 is sensitive to G4 stability. Moreover, Pif1 preferentially unfolded antiparallel G4s rather than parallel G4s having similar stability. Furthermore, our results indicate that most G4 structures in S. cerevisiae sequences have long loops and can be efficiently unfolded by Pif1 because of their low stability. However, we also found that G4 structures with short loops can be barely unfolded. This study highlights the formidable capability of Pif1 to resolve the majority of G4s in S. cerevisiae sequences, narrows the fractions of G4s that may be challenging for genomic stability, and provides a framework for understanding the influence of different G4s on genomic stability via their processing by Pif1.

By introducing human G4-forming minisatellite CEB1 into S. cerevisiae genome, Piazza et al. (12Piazza A. Boulé J.B. Lopes J. Mingo K. Largy E. Teulade-Fichou M.P. Nicolas A. Genetic instability triggered by G-quadruplex interacting Phen-DC compounds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 (20223771): 4337-434810.1093/nar/gkq136Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) discovered that phenanthroline DC (Phen-DC) compounds specifically induce recombination-dependent DNA rearrangement, suggesting that Pif1 may not be able to resolve those stabilized G4 structures. Minisatellites of CEB25 variants with short loop length and high thermal stability have also been shown to trigger genomic instability in S. cerevisiae (17Piazza A. Adrian M. Samazan F. Heddi B. Hamon F. Serero A. Lopes J. Teulade-Fichou M.P. Phan A.T. Nicolas A. Short loop length and high thermal stability determine genomic instability induced by G-quadruplex-forming minisatellites.EMBO J. 2015; 34 (25956747): 1718-173410.15252/embj.201490702Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In those studies, exogenous G4 structures were used to probe the functions of G4s in genomic stability. However, whether Pif1 is capable of resolving all kinds of endogenous G4 structures in S. cerevisiae or whether Pif1 just preferentially unfolds specific G4s is still unknown. Paeschke et al. (16Paeschke K. Capra J.A. Zakian V.A. DNA Replication through G-quadruplex motifs is promoted by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 DNA helicase.Cell. 2011; 145 (21620135): 678-69110.1016/j.cell.2011.04.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) reported that only 25% of G4 motifs were associated with Pif1 in the S. cerevisiae genome. In addition, several other helicases in S. cerevisiae, including Sgs1, Srs2, Dna2, and Rrm3, have also been discovered to unfold G4 structures (9Paeschke K. Bochman M.L. Garcia P.D. Cejka P. Friedman K.L. Kowalczykowski S.C. Zakian V.A.

This evidence suggests that different helicases may be responsible for processing different G4 structures in S. cerevisiae. Therefore, a systematic study of Pif1 unwinding activity toward various G4 structures in vitro may provide insight into its in vivo G4 substrates in S. cerevisiae. Besides resolving G4s, Pif1 is also involved in inhibiting telomerase activity at telomeres and DSBs, processing Okazaki fragments, and ribosomal DNA replication in nucleus. Moreover, Pif1 participates in mitochondrial DNA recombination, replication, and maintenance (18Bochman M.L. Sabouri N. Zakian V.A. Unwinding the functions of the Pif1 family helicases.DNA Repair. 2010; 9 (20097624): 237-24910.1016/j.dnarep.2010.01.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and Pif1 has been indicated to be part of the mitochondrial replisome (19Cheng X. Dunaway S. Ivessa A.S. The role of Pif1p, a DNA helicase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in maintaining mitochondrial DNA.Mitochondrion. 2007; 7 (17257907): 211-22210.1016/j.mito.2006.11.023Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Some of those functions require Pif1 to translocate on ssDNA and unwind duplex DNA into single strands (20Ramanagoudr-Bhojappa R. Chib S. Byrd A.K. Aarattuthodiyil S. Pandey M. Patel S.S. Raney K.D. Yeast Pif1 helicase exhibits a one-base-pair stepping mechanism for unwinding duplex DNA.J. Biol.

However, formation of G4 structures may directly affect the activity of Pif1 to unwind the downstream duplex. Therefore, studying the impact of G4 structures on Pif1 activity will be important to understand how G4 structures can modulate the rate of DNA transactions such as mitochondrial DNA replication in S. cerevisiae. We have shown that for a G4-duplex conjugate, at low protein concentration, monomeric Pif1 unfolds G4 structures repetitively in successive runs but without further unwinding the downstream duplex as Pif1 dimerization is required for optimal duplex DNA unwinding (14Hou X.M. Wu W.Q. Duan X.L. Liu N.N. Li H.H. Fu J. Dou S.X. Li M. Xi X.G. Molecular mechanism of G-quadruplex unwinding helicase: sequential and repetitive unfolding of G-quadruplex by Pif1 helicase.Biochem. J. 2015; 466 (25471447): 189-19910.1042/BJ20140997Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At high protein concentration, G4 structure is able to stimulate Pif1-catalyzed downstream duplex unwinding (21Zhang B. Wu W.Q. Liu N.N. Duan X.L. Li M. Dou S.X. Hou X.M. Xi X.G. G-quadruplex and G-rich sequence stimulate Pif1p-catalyzed downstream duplex DNA unwinding through reducing waiting time at ss/dsDNA junction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27471032): 8385-839410.1093/nar/gkw669Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Of note, those experiments were performed in 50 mm NaCl with human telomeric G4 sequence, resulting in a less stabilized G4 structure. In contrast, Pif1 was reported to unfold the parallel c-Myc G4 more slowly relative to unwinding of duplex in 50 mm KCl (22Byrd A.K. Raney K.D. A parallel quadruplex DNA is bound tightly but unfolded slowly by Pif1 helicase.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 (25589786): 6482-649410.1074/jbc.M114.630749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mendoza et al. (23Mendoza O. Gueddouda N.M. Boulé J.B. Bourdoncle A. Mergny J.L. A fluorescence-based helicase assay: application to the screening of G-quadruplex ligands.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25765657): e7110.1093/nar/gkv193Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that a stable intramolecular G4 can resist unfolding by Pif1 helicase in 100 mm KCl. Therefore, whether G4 structures with different thermal stabilities or folding conformations can stimulate or impair Pif1 activity is still controversial. In this study, we first showed that sequences from S. cerevisiae can form G4 structures with a broad range of loop sizes in vitro. They may adopt different conformations, but parallel form is favored. In addition, their thermal stability gradually decreases with increasing G4 motif length. Afterward, we characterized Pif1 unwinding activity toward various G4 structures systematically. We showed that Pif1 is sensitive to the stability of G4, and downstream duplex unwinding is limited by how fast G4 structure is unfolded. In addition, Pif1 preferentially unwinds antiparallel G4s over parallel G4s with similar stability, and conformation is most influential for G4s with very high stability. More importantly, we discovered that Pif1 should be able to efficiently resolve the majority of G4 structures in S. cerevisiae because of their low thermal stability. However, Pif1 demonstrates very poor activity toward G4 structures with short loops as a result of their high stability and parallel conformation, suggesting this kind of G4 may be resolved by other helicases, or additional in vivo factors may assist Pif1 to remove them. The present work sheds new light on the formation and structural properties of G4s in S. cerevisiae and reveals the factors that may influence their removal by Pif1. Hershman et al. (4Hershman S.G. Chen Q. Lee J.Y. Kozak M.L. Yue P. Wang L.S. Johnson F.B. Genomic distribution and functional analyses of potential G-quadruplex-forming sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 (17999996): 144-15610.1093/nar/gkm986Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) have predicted the DNA sequences with G4-forming potential in S. cerevisiae genome using a bioinformatics method. Based on their results, we analyzed the features of G4 motifs from 15 to 60 nt. Fig. S1A demonstrates that the number of G4 motifs increases significantly with increasing sequence length. In particular, there are a large number of G4 motifs with a sequence longer than 30 nt. However, it is still unknown how many of those predicted G4 motifs actually fold into G4 structures. To this end, 83 G4 motifs were randomly selected from S. cerevisiae (Table S2) (4Hershman S.G. Chen Q. Lee J.Y. Kozak M.L. Yue P. Wang L.S. Johnson F.B. Genomic distribution and functional analyses of potential G-quadruplex-forming sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 (17999996): 144-15610.1093/nar/gkm986Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and their folding properties were examined by circular dichroism (CD). It is generally accepted that parallel G4 will generate a characteristic maximum near 265 nm and a minimum near 240 nm. Antiparallel G4 has a distinct spectrum with a maximum near 290 nm accompanied by a minimum near 260 nm (24Bugaut A. Balasubramanian S. A sequence-independent study of the influence of short loop lengths on the stability and topology of intramolecular DNA G-quadruplexes.Biochemistry. 2008; 47 (18092816): 689-69710.1021/bi701873cCrossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In-depth studies further demonstrated that the CD profile depends mainly on the type of stacking, including anti-anti, syn-syn, anti-syn, and syn-anti, between G-tetrads rather than the strand orientations, and quantitative secondary structural information may be obtained by analyzing the CD profile to resolve the components in a mixture of topologies (25Masiero S.

According to previous reports (27Lane A.N. Chaires J.B. Gray R.D. Trent J.O.

The CD spectra in Fig. S2 demonstrate that G4 structures can indeed be formed in 41 of those G4 motifs with a broad range of loop sizes. For instance, one single loop can be as long as 20, 27, or more than 30 nt, updating our knowledge about the loop length of G4 structures. We then chose 10 sequences from Fig. S2 and further confirmed the formation of G4 structures with an engineered, structure-specific antibody that binds with high selectivity to G4 structure (30Biffi G. Tannahill D. McCafferty J. Balasubramanian S. Quantitative visualization of DNA G-quadruplex structures in human cells.Nat. Chem. 2013; 5 (23422559): 182-18610.1038/nchem.1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). Fig. S3 shows that although ssDNA fails to bind to the antibody, those G4s with 30–55-nt sequences can bind well to the antibody, indicating G4 structures can indeed be formed, consistent with the results of CD spectra. Next, we determined the fractions of G4 motifs that can fold into G4 structures based on the CD spectra. The number of sequences with G4 formation was divided by the total number of sequences with a specific G4 length in Table S2, generating the folding fraction. Fig. 1A shows that G4 structures are formed in all of the 30-nt G4 motifs; however, the probability of G4 formation decreases gradually as the sequence length increases. For the 45-nt G4 motifs, 50% of the sequences can be folded, whereas none of the sequences are folded once the length reaches 60 nt, indicating that G4 structures with sequences longer than 60 nt may not exist in S. cerevisiae. Fig. S2 also demonstrates that, based on the folding conformation, those G4 structures can be classified as mainly parallel, a mixture of parallel and antiparallel with similar fractions, and mainly antiparallel. Fig. 1B shows that the majority of the sequences adopt a mainly parallel conformation, suggesting that parallel G4 topology is favored in S. cerevisiae. Previous studies reported that parallel G4 structures are only present when the loops are too short to accommodate the antiparallel conformation (24Bugaut A. Balasubramanian S.

In those studies, the loops were usually pure thymine.

Therefore, the preference of parallel conformation in S. cerevisiae may be related to loop sequences that are particularly rich in thymine and guanine (Table S2). The thermal stability of those G4 structures has also been characterized by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) melting assay (34De Cian A. Guittat L. Kaiser M. Saccà B. Amrane S. Bourdoncle A. Alberti P. Teulade-Fichou M.P. Lacroix L. Mergny J.L. Fluorescence-based melting assays for studying quadruplex ligands.Methods. 2007; 42 (17472900): 183-19510.1016/j.ymeth.2006.10.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). G4 sequences were modified by donor and acceptor pairs (FAM and TAMRA) at both ends. The unfolding of G4 with increasing temperature will lead to an increased emission intensity in FAM. For each specific G4 length, two or three sequences (Table S1) were selected from the motifs that can fold into G4 structures. Fig. 1C shows that G4 stability decreases as the sequence becomes longer. For 32-3-3 with a 50-nt length, the melting temperature (Tm) is 40.6 °C in 100 mm KCl, which is much lower than the 60.1 °C value for three-layered G4 with 3-3-3 loops (named 3G4) in the same buffer (Table S3). The above results reflect that G4 structures with long DNA sequences in S. cerevisiae may have lower thermal stability. After characterizing the formation and structural properties of G4s in S. cerevisiae sequences, we wanted to address how these structures with different thermal stabilities and conformational diversity are resolved by Pif1. As Paeschke et al. (16Paeschke K. Capra J.A. Zakian V.A. DNA Replication through G-quadruplex motifs is promoted by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 DNA helicase.Cell. 2011; 145 (21620135): 678-69110.1016/j.cell.2011.04.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) reported that only a portion of G4 motifs were associated with Pif1 in S. cerevisiae, we hypothesized that Pif1 may be sensitive to the structural properties of G4s and preferentially act on specific G4 structures. We first determined whether Pif1 indeed reacts differently toward different G4 structures with varied G-tetrad layers or loop lengths using a fluorescently labeled substrate as described under “Experimental procedures.” The substrate contains a G4 structure with a 5′ tail of 26-nt ssDNA and a 3′ tail of 17-bp dsDNA, mimicking the ongoing synthesis of a leading or lagging strand stalled by G4 structure. The substrate was labeled with Cy3 at the 26th nucleotide from the 5′ end in the G4 strand and with Cy5 at the fifth nucleotide from the 3′ end in the complementary strand (Fig. 2A, C, E, and G, left panels). This spacing of the fluorophores ensured that the FRET signal may sensitively report the conformational change of G4 structure, and the simultaneous disappearance of Cy3 and Cy5 signals would reflect the escape of the unwound DNA from the coverslip. G4 structure in s263G4d17 can be well-formed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl as shown in our previous study (14Hou X.M. Wu W.Q. Duan X.L. Liu N.N. Li H.H. Fu J. Dou S.X. Li M.

The FRET distribution of s263G4d17 is composed of a major Gaussian peak around 0.95, corresponding to the well-folded G4 structure (Fig. 2A, right panel). In the presence of 5 nm Pif1 and 25 μm ATP, the high EFRET population decreases accompanied by an increase of low EFRET populations, suggesting the disruption of G4 structure by Pif1. The individual FRET trajectory shows several cycles of repetitive G4 unfolding without duplex unwinding, consistent with our previous report (14Hou X.M. Wu W.Q. Duan X.L. Liu N.N. Li H.H. Fu J.

https://openalex.org/W2895807593,"Speech Analysis for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems typically starts with a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) that implies selecting a fixed point in the time-frequency resolution trade-off. This approach, combined with a Mel-frequency scaled filterbank and a Discrete Cosine Transform give rise to the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), which have been the most common speech features in speech processing for the last decades. These features were particularly well suited for the previous Hidden Markov Models/Gaussian Mixture Models (HMM/GMM) state of the art in ASR. In particular they produced highly uncorrelated features of small dimensionality (typically 13 coefficients plus deltas and double deltas), which was very convenient for diagonal covariance GMMs, for dealing with the curse of dimensionality and for the limited computing resources of a decade ago. Currently most ASR systems use Deep Neural Networks (DNN) instead of the GMMs for modeling the acoustic features, which provides more flexibility regarding the definition of the features. In particular, acoustic features can be highly correlated and can be much larger in size because the DNNs are very powerful at processing high-dimensionality inputs. Also, the computing hardware has reached a level of evolution that makes computational cost in speech processing a less relevant issue. In this context we have decided to revisit the problem of the time-frequency resolution in speech analysis, and in particular to check if multi-resolution speech analysis (both in time and frequency) can be helpful in improving acoustic modeling using DNNs. Our experiments start with several Kaldi baseline system for the well known TIMIT corpus and modify them by adding multi-resolution speech representations by concatenating different spectra computed using different time-frequency resolutions and different post-processed and speaker-adapted features using different time-frequency resolutions. Our experiments show that using a multi-resolution speech representation tends to improve over results using the baseline single resolution speech representation, which seems to confirm our main hypothesis. However, results combining multi-resolution with the highly post-processed and speaker-adapted features, which provide the best results in Kaldi for TIMIT, yield only very modest improvements."
https://openalex.org/W2896153510,"Congenital disorders of glycosylation are severe inherited diseases in which aberrant protein glycosylation is a hallmark. Transmembrane protein 165 (TMEM165) is a novel Golgi transmembrane protein involved in type II congenital disorders of glycosylation. Although its biologic function is still a controversial issue, we have demonstrated that the Golgi glycosylation defect due to TMEM165 deficiency resulted from a Golgi Mn2+ homeostasis defect. The goal of this study was to delineate the cellular pathway by which extracellular Mn2+ rescues N-glycosylation in TMEM165 knockout (KO) cells. We first demonstrated that after extracellular exposure, Mn2+ uptake by HEK293 cells at the plasma membrane did not rely on endocytosis but was likely done by plasma membrane transporters. Second, we showed that the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase 1, also known to mediate the influx of cytosolic Mn2+ into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, is not crucial for the Mn2+-induced rescue glycosylation of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2). In contrast, our results demonstrate the involvement of cyclopiazonic acid—and thapsigargin (Tg)-sensitive pumps in the rescue of TMEM165-associated glycosylation defects by Mn2+. Interestingly, overexpression of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) 2b isoform in TMEM165 KO cells partially rescues the observed LAMP2 glycosylation defect. Overall, this study indicates that the rescue of Golgi N-glycosylation defects in TMEM165 KO cells by extracellular Mn2+ involves the activity of Tg and cyclopiazonic acid–sensitive pumps, probably the SERCA pumps.—Houdou, M., Lebredonchel, E., Garat, A., Duvet, S., Legrand, D., Decool, V., Klein, A., Ouzzine, M., Gasnier, B., Potelle, S., Foulquier, F.

https://openalex.org/W2897524210,"Purpose As atherosclerotic plaque ruptures are the primary cause of ischaemic events, their preventive identification by imaging remains a clinical challenge. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are involved in plaque progression and destabilisation and are therefore promising targets to characterize rupture-prone unstable plaques. This study aims at evaluating MMP imaging to discriminate unstable from stable plaque phenotypes. Methods ApoE deficient mice (ApoE-/-) on a high cholesterol diet underwent implantation of a tapered cuff around the right common carotid artery (CCA) inducing a highly inflamed atherosclerotic plaque upstream (US) and a more stable plaque phenotype downstream (DS) of the cuff. 8 weeks after surgery, the MMP inhibitor-based photoprobe Cy5.5-AF443 was administered i.v. 3h prior to in situ and ex vivo fluorescence reflectance imaging of the CCAs. Thereafter, CCAs were analysed regarding plaque size, presence of macrophages, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 concentrations by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Results We found a significantly higher uptake of Cy5.5-AF443 in US as compared to DS plaques in situ (1.29 vs. 1.06 plaque-to-background ratio; p<0.001), which was confirmed by ex vivo measurements. Immunohistochemistry revealed a higher presence of macrophages, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in US compared to DS plaques. Accordingly, MMP-2 concentrations were significantly higher in US plaques (47.2±7.6 vs. 29.6±4.6 ng/mg; p<0.05). Conclusions In the ApoE-/- cuff model MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities are significantly higher in upstream low shear stress-induced unstable atherosclerotic plaques as compared to downstream more stable plaque phenotypes. MMP inhibitor-based fluorescence molecular imaging allows visualization of these differences in shear stress-induced atherosclerosis."

Moreover, there is only limited information concerning transmission of HIV-1 drug resistance (TDR) in the country.A cross-sectional survey was conducted among young antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve individuals recently diagnosed with HIV infection, in Gondar, Ethiopia, 2011-2013 using the WHO recommended threshold survey. A total of 84 study participants with a median age of 22 years were enrolled. HIV-1 genotyping was performed and investigated for drug resistance in 67 individuals. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on all available HIV sequences obtained from Gondar (n = 301) which were used to define subtype C clades, temporal trends and local transmission clusters. Dating of transmission clusters was performed using BEAST.Four of 67 individuals (6.0%) carried a HIV drug resistance mutation strain, all associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Strains of the C-EA clade were most prevalent as we found no evidence of temporal changes during this time period. However, strains of the C-SA clade, prevalent in Southern Africa, have been introduced in Ethiopia, and became more abundant during the study period. The oldest Gondar transmission clusters dated back to 1980 (C-EA), 1983 (C-SA) and 1990 (C'-ET) indicating the presence of strains of different subtype C clades at about the same time point in Gondar. Moreover, some of the larger clusters dated back to the 1980s but transmissions within clusters have been ongoing up till end of the study period. Besides being associated with more sequences and larger clusters, the C-EA clade sequences were also associated with clustering of HIVDR sequences. One cluster was associated with the G190A mutation and showed onward transmissions at high rate.TDR was detected in 6.0% of the sequenced samples and confirmed pervious reports that the two subtype C clades, C-EA and C'-ET, are common in Ethiopia. Moreover, the findings indicated an increased diversity in the epidemic as well as differences in transmission clusters sizes of the different clades and association with resistance mutations. These findings provide epidemiological insights not directly available using standard surveillance and may inform the adjustment of public health strategies in HIV prevention in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W2897492592,"BPI-inducible protein A (BipA) is a conserved ribosome-associated GTPase in bacteria that is structurally similar to other GTPases associated with protein translation, including IF2, EF-Tu, and EF-G. Its binding site on the ribosome appears to overlap those of these translational GTPases. Mutations in the bipA gene cause a variety of phenotypes, including cold and antibiotics sensitivities and decreased pathogenicity, implying that BipA may participate in diverse cellular processes by regulating translation. According to recent studies, a bipA-deletion strain of Escherichia coli displays a ribosome assembly defect at low temperature, suggesting that BipA might be involved in ribosome assembly. To further investigate BipA’s role in ribosome biogenesis, here, we compared and analyzed the ribosomal protein compositions of MG1655 WT and bipA-deletion strains at 20 °C. Aberrant 50S ribosomal subunits (i.e. 44S particles) accumulated in the bipA-deletion strain at 20 °C, and the ribosomal protein L6 was absent in these 44S particles. Furthermore, bipA expression was significantly stimulated at 20 °C, suggesting that it encodes a cold shock–inducible GTPase. Moreover, the transcriptional regulator cAMP receptor protein (CRP) positively promoted bipA expression only at 20 °C. Importantly, GFP and α-glucosidase refolding assays revealed that BipA has chaperone activity. Our findings indicate that BipA is a cold shock–inducible GTPase that participates in 50S ribosomal subunit assembly by incorporating the L6 ribosomal protein into the 44S particle during the assembly."

Under physiological conditions, most native TRPM7 channels are inhibited by cytoplasmic Mg2+, protons, and polyamines. Currents through these channels (ITRPM7) are robustly potentiated when the cell interior is exchanged with low Mg2+-containing buffers. ITRPM7 is also potentiated by phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and suppressed by its hydrolysis. Here we characterized internal Mg2+- and pH-mediated inhibition of TRPM7 channels in HEK293 cells overexpressing WT voltage-sensing phospholipid phosphatase (VSP) or its catalytically inactive variant VSP-C363S. VSP-mediated depletion of membrane phosphoinositides significantly increased channel sensitivity to Mg2+ and pH. Proton concentrations that were too low to inhibit ITRPM7 when the VSP-C363S variant was expressed (pH 8.2) became inhibitory in WT VSP–expressing cells. At pH 6.5, protons inhibited ITRPM7 both in WT and VSP C363S–expressing cells but with a faster time course in the WT VSP–expressing cells. Inhibition by 150 μm Mg2+ was also significantly faster in the WT VSP–expressing cells. Cellular PI(4,5)P2 depletion increased the sensitivity of TRPM7 channels to the inhibitor 2-aminoethyl diphenyl borinate, which acidifies the cytosol. Single substitutions at Ser-1107 of TRPM7, reducing its sensitivity to Mg2+, also decreased its inhibition by spermine and acidic pH. Furthermore, these channel variants were markedly less sensitive to VSP-mediated PI(4,5)P2 depletion than the WT. We conclude that the internal Mg2+-, polyamine-, and pH-mediated inhibition of TRPM7 channels is not direct but, rather, reflects electrostatic screening and resultant disruption of PI(4,5)P2–channel interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2896521168,"Insulin promotes larval growth of insects by stimulating the synthesis of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), which induces pupation and apoptosis. However, the mechanism underlying the coordinate regulation of insect pupation and apoptosis by these two functionally opposing hormones is still unclear. Here, using the lepidopteran insect and serious agricultural pest Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm) as a model, we report that phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and forkhead box O (FoxO) play key roles in these processes. We found that the transcript levels of the PDK1 gene are increased during the larval feeding stages. Moreover, PDK1 expression was increased by insulin, but repressed by 20E. dsRNA-mediated PDK1 knockdown in the H. armigera larvae delayed pupation and resulted in small pupae and also decreased Akt/protein kinase B expression and increased FoxO expression. Furthermore, the PDK1 knockdown blocked midgut remodeling and decreased 20E levels in the larvae. Of note, injecting larvae with 20E overcame the effect of the PDK1 knockdown and restored midgut remodeling. FoxO overexpression in an H. armigera epidermal cell line (HaEpi) did not induce apoptosis, but promoted autophagy and repressed cell proliferation. These results reveal cross-talk between insulin and 20E and that both hormones oppose each other's activities in the regulation of insect pupation and apoptosis by controlling PDK1 expression and, in turn, FoxO expression. We conclude that sufficiently high 20E levels are a key factor for inducing apoptosis during insect pupation."
https://openalex.org/W2896638369,"Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a glycoprotein on the surface of epithelial cells that is essential for intestinal epithelial integrity and expressed at high levels in many epithelial derived cancers and circulating tumor cells. Here we show the effect of EpCAM levels on migration of Madin-Darby-Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells. MDCK cells depleted of EpCAM show increased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and of myosin, and increased cell spreading and epithelial sheet migration into a gap. In contrast, over-expression of EpCAM inhibits ERK and myosin activation, and slows epithelial sheet migration. Loss of EpCAM is rescued by EpCAM-YFP mutated in the extracellular domain required for cis-dimerization whereas EpCAM-YFP with a mutation that inhibits Claudin-7 interaction cannot rescue increased ERK, myosin activation, and increased migration in EpCAM-depleted cells. In summary, these results indicate that interaction of EpCAM and Claudin-7 at the cell surface negatively regulates epithelial migration by inhibiting ERK and actomyosin contractility."
https://openalex.org/W2896989597,"N-Glycans are involved in numerous biologic processes, such as cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. To distinguish the functions of complex high-mannose types of N-glycans, we used the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats/Cas9 system to establish N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT)-I-knockout (KO) cells. Loss of GnT-I greatly induced cell-cell adhesion and decreased cell migration. In addition, the expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers such as α-SMA, vimentin, and N-cadherin were suppressed, whereas the expression of claudin-1 was promoted, suggesting a mesenchymal-epithelial transition-like phenotype, an opposite process to the EMT, was occurred in the KO cells. The phosphorylation levels of Smad-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and integrin-mediated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were consistently suppressed. Furthermore, the restoration of GnT-I in the KO cells suppressed the cell-cell adhesion and augmented the expression of EMT markers as well as that of FAK activation. The expression levels of integrins were upregulated in the KO cells, although their functions were decreased, whereas their expression levels were downregulated in the rescued cells, which suggests a negative feedback loop between function and expression. Finally, we also found that the expression of GnT-I was important for cell survival, resistance to cancer drugs, and increased colony formation. The results of the present study demonstrate that GnT-I works as a switch to turn on/off EMT, which further supports the notion that on most surface receptors, the N-glycans differentially play essential roles in biologic functions.—Zhang, G., Isaji, T., Xu, Z., Lu, X., Fukuda, T., Gu, J.

https://openalex.org/W2897357636,"Objective In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, insufficient state financing of the health system produced weak progress toward targets of Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5. In Lubumbashi, almost all women pay out-of-pocket for obstetric and neonatal care. As no standard pricing system has been implemented, there is great variation in payments related to childbirth between health facilities and even within the same facility. This work investigates the determinants of this variation. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study including women from admission through discharge at 92 maternity wards in Lubumbashi in March 2014. The women’s payments were collected and validated by triangulating interviews of new mothers and nurses with document review. We studied payments related to delivery from the perspective of women delivering. The total was the sum of the payments linked to seeking and accessing care and transport of the woman and companion. The determinants were assessed by multilevel regression. Results Median payments for delivery varied by type: for an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, US$45 (range, US$17–260); for a complicated vaginal delivery US$60 (US$16–304); and for a Cesarean section, US$338 (US$163–782). Vaginal delivery was more expensive at health centers than in general referral hospitals or polyclinics. Cesarean sections done in corporate polyclinics and hospitals were more expensive than those done in the general referral hospitals. Referral of delivering women, use of more highly trained personnel, and a longer stay in the maternity unit contributed to higher expenses. A vaginal delivery in the private sector was more cost-effective than in the public sector. Conclusion To guarantee universal coverage of high-quality care, we suggest that the government and funders in DRC support health insurance and risk pool initiatives, and introduce and institutionalize free mother and infant care."
https://openalex.org/W2897569753,"Background Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is defined as the presence of hepatitis B virus (HVB) DNA in the liver of HBsAg negative individuals with or without detectable viral DNA in serum. OBI is a diagnostic challenge as it is characterized by a very low viral load, intermittently detectable through time. Individuals with OBI can develop chronic hepatic disease, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this work was to produce tools to improve OBI detection of the HVB genotypes prevalent in Mexico. Methods We designed and tested primers to detect OBI in serum samples by nested and real-time PCR. Conserved sites in the viral genome were determined by alignment of the most frequent HBV genotypes in Mexico (H, G/H, F and D) and primers spanning the entire viral genome were designed for first round and nested PCR. Primers were tested in serum samples of 45 patients not co-infected with hepatitis C virus or with HIV, out of a group of 116 HBsAg (-)/anti-HBc (+) individuals. Primers were also tested in a control group with chronic HBV. Nested PCR products obtained from HBsAg (-)/anti-HBc (+) were sequenced and used to design primers for real-time PCR (SYBR Green). Results The most effective primer pairs to detect HBV products by nested PCR targeted ORF regions: PreS2/P, S/P, X/PreC, and C; while by real-time PCR they targeted ORF regions PreS2/P, S/P, X, and C. Out of the 45 HBsAg (-)/anti-HBc (+) patients tested, the viral genome was detected in 28 (62.2%) and 34 (75.5%), with nPCR and real-time PCR respectively. Conclusion Primers designed for real-time PCR detected up to 75.5% of suspected OBI Mexican patients, with or without liver disease, which represents an improvement from previous PCR strategies."

Despite the widespread use of FEN worldwide, little data are available on FEN-induced hepatic lesions and molecular mechanisms. In the present study, we first performed an occupational cross-sectional study on FEN factory workers and found that the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total antioxidant capacity increased, whereas malondialdehyde decreased in laborers in the working areas where the levels of airborne FEN were much higher compared with the office area. The results were then confirmed by animal experiments that abnormal hepatic histology, increased ALT level, and compromised hepatic oxidative capability were observed in rats exposed to a high concentration of FEN. Furthermore, the bioinformatics analysis of gene microarray in rat liver tissue showed that FEN significantly changed the expressions of genes related to the regulation of intracellular calcium ion homeostasis and the calcium signal pathway. Finally, the functional experiments in Buffalo rat liver (BRL) cells demonstrated that FEN first activated ERK MAPK, followed by IKK and NF-κB, which triggered the transcription of genes responsible for accelerating an overload of intracellular calcium ions, prompted reactive oxygen species generation in the mitochondria, and finally, induced hepatic cellular apoptosis.

This study aimed to evaluate the fatty acid and protein profiles of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis PT4 578 throughout time of cultivation in the presence of AHL. The presence of N-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone (C12-HSL) altered the fatty acid and protein profiles of Salmonella cultivated during 4, 6, 7, 12 and 36 h in anaerobic condition. The profiles of Salmonella Enteritidis at logarithmic phase of growth (4 h of cultivation), in the presence of C12-HSL, were similar to those of cells at late stationary phase (36 h). In addition, there was less variation in both protein and fatty acid profiles along growth, suggesting that this quorum sensing signal anticipated a stationary phase response. The presence of C12-HSL increased the abundance of thiol related proteins such as Tpx, Q7CR42, Q8ZP25, YfgD, AhpC, NfsB, YdhD and TrxA, as well as the levels of free cellular thiol after 6 h of cultivation, suggesting that these cells have greater potential to resist oxidative stress. Additionally, the LuxS protein which synthesizes the AI-2 signaling molecule was differentially abundant in the presence of C12-HSL. The NfsB protein had its abundance increased in the presence of C12-HSL at all evaluated times, which is a suggestion that the cells may be susceptible to the action of nitrofurans or that AHLs present some toxicity. Overall, the presence of C12-HSL altered important pathways related to oxidative stress and stationary phase response in Salmonella."
https://openalex.org/W2897750582,"Tumor responses to cancer therapeutics are generally monitored every 2–3 months based on changes in tumor size. Dynamic biomarkers that reflect effective engagement of targeted therapeutics to the targeted pathway, so-called “effect sensors”, would fulfill a need for non-invasive, drug-specific indicators of early treatment effect. Using a proteomics approach to identify effect sensors, we demonstrated MUC1 upregulation in response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting treatments in breast and lung cancer models. To achieve this, using semi-quantitative mass spectrometry, we found MUC1 to be significantly and durably upregulated in response to erlotinib, an EGFR-targeting treatment. MUC1 upregulation was regulated transcriptionally, involving PI3K-signaling and STAT3. We validated these results in erlotinib-sensitive human breast and non-small lung cancer cell lines. Importantly, erlotinib treatment of mice bearing SUM149 xenografts resulted in increased MUC1 shedding into plasma. Analysis of MUC1 using serial blood sampling may therefore be a new, relatively non-invasive tool to monitor early and drug-specific effects of EGFR-targeting therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2897645502,"2-Hydroxy-oleic acid (2OHOA) is a potent anticancer drug that induces cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Previous studies have suggested that 2OHOA's anticancer effect is mediated by SMS activation in cancer cells, including A549 and U118 cells. To confirm this phenomenon, in this study, we treated both A549 and U118 cells with 2OHOA and measured SMS activity. To our surprise, we found neither 2OHOA-mediated SMS activation nor sphingomyelin accumulation in the cells. However, we noted that 2OHOA significantly reduces phosphatidylcholine in these cells. We also did not observe 2OHOA-mediated SMS activation in mouse tissue homogenates. Importantly, 2OHOA inhibited rather than activated recombinant SMS1 (rSMS1) and rSMS2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Intra-gastric treatment of C57BL/6J mice with 2OHOA for 10 days had no effects on liver and small intestine SMS activities and plasma sphingomyelin levels. The treatment inhibited lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) activity, consistent with the aforementioned reduction in plasma phosphatidylcholine. Because total cellular phosphatidylcholine is used as a predictive biomarker for monitoring tumor responses, the previously reported 2OHOA-mediated cancer suppression could be related to this phosphatidylcholine reduction, which may influence cell membrane structure and properties. We conclude that 2OHOA is not a SMS activator and that its anticancer property may be related to an effect on phosphatidylcholine metabolism. 2-Hydroxy-oleic acid (2OHOA) is a potent anticancer drug that induces cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

In this study, we re-evaluated the effect of 2OHOA on SMS activity, using the same cells reported by previous studies (6Barceló-Coblijn G. Martin M.L. de Almeida R.F.

We further explored a potential 2OHOA-mediated anti-cancer mechanism. We re-evaluated the effect of 2OHOA on SMS. To our surprise, we did not find the same effect of 2OHOA reported before (6Barceló-Coblijn G. Martin M.L. de Almeida R.F. Noguera-Salvà M.A. Marcilla-Etxenike A. Guardiola-Serrano F. Lüth A.

We first incubated 2OHOA (200 μm) with mouse liver homogenate and then measured SMS activity: generation of NBD-SM from NBD-ceramide. We not only did not observe the activation, but also observed some inhibition, although it did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, we performed the same analysis on homogenates from either HEK293 cells or HeLa cells, and we observed a significant reduction instead of induction on SMS activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1, C and D). It has been reported that the treatment of 2OHOA (200 μm) on U118 and A549, two cancer cell lines, could stimulate SMS activity in both cells, leading to cell death (6Barceló-Coblijn G. Martin M.L. de Almeida R.F. Noguera-Salvà M.A. Marcilla-Etxenike A. Guardiola-Serrano F. Lüth A. Kleuser B. Halver J.E. Escribá P.V.

We first determined the cell survival rate after 2OHOA treatment in different doses. Indeed, 200 μm 2OHOA could significantly reduce the survival rate of U118 cells (Fig. 2A) and A549 cells (Fig. 2B). We treated U118 and A549 cells with 2OHOA (200 μm) and then used the cell homogenates for SMS activity analysis. Again, we did not find significant changes of SMS activity in either cell line (Fig. 2, C and D). Further, we treated mouse primary macrophages with 200 μm 2OHOA, and we again did not find any significant changes in SMS activity (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that 2OHOA cannot stimulate SMS activity in our tested cancer cells and macrophages. To directly test the effect of 2OHOA, we transfected insect cells with SMS1-Strep tag and SMS2-Strep tag and purified both proteins, which have high SMS activity (Fig. 3A). We then incubated the purified proteins with different concentration of 2OHOA for 2 h, and we found that 2OHOA has a dose-dependent inhibition of SMS1 (Fig. 3, B and D) and SMS2 (Fig. 3, C and E) instead of activation. 2OHOA is an analog of oleic acid that can be used as a substrate for LPCAT activity. It seems to be reasonable that 2OHOA could interfere with LPCAT activity by competing with acyl-CoA. Indeed, when we utilized tissue homogenates from mouse liver, lung, brain, and testis to test LPCAT activity, using oleoyl-CoA, we found that 2OHOA inhibits LPCAT activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A–D). We then treated both mouse liver and small intestine homogenates with 200 μm 2OHOA and oleoyl-CoA, and we found a dramatic reduction of LPCAT activity (Fig. 4E). However, when we used arachidonyl-CoA as a substrate, the liver inhibition did not reach to statistical significance (Fig. 4F), indicating that 2OHOA may have minimal effect on LPCAT3, one of the four isoforms of LPCAT. Arachidonyl-CoA is the optimal substrate for LPCAT3 (22Zhao Y. Chen Y.Q. Bonacci T.M. Bredt D.S. Li S. Bensch W.R. Moller D.E. Kowala M. Konrad R.J. Cao G. Identification and characterization of a major liver lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase.J. Biol.

Based on the structure of 2OHOA, most likely, it could compete with the substrate of LPCAT (i.e. oleoyl-CoA and some other acyl-CoA). Potentially, any biochemistry reaction with oleoyl-CoA as a substrate could be influenced by 2OHOA treatment. Thus, it is not likely that 2OHOA could influence mRNA and protein levels of SMS1, SMS2, and LPCAT. It has been reported that the treatment of 2OHOA (200 μm) on U118 and A549 cells caused SM accumulation owing to SMS activation (6Barceló-Coblijn G. Martin M.L. de Almeida R.F.

To re-evaluate this, we extracted the lipids from A549 cells after 2OHOA (200 μm) treatment and measured PC and SM subspecies using LC/MS/MS. We found that almost all tested PCs were significantly reduced (Table 1). However, no tested SMs had any significant changes (Table 2), except 18:0, which is a minor SM (less than 3% of all tested SM). These results again indicated that 2OHOA is not a SMS activator.Table 1Changes in A549 cell PC species after 2OHOA treatmentPCControl2OHOAp value16:0/16:015.31 ± 1.1815.87 ± 0.98NS16:0/18:166.29 ± 4.5853.84 ± 4.07<0.0218:0/20:41.41 ± 0.020.89 ± 0.05<0.00118:1/16:047.14 ± 4.1439.07 ± 3.09<0.0518:1/18:04.93 ± 0.384.20 ± 0.22<0.05 Open table in a new tab Table 2Changes in A549 cell SM species after 2OHOA treatmentSMControl2OHOAp value16:02.62 ± 0.262.75 ± 0.43NS18:00.17 ± 0.020.21 ± 0.02<0.0518:10.04 ± 0.010.04 ± 0.00NS24:00.89 ± 0.100.95 ± 0.08NS24:12.67 ± 0.252.51 ± 0.07NS Open table in a new tab To further investigate the effect of 2OHOA on cell plasma membrane, we studied lysenin-mediated cell lysis.

However, we did not observe any changes in lysenin-mediated A549 cell mortality with or without 2OHOA treatment (Fig. 5), suggesting no SM increasing on the plasma membrane. These results again indicated that 2OHOA is not a SMS activator. We next investigated in vivo effects of 2OHOA. We treated C57BL/6 mice with 2OHOA (600 mg/kg, intragastrically) once daily for 7 days. We found that the treatment had no effect on liver and small intestine SMS activity (Fig. 6, A and B), but significantly reduced liver and small intestine LPCAT activity, when oleoyl-CoA was used (Fig. 6, C and D). Moreover, 2OHOA significantly decreased plasma PC, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels (Fig. 7, A, C, and D). We also measured plasma subspecies of PC, using LC/MS/MS, and found that almost all PCs were significantly reduced (Table 3). Importantly, plasma SM levels were reduced instead of increased (Fig. 7B), although it did not reach statistical significance. We also measured plasma subspecies of SM and found that SM16:0 was significantly reduced, whereas two other major species, SM 24:0 and SM24:1, were reduced, but did not reach to statistical significance (Table 4). We also observed that two minor SMs (SM18:0 and SM18:1) were significantly increased, but they only compose about 3% of total plasma SM levels. These results indicate that 2OHOA has a significant effect on plasma PC but not SM, suggesting, again, that 2OHOA is not a SMS activator.Figure 7The effect of 2OHOA on plasma lipid levels.

Likewise, SMS inhibition could be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. However, based on existing reports, inhibition of SMS seems to result in tumorigenesis, because 2OHOA, a potent anticancer drug, could activate SMS in cancer cells (6Barceló-Coblijn G. Martin M.L. de Almeida R.F. Noguera-Salvà M.A. Marcilla-Etxenike A. Guardiola-Serrano F. Lüth A. Kleuser B. Halver J.E. Escribá P.V.

In this study, we found that 2OHOA treatment 1) has no effect on SMS activation in tested cancer cells, normal cells, and mouse tissue homogenates and has no effect of SM accumulation in cancer cells; 2) inhibits instead of activates rSMS1 and rSMS2 activity in a dose-dependent manner; and 3) can inhibit LPCAT but not LPCAT3 activity and significantly reduces phosphatidylcholine levels. Although we cannot explain the discrepancy between our results and a previous report, in fact, we repeated the experiments that were reported (6Barceló-Coblijn G. Martin M.L. de Almeida R.F.

We treated U118 and A459 cancer cell lines with 2OHOA, and we found significant changes in neither SMS activity (Fig. 2, B and C) nor cellular SM levels (Table 2) and plasma membrane SM levels (Fig. 5), indicating that the anti-cancer property of 2OHOA should not be related with cancer cell SMS activation. However, both our study and the previous study show that 2OHOA treatment can significantly reduce cellular PC levels (Table 1) (6Barceló-Coblijn G. Martin M.L. de Almeida R.F.

We also noticed that a previous report, which analyzed changes in the lipidome of xenografts after treatment with 2OHOA, showed the induction of two SMs (34:1 and 42:2). Neither the rest of the major SMs nor SMS activity levels were indicated in the tumor xenografts (26Fernández R. Garate J. Lage S. Terés S. Higuera M. Bestard-Escalas J. Martin M.L. López D.H.

Interestingly, 2OHOA treatment significantly reduced almost all major PCs (16;0/18:1, 16:0/16:0, 16:0/16:1, 16:0/18:2, 18:0/18:2, and 16:0/20:4), although the treatment had an opposite effect on some minor PCs (less than 5% of total PCs) (26Fernández R.

We did not repeat the xenografts; however, we treated C57BL/6 mice with same dose of 2OHOA (600 mg·kg−1) for 10 days, and we found a significant reduction of plasma PCs (Fig. 7A) but not SM (Fig. 7B), which reflects a steady state of PC and SM metabolism (biosynthesis and catabolism). PCs are first synthesized from glycerol 3-phosphate in the de novo biosynthetic pathway, originally described by Kennedy and Weiss in 1956 (Kennedy pathway) (27Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. The function of cytidine coenzymes in the biosynthesis of phospholipides.J. Biol.

Wood ash is generally applied as a potassium fertilizer, but the effects of simultaneous incorporation of wood ash and crop straw on the turnover of soil organic carbon (SOC) and inorganic carbon (SIC) are not well understood. In this study, a 118-day lab incubation experiment was conducted using a calcareous soil (with 10 years of continuous maize cropping history) to study the effects of adding wheat straw, wood ash and lime. Our study showed that straw addition led to an increase in both SOC (19%) and SIC (3%). Wood ash and lime addition decreased CO2 emission by 182 and 1210 mg kg-1 and increased SIC by 125 and 1001 mg kg-1 during the incubation, respectively, which was due to supply of CaO from wood ash and lime. The increase of SOC content was 2.4% due to the addition of lime. In addition to straw addition enhanced straw-derived OC content, the addition of lime also increased straw-derived OC content by 34.5%. This study demonstrated that lime was more effective in reducing CO2 emission and and enhancing SOC than wood ash. In conclusion, adding lime to calcareous soil might be an effective method of enhancing carbon sequestration and slowing climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2896018875,"CD133 (AC133/prominin-1) has been identified as a stem cell marker and a putative cancer stem cell marker in many solid tumors. Its biologic function and molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we show that a fly mutant for prominin-like, a homolog of mammalian CD133, shows a larger body size and excess weight accompanied with higher fat deposits as compared with the wild type. The expression levels of prominin-like are mediated by ecdysone signaling where its protein levels increase dramatically in the fat body during metamorphosis. Prominin-like mutants exhibit higher Drosophila insulin-like peptide 6 (di lp6) levels during nonfeeding stages and increased Akt/ Drosophila target of rapamycin (dTOR) signaling. On an amino acid-restricted diet, prominin-like mutants exhibit a significantly larger body size than the wild type does, similar to that which occurs upon the activation of the dTOR pathway in the fat body. Our data suggest that prominin-like functions by suppressing TOR and dilp6 signaling to control body size and weight. The identification of the physiologic function of prominin-like in Drosophila may provide valuable insight into the understanding of the metabolic function of CD133 in mammals.-Zheng, H., Zhang, Y., Chen, Y., Guo, P., Wang, X., Yuan, X., Ge, W., Yang, R., Yan, Q., Yang, X., Xi, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2897422074,"Drosophila DNA replication-related element binding factor (DREF) is a transcription regulatory factor that binds the promoters of many genes involved in replication and cell proliferation and is required for normal cell cycle progression. Human DREF/zinc finger BED domain-containing protein 1 (ZBED1), an orthologue of Drosophila DREF, also has DNA binding activity, but its cellular functions remain largely uncharacterized. Herein, we show that ZBED1 is a chromatin-associated nuclear protein with a wide expression profile in human tissues from all three primary germ layers. For instance, ZBED1 was expressed in mesodermal-derived epithelial cells of the reproductive system and urinary tract, in endodermal-derived epithelial cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and in epidermal epithelium from the ectoderm. ZBED1 was also expressed in connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of multiple organs. To investigate whether ZBED1 is implicated in cell proliferation, similar to Drosophila DREF, we compared the tissue distribution of ZBED1 to that of the proliferation marker Ki-67. ZBED1 and Ki-67 were co-expressed in many epithelial tissues, but ZBED1 expression extended widely beyond that of Ki-67-positive cells. In other tissues, ZBED1 expression was more restricted than Ki-67 expression. These results suggest that ZBED1 is not a cell proliferation-associated factor such as Drosophila DREF, and our study adds to the cumulative understanding of the functions of ZBED1 in human cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2896017147,"Peptides represent a promising source of new medicines, but improved technologies are needed to facilitate discovery and optimization campaigns. In particular, longer peptides with multiple disulfide bridges are challenging to produce, and producing large numbers of structurally related variants is dissuasively costly and time-consuming. The principal cost and time drivers are the multiple column chromatography purification steps that are used during the multistep chemical synthesis procedure, which involves both ligation and oxidative refolding steps. In this study, we developed a method for multiplex parallel synthesis of complex peptide analogs in which the structurally variant region of the molecule is produced as a small peptide on a 384-well synthesizer with subsequent ligation to the longer, structurally invariant region and oxidative refolding carried out in-well without any column purification steps. To test the method, we used a panel of 96 analogs of the chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted)/CCL5 (69 residues, two disulfide bridges), which had been synthesized using standard approaches and characterized pharmacologically in an earlier study. Although, as expected, the multiplex method generated chemokine analogs of lower purity than those produced in the original study, it was nonetheless possible to closely match the pharmacological attributes (anti-HIV potency, capacity to elicit G protein signaling, and capacity to elicit intracellular receptor sequestration) of each chemokine analog to reference data from the earlier study. This rapid, low-cost approach has the potential to support discovery and optimization campaigns based on analogs of other chemokines as well as those of other complex peptide and small protein targets of a similar size.

https://openalex.org/W2896368270,"Pinniped vibrissae provide information on changes in diet at seasonal and annual scales; however, species-specific growth patterns must first be determined in order to interpret these data. In this study, a simple linear model was used to estimate the growth rate of vibrissae from adult female California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) from San Esteban Island in the Gulf of California, Mexico. The δ15N and δ13C values do not display a marked oscillatory pattern that would permit direct determination of the time period contained in each vibrissa; thus, time (age) was calculated in two ways: 1) based on the correlation between the observed number of peaks (Fourier series) in the δ15N profile and the length of each vibrissa, and 2) through direct comparison with the observed number of peaks in the δ15N profile. Cross-correlation confirmed that the two peaks in the δ15N profile reflected the two peaks in the chlorophyll-a concentration recorded annually around the island. The mean growth rate obtained from the correlation was 0.08 ± 0.01 mm d-1, while that calculated based on the observed number of peaks was 0.10 ± 0.05 mm d-1. Both are consistent with the rates reported for adult females of other otariid species (0.07 to 0.11 mm d-1). Vibrissa growth rates vary by individual, age, sex, and species; moreover, small differences in the growth rate can result in significant differences over the time periods represented by the isotopic signal. Thus, it is important to assess this parameter on a species-by-species basis."
