Such methods have formed the basis for the determination of the anti-inflammatory activity of adrenal steroids and other agents, and for the measurement of the local response to injections of histamine and histamine-releasing agents."

https://openalex.org/W2060352481,"CARCINOID tumours (argentaffin carcinomas) are considered to arise from the argentaffin (enterochromaffin, Kultschitsky) cells of the intestine. These tumours contain and secrete 5-hydroxytryptamine1, and histochemical investigations2 make it likely that enterochromaffin cells do likewise. In three cases of argentaffin carcinoma recently investigated, we have observed a strong esterase (Fig. 1) capable of hydrolysing a variety of substrates. Using O-acetyl-5-bromoindoxyl as substrate and an incubation time of 4 hr., inhibition studies gave the results shown in Table 1."
https://openalex.org/W1976922087,"IN a preliminary study of chiasmata in female mice the meiotic prophase was observed in sixty-two females from a variety of strains, mostly outbred. It was found that in all strains the oogonial nuclei in newly born females are without exception in the resting stage probably following the last mitotic division. At about 12 hr. of age the first part of meiotic prophase is appearing and at the age of 60–72 hr. it is completely over. Later the ovary contains oocyte nuclei which are in the ‘dictyotene’ stage. In this stage they remain until sexual maturity is reached and ovulation starts."

https://openalex.org/W1992070641,"THE agar electrophoresis technique developed in this laboratory1,2 has been adapted to two-stage and two-dimensional procedure for demonstrating the micro-heterogeneity of the main protein components of human serum3. Recently, Markham4 reported a method of two-dimensional paper electrophoresis for the separation of mucoproteins. The method is elaborate, and the separations achieved are not satisfactory, diffused zones being obtained as a result of trailing due to adsorption of the proteins on paper at the acid PH. The present communication gives a brief description of a simple method of two-dimensional agar electrophoresis, by which the mucoproteins can be separated into well-defined zones."
https://openalex.org/W2095052782,"THE role of iodine-131 in the possible development of thyroid tumours has been a matter of considerable concern in view of its widespread clinical use. The occurrence of thyroid tumours in rats after single-dose administration of iodine-131 has been described by Goldberg and Chaikoff1; but no reports of such tumour development in other species have been recorded. During the course of an extended investigation of the effects of iodine-131 administered daily to sheep2,3, thyroid adenomas were encountered in four of a group of five sheep which were exposed to 5 µc. iodine-131 per day for their lifetime. The development of a fibrosarcoma in the thyroid region of the remaining member of this group is reported separately4."
https://openalex.org/W2049864124,"THE only recorded micromethod for the estimation of bacterial cellulose is that of Schramm and Hestrin1, which requires the acetolysis of a previously purified sample and careful neutralization of the hydrolysate with sodium hydroxide prior to colorimetric estimation of the reducing power of this neutralized solution. This method is rather long—a disadvantage when several samples are to be assayed—and the neutralization step is critical. A micromethod has now been devised which halves the time taken for analysis, by eliminating acetolysis, hydrolysis and neutralization. This new method is an adaptation of that reported by Mendel, Kemp and Myers2 for estimating blood glucose. These workers found that their method was also applicable to such polysaccharides as starch and glycogen. Although cellulose is much more difficult to hydrolyse than either of these polysaccharides, adaptation of their method has proved successful in estimating cellulose directly without initial hydrolytic treatment."

Because the radioactive isotope of zinc (zinc-65) at present available has a half-life of 250 days, it is unsuitable for studies in man, with the possible exception of cases with advanced malignant disease3."
