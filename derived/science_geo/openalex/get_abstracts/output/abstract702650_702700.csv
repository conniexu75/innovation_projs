https://openalex.org/W4306412179,"Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a common mode of oncogene amplification but is challenging to analyze. Here, we adapt CRISPR-CATCH, in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 treatment and pulsed field gel electrophoresis of agarose-entrapped genomic DNA, previously developed for bacterial chromosome segments, to isolate megabase-sized human ecDNAs. We demonstrate strong enrichment of ecDNA molecules containing EGFR, FGFR2 and MYC from human cancer cells and NRAS ecDNA from human metastatic melanoma with acquired therapeutic resistance. Targeted enrichment of ecDNA versus chromosomal DNA enabled phasing of genetic variants, identified the presence of an EGFRvIII mutation exclusively on ecDNAs and supported an excision model of ecDNA genesis in a glioblastoma model. CRISPR-CATCH followed by nanopore sequencing enabled single-molecule ecDNA methylation profiling and revealed hypomethylation of the EGFR promoter on ecDNAs. We distinguished heterogeneous ecDNA species within the same sample by size and sequence with base-pair resolution and discovered functionally specialized ecDNAs that amplify select enhancers or oncogene-coding sequences."
https://openalex.org/W4306411715,"Attempts to reduce the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reservoir and induce antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free virologic control have largely been unsuccessful. In this phase 1b/2a, open-label, randomized controlled trial using a four-group factorial design, we investigated whether early intervention in newly diagnosed people with HIV-1 with a monoclonal anti-HIV-1 antibody with a CD4-binding site, 3BNC117, followed by a histone deacetylase inhibitor, romidepsin, shortly after ART initiation altered the course of HIV-1 infection ( NCT03041012 ). The trial was undertaken in five hospitals in Denmark and two hospitals in the United Kingdom. The coprimary endpoints were analysis of initial virus decay kinetics and changes in the frequency of CD4+ T cells containing intact HIV-1 provirus from baseline to day 365. Secondary endpoints included changes in the frequency of infected CD4+ T cells and virus-specific CD8+ T cell immunity from baseline to day 365, pre-ART plasma HIV-1 3BNC117 sensitivity, safety and tolerability, and time to loss of virologic control during a 12-week analytical ART interruption that started at day 400. In 55 newly diagnosed people (5 females and 50 males) with HIV-1 who received random allocation treatment, we found that early 3BNC117 treatment with or without romidepsin enhanced plasma HIV-1 RNA decay rates compared to ART only. Furthermore, 3BNC117 treatment accelerated clearance of infected cells compared to ART only. All groups had significant reductions in the frequency of CD4+ T cells containing intact HIV-1 provirus. At day 365, early 3BNC117 + romidepsin was associated with enhanced HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8+ T cell immunity compared to ART only. The observed virological and immunological effects of 3BNC117 were most pronounced in individuals whose pre-ART plasma HIV-1 envelope sequences were antibody sensitive. The results were not disaggregated by sex. Adverse events were mild to moderate and similar between the groups. During a 12-week analytical ART interruption among 20 participants, 3BNC117-treated individuals harboring sensitive viruses were significantly more likely to maintain ART-free virologic control than other participants. We conclude that 3BNC117 at ART initiation enhanced elimination of plasma viruses and infected cells, enhanced HIV-1-specific CD8+ immunity and was associated with sustained ART-free virologic control among persons with 3BNC117-sensitive virus. These findings strongly support interventions administered at the time of ART initiation as a strategy to limit long-term HIV-1 persistence."
https://openalex.org/W4306412217,"Abstract The human gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin is a possible key driver of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Understanding colibactin’s biological effects remains difficult owing to the instability of the proposed active species and the complexity of the gut microbiota. Here, we report small molecule boronic acid inhibitors of colibactin biosynthesis. Designed to mimic the biosynthetic precursor precolibactin, these compounds potently inhibit the colibactin-activating peptidase ClbP. Using biochemical assays and crystallography, we show that they engage the ClbP binding pocket, forming a covalent bond with the catalytic serine. These inhibitors reproduce the phenotypes observed in a clbP deletion mutant and block the genotoxic effects of colibactin on eukaryotic cells. The availability of ClbP inhibitors will allow precise, temporal control over colibactin production, enabling further study of its contributions to CRC. Finally, application of our inhibitors to related peptidase-encoding pathways highlights the power of chemical tools to probe natural product biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4306711266,"Background The currently used SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have proven to induce a strong and protective immune response. However, functional relevance of vaccine-generated antibodies and their temporal progression are still poorly understood. Thus, the central aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of systemic and mucosal humoral immune response after mRNA vaccination with BNT162b2. Methods We compared antibody production against the S1 subunit and the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in sera of BNT162b2 vaccinees, heterologous ChAdOx1-S/BNT162b2 vaccinees and COVID-19 patients. We monitored the neutralizing humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 wildtype strain and three VOCs over a period of up to eight months after second and after a subsequent third vaccination. Results In comparison to COVID-19 patients, vaccinees showed higher or similar amounts of S1- and RBD-binding antibodies but similar or lower virus neutralizing titers. Antibodies peaked two weeks after the second dose, followed by a decrease three and eight months later. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) poorly correlated with S1-IgG levels but strongly with RBD-IgGAM titers. After second vaccination we observed a reduced vaccine-induced neutralizing capacity against VOCs, especially against the Omicron variant. Compared to the nAb levels after the second vaccination, the neutralizing capacity against wildtype strain and VOCs was significantly enhanced after third vaccination. In saliva samples, relevant levels of RBD antibodies were detected in convalescent samples but not in vaccinees. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals generate relevant nAbs titers, which begin to decrease within three months after immunization and show lower neutralizing potential against VOCs as compared to the wildtype strain. Large proportion of vaccine-induced S1-IgG might be non-neutralizing whereas RBD-IgGAM appears to be a good surrogate marker to estimate nAb levels. A third vaccination increases the nAb response. Furthermore, the systemic vaccine does not seem to elicit readily detectable mucosal immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4306411918,"Colibactin, a DNA cross-linking agent produced by gut bacteria, is implicated in colorectal cancer. Its biosynthesis uses a prodrug resistance mechanism: a non-toxic precursor assembled in the cytoplasm is activated after export to the periplasm. This activation is mediated by ClbP, an inner-membrane peptidase with an N-terminal periplasmic catalytic domain and a C-terminal three-helix transmembrane domain. Although the transmembrane domain is required for colibactin activation, its role in catalysis is unclear. Our structure of full-length ClbP bound to a product analog reveals an interdomain interface important for substrate binding and enzyme stability and interactions that explain the selectivity of ClbP for the N-acyl-D-asparagine prodrug motif. Based on structural and biochemical evidence, we propose that ClbP dimerizes to form an extended substrate-binding site that can accommodate a pseudodimeric precolibactin with its two terminal prodrug motifs in the two ClbP active sites, thus enabling the coordinated activation of both electrophilic warheads."
https://openalex.org/W4306711183,"Background Schizophrenia and especially deficit schizophrenia (DSCZ) are characterized by increased activity of neuroimmunotoxic pathways and a generalized cognitive decline (G-CoDe). There is no data on whether the interleukin (IL)-6/IL-23/T helper 17 (IL-6/IL-23/Th17)-axis is more associated with DSCZ than with non-deficit schizophrenia (NDSCZ) and whether changes in this axis are associated with the G-CoDe and the phenome (a factor extracted from all symptom domains) of schizophrenia. Methods This study included 45 DSCZ and 45 NDSCZ patients and 40 controls and delineated whether the IL-6/IL-23/Th17 axis, trace elements (copper, zinc) and ions (magnesium, calcium) are associated with DSCZ, the G-CoDe and the schizophrenia phenome. Results Increased plasma IL-23 and IL-6 levels were associated with Th17 upregulation, assessed as a latent vector (LV) extracted from IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and TNF-α. The IL-6/IL-23/Th17-axis score, as assessed by an LV extracted from IL-23, IL-6, and the Th17 LV, was significantly higher in DSCZ than in NDSCZ and controls. We discovered that 70.7% of the variance in the phenome was explained by the IL-6/IL-23/Th17-axis (positively) and the G-CoDe and IL-10 (both inversely); and that 54.6% of the variance in the G-CoDe was explained by the IL-6/IL-23/Th17 scores (inversely) and magnesium, copper, calcium, and zinc (all positively). Conclusion The pathogenic IL-6/IL-23/Th17-axis contributes to the generalized neurocognitive deficit and the phenome of schizophrenia, especially that of DSCZ, due to its key role in peripheral inflammation and neuroinflammation and its consequent immunotoxic effects on neuronal circuits. These clinical impairments are more prominent in subjects with lowered IL-10, magnesium, calcium, and zinc."
https://openalex.org/W4306711120,"Our research aims to assess the performance of a new generation of consumer activity trackers (Fitbit Charge 4 TM : FBC) to measure sleep variables and sleep stage classifications in patients with chronic insomnia, compared to polysomnography (PSG) and a widely used actigraph (Actiwatch Spectrum Pro: AWS). We recruited 37 participants, all diagnosed with chronic insomnia disorder, for one night of sleep monitoring in a sleep laboratory using PSG, AWS, and FBC. Epoch-by-epoch analysis along with Bland–Altman plots was used to evaluate FBC and AWS against PSG for sleep-wake detection and sleep variables: total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), waking after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep onset latency (SOL). FBC sleep stage classification of light sleep (LS), deep sleep (DS), and rapid eye movement (REM) was also compared to that of PSG. When compared with PSG, FBC notably underestimated DS (-41.4, p &lt; 0.0001) and SE (-4.9%, p = 0.0016), while remarkably overestimating LS (37.7, p = 0.0012). However, the TST, WASO, and SOL assessed by FBC presented no significant difference from that assessed by PSG. Compared with PSG, AWS and FBC showed great accuracy (86.9% vs. 86.5%) and sensitivity (detecting sleep; 92.6% vs. 89.9%), but comparatively poor specificity (detecting wake; 35.7% vs. 62.2%). Both devices showed better accuracy in assessing sleep than wakefulness, with the same sensitivity but statistically different specificity. FBC supplied equivalent parameters estimation as AWS in detecting sleep variables except for SE. This research shows that FBC cannot replace PSG thoroughly in the quantification of sleep variables and classification of sleep stages in Chinese patients with chronic insomnia; however, the user-friendly and low-cost wearables do show some comparable functions. Whether FBC can serve as a substitute for actigraphy and PSG in patients with chronic insomnia needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4306732795,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a major obstacle in developing specific diagnostic imaging agents for many neurological disorders. In this study we aimed to generate single domain anti-mouse transferrin receptor antibodies (anti-mTfR VHHs) to mediate BBB transcytosis as components of novel MRI molecular contrast imaging agents. Anti-mTfR VHHs were produced by immunizing a llama with mTfR, generation of a VHH phage display library, immunopanning, and in vitro characterization of candidates. Site directed mutagenesis was used to generate additional variants. VHH fusions with neurotensin (NT) allowed rapid, hypothermia-based screening for VHH-mediated BBB transcytosis in wild-type mice. One anti-mTfR VHH variant was fused with an anti-amyloid-beta (Aβ) VHH dimer and labeled with fluorescent dye for direct assessment of in vivo target engagement in a mouse model of AD-related Aβ plaque pathology. An anti-mTfR VHH called M1 and variants had binding affinities to mTfR of <1nM to 1.52nM. The affinity of the VHH binding to mTfR correlated with the efficiency of the VHH-NT induced hypothermia effects after intravenous injection of 600 nmol/kg body weight, ranging from undetectable for nonbinding mutants to -6°C for the best mutants. The anti-mTfR VHH variant M1P96H with the strongest hypothermia effect was fused to the anti-Aβ VHH dimer and labeled with Alexa647; the dye-labeled VHH fusion construct still bound both mTfR and Aβ plaques at concentrations as low as 0.22 nM. However, after intravenous injection at 600 nmol/kg body weight into APP/PS1 transgenic mice, there was no detectible labeling of plaques above control levels. Thus, NT-induced hypothermia did not correlate with direct target engagement in cortex, likely because the concentration required for NT-induced hypothermia was lower than the concentration required to produce in situ labeling. These findings reveal an important dissociation between NT-induced hypothermia, presumably mediated by hypothalamus, and direct engagement with Aβ-plaques in cortex. Additional methods to assess anti-mTfR VHH BBB transcytosis will need to be developed for anti-mTfR VHH screening and the development of novel MRI molecular contrast agents."
https://openalex.org/W4306732251,"This work describes a chronological (2000–2019) analysis of sentiment and emotion in 23 million headlines from 47 news media outlets popular in the United States. We use Transformer language models fine-tuned for detection of sentiment (positive, negative) and Ekman’s six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise) plus neutral to automatically label the headlines. Results show an increase of sentiment negativity in headlines across written news media since the year 2000. Headlines from right-leaning news media have been, on average, consistently more negative than headlines from left-leaning outlets over the entire studied time period. The chronological analysis of headlines emotionality shows a growing proportion of headlines denoting anger , fear , disgust and sadness and a decrease in the prevalence of emotionally neutral headlines across the studied outlets over the 2000–2019 interval. The prevalence of headlines denoting anger appears to be higher, on average, in right-leaning news outlets than in left-leaning news media."
https://openalex.org/W4306732428,"Many university-taught courses moved to online form since the outbreak of the global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Distance learning has become broadly used as a result of the widely applied lockdowns, however, many students lack personal contact in the learning process. A classical web-based distance learning does not provide means for natural interpersonal interaction. The technology of immersive virtual reality (iVR) may mitigate this problem. Current research has been aimed mainly at specific instances of collaborative immersive virtual environment (CIVE) applications for learning. The fields utilizing iVR for knowledge construction and skills training with the use of spatial visualizations show promising results. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of collaborative and individual use of iVR for learning geography, specifically training in hypsography. Furthermore, the study’s goals were to determine whether collaborative learning would be more effective and to investigate the key elements in which collaborative and individual learning were expected to differ–motivation and use of cognitive resources. The CIVE application developed at Masaryk University was utilized to train 80 participants in inferring conclusions from cartographic visualizations. The collaborative and individual experimental group underwent a research procedure consisting of a pretest, training in iVR, posttest, and questionnaires. A statistical comparison between the geography pretest and posttest for the individual learning showed a significant increase in the score ( p = 0.024, ES = 0.128) and speed ( p = 0.027, ES = 0.123), while for the collaborative learning, there was a significant increase in the score ( p &lt;0.001, ES = 0.333) but not in speed ( p = 1.000, ES = 0.000). Thus, iVR as a medium proved to be an effective tool for learning geography. However, comparing the collaborative and individual learning showed no significant difference in the learning gain ( p = 0.303, ES = 0.115), speed gain ( p = 0.098, ES = 0.185), or performance motivation ( p = 0.368, ES = 0.101). Nevertheless, the collaborative learning group had significantly higher use of cognitive resources ( p = 0.046, ES = 0.223) than the individual learning group. The results were discussed in relation to the cognitive load theories, and future research directions for iVR learning were proposed."
https://openalex.org/W4306730123,"Nanofibrous morphology and the doping technique can overcome the problem of electron/hole fast recombination and improve the activity of titanium oxide-based photocatalysts. In this study, nanoparticulate and nanofibrous forms of CdTiO 3 -incorporated TiO 2 were synthesized with different cadmium contents; the morphology and composition were determined by SEM, TEM, EDX, and XRD techniques. The nanomorphology, cadmium content, and reaction temperature of Cd-doped TiO 2 nanostructures were found to be strongly affect the hydrogen production rate. Nanofibrous morphology improves the rate of hydrogen evolution by around 10 folds over the rate for nanoparticles due to electron confinement in 0D nanostructures. The average rates of hydrogen production for samples of 0.5 wt.% Cd are 0.7 and 16.5 ml/g cat. min for nanoparticles and nanofibers, respectively. On the other hand, cadmium doping resulted in increasing the hydrogen production rate from 9.6 to 19.7 ml/g cat .min for pristine and Cd-doped (2 wt%) TiO 2 nanofibers, respectively. May be the formation of type I heterostructures between the TiO 2 matrix and CdTiO 3 nanoparticles is the main reason for the observed enhancement of photocatalytic activity due to the strong suppressing of electron/holes recombination process. Consequently, the proposed photocatalyst could be exploited to produce hydrogen from scavenger-free solution. Varying reaction temperature suggests that hydrogen evolution over the proposed catalyst is incompatible with the Arrhenius equation. In particular, reaction temperature was found to have a negative influence on photocatalytic activity. This work shows the prospects for using CdTiO 3 as a co-catalyst in photon-induced water splitting and indicates a substantial enhancement in the rate of hydrogen production upon using the proposed photocatalyst in nanofibrous morphology."
https://openalex.org/W4306730934,"Background Electronic medical recording system is one of the information technologies that has a proven benefit to improve the quality of health service. Readiness assessment is one of the recommended steps to be taken prior to implementing electronic medical recording system to reduce the probability of failure. Objective T o determine the level of health professional readiness to implement Electronic medical recording system and associated factors in public general hospitals of Sidama region, 2022. Methodology A cross-sectional study design complemented with qualitative study was employed at three public general hospitals in Sidama region on a sample of 306 participants. A pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data and in-depth interview was used for the qualitative study. Bivariate and multivariate Binary logistics regression was performed to determine predictors of readiness at α = 0.05, using an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Thematic analysis was done for qualitative data collected through in-depth interview. Result The overall readiness for health professionals was 36.5%. Of the study participants, 201 (73.4%) were computer literate, 176(64.23%) had good knowledge, and 204 (74.45%) had favorable attitude towards EMR. Only 31 participants had previous training (11.3%), while 64 (23%) had previous experience. EMR knowledge (AOR = 3.332; 95%CI: (1.662, 6.682)) and attitude towards electronic medical recording (AOR = 2.432; 95%CI: (1.146, 5.159)) were statistically significant predictors of readiness to implement electronic medical recording. Qualitative analysis has revealed lack of training, ease of use concerns, information security concerns, and perceived inadequacy of infrastructures including internet connectivity and electricity as common barriers for health professional readiness to implement EMR. Conclusion Health professionals’ readiness in this study was low. Capacity building efforts to increase the awareness and skills of health professionals should be done before implementing the system."
https://openalex.org/W4306711112,"Pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients commonly have Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNAemia and are at risk of developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). EBV DNAemia has not been analyzed on a continuous scale in this population.All children ≤ 18 years of age who underwent SOT at a single center between January 1, 2007 and July 31, 2018 were included in this retrospective study. Transplant episodes in which PTLD occurred were compared to transplant episodes without PTLD. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the development of EBV DNAemia and maximum height of EBV DNAemia. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios for time to PTLD.Of 275 total transplant recipients and 294 transplant episodes, there were 14 episodes of PTLD. Intestinal and multivisceral transplant were strongly associated with PTLD (p = 0.002). Risk factors for the development of EBV DNAemia include donor and recipient positive EBV serologies (p = 0.001) and older age (p = 0.001). Maximum level of EBV DNAemia was significantly associated with development of PTLD (p<0.0001). Every one log (log10) increase in the maximum level of EBV DNAemia was associated with a more than doubling of the hazard on developing PTLD (HR: 2.18, 95% CI 1.19-3.99).Transplant type was strongly associated with development of PTLD in pediatric SOT recipients. EBV serologies and age were associated with the development of EBV DNAemia and height of DNAemia. High levels of EBV DNAemia were strongly associated with an increased hazard for PTLD."
https://openalex.org/W4306728547,"Objectives Spondylolysis occurs bilaterally or unilaterally and bilateral spondylolysis increases the risk of developing isthmic spondylolisthesis. The characteristics of the lumbar lordosis angle (LLA), sacral slope angle (SSA), and spondylolysis fracture angle (SFA) in bilateral spondylolysis compared with those in unilateral spondylolysis have not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to compare the LLA, SSA, and SFA of bilateral and unilateral spondylolysis. Materials and methods Thirty-eight patients with lumbar spondylolysis who visited our clinic for an initial visit and 15 age-matched patients with a chief complaint of low back pain were included as controls. Computed tomography films were used to classify all spondylolysis patients into two groups: those with bilateral fractures (bilateral) and those with unilateral fractures (unilateral). The LLA and SSA were measured using lateral X-ray films and the SFA was measured using computed tomography films. Results The LLA was significantly higher in all spondylolysis patients than in the control group (p = .026). There was no significant difference in SSA between the spondylolysis and control groups (p = .28). The LLA was significantly higher in the bilateral group than in the unilateral group (p = .018). There was no significant difference in SSA between the bilateral and unilateral groups (p = .15). The SFA was significantly lower in the bilateral group than in the unilateral group (p = .024). Conclusions This study suggests that physical therapy for spondylolysis may be considered bilaterally and unilaterally."
https://openalex.org/W4306728555,"This study shifts the focus away from demonstrating the existence of the effect toward understanding the mechanism by which the effect of AR operates in museum learning. By uncovering and describing the contingencies of AR from the perspectives of learner control, this study investigates how and when AR affects museum learning experiences, and to give insights into curation with AR. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 48 college students divided into three groups. This study considered both qualitative and quantitative features of learner control and designed the AR control tools and experiment accordingly, and the findings supported the success of integrating the immersive technology of AR and the theoretical framework of learner control to construct museum exhibits. The results showed that visitors are willing to use the provided tools in museum AR and perform steadily in knowledge acquisition. In addition to offering more learner control in museums, AR promotes positive behaviors and attitudes. This study contributes to the field studies of learner control by linking learner control with the critical dimensions of AR-enhanced museum learning to provide more guidance in exhibit design. Based on the findings, practical suggestions on incorporating learner control in AR-based interactive exhibits are provided."
https://openalex.org/W4306730589,"Background Vaccination of masses against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical to overcome the pandemic and restore normalcy. However, vaccine refusal and hesitancy prevail in many countries. COVID-19 has rapidly spread in Saudi Arabia since 2020. The acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccines has been investigated in adults aged &gt;18 years in Saudi Arabia. This study aimed to understand the acceptance and hesitancy of parents to vaccinate children aged &lt;12 years against COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia and identify strategies that can encourage their engagement. Methods We used an online cross-sectional survey distributed to parents who lived in all regions of Saudi Arabia to investigate parents’ views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine for their children aged &lt;12 years. Five hundred parents living in Saudi Arabia completed the survey. Results The survey indicated that mothers were more enthusiastic about participating in the study than fathers. The participant aged 37.31 ± 8.52 years. A total of 38.6% of participants refused to vaccinate their children. Additionally, 56% were unsure if the vaccine would cause serious side effects in children. A total of 48.8% of parents believed that the Pfizer vaccine was suitable for children, while 64.5% failed to decide whether to administer vaccines to their children. Conclusion Vaccine hesitancy remains a major problem worldwide. A lack of scientific evidence on vaccine efficacy, low education level, and reduced level of health education and promotion are the most common factors in parents in Saudi Arabia. However, some participants agreed to receive vaccines only to protect their family members, and due to governmental rules and school mandates. Therefore, vaccine efficacy and safety in children must be clearly communicated to the public. This information would aid in reducing the hesitancy of parents to vaccinate their children against COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4306731744,"Duffy binding protein region II (DBPII) is considered a strong potential vaccine candidate of blood-stage P. vivax. However, the highly polymorphic nature of this protein often misdirects immune responses, leading them to be strain-specific. Details of cross-reactive humoral immunity to DBPII variants have therefore become an important focus for the development of broadly protective vaccines. Here, cross-reactive humoral immunity against a panel of Thai DBPII variants (DBL-THs) was demonstrated in immunized BALB/c mice and P. vivax patients, by in vitro erythrocyte-binding inhibition assay. Sera from immunized animals showed both strain-transcending (anti-DBL-TH2 and -TH4) and strain-specific (anti-DBL-TH5, -TH6 and -TH9) binding to DBL-TH variants. Using anti-DBL-TH sera at 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the homologous strain, anti-DBL-TH2 sera showed cross inhibition to heterologous DBL-TH strains, whereas anti-DBL-TH5 sera exhibited only strain-specific inhibition. In P. vivax patients, 6 of 15 subjects produced and maintained cross-reactive anti-DBL-TH inhibitory antibodies through the 1-year post-infection timepoint. Cross-reactive memory B cell (MBC) responses to DBL-TH variants were analyzed in subjects recovered from P. vivax infection (RC). The plasma samples from 5 RC subjects showed broad inhibition. However, MBC-derived antibodies of these patients did not reveal cross-inhibition. Altogether, broadly anti-DBP variant inhibitory antibodies developed and persisted in P. vivax infections. However, the presence of cross-reactive anti-DBL-TH inhibitory function post-infection was not related with MBC responses to these variants. More detailed investigation of long-lasting, broadly protective antibodies to DBPII will guide the design of vivax malaria vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4306732149,"In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the desire of the Ministry of Health to integrate Traditional African Medicine into the Official Health System remains limited by the lack of reliable data on several aspects of this medicine. This study aims to determine the perceptions of the Lubumbashi population towards Traditional African Medicine and the contexts of recourse to these therapeutic modalities. We conducted semi-structured interviews of population samples in each of the 7 Lubumbashi municipalities, which were semi-randomly selected in proportions to each population size, from January to June 2017 and from February to July 2018. A total of 4278 people (average age, 32.1 ± 10.4 years; 36.5% of women) have been surveyed. Among them, 75.8% define ""Traditional African Medicine"" as ""herbal-based treatments""; 79.4% have resorted to traditional medicine, for several pathologies and social problems. This medicine was preferred for efficiency, speed of healing and low cost, as well as the presence of the diseases against which it would be the only one used. Most, (52.1%) have started with Conventional Medicine, then resorted to Traditional African Medicine, 34.7% started directly with Traditional African Medicine, while 13.2% combined these two medicines. From those who have resorted to Traditional African Medicine (n = 3396), 55% declare no concern towards traditional medicine, while 42.5% fear looseness, overdose, intoxication, and lack of hygiene; from those who have not resorted to Traditional African Medicine (n = 882), 78% are fearful of fear looseness, witchcraft, and fetishism. Traditional African Medicine remains an important health care resource for the Lubumbashi people. It is essential that decision-makers consider the importance of this health sector for the population, but also the reported fears and hindrances, and work towards the regulation, sanitization, and control of this medicine to ensure its safe use."
https://openalex.org/W3180486284,"Sit-to-stand transitions are an important part of activities of daily living and play a key role in functional mobility in humans. The sit-to-stand movement is often affected in older adults due to frailty and in patients with motor impairments such as Parkinson's disease leading to falls. Studying kinematics of sit-to-stand transitions can provide insight in assessment, monitoring and developing rehabilitation strategies for the affected populations. We propose a three-segment body model for estimating sit-to-stand kinematics using only two wearable inertial sensors, placed on the shank and back. Reducing the number of sensors to two instead of one per body segment facilitates monitoring and classifying movements over extended periods, making it more comfortable to wear while reducing the power requirements of sensors. We applied this model on 10 younger healthy adults (YH), 12 older healthy adults (OH) and 12 people with Parkinson's disease (PwP). We have achieved this by incorporating unique sit-to-stand classification technique using unsupervised learning in the model based reconstruction of angular kinematics using extended Kalman filter. Our proposed model showed that it was possible to successfully estimate thigh kinematics despite not measuring the thigh motion with inertial sensor. We classified sit-to-stand transitions, sitting and standing states with the accuracies of 98.67%, 94.20% and 91.41% for YH, OH and PwP respectively. We have proposed a novel integrated approach of modelling and classification for estimating the body kinematics during sit-to-stand motion and successfully applied it on YH, OH and PwP groups."
https://openalex.org/W4306711059,"Ruminant livestock are a major contributor to Australian agricultural sector carbon emissions. Variation in methane (CH4) produced from enteric microbial fermentation of feed in the reticulo-rumen of sheep differs with different digestive functions.We isolated rumen epithelium enzymatically to extract membrane and cytosol proteins from sheep with high (H) and low (L) CH4 emission. Protein abundance was quantified using SWATH-mass spectrometry.The research found differences related to the metabolism of glucose, lactate and processes of cell defence against microbes in sheep from each phenotype. Enzymes in the methylglyoxal pathway, a side path of glycolysis, resulting in D-lactate production, differed in abundance. In the H CH4 rumen epithelium the enzyme hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (HAGH) was 2.56 fold higher in abundance, whereas in the L CH4 epithelium lactate dehydrogenase D (LDHD) was 1.93 fold higher. Malic enzyme 1 which converts D-lactate to pyruvate via the tricarboxylic cycle was 1.57 fold higher in the L CH4 phenotype. Other proteins that are known to regulate cell defence against microbes had differential abundance in the epithelium of each phenotype.Differences in the abundance of enzymes involved in the metabolism of glucose were associated with H and L CH4 phenotype sheep. Potentially this represents an opportunity to use protein markers in the rumen epithelium to select low CH4 emitting sheep."
https://openalex.org/W4306711186,"Objective While self-injection of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) has well-documented benefits, uptake may be improved by addressing client concerns such as fear of self-injury and low self-efficacy. However, current training materials for family planning providers do not address these concerns. We used an iterative process with family planning providers and clients, male community leaders and partners, and stakeholders in Malawi to develop a counseling message addressing user-centered concerns about self-injection. We report on our testing of the effectiveness of this evidence-based message for increasing self-injection uptake in the context of full method choice. Methods We randomized 60 public facilities across two districts in southern Malawi to orient their providers to the message (treatment) or not (control). After strengthening data quality, we extracted routine service delivery data from the facilities six months before and after introducing the message. We compared pre- and post-orientation trends for the treatment and control groups using generalized linear mixed models. We conducted eight focus group discussions with a sample of providers oriented to the message. Results The message was feasible to implement and highly acceptable to providers. During June 2020–June 2021, 16,593 new clients used injectables in Mangochi district (52% DMPA-SC; 15% self-injected). In Thyolo district, 7,761 new clients used injectables during July 2020–July 2021 (29% DMPA-SC; 14% self-injected). We observed high variability in number of clients and self-injection uptake across facilities and over time, indicating inconsistent offering of self-injection. In both districts, we found significant increases in self-injection in treatment facilities after message introduction. However, this increase was not sustained, especially when DMPA-SC was unavailable or about to expire. Conclusion Based on the study findings, we recommend the evidence-based message be used in programs offering DMPA-SC self-injection services. However, effective use of the message is contingent upon a consistent supply of DMPA-SC."
https://openalex.org/W4306711225,"In order to assess the rationality of the rated shield support capacity (RSSC) experienced selection and guide the reasonable RSSC selection for the subsequent working faces of each coal seam, the coupling relationship between shield and roof strata was revealed during each coal seams mining. According to whether the fractured rock blocks generated by the main roof are articulated and whether the upper coal seam has been mined and influenced on the lower coal seam, two roof structure mechanical models of the rock blocks generated by the thick main roof and two calculation methods of a given load on the rock blocks are proposed. In addition, a selection method of roof structure model for maximum shield support capacity (MSSC) of close-multiple coal seams with the coordinated mining is put forward. Three roof structures to calculate the MSSC are established. Based on a case study of close-multiple coal seams with the coordinated mining in the Qianjiaying coal mine, the MSSC is calculated and analyzed in each coal seam combined with roof structure characteristics description, theoretical analysis, and field measurement. No.7, No.12-1, and No.5 coal seams mining are applicable to a voussoir beam balanced structure. No.8 coal seam mining is applicable to a balanced structure with a given load of loose body. No.9 coal seam mining is applicable to a voussoir beam balanced structure with a given load of loose body. Through the calculation, the MSSC of No.7, No.8, No.12-1, No.9, and No.5 coal seam is 3948.55kN, 4018.32kN, 4101.63kN, 3560.03kN, and 4015.30kN, respectively. And the RSSC suggested selection of each coal seam is 4500kN, 4300kN, 4300kN, 4000kN, and 4300kN, respectively. By field measurement, the RSSC experienced selection of each coal seam in the Qianjiaying coal mine is unreasonable with low support load utilization. However, after adopting the RSSC suggested selection in each coal seam, the support load utilization increased by 29.07%, 9.6%, 8.57%, 15.33%, and 11.39%."
https://openalex.org/W4306728934,"Objective With increases in chronic disease, men with prostate cancer are likely to have at least one other chronic health condition. The burden and complexity of each additional chronic disease may complicate prostate cancer treatment and reduce survival. In this paper, we describe the frequency of multimorbid chronic diseases, HIV and depression among men in Soweto, South Africa (SA) with and without prostate cancer and determine whether the presence of multimorbid diseases is associated with metastatic and high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer. Methods A population-based case-control study on prostate cancer was conducted among black men in Soweto. All participants completed a baseline survey on sociodemographics, lifestyle, and comorbid medical conditions. All participants completed a depression screening survey and HIV testing at enrolment. Blood pressure measurements and blood testing for fasting glucose, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein were performed on a subset of randomly selected cases and controls. For men with prostate cancer, clinical T staging was assessed with the digital rectal examination, the diagnosis was confirmed with a biopsy and PSA levels were assessed at presentation. The metastatic staging was assessed by bone scans, and this was confirmed with PSMA PET scans, CT scans and X-rays, standard for our resource-constrained setting. Normal PSA scores were used as an inclusion criterion for controls. Results Of the 2136 men (1095 with prostate cancer and 1041 controls) included in the analysis, 43.0% reported at least one chronic metabolic disease; 24.1% reported two metabolic diseases; 5.3% reported three metabolic diseases; and 0.3% reported four metabolic diseases. Men with prostate cancer were more likely to report a multimorbid chronic metabolic disease compared to controls (p&lt;0.001) and more likely to test positive for HIV (p = 0.05). The majority of men (66.2%) reported at least one metabolic disease, tested negative for HIV and had a negative depression screen. The clinical characteristics of men with prostate cancer, were as follows: 396 (36.2%) had a Gleason score of 8 and above; 552 (51.3%) had a PSA score of &gt;20ng/ml; 233 (21.7%) had confirmed metastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis. Older age was associated with metastatic prostate cancer (OR = 1.043 95% CI:1.02–1.07) and NCCN defined high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer (OR = 1.03 95% CI:1.01–1.05), whilst being hypertensive was protective (OR = 0.63 95% CI:0.47–0.84 and OR = 0.55 95% CI:0.37–0.83) respectively for metastatic and high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer. Conclusion The high prevalence of multimorbid metabolic diseases and HIV among men with prostate cancer represents a public health concern in South Africa. There is a need to effectively address multiple chronic diseases among men with prostate cancer by incorporating coordinated care models."
https://openalex.org/W4306729512,"Assessing the impact of cesarean delivery (CD) on long-term childhood outcomes is challenging as conducting a randomized controlled trial is rarely feasible and inferring it from observational data may be confounded. Utilizing data from electronic health records of 737,904 births, we defined and emulated a target trial to estimate the effect of CD on predefined long-term pediatric outcomes. Causal effects were estimated using pooled logistic regression and standardized survival curves, leveraging data breadth to account for potential confounders. Diverse sensitivity analyses were performed including replication of results in an external validation set from the UK including 625,044 births. Children born in CD had an increased risk to develop asthma (10-year risk differences (95% CI) 0.64% (0.31, 0.98)), an average treatment effect of 0.10 (0.07-0.12) on body mass index (BMI) z-scores at age 5 years old and 0.92 (0.68-1.14) on the number of respiratory infection events until 5 years of age. A positive 10-year risk difference was also observed for atopy (10-year risk differences (95% CI) 0.74% (-0.06, 1.52)) and allergy 0.47% (-0.32, 1.28)). Increased risk for these outcomes was also observed in the UK cohort. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence on the long-term effects of CD on pediatric morbidity, may assist in the decision to perform CD when not medically indicated and paves the way to future research on the mechanisms underlying these effects and intervention strategies targeting them."
https://openalex.org/W4306729572,"Care workers' views of clients' death have not been explored in Japan because of a cultural tendency to avoid talking openly about death. However, given the arising problems in end-of-life care settings, such as abuse and burnout, understanding care workers' views regarding death is essential for designing effective interventions. We had two main research questions: Do care workers in Japan have their own ideas about death after working in the landscape of dying and death? Do these ideas influence care workers' professional lives?We recruited interviewees based on a quantitative survey of care workers at 10 geriatric institutions in Tokyo. Among the 323 respondents, 23 survey respondents were willing to participate in an interview. After the scheduling process, nine individuals were able to participate in an in-depth interview. To overwhelm cultural avoidance regarding death that prevents care workers from talking openly about death, Buddhist priests conducted interviews in the current study. Physicians and researchers assisted the interviews. Because this was exploratory studies in which little is known about the topic in question, we adapted a qualitative descriptive approach.Thematic analysis revealed that: 1) care workers had clear views about conditions of clients' good death after working in the field of dying and death; 2) care workers were motivated by past experiences of being close to dying themselves; and 3) care workers regarded their care for the dying as an experience that enriched their lives. In addition, the results revealed that the concept of spiritual care in Japan is still its infancy among care workers because of its vague definition.Care workers were willing to work for dying people with their view of death, and regarded their jobs as important opportunities for personal growth through caring for the dying."
https://openalex.org/W4306729893,"For accurate respiration gated radiation therapy, compensation for the beam latency of the beam control system is necessary. Therefore, we evaluate deep learning models for predicting patient respiration signals and investigate their clinical feasibility. Herein, long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and the Transformer are evaluated. Among the 540 respiration signals, 60 signals are used as test data. Each of the remaining 480 signals was spilt into training and validation data in a 7:3 ratio. A total of 1000 ms of the signal sequence (T s ) is entered to the models, and the signal at 500 ms afterward (P t ) is predicted (standard training condition). The accuracy measures are: (1) root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), (2) accuracy dependency on T s and P t , (3) respiratory pattern dependency, and (4) error for 30% and 70% of the respiration gating for a 5 mm tumor motion for latencies of 300, 500, and 700 ms. Under standard conditions, the Transformer model exhibits the highest accuracy with an RMSE and CC of 0.1554 and 0.9768, respectively. An increase in T s improves accuracy, whereas an increase in P t decreases accuracy. An evaluation of the regularity of the respiratory signals reveals that the lowest predictive accuracy is achieved with irregular amplitude patterns. For 30% and 70% of the phases, the average error of the three models is &lt;1.4 mm for a latency of 500 ms and &gt;2.0 mm for a latency of 700 ms. The prediction accuracy of the Transformer is superior to LSTM and Bi-LSTM. Thus, the three models have clinically applicable accuracies for a latency &lt;500 ms for 10 mm of regular tumor motion. The clinical acceptability of the deep learning models depends on the inherent latency and the strategy for reducing the irregularity of respiration."
https://openalex.org/W4306730532,"The emergence of potentially pandemic viruses has resulted in preparedness efforts to develop candidate vaccines and adjuvant formulations. We evaluated the dose-sparing effect and safety of two distinct squalene-based oil-in-water adjuvant emulsion formulations (IB160 and SE) with influenza A/H7N9 antigen. This phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial (NCT03330899), enrolled 432 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 59. Participants were randomly allocated to 8 groups: 1A) IB160 + 15μg H7N9, 1B) IB160 + 7.5μg H7N9, 1C) IB160 + 3.75μg H7N9, 2A) SE + 15μg H7N9, 2B) SE + 7.5μg H7N9, 2C) SE + 3.75μg H7N9, 3) unadjuvanted vaccine 15μg H7N9 and 4) placebo. Immunogenicity was evaluated through haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) tests. Safety was evaluated by monitoring local and systemic, solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AE) and reactions (AR) 7 and 28 days after each study injection, respectively, whereas serious adverse events (SAE) were monitored up to 194 days post-second dose. A greater increase in antibody geometric mean titers (GMT) was observed in groups receiving adjuvanted vaccines. Vaccinees receiving IB160-adjuvanted formulations showed the greatest response in group 1B, which induced an HI GMT increase of 4.7 times, HI titers ≥40 in 45.2% of participants (MN titers ≥40 in 80.8%). Vaccinees receiving SE-adjuvanted vaccines showed the greatest response in group 2A, with an HI GMT increase of 2.5 times, HI titers ≥40 in 22.9% of participants (MN titers ≥40 in 65.7%). Frequencies of AE and AR were similar among groups. Pain at the administration site and headache were the most frequent local and systemic solicited ARs. The vaccine candidates were safe and the adjuvanted formulations have a potential dose-sparing effect on immunogenicity against influenza A/H7N9. The magnitude of this effect could be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W4306730931,"There are limited studies investigating the use of fecal microbial transplant (FMT) in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the feasibility of adding FMT to standard therapy (corticosteroids and a hypoallergenic diet) for dogs with IBD and to and to describe the changes in measured outcomes after 30 days of treatment.Thirteen client-owned dogs with IBD were enrolled in this double blinded, randomized clinical trial. All dogs received corticosteroid therapy and a hypoallergenic diet; dogs were randomized to receive either placebo or FMT. Measured outcomes included the canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index (CCECAI) at 1 week and 1 month after enrolment. Fecal microbiota were analyzed after extracting DNA from fecal samples and profiling using 16S amplicon sequencing. Dogs in the placebo group not responding to treatment after 1 month were offered FMT.The CCECAI significantly decreased over time in both groups (p = 0.001). There were no significant differences between the CCECAI of the placebo and FMT group at each time point (F test from ANOVA, p = 0.40). No adverse effects were reported in the 30 days following FMT.The addition of FMT to standard therapy for IBD was feasible. No significant differences were observed in the CCECAI between groups at each time point. Large scale clinical trials can be performed using these methods to evaluate the longer term effect of FMT on clinical signs, microbial diversity, and other outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4306731128,"Critically ill patients have a higher incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) than non-critically ill patients, yet no diagnostic algorithm has been validated in this population, leading to the overuse of pulmonary artery computed tomographic angiogram (CTA). This study aimed to comparatively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) combined with laboratory data versus CTA in predicting PE in critically ill patients.A prospective diagnostic accuracy study. Critically ill patients with suspected acute PE undergoing CTA were prospectively enrolled. Demographic and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Blood samples were collected, and the Wells and revised Geneva scores were calculated. Standardized multiorgan POCUS and CTA were performed. The discriminatory power of multiorgan POCUS combined with biochemical markers was tested using ROC curves, and multivariate analysis was performed.A total of 88 patients were included, and 37 (42%) had PE. Multivariate analysis showed a relative risk (RR) of PE of 2.79 (95% CI, 1.61-4.84) for the presence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, of 2.54 (95% CI, 0.89-7.20) for D-dimer levels >1000 ng/mL, and of 1.69 (95% CI, 1.12-2.63) for the absence of an alternative diagnosis to PE on lung POCUS or chest radiograph. The combination with the highest diagnostic accuracy for PE included the following variables: 1- POCUS transthoracic echocardiography with evidence of RV dysfunction; 2- lung POCUS or chest radiograph without an alternative diagnosis to PE; and 3- plasma D-dimer levels >1000 ng/mL. Combining these three findings resulted in an area under the curve of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.77-0.94), with 50% sensitivity and 96% specificity.Multiorgan POCUS combined with laboratory data has acceptable diagnostic accuracy for PE compared with CTA. The combined use of these methods might reduce CTA overuse in critically ill patients."
https://openalex.org/W4306731594,"A multi-objective modeling approach is required in the context of generator maintenance scheduling (GMS) for power generation systems. Most multi-objective modeling approaches in practice are modeled using a periodic system approach that caters for a fixed maintenance window. This approach is not suitable for different types of generating units and cannot extend the generator lifespan. To address this issue, this study proposes a tri-objective GMS model with three conflicting objectives based on the sequential system approach that accounts for operating hours and start-up times. The GMS model's objectives are to minimize the total operation cost, maximize system reliability and minimize violation. The main difference between the proposed tri-objective GMS model and other multi-objective GMS models, is that the proposed model uses a sequential strategy based on operating hours and start-up times. In addition, the proposed model has considered the most important criteria in scheduling the generator maintenance, and this reflects the real-life requirements in electrical power systems. A multi-objective graph model is also developed to generate the maintenance units scheduling and used in developing the proposed Pareto ant colony system (PACS) algorithm. A PACS algorithm is proposed to implement the model and obtain solution for GMS. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using the IEEE RTS 26, 32, and 36-unit systems dataset. The performance metrics used comprise the GMS model objectives. The experimental results showed that the obtained solution from the proposed tri-objective GMS model was a robust solution by considering the different initial operational hours of the units."
https://openalex.org/W4306731997,"Knowledge of platelet function in pigs and the effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy is important to ensure proper transferability from animal studies to humans. Our aim was to (1) characterize baseline platelet function of Aachen minipigs using the bedside Multiplate analyzer, (2) compare baseline platelet function with Göttingen minipigs, and (3) characterize platelet inhibition within the first 5 minutes after intravenous administration of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). We characterized the baseline platelet function and hematological parameters in 9 Aachen minipigs. Historical data of 8 unmedicated Göttingen minipigs were used for comparison of baseline values. Platelet inhibition in Aachen minipigs was tested 1-5 minutes after intravenous administration of 500 mg ASA. Multiplate examinations included the following tests: ASPI test (to assess the effect of ASA), adenosine-diphosphate-test (ADP test) and thrombin receptor activating peptide test (TRAP test). Median values and interquartile range (IQR) of the Multiplate baseline tests in Aachen minipigs were as follows: ASPI: 39 U (IQR = 21-71), ADP: 70 U (IQR = 48-73), and TRAP: 8 U (IQR = 6-9), whereas the values in Göttingen minipigs were as follows: ASPI: 70.5 U (IQR = 60-78), ADP: 51 U (IQR = 45-66), and TRAP: 6.5 U (IQR = 4-8). ASPI values of Göttingen minipigs were significantly higher than those of Aachen minipigs (p = 0.046). Intravenous administration of ASA in Aachen minipigs resulted in significant platelet inhibition after 1 minute, which remained stable over a period of 5 minutes (p≤0.038). Aachen minipigs appeared to have a high variance in arachidonic acid-mediated platelet aggregation. In Aachen minipigs, intravenous ASA administration resulted in immediate platelet inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W4306733816,"The recent commercialization of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) has facilitated their incorporation into a variety of ecological studies. While UAVs are able to provide accurate visual data of marine species from an aerial perspective, these devices have some limitations that make measuring marine animals below the surface challenging. Many marine organisms are often visible from the air, but are deeper in the water column, and current methods cannot measure animals below the surface. Here, we developed and tested a stereo-video camera (SVC) system that was mounted onto a commercially-available UAV. We used the SVC-UAV to conduct remote body-size measurements for two marine species: the green sea turtle ( Chelonia mydas ) and the nurse shark ( Ginglymostoma cirratum ). When comparing SVC measurements to those taken by hand, the SVC-UAV had a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.44 cm (n = 6; mean percent error (MPE) = 10.6%) for green sea turtles and 7.16 cm absolute error (n = 1; PE = 3.6%) for the nurse shark. Using a linear model, we estimated the slope of the SVC versus hand measurements for green sea turtles to be 1.085 (±0.099 SE), and accounting for the standard error, a measurement bias was not apparent. Using model selection, based on a global model predicting MAE from animal distance to the SVC and body size, the top ranked model was the intercept-only model. This indicates that neither animal distance nor body size strongly influenced measurement error. Incorporating SVC systems into UAVs can allow for relatively accurate measurements of near surface-dwelling marine species. To our knowledge, there is no other stand-alone SVC for UAVs available that offers similar accuracy and utility."
https://openalex.org/W4306711188,"Avoiding losses from long-term trend reversals is challenging, and trend-following is one of the few trading approaches to explore it. While trend-following is popular among investors and has gained increased attention in academia, the recent diminished profitability in equity markets casts doubt on its effectiveness. To clarify its cause and suggest remedies, we thoroughly examine the effect of market conditions and averaging window on recent profitability using four major stock indices in an out-of-sample experiment comparing trend-following rules (moving average and momentum) and a machine-classification-based non-trend-following rule. In addition to the significant advantage of trend-following rules in avoiding downside risks, we find a discrepancy in the optimum averaging window size between trend direction phases, which is exacerbated by a higher positive trend direction ratio. A higher positive trend direction ratio leads to poor performance relative to buy-and-hold returns. This discrepancy creates the dilemma of choosing which trend direction phase to emphasize. Incorporating machine-learning into trend-following is effective for alleviating this dilemma. We find that the profit-maximizing averaging window realizes the level that best balances the dilemma and suggest a simple guideline for selecting the optimum averaging window. We attribute the sluggishness of trend-following in recent equity markets to the insufficient chances of trend reversals rather than their loss of profitability. Our results contribute to improving the performance of trend following by mitigating the dilemma."
https://openalex.org/W4306711218,"This nationwide study builds on prior research, which suggests that Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and other primary care providers are associated with increased access to opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment. We compare health care utilization, spending, and quality for Medicaid patients diagnosed with OUD who receive primary care at FQHCs and Medicaid patients who receive most primary care in other settings, such as physician offices (non-FQHCs). We hypothesized that the integrated care model of FQHCs would be associated with greater access to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and/or behavioral health therapy and lower rates of potentially inappropriate co-prescribing.This cross-sectional study examined 2012 Medicaid Analytic eXtract files for patients diagnosed with OUD receiving most (>50%) primary care at FQHCs (N = 37,142) versus non-FQHCs (N = 196,712) in all 50 states and Washington DC. We used propensity score overlap weighting to adjust for measurable confounding between patients who received care at FQHCs versus non-FQHCs and increase generalizability of findings given variation in Medicaid programs and substance use policies across states.FQHC patients displayed higher primary care utilization and fee-for-service spending, and similar or lower utilization and fee-for-service spending for other health service categories. Contrary to our hypotheses, non-FQHC patients were more likely to receive timely (≤90 days) MOUD (buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone, or suboxone) (Relative Risk [RR] = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.12) and more likely be retained in medication treatment (>180 days) (RR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.14). However, non-FQHC patients were less likely to receive behavioral health therapy (mental health or substance use therapy) (RR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.92) and less likely to remain in behavioral health treatment (RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89, 0.94). Non-FQHC patients were more likely to fill potentially inappropriate prescriptions of benzodiazepines and opioids after OUD diagnosis (RR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.40).Observed patterns suggest that Medicaid patients diagnosed with OUD who obtained primary care at FQHCs received more integrated care compared to non-FQHC patients. Greater care integration may be associated with increased access to behavioral health therapy and quality of care (lower potentially inappropriate co-prescribing) but not necessarily greater access to MOUD."
https://openalex.org/W4306728559,"There is an increasing number of medical use cases where classification algorithms based on deep neural networks reach performance levels that are competitive with human medical experts. To alleviate the challenges of small dataset sizes, these systems often rely on pretraining. In this work, we aim to assess the broader implications of these approaches in order to better understand what type of pretraining works reliably (with respect to performance, robustness, learned representation etc.) in practice and what type of pretraining dataset is best suited to achieve good performance in small target dataset size scenarios. Considering diabetic retinopathy grading as an exemplary use case, we compare the impact of different training procedures including recently established self-supervised pretraining methods based on contrastive learning. To this end, we investigate different aspects such as quantitative performance, statistics of the learned feature representations, interpretability and robustness to image distortions. Our results indicate that models initialized from ImageNet pretraining report a significant increase in performance, generalization and robustness to image distortions. In particular, self-supervised models show further benefits to supervised models. Self-supervised models with initialization from ImageNet pretraining not only report higher performance, they also reduce overfitting to large lesions along with improvements in taking into account minute lesions indicative of the progression of the disease. Understanding the effects of pretraining in a broader sense that goes beyond simple performance comparisons is of crucial importance for the broader medical imaging community beyond the use case considered in this work."
https://openalex.org/W4306728851,"Background Chronic stress in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), including peripheral artery disease (PAD), is independently associated worse outcomes. A model that can reliably identify factors associated with risk of chronic stress in patients with CVD is needed. Methods In a prospective myocardial infarction (MI) registry (TRIUMPH), we constructed a logistic regression model using 27 patient demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors, adjusting for site, to identify predictors of chronic stress over 1 year. Stress at baseline and at 1-, 6- and 12-month follow-up was measured using the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) [range 0–16, scores ≥6 depicting high stress]. Chronic stress was defined as at least 2 follow-up PSS-4 scores ≥6. We identified and validated this final model in another prospective registry of patients with symptomatic PAD, the PORTRAIT study. Results Our derivation cohort consisted of 4,340 patients with MI (mean age 59.1 ± 12.3 years, 33% females, 30% non-white), of whom 30% had chronic stress at follow-up. Of the 27 factors examined, female sex, current smoking, socioeconomic status, and economic burden due to medical care were positively associated with chronic stress, and ENRICHD Social Support Instrument (ESSI) score and age were inversely related to chronic stress. In the validation cohort of 797 PAD patients (mean age 68.6±9.7 years, 42% females, 28% non-white, 18% chronic stress) the c-statistic for the model was 0.77 and calibration was excellent. Conclusions We can reliably identify factors that are independently associated with risk of chronic stress in patients with CVD. As chronic stress is associated with worse outcomes in this population, our work identifies potential targets for interventions to as well as the patients that could benefit from these."
https://openalex.org/W4306729073,"For the echocardiographic examination horses should not be sedated unless absolutely necessary because this alters cardiac dimensions and indices of function. However, some horses do not tolerate the echocardiographic procedure and require sedation to conduct the examination safely and obtain good quality images. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the concurrent infusion of dobutamine in horses sedated with romifidine counteracts the cardiovascular changes observed with sedation alone. Twelve healthy untrained Standardbred mares were used. Three echocardiographic examinations were performed on the same day for each subject: a) without any treatment under resting conditions (WT); b) under sedation with romifidine administered intravenously (RT); c) under sedation with romifidine and concurrent intravenous infusion with dobutamine (RDT). A three-hour washout period was observed between each examination and the order of the examinations was randomly decided by rolling a dice. The measurements on the images recorded were performed offline at the end of the study protocol and at this point the operator was blinded to the horse and treatment administered. Left ventricular internal diameter (LVID) in diastole, left ventricular free wall (LVFW) in systole, and fractional shortening (FS) were higher in the WT group compared with the other two groups. No differences in the other M-mode and B-mode values were observed. A continuous rate infusion of dobutamine did not counteract the alterations caused by sedation and led to similar echocardiographic measurements to those obtained after romifidine administration."
https://openalex.org/W4306729088,"Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are at increased risk for major ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. However, the use of preventative antithrombotic therapy can increase the risk of ICH recurrence and worsen ICH-related outcomes. Colchicine, an anti-inflammatory agent, has the potential to mitigate inflammation-related atherothrombosis and reduce the risk of ischemic vascular events. Here we investigated the safety and efficacy of colchicine when used both before and acutely after ICH. We predicted that daily colchicine administration would not impact our safety measures but would reduce brain injury and improve functional outcomes associated with inflammation reduction. To test this, 0.05 mg/kg colchicine was given orally once daily to rats either before or after they were given a collagenase-induced striatal ICH. We assessed neurological impairments, intra-parenchymal bleeding, Perls positive cells, and brain injury to gauge the therapeutic impact of colchicine on brain injury. Colchicine did not significantly affect bleeding (average = 40.7 μL) at 48 hrs, lesion volume (average = 24.5 mm3) at 14 days, or functional outcome (median neurological deficit scale score at 2 days post-ICH = 4, i.e., modest deficits) from 1-14 days after ICH. Colchicine reduced the volume of Perls positive cells in the perihematomal zone, indicating a reduction in inflammation. Safety measures (body weight, food consumption, water consumption, hydration, body temperature, activity, and pain) were not affected by colchicine. Although colchicine did not confer neuroprotection or functional benefit, it was able to reduce perihematomal inflammation after ICH without increasing bleeding. Thus, our findings suggest that colchicine treatment is safe, unlikely to worsen bleeding, and is unlikely but may reduce secondary injury after an ICH if initiated early post ICH to reduce the risk of ischemic vascular events. These results are informative for the ongoing CoVasc-ICH phase II randomized trial (NCT05159219)."
https://openalex.org/W4306729329,"Limited access to healthcare among children in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is a major cause of poor infant health indicators. Although many speculate that the private sector expansion has overwhelmingly reinforced health systems' utilization, little is known as to whether and where children are cared for when they are sick. This study investigated health-seeking behavior (HSB) among children from an urban area of Burkina Faso, with respect to disease severity and the type of provider versus children's characteristics.A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso using a two-stage sampling strategy. 1,098 households (2,411 children) data were collected. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to analyze providers' choice for emergency, severe and non-severe conditions; sex-preference was further assessed with a χ2 test.Thirty-six percent of children requiring emergency care sought private providers, as did 38% with severe conditions. Fifty-seven percent with non-severe conditions were self-medicated. A multivariable GEE indicated that University-educated household-heads would bring their children to for-profit (instead of public) providers for emergency (OR = 3.51, 95%CI = 1.90; 6.48), severe (OR = 4.05, 95%CI: 2.24; 7.30), and non-severe (OR = 3.25, 95%CI = 1.25; 8.42) conditions. A similar pattern was observed for insured and formal jobholders. Children's sex, age and gender was not associated with neither the type of provider preference nor the assessed health condition.Private healthcare appeared to be crucial in the provision of care to children. The household head's socioeconomic status and insurance coverage significantly distinguished the choice of care provider. However, the phenomenon of son-preference was not found. These findings spotlighted children's HSB in Burkina Faso."
https://openalex.org/W4306730619,"Classical ballet dancers stand on tiptoe in the demi–pointe position where the ankle is plantarflexed, and the toes extend around a mediolateral axis passing through the second metatarsal head. Foot sickling, the foot inversion/eversion when the forefoot is grounded, should be avoided to achieve esthetics and prevent injuries during tiptoe standing. The foot inversion/eversion angle may change depending on the metatarsal heads through which the toe extension axis passes. This study investigated the relationship between metatarsal alignment in both load positions and foot inversion/eversion angle during tiptoe standing. Nine recreational female ballet dancers performed tiptoe standing on a single leg in the demi–pointe position. The foot inversion/eversion angle, the centre of pressure (COP) positions, and angles between adjacent metatarsal heads in the horizontal plane were investigated using motion–capture data and magnetic resonance imaging of the forefoot. As the angle between the second and adjacent metatarsal heads became more acute during tiptoe standing on the non-dominant leg, the dancers everted the foot more and significantly loaded the first toe–side more, and vice versa ( r = −0.85 and −0.82, respectively). Then, the load positions were distributed on the distal side of the second metatarsal head. These were not seen during standing on the dominant leg with COPs more proximal to the second metatarsal head. In conclusion, dancers load the distal part of the second metatarsal head during tiptoe standing on the non–dominant leg. When the angle at the second metatarsal head was acute, within the triangle formed by the first, second, and third metatarsal heads, even slight mediolateral shifts of load positions altered the toe extension axis around that metatarsal head; the dancers loaded medial to the second metatarsal head and everted the foot and vice versa. Therefore, the angle between the second and adjacent metatarsal heads influenced the foot inversion/eversion angle."
https://openalex.org/W4306730651,"The transition from a demographic regime of high mortality and high fertility to one with low mortality and low fertility is universal and comes along with the process of socio-economic modernization. The Spanish total fertility rate has decreased to below replacement levels in the last decades. The decline has persisted since the 1960s and is diverse across the country. Based on that diversity, the use of population forecasts, not only at national but at regional levels, for planning purposes (governments and private sector) with large horizons has become a must to provide essential services. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model we constructed probabilistic fertility forecasts for Spain at the regional level. Although this approach is already issued by the United Nations little research has been done focusing on the Spanish subnational level. Our objective is to disaggregate the national projections of the total fertility rate for Spain into regional forecasts. The results of this research will show the model fitting, first to the national level and then using a multifaceted and continuous evolution of fertility over time, at the regional level, to check its convergence."
https://openalex.org/W4306730975,"The article discusses the issue of career and motherhood of female scientists, which is part of a broader thematic area known as Work-Life Balance. The theoretical part refers to the social role theory and the mutual influence of work and career on family and motherhood. The situation of women scientists is presented, for whom fulfilling the role of a mother is an important, although natural barrier on the road to a scientific career. Previous analyses present in the literature revealed that for the vast majority of mothers-scientists, motherhood is a factor that significantly delays their plans related to the development of a scientific career. The paper presents the results of empirical research conducted on the basis of classical academic methodology. Then, based on the data obtained from 334 mothers-scientists, an innovative, multidisciplinary experiment using data mining solutions was conducted, to answer the research question: Is the basket analysis tool able to find possible correlations between the factors characterising the respondents, and the types and dimensions of conflict occurring between scientific career and motherhood they experience? The paper shows that, according to the study results, most respondents declare they indeed experience the conflict between the roles of a mother and a scientist. The most frequently declared dimension of the conflict is the time-related one, then subsequently the emotional dimension, and lastly the financial dimension; many scientists declare they experience more than one dimension of conflict. Lastly, the basket analysis tool objectively confirmed the occurrence of correlations between the factors characterising the respondents and the types and dimensions of conflict occurring between scientific career and motherhood."
https://openalex.org/W4306731059,"We looked at the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in decision-making and surgical management of patients selected for intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT). We also compared lesion size measurements in different modalities (ultrasound (US), mammogram (MMG), MRI) against pathological size as the gold standard. 63 patients eligible for IORT based on clinical and imaging criteria over a 34-month period were enrolled. All had MMG and US, while 42 had additional preoperative MRI for locoregional preoperative staging. Imaging findings and pathological size concordances were analysed across the three modalities. MRI changed the surgical management of 5 patients (11.9%) whereby breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and IORT was cancelled due to detection of satellite lesion, tumor size exceeding 30mm and detection of axillary nodal metastases. Ten of 42 patients (23.8%) who underwent preoperative MRI were subjected to additional external beam radiotherapy (EBRT); 7 due to lymphovascular invasion (LVI), 2 due to involved margins, and 1 due to axillary lymph node metastatic carcinoma detected in the surgical specimen. Five of 21 (23.8%) patients without prior MRI were subjected to additional EBRT post-surgery; 3 had LVI and 2 had involved margins. The rest underwent BCS and IORT as planned. MRI and MMG show better imaging-pathological size correlation. Significant increase in the mean 'waiting time' were seen in the MRI group (34.1 days) compared to the conventional imaging group (24.4 days). MRI is a useful adjunct to conventional imaging and impacts decision making in IORT. It is also the best imaging modality to determine the actual tumour size."
https://openalex.org/W4306731961,"Background This is a pilot proof-of-concept study to evaluate the utility of a custom 15-gene circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) panel as a potential companion molecular next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay for identifying somatic single nucleotide variants and indels in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The custom panel covers the hotspot mutations in EGFR , KRAS , NRAS , BRAF , PIK3CA , ERBB2 , MET , KIT , PDGFRA , ALK , ROS1 , RET , NTRK1 , NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes which serve as biomarkers for guiding treatment decisions in NSCLC patients. Method The custom 15-gene ctDNA NGS panel was designed using ArcherDX Assay Designer. A total of 20 ng or 50 ng input ctDNA was used to construct the libraries. The analytical performance was evaluated using reference standards at different allellic frequencies (0.1%, 1%, 5% and parental). The clinical performance was evaluated using plasma samples collected from 10 treatment naïve advanced stage III or IV NSCLC patients who were tested for tissue EGFR mutations. The bioinformatics analysis was performed using the proprietary Archer Analysis Software. Results For the analytical validation, we achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity for the detection of known mutations in the reference standards. The limit of detection was 1% allelic frequency. Clinical validation showed that the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the assay for detecting EGFR mutation were 83.3% and 100% respectively. In addition, the NGS panel also detected other mutations of uncertain significance in 6 out of 10 patients. Conclusion This preliminary analysis showed that the custom 15-gene ctDNA NGS panel demonstrated good analytical and clinical performances for the EGFR mutation. Further studies incorporating the validation of other candidate gene mutations are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4306732048,"Human tissue surfaces are coated with mucins, a family of macromolecular sugar-laden proteins serving diverse functions from lubrication to the formation of selective biochemical barriers against harmful microorganisms and molecules. Membrane mucins are a distinct group of mucins that are attached to epithelial cell surfaces where they create a dense glycocalyx facing the extracellular environment. All mucin proteins carry long stretches of tandemly repeated sequences that undergo extensive O-linked glycosylation to form linear mucin domains. However, the repetitive nature of mucin domains makes them prone to recombination and renders their genetic sequences particularly difficult to read with standard sequencing technologies. As a result, human mucin genes suffer from significant sequence gaps that have hampered the investigation of gene function in health and disease. Here we leveraged a recent human genome assembly to characterize a previously unmapped MUC3B gene located at the q22 locus on chromosome 7, within a cluster of four structurally related membrane mucin genes that we name the MUC3 cluster. We found that MUC3B shares high sequence identity with the known MUC3A gene and that the two genes are governed by evolutionarily conserved regulatory elements. Furthermore, we show that MUC3A , MUC3B , MUC12 , and MUC17 in the human MUC3 cluster are expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Our results complete existing genetic gaps in the MUC3 cluster which is a conserved genetic unit in vertebrates. We anticipate our results to be the starting point for the detection of disease-associated polymorphisms in the human MUC3 cluster. Moreover, our study provides the basis for the exploration of intestinal mucin gene function in widely used experimental models such as human intestinal organoids and genetic mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W4306732301,"Background Accountable Communities of Health (ACH) models have been popularized through Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) grants, including the State Innovation Model (SIM), to encourage the development of community-based coalitions across medical, public health, and social service delivery systems. These models enhance care coordination for patients and are better equipped to address Social Determinants of Health (SDH) needs. Methods Network data was collected from participating organizations in seven ACH sites established across Iowa. The application of network analysis quantitatively characterized the relational context of the interorganizational, cross-sector networks which are foundational to achieving the ACH goal of systematic, comprehensive care. Our analysis primarily used logistic network regression modeling (LNRM) to identify network structures and characteristics of organizations that facilitate or impede sustainable connections. Results Our findings suggest that the ACH was effective at stimulating sustainable connections across sectors and disparate positions of centrality in the network. Factors associated with sustainable connections between organizations included the strength of relationships and the type of collaboration, namely data sharing and resource sharing. Leadership roles designated by the ACH structure were associated with stimulating connections during the grant, but not with sustainment. Network measures of density and transitivity, which peaked during the grant period (compared to pre- and post-grant networks), further implied possible attrition of the ACH intervention effects without incentive to maintain collaborations. Conclusions Multi-sector care coordination networks were established, but our findings suggest depreciation of ACH intervention momentum and structure without incentive to maintain collaborations beyond the three-year duration of the grant. Sustainability could be bolstered and ACH goals actualized with reliable long-term funding."
https://openalex.org/W4306732303,"Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are common during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and are associated with a variety of postoperative outcomes. Therefore, the strategy of intraoperative glycemic control is an important issue for the patients undergoing CABG. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effect of different intraoperative glycemic control strategies on postoperative outcomes.We will perform this systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Relevant studies will be searched in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers will conduct study selection, data extraction, risk of bias and quality assessment. The primary outcome is postoperative mortality, and the secondary outcomes include the duration of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU), the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (MI), the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF), the type and volume of blood product transfusion, the rate of rehospitalization, the rate of cerebrovascular accident, the rate of significant postoperative bleeding, the rate of infection, the incidence of acute kidney failure (AKF), hospital and ICU lengths of stay (LOS). ReviewManager 5.4 will be used for data management and statistical analysis. The Cochrane risk-of -bias tool 2.0 and GRADEpro will be applied for risk of bias and quality assessment of the evidence.There is no consensus that which strategy of glycemic control is better for improving postoperative complications of patients undergoing CABG. The results of our study might provide some evidence for the relationship between intraoperative glycemic control strategies and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing CABG."
https://openalex.org/W4306733181,"Alcohol abuse and dependence have a substantial heritable component. Although the genome has been considered the sole vehicle of heritable phenotypes, recent studies suggest that drug or alcohol exposure may induce alterations in gene expression that are transmitted across generations. Still, the transgenerational impact of alcohol use (and abuse) remains largely unexplored in part because multigenerational studies using rodent models present challenges for time, sample size, and genetic heterogeneity. Here, we took advantage of the extremely short generation time, large broods, and clonal form of reproduction of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We developed a model of pre-fertilization parental alcohol exposure to test alterations in behavioral responses to acute alcohol treatment (referred to in short as intoxication) in subsequent F1, F2 and F3 generations. We found that chronic and intermittent alcohol-treatment paradigms resulted in opposite changes to intoxication sensitivity of F3 progeny that were only apparent when controlling for yoked trials. Chronic alcohol-treatment paradigm in the parental generation resulted in alcohol-naïve F3 progeny displaying moderate resistance to intoxication. Intermittent treatment resulted in alcohol-naïve F3 progeny displaying moderate hypersensitivity to intoxication. Further study of these phenomena using this new C. elegans model may yield mechanistic insights into how transgenerational effects may occur in other animals."
https://openalex.org/W4306733962,"A high-performance medical image segmentation model based on deep learning depends on the availability of large amounts of annotated training data. However, it is not trivial to obtain sufficient annotated medical images. Generally, the small size of most tissue lesions, e.g., pulmonary nodules and liver tumours, could worsen the class imbalance problem in medical image segmentation. In this study, we propose a multidimensional data augmentation method combining affine transform and random oversampling. The training data is first expanded by affine transformation combined with random oversampling to improve the prior data distribution of small objects and the diversity of samples. Secondly, class weight balancing is used to avoid having biased networks since the number of background pixels is much higher than the lesion pixels. The class imbalance problem is solved by utilizing weighted cross-entropy loss function during the training of the CNN model. The LUNA16 and LiTS17 datasets were introduced to evaluate the performance of our works, where four deep neural network models, Mask-RCNN, U-Net, SegNet and DeepLabv3+, were adopted for small tissue lesion segmentation in CT images. In addition, the small tissue segmentation performance of the four different deep learning architectures on both datasets could be greatly improved by incorporating the data augmentation strategy. The best pixelwise segmentation performance for both pulmonary nodules and liver tumours was obtained by the Mask-RCNN model, with DSC values of 0.829 and 0.879, respectively, which were similar to those of state-of-the-art methods."
https://openalex.org/W4306734143,"Murine ulcerative dermatitis (UD) is a common, multifactorial skin disease of C57BL/6 and C57BL/6-background strains of mice. Many treatment options have been previously reported but have been variably successful and may interfere with specific research studies. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, such as oclacitinib, have been used to treat allergic dermatitis in humans, dogs, and other species. Additionally, topical oclacitinib was shown to improve an induced model of dermatitis in mice. We hypothesized that topical application of oclacitinib in conjunction with hind limb nail trimming would improve UD lesion scores more than our institutional standard treatment regime using meloxicam, topical antibiotic ointment, and nail trimming or nail trimming alone. To test this, mice with naturally occurring UD were recruited to the study and assigned to one of three treatment groups (n = 14/group): nail trim only; nail trim plus meloxicam and topical triple antibiotic ointment; or nail trim plus topical oclacitinib. UD was assessed on days 1, 7, and 14 for all treatment groups, and scored based on a previously published scoring system that quantitatively scored UD lesions based on pruritus, character of the lesion, size of lesion, and location of lesion. Here we found that mean UD scores decreased from day 1 to day 7 and from day 1 to day 14 for all treatment groups. However, there was no significant difference in mean UD score between the treatment groups at any timepoint. These data show that topical oclacitinib and nail trimming together improved UD lesion scores comparably to our institutional standard treatment and nail trimming alone. However, further studies may be warranted to investigate other potential applications of oclacitinib to treat UD."
