https://openalex.org/W1997054462,"Cruciform DNA, a non-double helix form of DNA, can be generated as an intermediate in genetic recombination as well as from palindromic sequences under the effect of supercoiling. Eukaryotic cells are equipped with a DNA-binding protein that selectively recognizes cruciform DNA. Biochemical and immunological data showed that this protein is HMG1, an evolutionarily conserved, essential, and abundant component of the nucleus. The interaction with a ubiquitous protein points to a critical role for cruciform DNA conformations."

https://openalex.org/W1696959307,"Synovial fluid from arthritic patients contains multiple forms of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), as resolved by high performance liquid chromatography (Seilhamer, J.J., Plant, S., Pruzanski, W., Schilling, J., Stefanski, E., Vadas, P., and Johnson, L. K. (1989) J. Biochem. (Tokyo), submitted for publication). Here we describe the cloning of a human 4.5-kilobase gene and 800-base pair cDNA encoding the form representing the major peak of activity and protein mass (peak A). The clones encode a mature peptide of 124 amino acids, which follows a prepeptide of 20 residues. The deduced amino acid sequence constitutes an enzyme of the Type II class of PLA2s, and resembles PLA2s from other mammalian sources. This represents the first report of a full length mammalian non-pancreatic PLA2 sequence. Active transcription of this PLA2 gene was detected in two different inflammatory cell sources. Recombinant human peak A PLA2 was expressed in vaccinia as a secreted protein which accumulated in conditioned medium."

https://openalex.org/W2088449181,"Mutant mice homozygous for 'retinal degeneration slow' (rds/rds) are characterized phenotypically by abnormal development of photoreceptor outer segments in the retina, followed by gradual degeneration of photoreceptors. This process of degeneration is complete by one year, with preservation of all other retinal cells. The biochemical defect that leads to the mutant phenotype is not known. Our strategy for cloning the rds gene was based upon three previously reported observations. First, the rds locus maps to chromosome 17. Second, experimental rds/rds----+/+ and rds/+----+/+ tetra-parental mice manifest patchy photoreceptor changes in the retina, suggesting that the wild-type rds locus is expressed within cells of the photoreceptor lineage. Finally, the process of degeneration is specific to photoreceptors. On the basis of these observations, we predicted that the rds mRNA is encoded by a gene on chromosome 17 and is normally expressed exclusively within photoreceptors in the retina. We here present evidence that this is the case."
https://openalex.org/W2129192681,"Sindbis virus, an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome, was engineered to express a bacterial protein, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), in cultured insect, avian, and mammalian cells. The vectors were self-replicating and gene expression was efficient and rapid; up to 10(8) CAT polypeptides were produced per infected cell in 16 to 20 hours. CAT expression could be made temperature-sensitive by means of a derivative that incorporated a temperature-sensitive mutation in viral RNA synthesis. Vector genomic RNAs were packaged into infectious particles when Sindbis helper virus was used to supply virion structural proteins. The vector RNAs were stable to at least seven cycles of infection. The expression of CAT increased about 10(3)-fold, despite a 10(15)-fold dilution during the passaging. Sindbis virus vectors should prove useful for expressing large quantities of gene products in a variety of animal cells."

https://openalex.org/W2050206304,"THE regulatory elements that determine the expression pattern of a number of eukaryotic genes expressed specifically in certain tissues have been defined and studied in detail. In general, however, the expression conferred by these elements on genes reintroduced into the genomes of cell lines and transgenic animals has turned out to be at a low level relative to that of endogenous genes, and influenced by the chromosomal site of insertion of the exogenous construct. We have previously shown that if regions flanking the human β-globin locus are introduced into the mouse genome along with the human β-globin gene, a level of expression comparable to that of endogenous genes can be achieved that is also independent of integration site1,2. We have now defined a dominant control region with these properties consisting of 6.5 kilobases of DNA encompassing erythroid cell-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites. The identification of such dominant control regions could have important applications in somatic gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2038030881,"The measles virus (MV) phosphoprotein (P) gene encodes two known proteins, P (Mr approximately 70,000), involved in viral transcription, and, in a different reading frame, C (Mr approximately 20,000). By a combination of cDNA cloning, cDNA and RNA sequencing, and in vitro translation, we demonstrate here that the MV P gene also expresses a third product (Mr approximately 46,000) containing the amino-terminal region of P but a different, cysteine-rich carboxy-terminal motif. This third protein is translated from mRNAs in which one G residue has been inserted after three genomically encoded Gs, a modification found in about 50% of the P mRNAs. A smaller fraction of transcripts contain several additional G residues."
https://openalex.org/W2063287165,"The trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), like many other eukaryotic cell surface proteins, is anchored to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety. This glycolipid is assembled first as a precursor (glycolipid A) that is then covalently attached to the newly synthesized polypeptide. We have developed a trypanosome cell-free system capable of performing all of the steps in the biosynthesis of the glycan portion of glycolipid A. Using [3H]sugar nucleotides as substrates, several biosynthetic intermediates have been identified. From structural analyses of these intermediates, we propose a pathway for GPI biosynthesis. Based on comparisons between the VSG GPI anchor and similar structures in other cells, we believe that this same pathway will apply to the GPI anchors, and the related insulin-mediator compound, of higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2125365759,"We have introduced a human β-globin minilocus, containing the recently described dominant control region (DCR), the β-globin or Thy-1 gene, and a thymidine kinase (tk)-neoR gene into erythroid and nonerythroid cells. Analysis of the transcription levels of the genes shows that the DCR directs high levels of human β-globin, Thy-1 and tk-neo expression independent of integration sites in an erythrold-specific manner. The presence of the DNAasel hypersensitive sites at the 5′ end of the locus is required for this effect on the homologous and heterologous gene. An analysis of the DCR chromatin in transfected mouse erythroleukemic cells suggests that the formation of the hypersensitive sites in this region precedes β-globin gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1989109522,"Alternative splicing of alpha-tropomyosin pre-mRNA involves mutually exclusive utilization of exons 2 and 3, exon 3 being preferentially selected in most cells. This mutually exclusive behavior is enforced by absolute incompatibility between the adjacent splice sites of the two exons, due to close proximity of the exon 3 branch point to exon 2. The branch point, with an associated polypyrimidine tract, is in an unusual location, 177 nt upstream of the acceptor, only 42 nt from the exon 2 splice donor site. Splicing of exon 2 to 3 is consequently blocked prior to formation of an active spliceosome complex. This block to splicing can be relieved by insertion of spacer elements that increase the donor site-branch point separation to 51-59 nt. The unconventional relative location of the constitutive cis splicing elements therefore provides a simple mechanistic basis for strict mutually exclusive splicing. These results not only demonstrate that the branch point is not specified by proximity to the splice acceptor site, but rather suggest that it is the acceptor site which is specified relative to the branch point."
https://openalex.org/W2006348933,"Recessive lethal mutations in the genetic locus of the Drosophila EGF receptor homolog (DER) were isolated. Identification of mutations in the gene is based on assays of DER protein autophosphorylation activity. Most DER alleles show little or no in vivo autophosphorylation. The ability to monitor these activities in vivo and in vitro offers a preliminary insight into the functional defects in the different mutant proteins. The identification of the DER locus was also confirmed by partial rescue of the mutant phenotype with a DER P-element construct. Homozygous DER mutants display a complex embryonic phenotype. Most notably, the anterior structures deteriorate, ventral denticle bands are missing, the germ band does not retract, and the central nervous system shows a collapse of commissure and midline pattern. Mutations in DER were shown to be allelic to the previously described locus faint little ball."

https://openalex.org/W1977184797,"Salmonella bacteria are capable of entering (invading) and multiplying within eukaryotic cells. Stable adherence to and invasion of epithelial cells by S. choleraesuis and S. typhimurium were found to require de novo synthesis of several new bacterial proteins. This inducible event appears to be a coordinately regulated system dependent on trypsin- and neuraminidase-sensitive structures present on the epithelial cell surface. Mutants of S. choleraesuis and S. typhimurium were unable to synthesize these proteins and did not stably adhere to nor invade eukaryotic cells. Two such S. typhimurium mutants were avirulent in mice, an indication that these proteins are required for Salmonella virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2001017981,"Monoclonal antibodies have been induced that are capable of catalyzing specific hydrolysis of the Gly-Phe bond of peptide substrates at neutral pH with a metal complex cofactor. The antibodies were produced by immunizing with a Co(III) triethylenetetramine (trien)-peptide hapten. These antibodies as a group are capable of binding trien complexes of not only Co(III) but also of numerous other metals. Six peptides were examined as possible substrates with the antibodies and various metal complexes. Two of these peptides were cleaved by several of the antibodies. One antibody was studied in detail, and cleavage was observed for the substrates with the trien complexes of Zn(II), Ga(III), Fe(III), In(III), Cu(II), Ni(II), Lu(III), Mg(II), or Mn(II) as cofactors. A turnover number of 6 x 10(-4) per second was observed for these substrates. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the use of cofactor-assisted catalysis in an antibody binding site to accomplish difficult chemical transformations."

https://openalex.org/W1604134423,"Abstract The two forms of the approximately 90-kDa murine heat shock protein, referred to as HSP86 and HSP84, are coded for by separate but related genes. A full-length nucleotide sequence of the cDNA coding for HSP86 from a chemically induced tumor, Meth A, was determined. Sequences from a number of peptides from HSP86 were found to be in complete agreement with the nucleotide sequence. The HSP84 sequence from the same tumor was also completed. HSP86 and HSP84 are acidic polypeptides 733 and 724 amino acids long with calculated molecular weights of 84,796 and 83,290, respectively. The two proteins are 86% homologous. HSP86 was found to contain internal peptide repeats of Glu-Lys-Glu within a region of highly charged amino acid residues. The coding regions of the cDNAs were 76% homologous; however, this homology did not extend to the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions. The 5'-untranslated region of hsp86 cDNA was considerably longer than that of hsp84 cDNA and, unlike that of hsp84, contained extraneous ATG triplets. Hsp86-related sequences were assigned to chromosomes 12, 11, and 3. An evolutionary tree constructed from HSP90-related protein sequences indicated that HSP86 and HSP84 were likely to have diverged more than 500 million years ago. The findings presented herein suggest that HSP86 and HSP84 may have different functions."
https://openalex.org/W1577258036,"P30, the major surface antigen of the parasitic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, can be specifically labeled with [3H]palmitic acid and with myo-[2-3H]inositol. The fatty acid label can be released by treatment of P30 with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Such treatment exposes an immunological cross-reacting determinant first described on Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein. PI-PLC cleavage of intact parasites metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine results in the release of intact P30 polypeptide in a form which migrates faster in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results argue that P30 is anchored by a glycolipid. Results from thin layer chromatography analysis of purified [3H] palmitate-labeled P30 treated with PI-PLC, together with susceptibility to mild alkali hydrolysis and to cleavage with phospholipase A2, suggest that the glycolipid anchor of T. gondii P30 includes a 1,2-diacylglycerol moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1981307383,"In Drosophila, five ""terminal"" polarity genes must be active in females in order for them to produce embryos with normal anterior and posterior ends. Hypoactivity mutations in one such gene, torso, result in the loss of the most posterior domain of fushi tarazu expression and the terminal cuticular structures. In contrast, a torso hyperactivity mutation causes the loss of central fushi tarazu expression and central cuticular structures. Cytoplasmic leakage, transplantation, and temperature-shift experiments suggest that the latter effect is caused by abnormal persistence of the torso product in the central region of the embryo during early development. Thus, the amount and timing of torso activity is key to distinguishing the central and terminal regions of the embryo. Mutations in the tailless terminal gene act as dominant maternal suppressors of the hyperactive torso allele, indicating that the torso product acts through, or in concert with, the tailless product."

https://openalex.org/W2129420509,"The kinetics of alpha-factor Xa inhibition by antithrombin III (AT) were studied in the absence and presence of heparin (H) with high affinity for antithrombin by stopped-flow fluorometry at I 0.3, pH 7.4 and 25 degrees C, using the fluorescence probe p-aminobenzamidine (P) and intrinsic protein fluorescence to monitor the reactions. Active site binding of p-aminobenzamidine to factor Xa was characterized by a 200-fold enhancement and 4-nm blue shift of the probe fluorescence emission spectrum (lambda max 372 nm), 29-nm red shift of the excitation spectrum (lambda max 322 nm), and dissociation constant (KD) of about 80 microM. Under pseudo-first order conditions [( AT]0, [H]0, [P]0 much greater than [Xa]0), the observed factor Xa inactivation rate constant (kobs) measured by p-aminobenzamidine displacement or residual enzymatic activity increased linearly with the antithrombin concentration (i.e. corrected for probe competition) up to 300 microM in the absence of heparin, indicating a simple bimolecular process with a rate constant of 2.1 x 10(3) M-1 s-1. In the presence of heparin, a similar linear dependence of kobs on effective AT.H complex concentration was found up to 25 microM whether the reaction was followed by probe displacement or the quenching of AT.H complex protein fluorescence due to heparin dissociation, consistent with a bimolecular reaction between AT.H complex and free factor Xa with a 300-fold enhanced rate constant of 7 x 10(5) M-1 s-1. Above 25 microM AT.H complex, an increasing dead time displacement of p-aminobenzamidine and a downward deviation of kobs from the initial linear dependence on AT.H complex concentration were found, reflecting the saturation of an intermediate Xa.AT.H complex with a KD of 200 microM and a limiting rate of Xa-AT product complex formation of 140 s-1. Kinetic studies at catalytic heparin concentrations yielded a kcat/Km for factor Xa at saturating antithrombin of 7 x 10(5) M-1 s-1 in agreement with the bimolecular rate constant obtained in single heparin turnover experiments. These results demonstrate that 1) the accelerating effect of heparin on the AT/Xa reaction is at least partly due to heparin promoting the ordered assembly of antithrombin and factor Xa in an intermediate ternary complex and that 2) heparin catalytic turnover is limited by the rate of conversion of the ternary complex intermediate to the product Xa-AT complex with heparin dissociation occurring either concomitant with this step or in a subsequent faster step."
https://openalex.org/W1479896379,"Two separate enhancers were identified both upstream and downstream of the promoter of the human epidermal growth factor receptor gene. Transcriptional enhancer activity was found to be associated with a region 1172 and 852 base pairs upstream of the most upstream RNA start site, and within a 530-base pair fragment located in the first intron about 2000 base pairs downstream of the most upstream RNA start site. These two separate enhancers stimulated promoter activity cooperatively in HeLa cells synthesizing the epidermal growth factor receptor. The enhancer downstream of the promoter functioned only in the presence of the other upstream enhancer. Several areas of sequences homology with viral and cellular enhancers were noted in both the upstream and downstream enhancers. The region essential for the downstream enhancer activity has 10 nuclear factor-binding sites."

Electrical stimulation evoked a transient elevation of [Ca2+]i associated with a ""catch"" contraction. During the catch state, however, [Ca2+]i was effectively at its resting level and was unaffected by 5-hydroxytryptamine, which induced a rapid relaxation from catch. The results indicate that a maintained high [Ca2+]i is not required for the maintenance of catch tension in intact ABRM and that there was no significant change in [Ca2+]i upon abolition of catch."
https://openalex.org/W2156070993,"The sevenless gene encodes a putative cell surface receptor that is expressed in a highly specific and complex pattern in the developing Drosophila eye. We show here that this pattern is not required for the development of either the R7 cell or any other cell in the retina. By transiently expressing sevenless protein, we show that there is only a brief period during eye development when the sevenless protein is required for the formation of the R7 photoreceptor. Our results indicate that the specificity of the cell-cell signaling mediated by the sevenless protein is not achieved by regulating the distribution of the sevenless protein, but rather must reside in some combination of the temporal and spatial distributions of the sevenless ligand or other components of the sevenless signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2098105689,"Abstract Affinity labeling of the NAD-binding site of chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (5'-FSBA) caused spectral perturbation around 450 nm in the same way as NAD. Reductive titration with xanthine of native xanthine dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD showed that redox potentials of the FAD/FADH. and FADH./FADH2 couples were shifted positive by NAD binding to the enzyme. The redox potentials of these couples were also shifted to some extent by modification of the NAD-binding site with 5'-FSBA. These results provide further evidence that binding of NAD to chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase modulates the reactivity of the enzyme by shifting the redox potential of FAD. Proteolytic cleavage of the [14C]-5'-FSBA-modified enzyme yielded several domain peptides, only one of which contained radioactivity. The isolated radioactive peptide was further digested with Staphylococcus aureus protease and the 14C-labeled peptide was purified by two steps of high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was determined, and a reactive tyrosine residue was identified."
https://openalex.org/W1494888628,"The perform of chicken prolactin (PRL) deduced from the cDNA sequence contains a signal peptide of 30 amino acid residues followed by a mature PRL of 199 residues. Chicken PRL shows 77, 68, 67, 58, and 31% identity of amino acid sequence with whale, human, ovine, rat, and salmon PRLs, respectively. Elucidation of the primary structure of avian PRL enabled extended analysis of the specific and conserved amino acid residues and domains of the PRL molecules. The mammalian, teleostean, and avian PRLs share 32 common residues, and these conserved residues are observed to cluster in four distinct domains (PD1 to PD4), corresponding to four of five conserved domains of the growth hormones. Of the 32 residues, 8 residues in the PD2 and PD4 domains, including 4 cysteines, are conserved by other members of the growth hormone family, which indicates that these 8 residues may be essential for common structural features of the gene family. On the other hand, 13 other residues distributed among all four domains are conserved almost exclusively in the PRLs, suggesting that these residues are indispensable for specific binding of the PRLs to their receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1679034681,"Abstract The primary structure of a 22-kDa protein which was isolated during the purification of bovine skin dermatan sulfate proteoglycan is described.

A prominent component of mass 22 kDa was separated from the proteoglycan and further purified on octyl-Sepharose. The primary structure of this component was determined and found to contain three repeat regions. Each of the three sections contains a similar pattern of looped disulfide bonds. A six-amino acid consensus sequence, Asp-Arg-Glx-Trp-Asn/Gln/Lys-Phe/Tyr, is found in each loop. This domain may be involved in associations of the molecule with other extracellular matrix components."
https://openalex.org/W1531964167,"Glutathione transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) from horse erythrocytes has been purified and some molecular and kinetic properties have been investigated. It appears to be a dimeric protein composed of subunits of about 23 kDa, indistinguishable either in sodium dodecyl sulfate or in urea electrophoresis. Amino acid composition, substrate specificities, sensitivity to inhibitors, CD spectra, and immunological studies provide evidence that the horse enzyme is related to the pi class transferases. This enzyme has only two reactive thiol groups/dimer whose integrity appears to be essential for the activity. A peculiar feature of these protein thiol groups is that they react nonidentically with a number of thiol blocking reagents, i.e. iodacetamide, bromopyruvate, N-ethylmaleimide, and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Also many disulfides react with one thiol group 5- to 10-fold more rapidly than with the other. The two mixed disulfides so formed also have different rates of reactivation by dithiothreitol. All the structural and kinetic data reported in this paper indicate a nonsymmetrical association of two identical subunits, or alternatively heterodimeric structure with subunits of very similar charge and size."
https://openalex.org/W2165304235,"The neural control of the accessory respiratory muscles regulating upper airway patency is poorly understood. This is particularly true with regard to the declines in electromyographic (EMG) activity of upper airway muscles during sleep. To specify the cellular mechanisms causing decreased upper airway muscle tone during sleep, we used an established pharmacological model of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. With this model, a REM sleep-like state was reliably produced by microinjecting the cholinergic agonist carbachol directly into the pontine reticular formation of the cat. EMG recording were taken from the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscles of the larynx during wakefulness and the carbachol-induced, REM sleep-like state. This experimental model had not been previously used to study the neuropharmacological control of the upper airway. The results revealed a dose-dependent decrease in PCA muscle tone caused by pontine microinjections of carbachol. To investigate the cholinergic specificity of these effects, the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist pirenzepine was centrally administered before carbachol. Pirenzepine pretreatment effectively blocked the carbachol-induced, REM sleep-like state and attendant changes in muscle tone. These results specify for the first time that muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms within the pontine reticular formation can causally mediate state-dependent hypotonia in accessory respiratory muscles of the upper airway."

https://openalex.org/W1483551415,"Abstract This study extends our previous observation that surface mannose receptor expression by pure populations of CSF-1-dependent bone marrow-derived macrophages increases with time (Clohisy, D. R., Bar-Shavit, Z., Chappel, J. C., and Teitelbaum, S. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15922-15929). We presently find, however, that the progressive enhancement of 125I-mannose-bovine serum albumin (125I-Man-BSA) binding per cell reflects cell number rather than duration of culture. In fact, macrophages plated at high density bind 8-fold more 125I-Man-BSA than do their low density counterparts, with no difference in receptor-ligand affinity. Furthermore, cells cultured at high density are ultimately subjected to lower levels of exogenously provided macrophage growth factor, and fewer are in interphase. By obtaining synchronous populations of quiescent bone marrow macrophages, however, we demonstrate that neither cell cycling nor attendant levels of colony stimulating factor-1 influence mannose receptor expression. Our next series of experiments established that density-related mannose receptor expression reflects removal, by marrow macrophages, of a factor contained in culture medium. To this end, we treated mononuclear phagocytes with either macrophage- or control-conditioned medium and found that, via a fetal calf serum-residing protein(s), only control medium is capable of noncompetitively reducing 125I-Man-BSA binding in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, reconstituted 20-40% (NH4)2SO4-precipitable fractions derived from either sham-conditioned medium or fetal calf serum are capable of down-regulating mannose receptor expression. Alternatively, the same fraction obtained from macrophage-conditioned medium contains no such activity. Finally, initial characterization of the down-regulating factor reveals it to be acid-activable and trypsin-sensitive, yet resistant to heating to at least 80 degrees C, ribonuclease A, or freezing and thawing. We conclude that bone marrow macrophages up-regulate expression of their own plasma membrane mannose receptor by inactivating a noncompetitive, serum-residing inhibitory protein(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1562886527,"The purpose of this experiment was to test the stability of the heart rate (HR) power spectrum over time in conscious dogs. HR was recorded for 1 h for each of six animals on 2 days. A Fast Fourier transform was used to derive the HR power spectrum for the 12 contiguous 5-min epochs comprising the 1-h recordings. Changes in frequency and amplitude of the various spectral peaks were quantitatively examined. We confirm the presence of two major concentrations of power centered around 0.02 (low frequency peak) and 0.32 Hz (high frequency peak). However, we observed variations in these spectral peaks, especially their amplitudes, both within each hour and from day 1 to day 2. The amplitudes of these two spectral peaks tended to vary reciprocally. HR power spectra based on 5 min of recorded data were also derived from an additional eight animals in both the lying and standing positions; the power spectra from these short recordings were sufficiently sensitive to detect redistributions in power due to changes in posture in all eight dogs. We conclude that: 1) data should be recorded for relatively long periods (e.g., 1 h) to characterize the HR power spectrum; 2) some variability in frequency and amplitude will persist across spectra even when based on longer data bases; 3) care should be taken to ensure that the subject's behavioral state is stable within the recording period; 4) shorter (e.g., 5 min) data bases are not suitable except for detecting relatively robust changes in the HR power spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W1559933618,"Elimination of [2H]ethanol in vivo as studied by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry occurred at about half the rate in deer mice reported to lack alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH−) compared with ADH+ deer mice and exhibited kinetic isotope effects on Vmax and Km (D(V/K] of 2.2 ± 0.1 and 3.2 ± 0.8 in the two strains, respectively. To an equal extent in both strains, ethanol elimination was accompanied by an ethanol-acetaldehyde exchange with an intermolecular transfer of hydrogen atoms, indicating the occurrence of dehydrogenase activity. This exchange was also observed in perfused deer mouse livers. Based on calculations it was estimated that at least 50% of ethanol elimination in ADH- deer mice was caused by the action of dehydrogenase systems. NADPH-supported cytochrome P-450-dependent ethanol oxidation in liver microsomes from ADH+ and ADH− deer mice was not stereoselective and occurred with a D(V/K) of 3.6. The D(V/K) value of catalase-dependent oxidation was 1.8, whereas a kinetic isotope effect of cytosolic ADH in the ADH+ strain was 3.2. Mitochondria from both ADH+ and ADH− deer mice catalyzed NAD+-dependent ethanol oxidation and NADH-dependent acetaldehyde reduction. The kinetic isotope effects of NAD+-dependent ethanol oxidation in the mitochondrial fraction from ADH+ and ADH− deer mice were 2.0 ± 0.1 and 2.3 ± 0.3, respectively. The results indicate only a minor contribution by cytochrome P-450 to ethanol elimination, whereas the isotope effects are consistent with ethanol oxidation by the catalase-H2O2 system in ADH− deer mice in addition to the dehydrogenase systems."
https://openalex.org/W1506794721,"High field deuterium NMR spectra have been recorded for various horseradish peroxidase complexes reconstituted with hemins possessing specific 2H labels. The line width of the 2H NMR signals of deuteroheme reconstituted-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and its cyano complex for the immobilized skeletal 2-2H and 4-2H labels yield the overall protein rotational correlation time (22 ms at 55° C), which is consistent with expectations based on molecular weight. Meso-2H4 labels yield broad (1.3 kHz) signals just upfield from the diamagnetic protein envelope for HRP, and in the central portion of the protein envelope for the CN− ligated resting state HRP. Meso-2H4-labeled mesohemin-reconstituted HRP exhibits a similar signal but shifted further upfield by ∼10 ppm. The net upfield meso-H hyperfine shifts confirm a five-coordinate structure for resting state HRP. 2Ha resonances for essentially rotationally immobile vinyl groups were detected in both resting state HRP and CN− ligated resting state HRP. Heme methyl-2H-labeling yields relatively narrow lines (∼80 Hz) indicative of effective averaging of the quadrupolar relaxation by rapid methyl rotation. Thus the 2H line width of rapidly rotating methyls in hemoproteins can be used effectively to determine the overall protein tumbling rate. Preliminary 2H experiments in meso-2H4-labeled compound I do not support large π spin density at these positions on the porphyrin cation radical, and argue for a a1u rather than a a2u orbital ground state."
https://openalex.org/W1652495895,"Abstract We describe in this paper a monoclonal antibody to pig NADPH oxidase which inhibits enzymatic activity. This antibody, designated 1H8.2, was selected from a group of monoclonal antibodies produced against active preparations of purified NADPH oxidase and which showed selectivity of binding. 1H8.2 is an IgM restricted in binding to pig NADPH oxidase and showing higher binding to NADPH oxidase purified from phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated than from resting neutrophils. The antibody inhibits by about 90% the oxidase activity at 20-50 micrograms/ml. Inhibition is due to a decrease of the Vmax of the oxidase, and the Km is not affected. Incubation of the NADPH oxidase with 1H8.2 in the presence of concentrations of NADPH up to 25-fold the Km does not prevent the inhibition. Together with the evidence that the antibody does not inhibit the neutrophil superoxide dismutase-insensitive NADPH cytochrome c reductase and the liver NADPH-cytochrome c reductase this observation indicates that the 1H8.2 does not bind to an epitope belonging to the NADPH-binding site. Experiments of immunoprecipitation of iodinated membrane proteins and of immunoaffinity purification showed that 1H8.2 recognizes a heterodimer of apparent molecular mass of 16/18 and 14 kDa. These polypeptides can be involved in the NADPH oxidase activity or represent still unrecognized molecules able to modulate its function."

https://openalex.org/W1559742800,"A photoaffinity label for the lumenal K+ site of the gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase has been identified. Seven azido derivatives based upon the reversible K+ site inhibitor SCH 28080 were studied, one of which, m-ATIP (8-(3-azidophenylmethoxy)-1,2,3-trimethylimidazo[1,2-a] pyridinium iodide), was subsequently synthesized in radiolabeled form. In the absence of UV irradiation, m-ATIP inhibited K+ -stimulated ATPase activity in lyophilized gastric vesicles competitively with respect to K+, with a Ki value of 2.4 microM at pH 7.0. Irradiation of lyophilized gastric vesicles at pH 7.0 with [14C]m-ATIP in the presence of 0.2 mM ATP resulted in a time-dependent inactivation of ATPase activity that was associated with an incorporation of radioactivity into a 100-kDa polypeptide representing the catalytic subunit of the (H+ + K+)-ATPase. Both inactivation and incorporation were blocked in the presence of 10 mM KCl but not with 10 mM NaCl, consistent with interaction at the K+ site. The level of incorporation required to produce complete inhibition of ATPase activity was 1.9 +/- 0.2 times the number of catalytic phosphorylation sites in the same preparation. Tryptic digestion of gastric vesicle membranes, labeled with [14C]m-ATIP, failed to release the radioactivity from the membranes suggesting that the site of interaction was close to or within the membrane-spanning sections of this ion pump."
