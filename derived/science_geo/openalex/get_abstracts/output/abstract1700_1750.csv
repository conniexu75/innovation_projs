https://openalex.org/W2018197873,"Using an immunocytochemical method for the localization of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), we have observed GABAergic nerve terminals distributed throughout all layers of normal monkey sensorimotor cortex. These terminals displayed ultrastructural characteristics that suggested that they arose from aspinous and sparsely spinous stellate neurons. In monkeys (Macaca mulatta and M. fascicularis) made epileptic by cortical application of alumina gel, a highly significant numerical decrease of GAD-positive nerve terminals occurred at sites of seizure foci indicating a functional loss of GABAergic inhibitory synapses. A loss of such inhibition at seizure foci could lead to epileptic activity of cortical pyramidal neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1976079950,"The stability of elements of three different dispersed repeated gene families in the genome of Drosophila tissue culture cells has been examined. Different amounts of sequences homologous to elements of 412, copia and 297 dispersed repeated gene families are found in the genomes of D. melanogaster embryonic and tissue culture cells. In general the amount of these sequences is increased in the cell lines. The additional sequences homologous to 412, copia and 297 occur as intact elements and are dispersed to new sites in the cell culture genome. It appears that these elements can insert at many alternative sites. We also describe a DNA sequence arrangement found in the D. melanogaster embryo genome which appears to result from a transposition of an element of the copia dispersed repeated gene family into a new chromosomal site. The mechanism of insertion of this copia element is precise to within 90 bp and may involve a region of weak sequence homology between the site of insertion and the direct terminal repeats of the copia element."

A single session of inescapable shock resulted in earlier tumor appearance, exaggeration of tumor size, and decreased survival time in recipient animals. Escapable shock had no such effects. The effects of the inescapable shock were mitigated if mice received long-term shock treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2081448757,The subicular cortices of the primate hippocampal formation form a physical and connectional link between the cortex of the temporal lobe and the hippocampus. Their direct connections with all classes of cortex in the temporal lobe except primary sensory cortex underscore the pivotal role of these areas in the potential interplay between the hippocampal formation and the association cortices.
https://openalex.org/W2259136523,"The number and chromosomal locations of elements of the 412, copia and 297 dispersed repeated gene families differ extensively when the genomes of four D. melanogaster strains are compared. Differences among individuals from the same laboratory stock in the arrangement of these elements are also observed. In contrast to these polymorphisms, the structures of the elements themselves are closely conserved. Our results indicate that 412, copia and 297 are capable of evolutionarily rapid transpositions to new chromosomal sites."
https://openalex.org/W1999985738,"Color-opponent ganglion cells in the monkey retina respond to luminance flicker at high temporal frequencies. Color opponency, which makes these cells so selective of wavelength at low temporal frequencies, is progressively lost at high frequencies. This loss is due to a frequency-dependent phase shift between the responses of spectrally different center and surround mechanisms in the receptive field of each of these cells. Center and surround responses, which are antagonistic at low temporal frequencies, become synergistic at high ones, making these cells most responsive at high frequencies to those wavelengths to which they are least responsive at low frequencies. This phenomenon can explain the differences between chromatic and luminance flicker in human vision."
https://openalex.org/W2086826087,"The interaction of human platelets with one another and with the blood vessel wall is thought to be regulated in part by a balance between two arachidonic acid metabolites: thromboxane A2, synthesized by platelets, and prostacyclin (PGI2), synthesized by the vessel wall. We have studied the ability of cultured human vascular cells to synthesize PGI2 from arachidonic acid. Four strains of human arterial smooth muscle cells synthesized a mean of 1.36 ng PGI2 per 105 cells, with a range of 0.2–5.3 ng PGI2 per 105 cells among the different strains. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells synthesized a mean of 7.16 ng PGI2 per 105 cells with a range of 2.3–14.0 ng per 105 cells. In contrast, cultured human diploid skin fibroblasts synthesized only 0.27 ng PGI2 per 105 cells with a range of 0.05–0.6 ng per 105 cells. When cultured cells were mixed with platelets, PGI2 synthesis from added arachidonate was reduced rather than stimulated. Thus the major precursor cyclic endoperoxides utilized for PGI2 synthesis are formed within the cells and not from endoperoxides synthesized by platelet cyclooxygenase. Aspirin has been proposed as an anti-thrombotic agent. Aspirin could be ineffective, however, if it inhibited not only platelet cyclooxygenase but that of vessel wall cells as well. Measurement of the rate constant or potency for aspirin inhibition of PGI2 synthesis in cultured cells indicates that the cyclooxygenase in both cell types of the blood vessel wall is 14–44 fold less sensitive to aspirin inactivation than that in platelets, and appropriate levels of aspirin can selectively block human platelet thromboxane A2 synthesis without compromising the capacity of the vasculature to produce PGI2."
https://openalex.org/W1489992640,"Three highly specific trypsin-like proteases from mouse submaxillary gland; nerve growth factor gamma subunit, beta nerve growth factor-endopeptidase, and epidermal growth factor-binding protein were tested for kallikrein activity. Low molecular weight kininogen was purified from mouse plasma and used as substrate for the three enzymes, and the kinin released by the enzymes was assayed by its ability to induce contraction of isolated rat uterus. All three enzymes were found to have significant kininogenase activity, and the most active enzyme, beta nerve growth factor-endopeptidase, has activity comparable to authentic kallikreins from other glandular sources. Essentially all of the kininogenase activity of submaxillary gland co-purifies with beta nerve growth factor-endopeptidase. Hence, beta nerve growth factor-endopeptidase appears to be identical with submaxillary gland kallikrein. Nerve growth factor gamma subunit, epidermal growth factor-binding protein, and beta nerve growth factor-endopeptidase have similar amino acid compositions and molecular weights, and are immunologically similar. Comparison of published partial primary sequence data confirms our conclusion that nerve growth factor gamma subunit, epidermal growth factor-binding protein, and kallikrein are very closely related enzymes. It is postulated that these three enzymes are members of a larger family of similar enzymes, all of which are involved in the processing of precursors to polypeptide hormones and growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2000057408,"We have isolated recombinant DNA clones which include cDNA and chromosomal DNA sequences of the major heat shock-inducible gene of Drosophila. With the cDNA fragments used as specific hybridization probes, DNA:DNA reassociation and in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the DNA sequences are repeated approximately 7 times in the haploid Drosophila genome, and that gene sequences are present at both the 87A and 87C loci on the cytological map. The cloned cDNA and homologous cloned chromosomal DNA hybridized to mRNA which translated in vitro into the major 70K heat shock-specific protein. Here we summarize a study of the organization of genes coding for the 70K heat shock-specific protein contained in the two recombinant chromosomal DNA plasmids pG3 and pG5. On the basis of R loop hybridization experiments and restriction enzyme analysis, we conclude that a 14 kb fragment, G3, contains three copies of the gene coding for the 70K protein. A second 9.2 kb fragment, G5, contains one copy of the gene coding for the 70K protein. Hybridization of labeled poly(A)-containing RNA to restriction endonuclease-cleaved DNA indicates that the mRNA coding regions in G3 and G5 are each approximately 2100 bp long. The three tandemly repeated genes of G3 are separated by approximately 1400 bp of spacer DNA. The two internal spacer regions in G3 appear to be identical, whereas differences in restriction enzyme sites indicate that the sequences adjacent to the cluster differ from the internal spacer and from each other."

https://openalex.org/W2043506496,"To determine the special feature of ribosomal RNA promoters that might account for the highly efficient and regulated synthesis of rRNA in E. coli, we have analyzed the beginnings of two ribosomal RNA operons, rrnD and rrnX. DNA sequences for 425 bp preceding those specifying mature 16s rRNA are reported. In vitro transcription of restriction endonuclease fragments containing this region from either operon reveals the presence of two promoters about 110 nucleotides apart; they are denoted P1 and P2. RNA synthesis from P1 is initiated with GTP at position -284 (relative to 16s sequences) in rrnD and with ATP at position -285 in rrnX. At P2, the RNA starts with CTP primarily at position-176 in both operons. The DNA sequences of the two operons are identical for 231 bp preceding the 16s rDNA (including a substantial region around P2); they then diverge almost completely, except for a notable 18 bp homology just preceding the transcription start site for P1. Certain sequences implicated in the recognition of promoters by E. coli RNA polymerase are clearly identifiable in both P1 and P2; other features include an extended region preceding P1 which is strikingly rich in AT base pairs. Possible mechansims by which these tandem promoters contribute to the high frequency of rRNA transcription and to the differential expression of the E. coli rrn operons are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1544393375,"The initial step of intermolecular covalent assembly of immunoglobulins molecules involves formation of heavy chain-light chain or heavy chain-heavy chain disulfide bonds. Using QAE-Sephadex chromatography to isolate microsomal nascent polypeptides, we have shown that this initial step of intermolecular covalent assembly occurs, to a substantial extent, on nascent heavy chains, as well as on completed heavy chains as previously demonstrated by others. In MPC 11 mouse myeloma cells, completed light chains are assembled covalently to nascent heavy chains, whereas in MOPC 21 mouse myeloma cells, completed heavy chains are assembled covalently to nascent heavy chains. These results are consisted with the heavy-light half-molecule being the major initial intermediate in the assembly of MPC 11 IgG2b and heavy-heavy dimer being the major initial intermediate formed in assembly of MOPC 21 IgG1. The nascent MPC 11 heavy chain must be at least 38,000 daltons in size before assembly with the light chain occurs, even though the heavy chain cysteine involved in this disulfide bond is 131 residues (approximately 15,000 daltons) from the NH2 terminus. In addition, pulse-chase labeling studies of MPC 11 cells have shown that the assembly of completed light chains with the nascent heavy chain must occur within a few minutes of the synthesis of the light chain even though a large excess of unassembled MPC 11 light chains remain inside the cell for an average time of 2 h before being secreted."
https://openalex.org/W1566398256,"The interaction between cytochrome P-450 and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase during catalysis has been investigated with a reconstituted monooxygenase system composed of the two purified enzyme components and synthetic phospholipid. Steady state kinetic data are consistent with a scheme in which the formation of a binary complex between the two proteins precedes catalysis. The formation of this binary complex is described by a simple mass action equation. In agreement with this equation, the observed Vmax for benzphetamine N-demethylation was found to be directly proportional to the calculated concentration of the cytochrome P-450 . reductase complex. Furthermore, with appropriate reductase/cytochrome P-450 mole ratios, the Vmax could be shown to be linearly dependent on either the reductase or the cytochrome P-450 concentration alone. In contrast, the Km parameter is independent of the complex concentration, indicating that no change in the rate-limiting step has occurred. Thus a distinction should be made between a rate-limiting enzyme component and the rate-limiting step in this multienzyme system."
https://openalex.org/W1986837752,"The isolation of the two hybrid plasmids 56H8 and 132E3, which contain D. melanogaster (Dm) DNA sequences complementary to the mRNA coding for the 70,000 dalton heat shock protein, has been reported (Schedl et al., 1978). Here we compare the sequence arrangement in the two cloned Dm DNA segments by restriction, cross-hybridization and heteroduplex analysis. The results show that the two cloned DNA segments derive from nonoverlapping regions of the Dm genome; that they contain homologous regions present once in 56H8 and twice in 132E3; and that each homologous region is composed of three distinct contiguous sequence elements, x, y and z, which together define a 3 kb common unit. While the 2.5 kb z elements show a high degree of sequence homology in all three common units, the three x and y elements display an intriguing relationship. The localization of the mRNA coding sequences within each of these common units is presented in the accompanying paper (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1979)."

Chorion proteins constitute a large fraction of the protein synthesized by ovarian egg chambers in stages 12–14. The sizes and times of synthesis of the chorion proteins correlate closely with the production of poly(A)-containing RNAs by the follicle cells ( Spradling and Mahowald, 1979 Spradling A.C.

https://openalex.org/W1977745168,"RNA synthesis in ovarian follicles of Drosophila melanogaster was studied by methods which eliminate experimentally induced alterations in gene expression. Gel electrophoresis of follicular RNA, labeled after injection of precursors into females, revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in synthesis during the course of oogenesis. A highly heterogeneous group of poly(A)-containing RNAs is produced during much of the course of follicular development. However, post-vitellogenic stages synthesize a small number of stage-specific poly(A)-containing RNAs. During this period, RNA synthesis is known to take place primarily in the follicle cells, which are engaged in the production of the endochorion and exochorion. Two intense bands of nonmitochondrial poly(A)+ RNA are labeled between stage 11 and early stage 13. The synthesis of a more heterogeneous group of very small poly(A)-containing RNAs characterizes the last part of oogenesis, stages 13 and 14. Evidence is presented to show that these RNAs are specifically localized in the follicle cells of the egg chamber. We propose that they represent mRNAs for chorion proteins. In situ hybridization of preparations of late stage poly(A)-containing RNA to salivary gland chromosomes revealed two major sites of complementarity, 7E11 and 12E, as well as several minor sites. Experiments in which RNAs were separated on gels prior to hybridization in situ suggested that both the major stage 12-specific RNA bands contained molecules which were complementary to DNA in the 7E11 region. It is particularly interesting that this site is within a small chromosomal interval known to contain the gene ocelliless. Females homozygous for ocelliless have been shown to produce structurally abnormal chorions ( Johnson and King, 1974 Johnson C.C. King R.C.

https://openalex.org/W1567077543,"Primer- and promoter-dependent transcription of the synthesis gene had been studied. Primer-dependent transcription gave, as a major product, an end-to-end transcript which was strand-specific. The transcript was characterized rigorously by two-dimensional separation and analysis of the oligonucleotides formed on digestion with T1-RNase and pancreatic RNase and by nearest neighbor analyses of the oligonucleotides obtained when different alpha-32P-labeled ribonucleoside triphosphates were used as substrates. Minor products accompanying the major transcript were characterized similarly. The major transcript, when treated with an Escherichia coli S-100 extract, was processed to the tRNATyr with correct 5'- and 3'-ends. The nucleolytic cleavages occurring at the 3'-end were characterized. In promoter-dependent transcription, transcription of a restriction fragment containing phi80psu+III gene and the synthetic gene with and without the promoter were compared. Transcription of the synthetic gene was promoter-dependent and strand-specific, the initiation of transcription occurring at the same point as previously found in vivo. Although the synthetic gene contains only 16 base pairs corresponding to the natural sequence following the C-C-A end, processing of the transcript at the 3'-end occurred normally, the endonucleolytic cleavage being followed by exonucleolytic cleavages. The products of promoter-dependent transcription were completely characterized. An examination of the base modifications of the primary transcript during treatment of the latter with E. coli S-100 extract showed couplete modification of uridine to pseudouridine and partial methylation of uridine to ribosylthymine in TpsiCG sequence and partial formation of pseudouridine in the anticodon loop. However, hardly any formation of 2'-O-methylguanosine or of 2-methylthio-6-isopentenyl adenosine could be detected."

Biochem. 9, 457-467) have shown that high performance liquid chromatographic analysis of amino acids with the o-phthaldialdehyde/2-mercaptoethanol reagent (OPA/2-ME) is one of the most sensitive procedures currently available for micro amino acid analysis. In the present paper, methods are presented for the modification of cysteine and cystine in proteins for micro amino acid analysis using OPA/2-ME. Cysteine and cystine, which both show low fluorescence with OPA/2-ME, are converted to cysteic acid with performic acid directly, or to S-3-sulfopropylcysteine with 1,3-propane sultone after reduction of cystine with tri-n-butylphosphine. Cysteic acid and S-3-sulfopropylcysteine form highly fluorescent adducts with OPA/2-ME. The formation of S-3-sulfopropylcysteine in proteins and the subsequent hydrolysis of the proteins with methanesulfonic acid are particularly useful for complete amino acid analysis at the picomole level using a single sample."

Identification and genetic localization of mRNAs from ovarian follicle cells of Drosophila melanogaster. Cell. 1979; 16: 589-598 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar ) within a region known to contain a gene, ocelliless, which may be involved in chorion production ( Johnson and King, 1974 Johnson C.C. King R.C. Oogenesis in the ocelliless mutant of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Int. J. Insect. Morphol. Embryol. 1974; 3: 385-395 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ). We have investigated the synthesis of “chorion mRNAs” and chorion proteins in flies carrying this mutation. A reduction of labeling of both E3 and E4 was observed in stage 12 egg chambers from homozygous ocelliless females. In addition, they produce mature oocytes which contain greatly reduced amounts of several major chorion proteins, including those normally produced in stage 12, c36 and c38. To investigate whether the reduction was due to a direct effect of the mutation, the genes for these proteins were mapped. Recombination analysis using electrophoretic variants of c36 and c38 showed that both proteins are coded on the X chromosome at a site between crossveinless and vermillion. Further mapping with the deficiency chromosomes Df(1)KA14 and Df(1)RA2 narrowed the region containing the structural genes to a 16 band region between 7E10 and 8A4. The ocelliless gene, as well as the site of in situ hybridization, are located within this same interval. In normal ovarian follicles, both c36 and c38 are produced in equal amounts and with the same developmental specificity ( Waring and Mahowald, 1979 Waring G.L. Mahowald A.P. Identification and time of synthesis of chorion proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. Cell. 1979; 16: 599-607 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar ). In the mutant, both are reduced to a similar extent. In oc+/oc heterozygotes, both the c36 and c38 genes on the mutant chromosome produce much less product than the corresponding genes on the oc+ chromosome. The cis-acting nature of the ocelliless mutation suggests that it may disrupt sequences involved in controlling the expression of the structural information for these proteins."

RNA extracted by an SDS-hot phenol procedure was fractionated with sucrose density gradient centrifugation followed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fingerprint analysis of the in vitro synthesized ""5S"" RNA, which was slightly larger than mature 5S RNA on gel electrophoresis, showed that it contained all the sequences of mature 5S RNA except for the oligonucleotide at the 3' end.

Riboflavin uptake proceeds via a system whose general properties are indicative of a carrier-mediated process: it is inhibited by substrate analogues, exhibits saturation kinetics, and is temperature-dependent. The organism concentrates riboflavin primarily as the phosphorylated cofactors FMN and FAD. Energy is required for uptake but whether the energy demand is required for both uptake and phosphorylation or only for the phosphorylation step is not known. Membrane-associated binding activity for riboflavin has also been demonstrated in membrane vesicles prepared from B. subtilis, and the binding component can be solubilized with Triton X-100. Evidence supporting the function of the binding component in riboflavin uptake by the intact cells includes the following. (i) Riboflavin analogues inhibit binding and uptake to nearly the same extent and with similar specificity of action. (ii) The KD for riboflavin-binding and the Km for uptake are in the same range. Similarly the Ki determined for the inhibitory analogue 5-deazariboflavin in the uptake assay and the KD for its interaction with the riboflavin-binding component of membrane vesicles are in the same range.

Purification of tRNATrp from this strain (temperature-sensitive tRNATrp) was achieved by one of two methods. Either a combination of benzoylated DEAE-cellulose column chromatography and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or hybridization to plasmid DNA covalently bound to cellulose (this is a recombinant plasmid carrying the gene for tRNATrp) and electrophoresis of the eluted material on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, produced isotopically pure tRNA. The sequence of the temperature-sensitive tRNATrp was determined by standard methods. We find that the sequence differs from that of wild type tRNATrp by a single residue; G in position 7 (G7) in wild type tRNATrp is A7 in temperature-sensitive tRNATrp. This base difference results in one less base pair in the CCA stem of the temperature-sensitive species.

Two low-dose-rate gamma-radiation-induced null mutants of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase were shown to be positive to cross-reacting material. Two-dimensional gel analyses enabled the characterization of three natural null variants of alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase. The viability of some null mutants with homozygous null or null/deficiency genotypes is discussed in terms of the in vivo metabolic roles of the related enzymes."
