https://openalex.org/W1997812904,"A transcription factor, Cbfa1, which belongs to the runt-domain gene family, is expressed restrictively in fetal development. To elucidate the function of Cbfa1, we generated mice with a mutated Cbfa1 locus. Mice with a homozygous mutation in Cbfa1 died just after birth without breathing. Examination of their skeletal systems showed a complete lack of ossification. Although immature osteoblasts, which expressed alkaline phophatase weakly but not Osteopontin and Osteocalcin, and a few immature osteoclasts appeared at the perichondrial region, neither vascular nor mesenchymal cell invasion was observed in the cartilage. Therefore, our data suggest that both intramembranous and endochondral ossification were completely blocked, owing to the maturational arrest of osteoblasts in the mutant mice, and demonstrate that Cbfa1 plays an essential role in osteogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1994596418,"The osteoblast is the bone-forming cell. The molecular basis of osteoblast-specific gene expression and differentiation is unknown. We previously identified an osteoblast-specific cis-acting element, termed OSE2, in the Osteocalcin promoter. We have now cloned the cDNA encoding Osf2/Cbfa1, the protein that binds to OSE2. Osf2/Cbfa1 expression is initiated in the mesenchymal condensations of the developing skeleton, is strictly restricted to cells of the osteoblast lineage thereafter, and is regulated by BMP7 and vitamin D3. Osf2/Cbfa1 binds to and regulates the expression of multiple genes expressed in osteoblasts. Finally, forced expression of Osf2/Cbfa1 in nonosteoblastic cells induces the expression of the principal osteoblast-specific genes. This study identifies Osf2/Cbfa1 as an osteoblast-specific transcription factor and as a regulator of osteoblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2025046506,"We have generated Cbfa1-deficient mice. Homozygous mutants die of respiratory failure shortly after birth. Analysis of their skeletons revealed an absence of osteoblasts and bone. Heterozygous mice showed specific skeletal abnormalities that are characteristic of the human heritable skeletal disorder, cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). These defects are also observed in a mouse Ccd mutant for this disease. The Cbfa1 gene was shown to be deleted in the Ccd mutation. Analysis of embryonic Cbfa1 expression using a lacZ reporter gene revealed strong expression at sites of bone formation prior to the earliest stages of ossification. Thus, the Cbfa1 gene is essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, and the Cbfa1 heterozygous mouse is a paradigm for a human skeletal disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2013714561,"Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal-dominant condition characterized by hypoplasia/aplasia of clavicles, patent fontanelles, supernumerary teeth, short stature, and other changes in skeletal patterning and growth. In some families, the phenotype segregates with deletions resulting in heterozygous loss of CBFA1, a member of the runt family of transcription factors. In other families, insertion, deletion, and missense mutations lead to translational stop codons in the DNA binding domain or in the C-terminal transactivating region. In-frame expansion of a polyalanine stretch segregates in an affected family with brachydactyly and minor clinical findings of CCD. We conclude that CBFA1 mutations cause CCD and that heterozygous loss of function is sufficient to produce the disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2025870139,"Activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade is essential for growth factor-induced cell proliferation and differentiation. In this report, we describe the purification, cloning, and characterization of a novel protein, designated FRS2, that is tyrosine phosphorylated and binds to Grb2/Sos in response to FGF or NGF stimulation. We find that FRS2 is myristylated and that this modification is essential for membrane localization, tyrosine phosphorylation, Grb2/Sos recruitment, and MAPK activation. FRS2 functions as a lipid-anchored docking protein that targets signaling molecules to the plasma membrane in response to FGF stimulation to link receptor activation with the MAPK and other signaling pathways essential for cell growth and differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate that FRS2 is closely related and probably indentical to SNT, the long-sought target of FGF and NGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1995589371,"ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP) channels) are heteromultimers of sulfonylurea receptors (SUR) and inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits (K(IR)6.x) with a (SUR-K(IR)6.x)4 stoichiometry. Association is specific for K(IR)6.x and affects receptor glycosylation and cophotolabeling of K(IR)6.x by 125I-azidoglibenclamide. Association produces digitonin stable complexes with an estimated mass of 950 kDa. These complexes can be purified by lectin chromatography or by using Ni2(+)-agarose and a his-tagged SUR1. Expression of SUR1 approximately (K(IR)6.2)i fusion constructs shows that a 1:1 SUR1:K(IR)6.2 stoichiometry is both necessary and sufficient for assembly of active K(ATP) channels. Coexpression of a mixture of strongly and weakly rectifying triple fusion proteins, rescued by SUR1, produced the three channel types expected of a tetrameric pore."
https://openalex.org/W2068861782,"In Escherichia coli, two pathways use NADPH to reduce disulfide bonds that form in some cytoplasmic enzymes during catalysis: the thioredoxin system, which consists of thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin, and the glutaredoxin system, composed of glutathione reductase, glutathione, and three glutaredoxins. These systems may also reduce disulfide bonds which form spontaneously in cytoplasmic proteins when E. coli is grown aerobically. We have investigated the role of both systems in determining the thiol-disulfide balance in the cytoplasm by determining the ability of protein disulfide bonds to form in mutants missing components of these systems. We find that both the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems contribute to reducing disulfide bonds in cytoplasmic proteins. In addition, these systems can partially substitute for each otherin vivo since double mutants missing parts of both systems generally allow substantially more disulfide bond formation than mutants missing components of just one system. Some of these double mutants were found to require the addition of a disulfide reductant to the medium to grow well aerobically. Thus, E. coli requires either a functional thioredoxin or glutaredoxin system to reduce disulfide bonds which appear after each catalytic cycle in the essential enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and perhaps to reduce non-native disulfide bonds in cytoplasmic proteins. Our results suggest the existence of a novel thioredoxin in E. coli.

Biol. 1991; 217: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). While these bonds often occur in extracytoplasmic proteins, they are rarely found in cytoplasmic proteins (3Schultz G.E. Schirmer R.H. Principles of Protein Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1979Crossref Google Scholar, 4Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the cytoplasm is too reducing for many disulfide bonds to form (5Ziegler D.M. Poulsen L.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1977; 2: 79-81Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, when many exported proteins that ordinarily form disulfide bonds are expressed in the cytoplasm, they do not form these bonds (7Pollitt S. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 27-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2970-2977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of factors are thought to determine the thiol-disulfide balance in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. The principle thiol-disulfide redox buffer in the cytoplasm is constituted by the cysteine containing tripeptide glutathione. E. coli contains high levels of glutathione (the intracellular concentration is approximately 5 mm) that is kept almost entirely reduced (10Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1978; 54: 109-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). The ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione in the E. coli cytoplasm is roughly 50:1 to 200:1 (11Hwang C. Sinsky A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). In vitro, similar levels of oxidized and reduced glutathione are not conducive to disulfide bond formation in many proteins (11Hwang C. Sinsky A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar, 12Saxena V.P. Wetlaufer D.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 5015-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 13Lyles M.M.

In addition to glutathione, the E. coli cytoplasm contains at least four thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that may help reduce protein disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm via their redox active disulfides: thioredoxin, glutaredoxin 1, glutaredoxin 2, and glutaredoxin 3 (15Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin is the best characterized of these and belongs to a superfamily of proteins that contain an active site CX1X2C motif and share a similar fold, in those cases where structure is known (18Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The redox potential of thioredoxin is low (−270 mV) (19Krause G. Lundström J. Barea J.L. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, in vitro, thioredoxin efficiently reduces disulfide bonds in a wide variety of proteins (15Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although they have not been as extensively tested as thioredoxin, the glutaredoxins are generally less efficient reductants of disulfide bonds than thioredoxin (16Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Åslund F. Nordstrand K. Berndt K.D. Nikkola M. Bergman T. Ponstingl H. Jörnvall H. Otting G. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6736-6745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This may be partially explained by the higher redox potentials of the glutaredoxins (glutaredoxin 1 = −233 mV; glutaredoxin 3 = −198 mV). 1F. Åslund, K. D. Berndt, and A. Holmgren, submitted for publication. Upon reducing disulfide bonds, the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases become oxidized. In order for these proteins to be functional, they in turn must be kept reduced. The flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase uses NADPH to reduce thioredoxin but is unable to reduce any of the glutaredoxins (16Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2F. Åslund and A. Holmgren, unpublished results. Instead, the glutaredoxins are reduced by glutathione, which in turn is reduced by glutathione reductase. Like thioredoxin reductase, glutathione reductase is a flavoenzyme that uses NADPH to reduce its substrate. Since glutathione does not efficiently reduce thioredoxin (22Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the glutaredoxins are not substrates of thioredoxin reductase, it has been presumed that E. coli has two separate pathways for using NADPH to reduce disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm: the thioredoxin system (which consists of thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin) and the glutaredoxin system (glutathione reductase, glutathione, and the three glutaredoxins) (Fig. 1) (16Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 54: 271-298Crossref Google Scholar). Similar systems are thought to reduce protein disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells as well. Most eukaryotic cells contain high levels of reduced glutathione as well as thioredoxin and glutaredoxin (6Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar, 15Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Holmgren A. Björnstedt M.

In E. coli, the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems are known to participate in the reduction of disulfide bonds in essential cytoplasmic enzymes which require this step to complete their catalytic cycles. These include ribonucleotide reductase, PAPS 3The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate; DTT, dithiothreitol; Km, kanamycin resistance; Cm, chloramphenicol resistance; Tc, tetracyclin resistance; AP, alkaline phosphatase. reductase, and methionine sulfoxide reductase (16Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the ability of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems to function in vivo as general reductants of cytoplasmic protein disulfide bonds has not been fully determined. We have previously demonstrated that the thioredoxin system has a role in this process (26Derman A.I. Prinz W.A. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the role of the glutaredoxin system and both systems together in determining the thiol-disulfide equilibrium in the cytoplasm. Media and chemical reagents were prepared or purchased as described previously (27Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Diazenedicarboxylic acid bis(N,N′-dimethylamide) (diamide) and DTT were purchased from Sigma. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. Strains were constructed by P1 transduction (28Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics.

Russel Open table in a new tab A strain in which the coding region of grxC, which encodes glutaredoxin 3, was replaced with a gene encoding chloramphenicol resistance (grxC::Cm) was constructed by linear transformation (33Russel C.B. Thaler D.S. Dahlquist F.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2609-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, we constructed a plasmid pGrxC::Cm, which contains grxC::Cm and the chromosomal DNA flanking grxC. We made pGrxC::Cm from pGrxC, which contains a 1723-base pair fragment of chromosomal DNA that includes grxC cloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM-3Z. 4F. Åslund, K. D. Berndt, G. Spyrou, and A. Holmgren, manuscript in preparation. pGrxC was cut with BalI and BamHI, which removes all but 20 base pairs of the coding sequence of grxC. ABamHI linker was added to the BalI site and the ends of the resulting fragment were ligated together. Into theBamHI site of the resulting plasmid, we cloned DNA encoding chloramphenicol resistance obtained from pHP45Ω-Cm (34Fellay R. Frey J. Krisch H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 52: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) after digestion with BamHI. The resulting plasmid is called pGrxC::Cm. The fragment of chromosomal DNA containinggrxC::Cm obtained from pGrxC::Cm after digestion with EcoRI was then used to transform JCB495 (recD) to chloramphenicol resistance. The replacement ofgrxC by grxC::Cm in the resulting strain was confirmed by P1 transduction, polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis using anti-glutaredoxin 3 antibody (data not shown). Two of the strains constructed for this study, WP759 (trxB gshA) and WP778 (trxB gor), grew very poorly unless they were grown in medium that contains a disulfide reductant like DTT. To construct WP759, WP758 (gshA) was transduced with P1 grown on A305 (trxB::K m … . Tn10) and plated on NZ-amine-A plates containing 20 μg/ml tetracycline. A 1-cm filter disk containing 25 μl of 1 mDTT was placed on the plate. After incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, two types of colonies were observed: large colonies evenly distributed on the plate and small colonies that were only present roughly 1 to 2 cm from the filter disk. The large colonies did not require DTT for growth and were found by P1 transduction not to containtrxB::Km. The small colonies required DTT for growth and contained trxB::Km (by P1 transduction). The same procedure was used to construct WP778 except that AD494 (trxB::Km) was transducted to tetracycline resistance with P1 grown on WP522 (gor522… . mini-Tn10Tc). WP759 and WP778 were grown on NZ-amine-A plates with 8 mmDTT. 4 and 2 mm DTT was used to grow these strains in liquid NZ-amine-A and liquid M63 minimal medium, respectively. In minimal medium, these strains require supplementation with cysteine. Growth rates of WP759 and WP778 (Fig. 2) were determined as follows. Overnight cultures of both strains and DHB4 were grown at 37 °C in NZ-amine-A medium supplemented with 4 mm DTT. The cultures were diluted 1:100 in the same medium and their growth followed for 3 h by determining their optical density at 600 nm. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in NZ-amide-A medium without DTT and their growth was followed for another 3 h. Growth rates were calculated from the average of three determinations and differed from one another by less than 1%. WP759 and WP778 accumulate suppressing mutations that allow them to grow about as rapidly as DHB4 (wild-type) in media that does not contain a disulfide reductant. Since these mutations arise at a high frequency (approximately 10−6 or 10−7), it was necessary to monitor the growth rate of these strains when they were grown without DTT (e.g. to determine AP activity or urokinase activity) to make sure that they grew slowly. Cultures that did not grow as slowly as those shown in Fig. 2 B were discarded. The strains shown in Table IIwere grown at 37 °C in M63 minimal medium containing 0.2% glucose, 50 μg/ml each of all amino acids except methionine, 200 μg/ml ampicillin, and 5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final optical density at 600 nm of approximately 0.4. They were then incubated on ice for 20 min in the presence of 100 mm iodoacetamide. The remainder of the assay was performed as described in Ref. 27Derman A.I. Puziss J.W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, except that 100 mm iodoacetamide was used instead of 1 mm iodoacetamide in the wash buffer.

Zymography using casein plasminogen agar underlays was performed as described previously (26Derman A.I. Prinz W.A. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) except that after incubation of the samples on ice for the times indicated in Fig.3, iodoacetamide was added to 100 mm and the samples were incubated for an additional 20 min on ice. To determine the affect of diazenedicarboxylic acid bis(N,N′-dimethylamide) (diamide) on growth rate, cells were grown to an optical density of 0.2 at 600 nm in NZ-amine-A medium at 37 °C and diamide was then added to a final concentration of 250 mm. The growth of the cells was then followed by determining their optical density at 600 nm. To investigate the role of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems in maintaining the thiol-disulfide balance in the cytoplasm, we constructed a set of mutants missing various components of these systems. We then assessed the ability of disulfide bonds to form in the cytoplasm of these strains by determining the extent to which E. coli alkaline phosphatase (AP) is able to form disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm of the mutants. AP is a periplasmic homodimeric enzyme that contains two intrachain disulfide bonds in each monomer (35Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 186: 175-188Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These bonds are required for AP to be enzymatically active. AP is synthesized with an N-terminal signal sequence which targets it for export to the periplasm. When AP is expressed with a defective or missing signal sequence, it is not exported to the periplasm, but remains in the cytoplasm (36Michaelis S. Inouye H. Oliver D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 366-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this compartment, AP does not form disulfide bonds and cannot fold into an enzymatically active conformation (8Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7719-7723Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, in the cytoplasm of E. colimutants missing thioredoxin reductase a fraction of a signal sequenceless version of AP (APΔ2-22) does forms disulfide bonds and folds into an active conformation (26Derman A.I. Prinz W.A. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Thus, APΔ2-22 can be used to assess the potential for disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm of the mutants missing components of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems. Some mutants lacking components of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems have been previously constructed. However, these mutants are in different genetic backgrounds. To facilitate comparisons between the mutants, a set of isogenic strains was constructed by P1 transduction (Table I). The mutant alleles of each gene used in the construction of these strains do not make any detectable functional product of that gene (Refs. 29Russel M. Model P. Holmgren A. Brändén C.I.

In addition to the previously described mutants lacking glutaredoxin 1 (encoded by grxA), we wished to obtain mutants lacking either glutaredoxin 2 or glutaredoxin 3. A mutant missing glutaredoxin 2 has only recently been constructed, 5A. Vlamis-Gardikas and A. Holmgren, manuscript in preparation. and was not used in these studies. We constructed a strain missing glutaredoxin 3 using linear transformation (33Russel C.B. Thaler D.S. Dahlquist F.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2609-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pGrxC contains a fragment of chromosomal DNA that includes grxC (which encodes glutaredoxin 3). The coding region of grxC in this plasmid was removed and replaced with DNA from pHP45Ω-Cm (34Fellay R. Frey J. Krisch H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 52: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) which confers chloramphenicol resistance. The fragment of chromosomal DNA was then removed from the resulting plasmid and used to transform arecD strain (JCB495) to chloramphenicol resistance. The replacement of grxC with grxC::Cm was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and P1 transduction (data not shown). Western blot analysis revealed thatgrxC::Cm cells contained no detectable glutaredoxin 3 (data not shown). grxC is in an operon withsecB, which encodes an export-specific cytoplasmic chaperone. Western blots revealed that strains containinggrxC::Cm did not make detectable amounts of SecB (data not shown). Seven mutants constructed for this study could not grow in M9 or M63 minimal medium unless it was supplemented with cysteine or glutathione: WP839 (trxA grxA), WP860 (trxA grxA grxC), WP864 (trxB trxA grxA grxC), WP843 (trxA gor), WP898 (trxA gshA), WP824 (trxB grxA), and WP863 (trxB grxA grxC) (data not shown). DHB4, the wild-type parent of these strains, does not require these supplements. However, these additives were not required if the M9 medium was prepared with sulfite instead of sulfate (data not shown). None of these strains required cysteine or glutathione to grow in NZ-amine-A medium. Similar findings have been reported for trxB grxA and trxA grxA mutants and were attributed to the inability of these strains to reduce PAPS reductase, an enzyme that is required for growth when sulfate is the only source of sulfur in the medium (32Russel M. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Kren B. Parsell D. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 308-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Russel M. Model P. Holmgren A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Two strains constructed for this study, WP759 (trxB gshA) and WP778 (trxB gor), grew extremely poorly. They formed microscopic colonies on rich medium (NZ-amine-A) after incubation for 1 day and small colonies after 4 days at 37 °C (wild-type cells form large colonies in 1 day). Since we suspected that these strains grew poorly because they were not able to efficiently reduce cytoplasmic protein disulfide bonds, we determined whether their growth rate could be improved by adding a disulfide reductant to the medium. Both strains grew at about the same rate as wild-type cells when 4 mmDTT was added to the medium (Fig. 2). The doubling time of WP759 and WP778 in NZ-amine-A medium without DTT is about 300 min, while this rate increases to 30 min when 4 mm DTT is added to the medium. The growth defect of these mutants could also be complemented by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol, but not oxidized DTT, to the medium (data not shown). Interestingly, WP759 and WP778 were able to grow about as rapidly as wild-type cells, even in medium that did not contain DTT or another disulfide reductant, when the cells were grown anaerobically (data not shown). Mutations that allow WP759 and WP778 to grow well aerobically without a disulfide reductant in the medium arose at a relatively high frequency (approximately 10−6 or 10−7). These mutations have not been characterized further. APΔ2-22 becomes active in the cytoplasm of the mutants missing components of either the thioredoxin or the glutaredoxin systems (Table II). We confirmed that the AP activity in some of these mutants in fact reflects an increase in the extent of disulfide bond formation in APΔ2-22 by using the finding that oxidized and reduced APΔ2-22 can be separated with nonreducing SDS-PAGE (8Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7719-7723Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) to determine the redox status of APΔ2-22 in the mutants (data not shown). As previously reported, mutants missing thioredoxin reductase allow a substantial amount of APΔ2-22 (approximately 25%) to form disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm. Cells missing thioredoxin or one of the components of the glutaredoxin system allow less APΔ2-22 to form disulfide bonds. The amount of AP activity in many of these mutants is only slightly higher than that found in wild-type cells. However, even these small differences probably indicate a substantial increase in the ability of APΔ2-22 to form disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm of these mutants. We suggest this since, as far as we can tell, all of the AP activity in wild-type cells (WP551) reflects the 1–2% of APΔ2-22 that is exported to the periplasm; no disulfide bonds form in APΔ2-22 in the cytoplasm of wild-type cells. Thus, the increase in activity in the mutant"

The nucleolus contains a large number of small RNAs (snoRNAs) that share two conserved sequence elements, box H and ACA. In this study, we demonstrate that site-specific pseudouridylation of rRNAs relies on short ribosomal signal sequences that are complementary to sequences in box H/ACA snoRNAs. Genetic depletion and reconstitution studies on yeast snR5 and snR36 snoRNAs demonstrate that box H/ACA snoRNAs function as guide RNAs in rRNA pseudouridylation. These results define a novel function for snoRNAs and further reinforce the idea that base pairing is the most common way to obtain specific substrate-""enzyme"" interactions during rRNA maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2066231048,"The endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is a key determinant of vascular homeostasis. Like all known nitric-oxide synthases, eNOS enzyme activity is dependent on Ca2+-calmodulin. eNOS is dynamically targeted to specialized cell surface signal-transducing domains termed plasmalemmal caveolae and interacts with caveolin, an integral membrane protein that comprises a key structural component of caveolae. We have previously reported that the association between eNOS and caveolin is quantitative and tissue-specific (Feron, O., Belhassen, L., Kobzick, L., Smith, T. W., Kelly, R. A., and Michel, T.

Addition of calmodulin disrupts the heteromeric complex formed between eNOS and caveolin in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. In addition, overexpression of caveolin markedly attenuates eNOS enzyme activity, but this inhibition is reversed by purified calmodulin. Caveolin overexpression does not affect the activity of the other NOS isoforms, suggesting eNOS-specific inhibition of NO synthase by caveolin. We propose a model of reciprocal regulation of eNOS in endothelial cells wherein the inhibitory eNOS-caveolin complex is disrupted by binding of Ca2+-calmodulin to eNOS, leading to enzyme activation.

Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), formed by the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), serves as an important determinant of blood pressure and platelet aggregation. In endothelial cells, increases in intracellular Ca2+ elicited by diverse extracellular signals lead to activation of eNOS. The three known mammalian nitric-oxide synthases share similar overall Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent catalytic pathways. However, the eNOS enzyme is unique among the three known NOS isoforms in being localized to the specialized cell surface signal-transducing domains termed plasmalemmal caveolae (4Shaul P.W.

Plasmalemmal caveolae are small invaginations in the plasma membrane that may serve as sites for the sequestration of signaling proteins (6Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The principal protein in caveolae is the integral membrane protein caveolin, an oligomeric protein that serves as a structural “scaffold” within caveolae (8Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L.

Moreover, a functional role of the eNOS-caveolin association, beyond its postulated role in subcellular targeting of the enzyme, remains to be determined. We document in this report that the interaction between eNOS and caveolin may be regulated by Ca2+-calmodulin, and we show that caveolin can specifically inhibit eNOS enzyme activity.

An irrelevant plasmid encoding β-galactosidase was used as a control to maintain identical amounts of DNA in each transfection. Cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells (studied between passages 4 and 10) and COS-7 cells were performed as described previously (9Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol.

COS-7 cells were transfected with 10 μg of total plasmid DNA in 100-mm cell culture plates using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used at a final dilution of 1:100. Immunoprecipitated complexes were then recovered, denatured in Laemmli sample buffer, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (5Feron O. Belhassen L.

Monoclonal antibodies directed against eNOS or caveolin-1 (Transduction Laboratories) were then used to detect eNOS and caveolin-1 using chemiluminescence, as described previously (5Feron O.

Calmodulin was detected using a previously characterized monoclonal calmodulin antibody (15Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Expression of immunoblotted proteins was quantitated by laser densitometric analysis of x-ray films following chemiluminescence detection. NO synthase activity in lysates prepared from transfected COS-7 cell was determined by measuring conversion of [3H]l-arginine to [3H]l-citrulline as described previously (9Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Lee C. Robinson L.J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27403-27406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In some experiments, this NO synthase activity assay was performed in washed membrane fractions prepared from endothelial cell lysates as described previously (9Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that calmodulin concentrations were varied by the addition of purified bovine brain calmodulin (Sigma) as indicated. In exploring the factors governing eNOS-caveolin association, we discovered that the co-immunoprecipitation of eNOS and caveolin was markedly attenuated when endothelial cell lysates were prepared in buffers containing excess free Ca2+ (Fig.1). Under no conditions did the presence of Ca2+ affect the recovery of caveolin or eNOS from endothelial cell lysates when the proteins were directlyimmunoprecipitated by their cognate antibody. Onlyco-immunoprecipitation was abrogated by Ca2+, as shown in Fig. 1. We next investigated the role of Ca2+ in modulating the association of eNOS and calmodulin. This is particularly important because calmodulin, a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein, plays a central role in nitric-oxide synthase catalysis (16Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 90: 10769-10772Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using eNOS antiserum to explore eNOS-calmodulin interactions in endothelial cell lysates are shown in Fig. 2. We could detect co-immunoprecipitation of eNOS and calmodulin only when free Ca2+ was present. This result is in striking contrast to the loss of eNOS-caveolin co-immunoprecipitation observed in the presence of Ca2+(Fig. 1). Taken together, these data suggest that Ca2+differentially modulates the association of eNOS with caveolinversus calmodulin in endothelial cell lysates. We next used antibodies against caveolin to co-immunoprecipitate eNOS in Ca2+-free buffers and then washed the immune complexes extensively to remove residual Ca2+ and calmodulin. Subsequent addition of either Ca2+ or calmodulin alone had no effect on the subsequent recovery of co-immunoprecipitated eNOS from the eNOS-caveolin complex (Fig. 3, upper panel). However, when Ca2+ and calmodulin were added together, eNOS was entirely lost from the caveolin immune complex. This “lost” eNOS could be completely recovered in the supernatant of the immune complex (Fig. 3, middle panel), indicating that the eNOS molecule had been released and not degraded following treatment of the caveolin-eNOS complex with Ca2+ plus calmodulin. None of these treatments affected the recovery of caveolin itself from the immune complex (Fig. 3, lower panel). The extensive washing of these immune complexes, required to remove the endogenous calmodulin, likely led to the loss of some eNOS (because the affinity of the eNOS-caveolin interaction is undoubtedly less than the affinity of the antibody for caveolin), leading to the detection of a relatively faint but highly reproducible (n = 4) signal for eNOS released from these complexes by the combination of Ca2+plus calmodulin. Diverse experimental approaches have shown that agonist activation of eNOS in endothelial cells is dependent on Ca2+-calmodulin (1Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Marletta M. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The striking effects of Ca2+-calmodulin on the interactions of eNOS and caveolin therefore suggested to us that caveolin may influence eNOS enzyme activity. Indeed, caveolin has recently been shown in vitro to interact with other signaling proteins, including H-ras and G protein α subunits, preferentially associating with the “inactive” forms of these proteins (17Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), but the cellular regulation of these interactions is less well understood. We explored the functional consequences of the interaction between eNOS and caveolin using transient transfection experiments in COS-7 cells and analyzed eNOS enzyme activity in transfected cells by assaying the conversion of [3H]l-arginine to [3H]l-citrulline in cell lysates, as shown in Fig. 4. In three separate experiments, each conducted in triplicate, we found that the co-transfection of a plasmid cDNA construct encoding caveolin with eNOS cDNA led to a marked attenuation of NOS activity (3.4 ± 0.3 versus 1.6 ± 0.1 pmol citrulline/min·mg protein in the absence or the presence of caveolin co-expression, respectively; see Fig. 4 A). There was no change in the abundance of eNOS protein associated with caveolin co-transfection, as assessed in immunoblots of these cellular lysates analyzed in each experiment (data not shown). Importantly, caveolin co-transfection failed to attenuate the enzyme activity expressed by transfected iNOS or nNOS cDNA, shown in Fig. 4 B. As for eNOS, the enzyme activity of iNOS and nNOS is calmodulin-dependent (although important differences in the Ca2+ dependence of the different NOS isoforms have been noted). In further contrast to eNOS, the other NOS isoforms are not targeted to caveolae. To explore the specificity of the inhibitory effect of caveolin co-expression on eNOS enzyme activity, we performed activity assays in the presence of varying concentrations of purified calmodulin added to washed membrane fractions prepared from transfected COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 C, in cells transfected with eNOS cDNA alone, there is a robust NOS activity even in the absence of added calmodulin (presumably due the presence of endogenous calmodulin in these membranes); enzyme activity increases only slightly with the addition of exogenous calmodulin. By contrast, caveolin co-expression markedly inhibits eNOS activity (by >90%) in the absence of added calmodulin; addition of increasing concentrations of exogenous calmodulin relieves this enzyme inhibition in a dose-dependent fashion, documenting that the caveolin inhibitory effect may be specifically overcome by purified calmodulin. Taken together, these studies suggest that the interaction between eNOS and caveolin is dynamically and specifically regulated by Ca2+-calmodulin and may serve as an important point of control in NO-dependent signaling. A direct interaction of caveolin with calmodulin appears unlikely to us because there was no influence of caveolin on the activity of other calmodulin-binding proteins (iNOS and nNOS) closely related to eNOS. This hypothesis is consistent with our failure to detect co-immunoprecipitation of calmodulin with caveolin (Fig. 2), under conditions in which eNOS was shown to associate with either one or the other protein. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of caveolin isoforms show no obvious sequence or structural homologies to the known NOS isoforms (10Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl.

Caveolin can attenuate the tyrosine kinase activity of c-src, an enzyme that bears no structural homology to eNOS, and is not known to be regulated by calmodulin (13Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). We speculate that there is a common higher order structure assumed by the inactive conformation of diverse caveolae-targeted signaling proteins that forms the basis for their common interaction with caveolin. The targeting of eNOS to caveolae is likely to facilitate the interactions of eNOS with other co-localized signaling and regulatory molecules (3Sase K. Michel T Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Formation of an inhibitory eNOS-caveolin heteromeric complex may serve to ensure the latency of the NO signal until calcium-mobilizing extracellular stimuli destabilize this complex and activate the enzyme. This close control of enzyme activity may be particularly important for eNOS in caveolae, where calmodulin, the enzyme's key allosteric activator, also is localized (4Shaul P.W. Smart E.J.

Because nitric oxide has cytotoxic as well as signaling functions (1Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Marletta M. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), attenuation of basal enzyme “leakiness” by caveolin may be of particular importance. The reciprocal regulation of eNOS by caveolin and calmodulin may represent a novel mechanism for the concerted control of NO production in the vascular wall. We are grateful to John Joyal for helpful discussions and for assistance performing calmodulin immunoblots."
https://openalex.org/W2054595326,"Neurons within each layer of cerebral cortex express multiple members of the neurotrophin family and their corresponding receptors. This multiplicity could provide functional redundancy; alternatively, different neurotrophins may direct distinct aspects of cortical neuronal growth and differentiation. By neutralizing endogenous neurotrophins in organotypic slices of developing cortex with Trk receptor bodies (Trk-IgGs), we found that BDNF and NT-3 oppose one another in regulating the dendritic growth of pyramidal neurons. In layer 4, both endogenous and exogenous NT-3 inhibited the dendritic growth stimulated by BDNF. In contrast, in layer 6 both endogenous and exogenous BDNF inhibited dendritic growth stimulated by NT-3. These antagonistic actions of endogenous BDNF and NT-3 provide a mechanism by which dendritic growth and retraction can be dynamically regulated during cortical development, and suggest that the multiple neurotrophins expressed in developing cortex represent distinct components of an extracellular signaling system for regulating dendritic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2079755276,"Odors are thought to be represented by a distributed code across the glomerular modules in the olfactory bulb (OB). Here, we optically imaged presynaptic activity in glomerular modules of the zebrafish OB induced by a class of natural odorants (amino acids [AAs]) after labeling of primary afferents with a calcium-sensitive dye. AAs induce complex combinatorial patterns of active glomerular modules that are unique for different stimuli and concentrations. Quantitative analysis shows that defined molecular features of stimuli are correlated with activity in spatially confined groups of glomerular modules. These results provide direct evidence that identity and concentration of odorants are encoded by glomerular activity patterns and reveal a coarse chemotopic organization of the array of glomerular modules."
https://openalex.org/W2129153399,"The mitotic checkpoint ensures proper chromosome segregation by delaying anaphase until chromosomes are aligned on the spindle. Following prolonged spindle damage, however, cells eventually exit mitosis and undergo apoptosis. We show here that a murine homolog of the yeast mitotic checkpoint gene BUB1 localizes to the kinetochore during mitosis. By expressing a dominant-negative mutant, we show that mBub1 is not only required for the checkpoint response to spindle damage, but acts in the timing of a normal mitosis. In addition, when mBub1 function is compromised, cells escape apoptosis and continue cell cycle progression, despite leaving mitosis with a disrupted spindle. These data demonstrate a role for kinetochore-associated mBub1 in regulating exit from mitosis, and suggest functional links between the mitotic checkpoint and subsequent apoptotic events in G1."
https://openalex.org/W2121701144,"A strong promoter of the transition to flowering in Arabidopsis is encoded by FCA. FCA has been cloned and shown to encode a protein containing two RNA-binding domains and a WW protein interaction domain. This suggests that FCA functions in the posttranscriptional regulation of transcripts involved in the flowering process. The FCA transcript is alternatively spliced with only one form encoding the entire FCA protein. Plants carrying the FCA gene fused to the strong constitutive 35S promoter flowered earlier, and the ratio and abundance of the different FCA transcripts were altered. Thus, FCA appears to be a component of a posttranscriptional cascade involved in the control of flowering time."
https://openalex.org/W2023091089,"The hippocampus and its associated structures play a key role in human memory, yet the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that during encoding and recognition, single neurons in the medial temporal lobe discriminated faces from inanimate objects. Some units responded selectively to specific emotional expressions or to conjunctions of facial expression and gender. Such units were especially prevalent during recognition, and the responses depended on stimulus novelty or familiarity. Traces of exposure to faces or objects were found a few seconds after stimulus removal as well as 10 hr later. Some neurons maintained a record of previous stimulus presentation that was more accurate than the person's conscious recollection. We propose that the human medial temporal lobe constructs a “cognitive map” of stimulus attributes comparable to the map of the spatial environment described in the rodent hippocampus."

Here, we present the first crystal structure of a thiol-activated cytolysin, perfringolysin O, a member of a large family of toxins that kill eukaryotic cells by punching holes in their membranes. The molecule adopts an unusually elongated shape rich in β sheet. We have used electron microscopy data to construct a detailed model of the membrane channel form of the toxin. The structures reveal a novel mechanism for membrane insertion. Surprisingly, the toxin receptor, cholesterol, appears to play multiple roles: targeting, promotion of oligomerization, triggering a membrane insertion competent form, and stabilizing the membrane pore."
https://openalex.org/W1971526742,"Neuronal precursors born in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the neonatal and adult rodent brain migrate 3–8 mm from the walls of the lateral ventricle into the olfactory bulb. This tangentially oriented migration occurs without the guidance of radial glia or axonal processes. The cells move closely associated, forming elongated aggregates called chains, which are ensheathed by astrocytes. We have developed a culture system in which postnatal mouse SVZ neuronal precursors assemble into chains with ultrastructural and immunocytochemical characteristics equivalent to those in vivo but without the astrocytic sheath. Time-lapse videomicrography revealed that individual cells migrate along the chains very rapidly (∼122 μm/hr) in both directions. Periods of cell body translocation were interspersed with stationary periods. This saltatory behavior was similar to radial glia–guided migration but ∼4 times faster. Neuronal precursors isolated from embryonic cortical ventricular zone or cerebellar external granule layer did not form chains under these conditions, suggesting that chain migration is characteristic of SVZ precursors. This study directly demonstrates that SVZ neuronal precursors migrate along each other without the assistance of astrocytes or other cell types. (Additional data are presented in www.cell.com)."
https://openalex.org/W1981810931,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) comprise a family of TGF-β-related neurotrophic factors (TRNs), which have trophic influences on a variety of neuronal populations. A receptor complex comprised of TrnR1 (GDNFRα) and Ret was recently identified and found to be capable of mediating both GDNF and NTN signaling. We have identified a novel receptor based on homology to TrnR1, called TrnR2, that is 48% identical to TrnR1, and is located on the short arm of chromosome 8. TrnR2 is attached to the cell surface via a GPI-linkage, and can mediate both NTN and GDNF signaling through Ret in vitro. Fibroblasts expressing TrnR2 and Ret are ∼30-fold more sensitive to NTN than to GDNF treatment, whereas those expressing TrnR1 and Ret respond equivalently to both factors, suggesting the TrnR2–Ret complex acts preferentially as a receptor for NTN. TrnR2 and Ret are expressed in neurons of the superior cervical and dorsal root ganglia, and in the adult brain. Comparative analysis of TrnR1, TrnR2, and Ret expression indicates that multiple receptor complexes, capable of mediating GDNF and NTN signaling, exist in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1994234356,"Protein transport into the nucleus is governed by the interaction of soluble transport factors with their import substrates and nuclear pore complexes. Here, we identify a major distinct nuclear import pathway, mediated by a previously uncharacterized yeast β karyopherin Kap123p. The predominant substrates for this pathway are ribosomal proteins, which must be imported into the nucleus prior to assembly into preribosomes. Kap123p binds directly to its transport substrates, repeat motif–containing nucleoporins, and Ran-GTP. We show that the related protein Pse1p is also a karyopherin and can functionally substitute for Kap123p; both are capable of specifically directing a ribosomal nuclear localization signal reporter to the nucleus in vivo."

We also show that the recombinant protein recognizes the UACUAAC sequence. Therefore, BBP is also an acronym for branchpoint binding protein. The mammalian splicing factor SF1 is a BBP ortholog (mBBP) and an E complex component, and also has branchpoint sequence specificity. The relative conservation of this region in yeast and mammals correlates well with the RNA-binding differences between BBP and mBBP, suggesting that BBP contributes to branchpoint sequence definition in both systems."

Rat striatal synaptosomes were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and solubilized homogenates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antiserum specific for DAT. Basal phosphorylation occurred in the absence of exogenous treatments, and the phosphorylation level was rapidly increased when synaptosomes were treated with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid or calyculin.

As the primary mechanism for the clearance of synaptic dopamine, DAT is the main determinant that regulates the intensity and duration of dopaminergic neurotransmission (1Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). DAT is implicated in the etiology of psychostimulant drug abuse, as binding of cocaine and amphetamine to the protein inhibit dopamine transport (2Horn A.S. Prog. Neurobiol. ( Oxford ). 1990; 34: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and the resulting elevation of synaptic dopamine levels is believed to underlie the reinforcing properties of these drugs (3Ritz M.C.

Ther. 1989; 251: 150-155PubMed Google Scholar). DAT is also a dopaminergic-specific mode of entry for the neurotoxins 6-hydroxydopamine and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (5Kitayama S. Shimada S Uhl G.R. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Pifl C. Giros B. Caron M.G. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implicating it in mechanisms of neurotoxicity that serve as the best current models for Parkinsonian neurodegeneration. DAT is a member of a large class of neurotransmitter and amino acid transporters, including carriers for norepinephrine, serotonin, γ-amino butyric acid, glycine, proline, taurine, and betaine, which drive reuptake of transmitter by cotransport of Na+ and Cl− down electrochemical gradients (7Amara S.

Molecular cloning of DAT demonstrates the presence of 12 potential transmembrane domains, with a presumed topology orienting the N and C termini intracellularly. DAT and the other proteins in this group are extensively glycosylated, and their sequences contain numerous consensus phosphorylation sites for PKA, PKC, and Ca2+-calmodulin kinase (10Kilty J.

The presence of potential phosphorylation sites on these proteins suggests that they may be subject to phosphorylation-induced functional regulation, and several studies have shown that transport of neurotransmitters is affected by protein kinase activators. Treatment of striatal synaptosomes and heterologous expression systems with phorbol esters or other protein kinase activators reduces dopamine transport activity of mouse, rat, and human DATs (15Kitayama S.

Evidence for the potential involvement of transporter phosphorylation in producing these effects has been obtained only for dopamine and glutamate transporters, which undergo in vivophosphorylation regulated by PMA in rDAT-LLC-PK1 cells and C6 glioma cells, respectively (16Huff R.A.

Neurosci. Abstr. 1995; 21: 865Google Scholar). Thus, although several studies have indicated that protein kinase activators regulate neurotransmitter transport activity, only a small number of studies utilizing in vitro or heterologous expression systems have demonstrated direct transporter phosphorylation, and to date little work has been done examining these properties in the brain. In this report we describe the endogenous phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of DAT in rat striatal synaptosomes and show that the phosphorylation state of the protein is regulated by protein kinase C. Dopamine transport activity is reduced by all treatments that increase DAT phosphorylation, with similar dose, kinetic, and inhibitor characteristics, suggesting that in brain DAT is subject to phosphorylation-induced functional regulation. Male Sprague Dawley rats, 150–300 g, were decaptitated, and the striata were rapidly removed and weighed. The tissue was homogenized in a Teflon-glass homogenizer in 10 ml of cold 0.32 m sucrose and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 12,500 × g for 10 min, and the resulting synaptosomal pellet was resuspended in 0.32 m sucrose at a concentration of 120 mg/ml original wet weight for phosphorylation experiments or 30 mg/ml original wet weight for uptake assays (0.5–2 mg/ml protein). Proteins were assayed using the Pierce protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Krebs bicarbonate buffer (25 mmNa2HCO3, 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3) was saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2, and [32P]orthophosphate was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mCi/ml. The synaptosomal suspension was diluted 4-fold in this buffer to a tissue concentration of 30 mg/ml original wet weight in a final volume of 300 μl. Treatment compounds were added in 3-μl volumes, and incubations were carried out at 30 °C for 45 min with shaking at 100 rpm. At the end of the incubation, reaction tubes were transferred to an ice water bath to reduce enzyme activity, and samples were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed, and the tissue was solubilized with 100 μl of 0.5% SDS and four passages through a 26-gauge needle. The solubilized samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were removed for analysis. Solubilized tissue samples were immunoprecipitated with antibody 16, directed against amino acids 42–59 of the deduced DAT primary sequence (28Vaughan R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 956-964PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody has been shown by immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry to be highly specific for DAT (28Vaughan R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 956-964PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nirenberg M.J. Vaughan R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. Pickel V.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 436-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilized,32PO4-labeled synaptosomal tissue was diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and serum 16 diluted 1:400. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein Sepharose CL4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for an additional hour. Immune complexes were washed twice with the Tris-Triton buffer, and samples were eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Samples were electrophoresed on 7% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax film for 1–5 days. Amersham Rainbow molecular mass markers were standards on all gels. Positive controls for immunoprecipitations were provided by parallel precipitation of [125I]DEEP photoaffinity labeled dopamine transporters (30Grigoriadis D.E. Wilson A.A. Lew R. Sharkey J.S. Kuhar M.J. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2664-2670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For peptide blocking experiments, diluted antiserum was preincubated with either 50 μg/ml peptide 16 or peptide 18 (amino acids 580–608) prior to addition of the sample. Levels of DAT phosphorylation were quantitated by Cerenkov counting. All results were obtained in three or more independent experiments. For preincubations with test compounds or vehicle, synaptosomal samples were distributed into 500-μl volumes and treated at 30 °C with shaking at 100 rpm for 20 min or other indicated times. After preincubation, 50-μl aliquots were distributed into assay tubes prepared as follows, and [3H]DA was added to inititate transport. Dopamine uptake was performed in a final volume of 1000 μl, in a buffer consisting of 16 mmNa2PO4, 126 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ascorbic acid, and 1 μm pargyline. Final tissue concentration was 1.5 mg/ml original wet weight, and [3H]DA was 1 nmexcept for saturation analyses where [3H]DA was increased to 10 nm and unlabeled dopamine varied from 10 nm to 1 μm. Nonspecific uptake was defined with 100 μm (−)-cocaine. Uptake assays were carried out for 3 min at 30 °C, followed by filtration under vacuum through Whatman GF/B filters soaked in 0.05% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed rapidly with 5 ml of ice-cold 0.3 m sucrose using a Brandel M48R filtering manifold. Radioactivity bound to filters was counted using a Beckman LS 6000 liquid scintillation counter at 45–50% efficiency. Specific dopamine uptake in control preparations averaged 1.18 ± 0.38 pmol/min/mg protein, and data were analyzed by EBDA and LIGAND computer software. For purposes of comparison across experiments, uptake results were converted to percentages of control values and analyzed statistically with paired t tests using Statview version 4D by Abacus Concepts, Inc. (Berklely, CA). Because of the modest effects produced by the test compounds, the experimental design incorporated substantial assay redundancy. In each experiment, preincubations with test compounds or vehicle were performed on duplicate tissue samples. Each tissue sample was analyzed in six assay tubes, and the resulting values were averaged. Each data point thus consists of the mean of 12 independent determinations. [3H]Alanine uptake was examined using the same conditions as for dopamine transport, except that [3H]alanine was 10 nm. PMA, 4αPDD, okadaic acid, calyculin, microcystin, cyclosporin A, staurosporine, bisindoylmaleimide I HCl, (−)-indolactam V, OAG, forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, and isobutylmethylxanthine were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Compounds were dissolved at high concentrations in Me2SO or water, and stock solutions were diluted for use in Krebs bicarbonate buffer, producing final Me2SO concentrations of up to 0.5%. Me2SO alone at this level did not affect DAT phosphorylation or dopamine transport, but in all experiments control samples were treated with matching concentrations of vehicle. [32P]Orthophosphate, carrier-free, was from DuPont NEN. [3H]Dopamine (specific activity 48 Ci/mmol) and [3H]alanine (specific activity 54.0 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Corp. [125I]DEEP was radioiodinated by Dr. John Lever (Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore, MD). The identification of the dopamine transporter from rat brain as a phosphoprotein is shown in Fig.1.

Preimmune serum did not recognize this protein (lane 5), and preabsorption of the immune serum with the immunizing peptide (lane 7), but not an irrelevant peptide (lane 8), blocked extraction of the protein. The32PO4-labeled protein exactly co-migrated on gels with authentic [125I]DEEP-labeled DAT, which exhibited the identical serum recognition and peptide preabsorption profile (lanes 1–4), and the phosphorylated protein was not extracted from the cerebellum, a brain region devoid of DATs (lane 9). These results identify this phosphoprotein as DAT, with the possible caveat that the observed phosphoprotein is a contaminant that co-precipitates only in the presence of DAT. Although DATs were phosphorylated at a basal level in untreated synaptosomes, inclusion of the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) during 32PO4 labeling resulted in a dramatic increase in the level of DAT phosphorylation (Figs. 2and 6). This effect was dose-dependent, increasing up to 10 μm, the highest concentration tested (Fig. 2,top). Time course studies showed increased levels of phosphorylated DAT by 5 min of treatment, with a maximum reached by 15–20 min (Fig. 2, bottom). Because of this effect, 10 μm okadaic acid was used in all subsequent experiments, unless otherwise indicated.Figure 6Activity of phosphatase inhibitors and forskolin on DAT phosphorylation. Synaptosomes were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate for 45 min in the presence of the indicated compounds followed by immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, and autoradiography. OA, calyculin, and microcystin were 10 μm, isobutylmethylxanthine was 1 mm, and forskolin was 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Treatment of synaptosomes with PMA in the presence of OA during32PO4 labeling increased DAT phosphorylation levels a further 3–5-fold (Fig. 3). This effect was dose-dependent, increasing steeply between 0.1 and 1 μm (top). The time course of PMA stimulation showed increases in phosphorylation by 5–10 min, with maximum levels reached by 15–20 min (bottom). The same relative response to PMA was produced in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors (not shown), although the lower base-line phosphorylation made this difficult to observe. The inactive phorbol ester 4αPDD at 10 μm had no effect on DAT phosphorylation (see Fig. 5). To further verify the involvement of PKC in this response, the effects of two other protein kinase C activators, (−)-indolactam V and OAG, were also examined (Fig. 4). A slight increase above basal was produced by 0.1 μm (−)-indolactam V, whereas 1 and 10 μm treatments increased DAT phosphorylation to comparable or slightly higher levels than PMA. OAG, a diacylglycerol analog, caused enhancement of DAT phosphorylation at 0.3 and 1 mm.Figure 5Protein kinase inhibitors block DAT phosphorylation.

Additional evidence in support of this conclusion was obtained using the PKC inhibitors staurosporine and bisindoylmaleimide (Fig. 5). 1 μmstaurosporine blocked the increased DAT phosphorylation produced by 1 μm PMA, whereas 10 μm staurosporine inhibited even basal phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of a 20-kDa contaminant present in precipitated samples was not affected by staurosporine, indicating that the reduction of DAT phosphorylation below basal levels was not due to toxicity or nonspecific effects. PMA-induced phosphorylation of DAT was also blocked by bisindoylmaleimide, a kinase inhibitor much more specific for PKC than staurosporine. Partial inhibition of stimulated phosphorylation was observed at 100 nm, and almost complete inhibition of the stimulated increase was obtained at 1 μm, the highest concentration tested. Additional characterization of DAT dephosphorylation was done using three other phosphatase inhibitors, calyculin, microcystin, and cyclosporin A (Fig. 6). Calyculin was as effective as okadaic acid at preventing DAT dephosphorylation in the dose range of 1–10 μm. Conversely, neither 10 μmmicrocystin (Fig. 6) nor 10 μm cyclosporin A (not shown) showed significant effects. Fig. 6 also shows that protein kinase A activators had no effect on DAT phosphorylation. In four separate experiments, neither 50 μm forskolin in the presence of the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (Fig. 6) nor 10 μm 8-Br-cAMP (not shown) caused stimulation of phosphorylation above the okadaic acid-induced level. These compounds were also without effect in the absence of OA. To examine possible functional consequences of DAT phosphorylation, synaptosomes were assayed for dopamine transport activity after being given phosphorylation-inducing treatments (Table I). When synaptosomes were treated with either 10 μm PMA or 10 μm okadaic acid, DA uptake activity was reduced to 86.9 ± 3.0% and 86.5 ± 3.0% of control values, respectively. When both compounds were used together the effects were additive, resulting in transport being reduced to 75.9 ± 2.5% compared with the control. The treatment group values are statistically different from control values, and the combined OA and PMA treatment group is also statistically different from the individual treatment groups. The nonphorbol PKC activators (−)-indolactam V and OAG also reduced DA uptake to 92.8 ± 1.5% and 79.0 ± 2.6% of control values, respectively, whereas 4αPDD had no effect (average uptake = 97.8 ± 3.2% of control). Staurosporine and bisindoylmaleimide, the protein kinase inhibitors that blocked PMA-induced phosphorylation, also blocked the ability of PMA to decrease transport activity (TableII).Table IPhosphorylation activators reduce [3 H]DA uptakeTreatmentControl ± S.E.n%Me2SO100aDifferent letters indicate means which are significantly different (p < 0.05). n, number of independent experiments with each compound.

Results are shown as the relative amount of DA transported compared with control samples treated with Me2SO. Kinetics and dose analysis of transport reduction showed several similarities to the properties of phosphorylation responses. The PMA effect on transport occurred in the dose range of 1–10 μm (Fig. 7), and the time course of uptake reduction in response to treatment with PMA plus OA occurred within 2–3 min and plateaued by 10 min (Fig. 8). Saturation analysis of dopamine uptake following treatment with PMA plus OA showed that the effect on transport was produced by a reduction inV max with no significant change inK m (Fig. 9). In six experiments theK m for control and treated samples averaged 91.3 ± 18.2 and 78.3 ± 37.2 nm, respectively (p > 0.05), whereas control and treatedV max values were 139.7 ± 19.3 and 72.2 ± 5.8 pmol/min/mg protein (p < 0.05).Figure 8Time course of dopamine transport response to PMA plus okadaic acid.

This graph represents the averaged results from six experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess whether the reduced transport activity in response to PMA and OA was due to an alteration of Na+ electrochemical gradients across membranes, we examined the effects of these compounds on Na+-dependent transport of alanine (26Miller K.J. Hoffman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27351-27356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synaptosomes were treated with 10 μm PMA plus 10 μm OA or with vehicle, and aliquots of each were assayed in parallel for transport of [3H]DA or [3H]alanine. In four independent experiments, alanine transport in treated tissue was not significantly different from control transport (normalized uptake = 93.0 ± 4.4%, p > 0.05), whereas dopamine transport activity in the treated tissue was 62.8 ± 3.6% compared with control (p < 0.01). This indicates that the reduction in DA transport observed after treatment with PMA and OA is unlikely to be due to loss of transmembrane ion gradients or perturbations of membrane integrity. This report demonstrates that dopamine transporters expressed in brain undergo endogenous phosphorylation and characterizes the DAT phosphorylation and dephosphorylation properties. The appearance of phosphorylated DAT on gels is somewhat different from its appearance in photoaffinity labeling or Western blots, in which DAT is visualized as a broad, homogenous band. Although basally phosphorylated DAT had this appearance, PMA-stimulated DAT often exhibited reduced electrophoretic mobility. In some experiments, radiolabel was concentrated at the protein's trailing edge, with reduced label intensity at the leading edge (Figs. 1 and 3; Fig. 5,left), whereas in other experiments the appearance of the stimulated band remained more homogenous but displayed a discrete upward shift relative to the basal band (Fig. 4; Fig. 5,right). Many phosphoproteins migrate as doublets or triplets on gels and undergo phosphorylation-induced interconversion between forms, although the appearance of DAT in these experiments was not as distinct as a doublet. Despite this previously undescribed appearance, the immunoprecipitation specificity controls argue against the possibility that this reduced electrophoretic mobility phosphoprotein is a contaminant rather than DAT. The significance of this observation is at present unknown. The altered migration pattern may indicate the presence of multiple states of the protein, possibly differentially or preferentially phosphorylated forms. DAT was phosphorylated at a basal level in untreated synaptosomes, demonstrating the occurrence of spontaneous phosphate turnover on the protein. Okadaic acid and calyculin each increased the phosphorylation state of the protein severalfold, demonstrating that DAT undergoes robust in vivo dephosphorylation. The 5–10-min time course of the okadaic acid effect indicates that DATs undergo rapid and constitutive dephosphorylation. The 1–10 μm dose responses to okadaic acid and calyculin may indicate that protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) is a major DAT phosphatase, because these compounds inhibit protein phosphatases 1 and 2A at lower concentrations (31Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar). However, cyclosporin A, a protein phosphatase 2B-specific inhibitor (32Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1992; 70: 365-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), had no effect on DAT phosphorylation. These inconsistencies may reflect membrane permeability characteristics of the compounds and indicate the need for further work to clarify the identity of the phosphatase activities involved with DAT. Several lines of evidence indicate that the phosphorylation level of DAT is controlled by protein kinase C. DAT phosphorylation was strongly increased by PMA, OAG, and (−)-indolactam V, three different protein kinase C activators. Phosphorylation was not affected by the inactive phorbol ester 4αPDD, and the protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine and bisindoylmaleimide blocked PMA-induced increases in DAT phosphorylation. These results are strong evidence that activation of PKC leads to increased phosphorylation of DAT, although it is not known if PKC phosphorylates DAT directly or induces phosphorylation via a downstream event. PKC-induced increases occurred in the presence of okadaic acid, demonstrating that the effects of OA and PKC activators on phosphorylation are additive and indicating the potential forin vivo regulation of DAT phosphorylation to occur through alterations in activity levels of kinases, phosphatases, or both. In contrast to the results with PKC activators, treatment of synaptosomes with the PKA activators forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP did not induce DAT phosphorylation, indicating the lack of involvement of PKA with DAT. The possibility that dopamine transport activity is regulated by phosphorylation of DAT is indicated by the finding that dopamine uptake in synaptosomes was reduced by all treatments that promoted DAT phosphorylation. PMA and okadaic acid each reduced dopamine transport to about 87% of control values, and use of both compounds together resulted in further reduction to about 76% of control values, mimicking the additivity of these compounds on DAT phosphorylation. Uptake was also reduced by (−)-indolactam V and OAG, 4αPDD had no effect on uptake, and staurosporine and bisindoylmaleimide were both able to block PMA-induced reductions in transport activity. The reduction in uptake occurred with dose and time courses similar to those for phosphorylation and was produced by a reduction in transport V max with no apparent change in the K m for dopamine. The close correlation of phosphorylation and transport characteristics strongly suggests that dopamine transport activity is regulated by DAT phosphorylation. Results similar to these were found when mouse striatal synaptosomes were treated with OA, PMA, and diacylglycerol analogs (18Copeland B.J. Neff N.H. Hadjjonstantinou M J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 1996; 277: 1527-1532PubMed Google Scholar). However, PKA activators did not affect DA transport, consistent with our finding that PKA activators do not induce DAT phosphorylation. The possibility that the reduced dopamine transport obtained in these studies was a nonspecific effect produced by an alteration of transmembrane Na+ gradients has been addressed by several different approaches. Our results show that in synaptosomes and rDAT-LLC-PK1 cells (16Huff R.A. Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), Na+-dependent alanine transport was not altered by PMA and OA treatments that substantially reduced DA uptake. In addition, PMA does not affect synaptosomal viability or alter the activity of synaptosomal Na+-K+ ATPase, which controls transmembrane Na+ gradients (18Copeland B.J. Neff N.H. Hadjjonstantinou M J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 1996; 277: 1527-1532PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that it is unlikely that the phosphorylation activators examined in these studies are inducing alterations in Na+electrochemical gradients or affecting membrane integrity. The effects of these compounds on DA uptake therefore appear to be specific for DA transport and physiologically meaningful. Although these results strongly indicate that DAT activity is regulated by phosphorylation, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain to be elucidated. Possible modes of action include direct effects on substrate translocation or changes in DAT surface expression as has been found for heterologously expressed γ-amino butyric acid and serotonin transporters (22Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional aspects of DAT function such as ion flux or binding of cocaine or other uptake blockers may also be affected by phosphorylation. While the pathways controlling DAT phosphorylation in vivo remain to be elucidated, the finding that the diacylglycerol analog OAG stimulates DAT phosphorylation indicates the feasibility for involvement of phospholipase C-coupled receptors in phosphorylation of DAT, and the rapid kinetics of DAT phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are compatible with receptor-mediated actions. One possible control mechanism is by feedback through presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors. Although dopamine receptors have classically been characterized as coupling to cAMP production (33Schwartz J.-C. Giros B. Martres M.-P. Sokoloff P. Neurosciences. 1992; 4: 99-108Google Scholar), recent studies indicate that dopamine receptors can couple either positively (34Vallar L. Muca C. Magni M. Albert P. Bunzow J. Meldolesi J. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10320-10326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Undie A.S. Weinstock J. Sarau H.M. Freidman E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 2045-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or negatively (36Giambalvo C.T. Wager R.L. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with PKC pathways. The latter may be compatible with the observation that D2receptor agonists increase striatal dopamine transport (37Meiergerd S.M. Patterson T.A. Schenk J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). If activation of D2 receptors reduces PKC activity, DAT phosphorylation would be reduced and DA transport activity would be increased. Coupling of dopamine receptors to DAT phosphorylation would also provide a mechanism for cocaine involvement in regulation of transport activity via cocaine's effects on synaptic dopamine levels. It is also possible that other phospholipase C-coupled receptors may regulate DAT phosphorylation and that this may be a convergence point for multiple signaling pathways. Although the transport of many neurotransmitters is affected by protein kinase activators, until recently there has been little direct evidence that phosphorylation of transporter proteins mediates these effects. The most well documented example of neurotransmitter transporter phosphorylation is DAT, which has now been characterized as a phosphoprotein both in neuronal tissue and heterologous expression systems (16Huff R.A. Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 38Vrindavam N.S. Arnaud P. Ma J.X. Altman-Hamamdzic S. Parratto N.P. Sallee F.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 216: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of DATs in LLC-PK1cells displays activator, inhibitor, and kinetic characteristics that parallel those shown here for neuronal DATs, indicating that heterologous expression systems provide valid models for examining DAT phosphorylation and that results from studies such as deletion or site-directed mutagenesis using transfected DATs will be relevant to the neuronal form of the protein. Regulation of DA transport activity by phosphorylation would provide neurons with a previously unappreciated mechanism for fine temporal and spatial control of synaptic dopamine concentrations. Such functional regulation could have profound effects on the intensity and duration of dopaminergic synaptic transmission, actions of psychostimulant drugs, and mechanisms of neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration.

In previous work, we presented support for the hypothesis that the anti-transforming effects of FTIs depend upon alterations in the function of RhoB, a member of the Rho family of proteins that regulate cytoskeletal actin, cell adhesion, and cell growth. A significant question that needed to be addressed was whether FTIs could directly alter the prenylation as well as the function of RhoB in cells. This issue is complex because farnesylated and geranylgeranylated forms of RhoB (RhoB-F and RhoB-GG) both exist in cells. Here, we show that RhoB farnesylation in vitro can be catalyzed by protein farnesyltransferase and that the peptidomimetic FTIl-739,749 inhibits the farnesylation of RhoB both in vitro and in intact cells. In drug-treated cells, the level of RhoB-GG increased in parallel with the decrease in RhoB-F. In addition to altering RhoB prenylation, l-739,749 suppressed RhoB-dependent cell growth. Taken together, the results suggest that the inhibitory effects of FTIs on RhoB function can be mediated by a relative loss of RhoB-F, a gain of RhoB-GG, or both. Our findings strengthen the causal link between RhoB inhibition and the anti-transforming effects of FTIs and indicate that differently prenylated forms of RhoB may have unique functions.

Like Ras, Rho proteins are post-translationally modified by either farnesyl (C15) or geranylgeranyl (C20) isoprenoids at their C-terminal CAAX box sequence, where C is cysteine, A is generally an aliphatic amino acid, and X is usually methionine, serine, glutamine, or leucine (7Casey P.J.

FTase inhibitors (FTIs) were developed as potential anti-cancer therapeutics to exploit the farnesylation requirement of Ras for its oncogenic activity (9Gibbs J. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 175-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In support of this potential, FTIs have been shown to revert Ras-transformed cells to a normal phenotype and to cause dramatic tumor regression in animal models without significant toxicity (10Prendergast G.C.

However, inhibition of Ras farnesylation does not seem to fully explain their anti-transforming activity (5Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell.

We have previously presented evidence that inhibition of the Rho family member RhoB is a critical event in FTI-induced reversion of Ras-transformed cells (5Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). First, unlike most Rho proteins, which are solely geranylgeranylated in vivo, RhoB can be either farnesylated or geranylgeranylated in cells (13Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making it a reasonable candidate as an FTI target. Second, RhoB is up-regulated by growth factors and is weakly oncogenic (3Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jahner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Third, RhoB has a short half-life and therefore can be functionally depleted within the 18–24 h required by FTIs to induce phenotypic reversion (5Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10Prendergast G.C. Davide J.P. deSolms S.J. Giuliani E. Graham S. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4193-4202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, a dominant inhibitory form of RhoB mimics FTIs in its ability to inhibit Ras transformation (3Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a myristylated form of RhoB that functions independently of prenylation renders Ras-transformed cell resistant to FTI-induced reversion (5Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although the hypothesis was supported by these biological experiments, recent in vitro biochemical experiments raised the possibility that RhoB might not be a physiological substrate for FTase (15Armstrong S.A. Hannah V.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7864-7868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). If so, the effects of FTIs on RhoB activity would reflect an indirect rather than a direct effect. In an attempt to clarify this issue, we analyzed the ability of FTIs to inhibit RhoB farnesylationin vivo and in vitro. 1-[3H]Farnesyldiphosphate ([3H]FPP; 15 Ci/mmol), 1-[3H]-geranylgeranyldiphosphate ([3H]GGPP; 15 Ci/mmol), and [3H]mevalonolactone (60 Ci/mmol) and unlabeled FPP and GGPP were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). The HA-RhoB, HA-RhoBV14, and Myr-RhoBV14 constructs have been described previously (3Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). Standard polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis techniques were used to generate a C193S mutant designated HA-RhoBS, and all constructs were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). RhoB without an HA-epitope tag was cloned into pQE30 and pQE50 (Qiagen) for bacterial expression. Bacterial expression plasmids for H-Ras was a gift from Channing Der (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). Rat 1 growth curves were performed in 0.25% fetal calf serum as described (5Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). COS cells were co-transfected with 15 μg of RhoB and 5 μg of pMEV (a mammalian expression vector containing the cDNA for a mevalonate transporter) and labeled for 9 h with [3H]mevalonate in the presence or the absence of 15 μml-739,749. Aliquots of cell lysate were reserved for Western analysis, and the remainder was used for immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 using standard methods. Equivalent aliquots of each immunoprecipitate were analyzed for SDS-PAGE analysis and fluorography or for isoprenoid analysis. Total cellular protein (4 μg/lane) was fractionated via SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by standard methods. Anti-HA antibody, 12CA5, was used at 2.5 μg/ml, and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Boerhinger Mannheim) was used at 1:5000 dilution. A chemiluminescence kit was used for detection following the protocol recommended by the vendor (Pierce). Isoprenoids attached to the anti-HA immunoprecipitated proteins were determined by HPLC analysis of the methyl iodide cleavage product essentially as described previously (16Casey P.J. Soski P.A.

Recombinant FTase and GGTase-I were produced in Sf9 insect cells by infection with recombinant baculoviruses and purified as described (18Chen W.J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9675-9680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhang F.L. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23465-23470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant six-histidine (His6) fusion of RhoB was produced inEscherichia coli and purified using Ni2+affinity chromatography as described previously (20James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6221-6226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Untagged versions of RhoB and H-Ras were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (21Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Prenylation reactions were conducted at 37 °C and contained the following components in a final volume of 50 μl: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 μm ZnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% lubrol, 1 μm3H-FPP or 3H-GGPP (typically at 8 Ci/mmol), Ras or RhoB protein at concentrations in figure legends, and 50 ng of either FTase or GGTase-I. The reactions were processed as described previously (22Thissen J.A. Casey P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine whether FTIs inhibit the farnesylation of RhoB in intact cells, we examined the isoprenylation status of RhoB, introduced transiently into COS cells, in the presence and the absence of the peptidomimetic FTI, l-739,749 (10Prendergast G.C. Davide J.P. deSolms S.J. Giuliani E. Graham S. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4193-4202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected with HA-tagged versions of RhoB and RhoBS; the latter is a nonprenylatable C193S mutant that lacks an acceptor cysteine residue (13Adamson P. Marshall C.J. Hall A. Tilbrook P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20033-20038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The day after transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]mevalonate, an isoprenoid precursor, in the presence or the absence of 15 μml-739,749, which blocks FTase, but not GGTase-I, activity in treated cells (10Prendergast G.C. Davide J.P. deSolms S.J. Giuliani E. Graham S. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4193-4202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After labeling, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody. SDS-PAGE analysis of the immunoprecipitates revealed that HA-RhoB was labeled in both the presence and the absence ofl-739,749, whereas, as expected, RhoBS was not labeled under either condition (Fig. 1 A). Based on these results, we concluded that the total amount of isoprenoid transferred to RhoB in vivo was not significantly affected by l-739,749. To determine if l-739,749 treatment influenced RhoB farnesylation, the anti-HA immunoprecipitates used above were processed by cleavage of the isoprenoids from immunoprecipitated protein followed by reverse-phase HPLC to analyze isoprenoid moities released (Fig. 1 B). This analysis revealed thatl-739,749 completely inhibited farnesylation of RhoB, whereas geranylgeranylation of RhoB increased correspondingly. Taking into account that C-20 isoprenoid would incorporate radioactivity from four mevalonate molecules versus three for the C-15 isoprenoid, quantitation of the radioactivity in the farnesol and geranylgeraniol peaks revealed that the total amount of prenylated RhoB was conserved after treatment of cells with l-739,749. This observation explained why the extent of [3H]mevalonate labeling in immunoprecipitates from drug-treated and untreated cells was similar. We concluded that RhoB is solely geranylgeranylated in cells treated with l-739,749. The finding that farnesylation of RhoB was inhibited by treatment of cells with the FTase-selective inhibitorl-739,749 prompted us to re-examine the ability of this G protein to be recognized by the two CAAX prenyltransferases.In vitro prenylation assays were performed using purified recombinant FTase and GGTase-I and selected substrates for these enzymes (Fig. 2). The results of this analysis, which are summarized in Table I, revealed that in contrast to a previous report (15Armstrong S.A. Hannah V.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7864-7868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), farnesylation of RhoB could be catalyzed by both FTase and GGTase-I with approximately the same efficiency (V/K of 2.0 for each). In addition and also in contrast to the previous study, RhoB was a significantly better substrate for geranylgeranylation by GGTase-I (V/K of 30) than for farnesylation by the same enzyme (V/K of 2.0, as noted above). The basis for the discrepancy with previously reported results is unclear, but it is not due to differences in substrates used, because both His-tagged RhoB and untagged RhoB behaved similarly in the assays (data not shown).Table IKinetic analysis of RhoB prenylationEnzymeProteinIsoprenoidK mV maxV/Kl-739,749 IC50μmFTaseH-RasFPP0.37.0230.06FTaseRho BFPP3.06.02.00.06GGTaseRho BFPP1.02.02.0>20GGTaseRho BGGPP0.13.030>20 Open table in a new tab The finding that FTase was able to catalyze farnesylation of RhoB suggested a mechanism for the ability of the FTase-selective inhibitor l-739,749 to block this modification of RhoB in cells. However, it remained possible that the compound, although a poor inhibitor of geranylgeranylation by GGTase-I, might effectively inhibit the ability of this enzyme to transfer farnesyl group onto substrate proteins. To assess this possibility,l-739,749 was tested for its ability to inhibit farnesylation of RhoB by both GGTase-I and FTase in an in vitro assay. The results of this analysis, shown in Fig.3, indicate that, as expected for this FTase-selective inhibitor, l-749,739 was a poor inhibitor of reactions catalyzed by GGTase-I. The IC50 values for inhibition of both RhoB farnesylation and geranylgeranylation by GGTase-I was >20 μm, whereas farnesylation of the protein by FTase was inhibited with an IC50 of 0.06 μm, a similar IC50 as that determined for inhibition of FTase action on H-Ras. These findings, together with the finding that l-739,749 blocks RhoB farnesylation in intact cells, provides compelling evidence that RhoB farnesylation in vivo is mediated by FTase. Previously we have shown that stable expression of RhoB in Rat1 cells stimulates their proliferation and allows them to grow to a greater saturation density (5Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To test whether inhibition of RhoB farnesylation compromises its growth-stimulating function, we investigated the effects ofl-739,749 on the growth characteristics of Rat 1 cells stably expressing RhoB constructs. Pooled cell populations stably transfected with either constitutively activated RhoB (RhoBV14), a myristylated form of activated RhoB (Myr-rhoBV14), or vector have been described previously (5Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The Myr-rhoBV14 construct has been shown to function similar to RhoBV14; however, its function is independent of farnesylation. As observed previously, the RhoBV14 and Myr-rhoBV14 cell populations grew faster and to a greater saturation density than the control cell population in the absence ofl-739,749 (Fig. 4). Growth curves determined in the presence of 5 μml-739,749 revealed that the growth rate and saturation density of RhoBV14-expressing cells decreased significantly, whereas that of cells containing vector or Myr-rhoBV14 was comparatively less affected (Fig. 4). Cell counts for vector and Myr-rhoBV14 cells were reduced by ∼12% in the presence of l-739,749, consistent with the slight suppression of cell growth of normal Rat1 cells seen previously (10Prendergast G.C. Davide J.P. deSolms S.J. Giuliani E. Graham S. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4193-4202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, cell counts for RhoBV14 cells treated withl-739,749 were decreased ∼35%. This result implied that either farnesylated RhoB had a specific growth stimulatory activity that geranylgeranylated RhoB could not replace or that increased levels of geranylgeranylated RhoB was growth inhibitory. We concluded thatl-739,749 attenuated the growth stimulatory function of RhoB as well as selectively inhibiting its farnesylation. Among prenylated proteins, RhoB provides an exception to the simple rules for prenylation because its CAAX box (CKVL) suggests that it should be geranylgeranylated but not farnesylated. Although previous in vitro work suggested that GGTase-I transfers both isoprenyl groups, our data argue that the GGTase-I farnesylation of RhoB is not physiologically relevant. Thus, the apparent inability of GGTase-I to farnesylate RhoB when the latter is expressed in an intact cell is also consistent with a recent report showing that CAAX prenyltransferases exhibit a very strong preference for utilization of their “correct” isoprenoid if presented both prenyldiphosphates (23Yokoyama K. Zimmerman K. Scholten J. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3944-3952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that RhoB is not a particularly good substrate for FTase in vitro, it appears that this enzyme is able to mediate farnesylation of RhoB in vivo. This report significantly strengthens our hypothesis that RhoB inhibition forms the basis for the anti-transforming effects of FTIs. (5Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 24Lebowitz P. Sakamuro Prendergast G.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 708-713PubMed Google Scholar). Initial biochemical data suggested that RhoB might not be farnesylated by FTase, so the effect of FTIs could have been indirect. We reconciled these data by showing that RhoB farnesylation and growth-stimulatory function are indeed directly blocked by FTI treatment. An interesting implication of our results is that farnesylated RhoB and geranylgeranylated RhoB may not be functionally interchangeable. Consistent with the results presented in this report, we have previously shown that FTI treatment alters the cellular localization of RhoB (5Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6613-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), suggesting that the differently prenylated forms of the protein may act at different subcellular locations. Our data suggest that farnesylation, but not geranylgeranylation, of RhoB is critical for Ras transformation. Although simple models for understanding how FTIs reverse cell transformation and cause tumor regression propose that the drugs act by loss of function of a farnesylated protein, our studies on RhoB open the possibility that FTIs could act instead by a gain of function effect, by preferentially inducing the accumulation of geranylgeranylated RhoB. Further investigation is needed to determine (i) whether the ratio or level of differently prenylated RhoB species can affect cell growth and transformation and (ii) whether loss of farnesylated RhoB, gain of geranylgeranylated RhoB, or both represent the key trigger for FTI-induced reversion.

We also thank Channing Der (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill) for expression plasmids for H-Ras."
https://openalex.org/W2015784090,"The PSD-95/SAP90 family of PDZ-containing proteins is directly involved in the clustering of specific ion channels at synapses. We report that channel clustering depends on a conserved N-terminal domain of PSD-95 that mediates multimerization and disulfide linkage of PSD-95 protomers. This N-terminal multimerization domain confers channel clustering activity on a single PDZ domain. Thus, channel clustering depends on aggregation of PDZ domains achieved by head-to-head multimerization of PSD-95, rather than by concatenation of PDZ domains in PSD-95 monomers. This mechanism predicts that PSD-95 can organize heterogeneous membrane protein clusters via differential binding specificities of its three PDZ domains. PSD-95 and its relative chapsyn-110 exist as disulfide-linked complexes in rat brain, consistent with head-to-head multimerization of these proteins in vivo."

Four trans-acting factors encoded by the male-specific lethal genes are required for this process. Dosage compensation is restricted to males by the splicing regulator Sex-lethal, which functions to prevent the production of the MSL-2 protein in females by an unknown mechanism. In this report, we provide evidence that Sex-lethal acts synergistically through sequences in both the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of MSL-2 to mediate repression. We also provide evidence that the repression of MSL-2 is directly regulated by Sex-lethal at the level of translation."
https://openalex.org/W2065635189,"Dopaminergic, interplexiform amacrines (DA cells) were labeled in transgenic mice with human placental alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme that resides on the outer surface of the cell membrane. It was therefore possible to investigate their activity in vitro after dissociation of the retina with whole-cell current and voltage clamp, as well as their connections in the intact retina with the electron microscope. DA cells generate action potentials even in the absence of synaptic inputs. This activity is abolished by the amacrine cell transmitters GABA and glycine, which induce an inward current carried by chloride ions, and is stimulated by kainate, an agonist at the receptor for the bipolar cell transmitter glutamate, which opens nonselective cation channels. Since DA cells are postsynaptic to amacrine and bipolar cells, we suggest that the spontaneous discharge of DA cells is inhibited in the dark by GABAergic amacrines that receive their input from off-bipolars. Upon illumination, the GABA-inhibition is removed, DA cells generate action potentials, and their firing is modulated by the excitation received from on-bipolars."
https://openalex.org/W1992815766,"Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) can act as an antioxidant or a pro-oxidant in vitro, depending on the absence or the presence, respectively, of redox-active metal ions. Some adults with iron-overload and some premature infants have potentially redox-active, bleomycin-detectable iron (BDI) in their plasma. Thus, it has been hypothesized that the combination of AA and BDI causes oxidative damage in vivo. We found that plasma of preterm infants contains high levels of AA and F2-isoprostanes, stable lipid peroxidation end products. However, F2-isoprostane levels were not different between those infants with BDI (138 ± 51 pg/ml, n = 19) and those without (126 ± 41 pg/ml, n = 10), and the same was true for protein carbonyls, a marker of protein oxidation (0.77 ± 0.31 and 0.68 ± 0.13 nmol/mg protein, respectively). Incubation of BDI-containing plasma from preterm infants did not result in detectable lipid hydroperoxide formation (≤10 nm cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides) as long as AA concentrations remained high. Furthermore, when excess iron was added to adult plasma, BDI became detectable, and endogenous AA was rapidly oxidized. Despite this apparent interaction between excess iron and endogenous AA, there was no detectable lipid peroxidation as long as AA was present at >10% of its initial concentration. Finally, when iron was added to plasma devoid of AA, lipid hydroperoxides were formed immediately, whereas endogenous and exogenous AA delayed the onset of iron-induced lipid peroxidation in a dose-dependent manner.

Oxidative damage to biomolecules has been implicated as a causal factor in several human diseases (1Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5446) Google Scholar). For example, retinopathy of prematurity and chronic lung disease in preterm infants have been attributed, in part, to oxidative injury (2Warner B.B. Wispe J.R. Semin. Perinatol. 1992; 16: 47-57PubMed Google Scholar). Premature infants may be particularly susceptible to oxidative injury because they are exposed to high levels of oxidants and/or their antioxidant defenses are immature (2Warner B.B. Wispe J.R. Semin. Perinatol. 1992; 16: 47-57PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gutteridge J.M.C. Stocks J. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Med. 1981; 14: 257-329Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 4Sosenko I.R.S. Frank L. Am.

The significance of oxidative damage to lipids in preterm infants with respiratory distress is supported by the observations that these infants exhale increased levels of volatile lipid peroxidation products, which is directly correlated with poor respiratory outcome and death (5Pitkänen O.M.

Interestingly, preterm infants are born with high plasma AA concentrations, which drop precipitously soon after birth (11Gopinathan V. Miller N.J. Milner A.D. Rice-Evans C.A.

Cancer Lett. 1995; 94: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is well known that in the presence of redox-active iron, AA can act as a pro-oxidant in vitro and contribute to the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which in turn may cause lipid, DNA, or protein oxidation (20Samuni A. Aronovitch J. Godinger D. Chevion M. Czapski G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 137: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus, Silvers et al. have suggested that high plasma concentrations of AA in preterm infants are harmful because of the presence of BDI in some of these infants (21Silvers K.M. Gibson A.T. Powers H.J. Arch. Dis. Child. 1994; 71: F40-F44Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, there is considerable controversy as to whether vitamin C supplementation in individuals with high iron status and/or BDI in plasma is deleterious because it may cause oxidative damage to biomolecules (15Berger H.M. Mumby S. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radical Res. 1995; 22: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Herbert, V., Shaw, S., and Jayatilleke, E. (1996) J.

Ferrari M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study, therefore, was to determine whether the combination of BDI or excess iron and high concentrations of AA in plasma is associated with increased lipid and protein oxidationin vivo and in vitro. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, and the Clinical Research Committee of the Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA. Twenty-nine infants with a gestational age of less than 34 weeks born at either hospital were enrolled in the study. Mean gestational age and birth weight were 29 weeks and 1390 grams, respectively (see also Table I). There were no exclusion criteria based on maternal, pregnancy, or perinatal history. Umbilical cord blood samples were drawn into heparinized tubes (Vacutainer® PST™Gel and Lithium Heparin, Becton Dickinson, Rutherford, NJ) immediately after birth. After centrifugation of the blood samples at 1000 ×g for 5 min and 4 °C, the plasma was collected and stored at −70 °C until analysis (up to six months). Blood samples from five adult, nonsmoking, healthy volunteers acting as controls were collected by venipuncture and processed and stored in identical fashion.Figure 1Ascorbic acid oxidation and cholesteryl ester hydroperoxide formation in plasma of preterm infants (panels A–C) and adult controls (panel D). Pooled samples were prepared as described in the text and incubated at 37 °C for 8 days. Aliquots were withdrawn at time intervals and analyzed for ascorbic acid (○) and cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides (•) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Levels of BDI and maximal rates of ascorbic acid oxidation and rates of lipid peroxidation are given in Table II. Panels A, B, and C are incubations of preterm I, II, and III samples (Table II), respectively, and panel D is an incubation of the adult sample (Table II). Lipid peroxidation is expressed as the ratio of cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides (CEOOH) to total cholesteryl esters (CE). Levels of CE (in mm) were as follows: 3.58 (A), 4.17 (B), 3.27 (C), and 5.48 (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ICharacteristics of preterm infants and plasma levels of bleomycin-detectable iron, ascorbic acid, and markers of oxidative damage in preterm infants with and without BDI and adult controlsSamplenGestational ageWeightBDIAscorbic acidF2-isoprostanesProtein carbonylsweekgμmμmpg/mlnmol/mg proteinInfants with BDI (I)1929.4 ± 2.11320 ± 3200.75 ± 0.70161 ± 60138 ± 510.77 ± 0.31Infants without BDI (II)1029.8 ± 2.01425 ± 420not detected160 ± 51126 ± 410.68 ± 0.13Adult controls (III)5NANAnot detected73 ± 2138 ± 100.58 ± 0.10P values, I vs.IINSNS<0.0001NSNSNSP values, I vs.IIINANA<0.0001<0.01<0.001NSP values, II vs.IIINANANS<0.02<0.01NSValues shown are the means ± standard deviation. n, number of subjects; NA, not applicable; NS, not significant (p > 0.05).

Halliwell B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Serum total iron and latent iron-binding capacity (LIBC, unbound iron) were measured by spectrophotometric analysis using a commercial kit (Sigma procedure 565). This procedure is based upon the determination of iron with ferrozine as described by Persijn et al. (26Persijn J.P. van der Silk W. Riethorst A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1971; 35: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Total iron-binding capacity (total iron + LIBC) and transferrin saturation (total iron: total iron binding capacity) were calculated from these measured values. Plasma levels of nonesterified F2-isoprostanes, stable end products of lipid peroxidation, were measured by gas chromatography negative ion chemical ionization/mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring (27Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Protein carbonyls were determined as described by Lyras et al. (28Lyras L. Evans P.J. Shaw P.J. Ince P.G. Halliwell B. Free Rad. Res. 1995; 24: 397-406Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For AA determination, plasma (50 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of 5% (w/v) metaphosphoric acid containing 1 mmD,l-dithiothreitol, centrifuged, and the supernatant analyzed by paired-ion reverse-phase HPLC with electrochemical detection at an applied potential of +0.6 V (9Frei B. England L. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). For lipid hydroperoxide analysis, plasma (100 μl) was extracted with 1 ml of methanol and 5 ml of hexane. The hexane phase was collected and evaporated under nitrogen, and cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides were quantitated by reverse-phase HPLC with chemiluminescence detection (29Frei B. Yamamoto Y. Niclas D. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The two-sample Student'st-test was used to compare plasma concentrations of AA, F2-isoprostanes, and protein carbonyls in preterm infants with and without BDI and in adults. Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate correlations between gestational age, BDI, AA, F2-isoprostanes, and protein carbonyl levels. Statistical significance was accepted if the null hypothesis was rejected at the p < 0.05 level. To investigate the role of BDI in oxidative damage in vivo, we obtained plasma samples from 29 preterm infants and 5 adult controls. BDI was found in plasma of 19 (66%) preterm infants (mean ± SD, 0.75 ± 0.70 μm, range 0.02–5.0 μm) and was not detected in any of the adult control samples (Table I). Plasma concentrations of AA and nonesterified F2-isoprostanes, but not protein carbonyls, were significantly higher in preterm infants than in adults (Table I). There were no significant differences in the levels of AA, F2-isoprostanes, and protein carbonyls between preterm infants with and without BDI (Table I). For all preterm infants (n = 29), multivariate regression analysis revealed that F2-isoprostanes were positively correlated with gestational age (p = 0.002) and AA (p = 0.02), suggesting a pro-oxidant role of AA. However, subgroup analysis of preterm infants with and without BDI showed that the correlation between F2-isoprostanes and AA was not statistically significant in either group. In addition, in those infants with BDI there was no statistically significant correlation between F2-isoprostane and BDI levels. These data suggest that the high plasma concentrations of F2-isoprostanes in preterm infants are not a direct consequence of the presence of BDI nor a pro-oxidant interaction between BDI and AA. Conversely, the data also do not provide support for an antioxidant role of AA in these infants. To study the interactions between BDI, AA, and lipids in plasma, selected samples from preterm infants with high (>0.5 μm), low (0.08–0.5 μm) or nondetectable BDI levels were pooled. Plasma samples from adults with relatively high AA levels were also pooled. BDI levels in the pooled samples were re-determined (Table II). Although F2-isoprostanes could be detected (see Table I), none of the samples contained detectable amounts (≤10 nm) of cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides. It should be noted that F2-isoprostanes are stable end products of lipid peroxidation (27Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that authentic lipid hydroperoxides cannot be detected (≤10 nm) in plasma of healthy adults (29Frei B. Yamamoto Y. Niclas D. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), in contrast to nonesterified F2-isoprostanes, which are usually present at levels of about 0.1 nm or 35 pg/ml (see Table I and Ref. 27Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For further details, see legend to Fig. 1. n, number of plasma samples pooled. The pooled plasma samples were incubated at 37 °C for 8 days, and concentrations of AA and lipid hydroperoxides (cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides) were followed. As shown in Fig. 1(A–D), AA was depleted in all samples over the first 4 days of incubation. The maximal absolute rate of AA oxidation was lowest in the adult control sample, and it was higher and apparently related to BDI levels in the samples from premature infants (Table II). However, the fractional AA oxidation rates were not different between the three samples from premature infants (Table II), indicating that the varying absolute rates are a reflection of the initial AA concentrations and not the different BDI levels. In all incubations, there was initially no detectable lipid peroxidation (Fig. 1). Interestingly, in the samples from preterm infants, lipid hydroperoxides became detectable before the complete consumption of AA, but the time point at which detectable lipid peroxidation began was not related to BDI levels (Fig.1, A–C). In adult plasma, the completion of AA oxidation coincided with the onset of detectable lipid peroxidation (Fig.1 D), in agreement with our previous data (8Frei B. Stocker R. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9748-9752Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 9Frei B. England L. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Once started, lipid peroxidation in all samples occurred at a rate not related to BDI levels (Table II). The above findings suggest that neither BDI itself nor an interaction between BDI and AA causes lipid oxidative damage in plasma. To further investigate these notions, we added iron (in the form of ferrous ammonium sulfate) to heparinized plasma from a healthy adult male at concentrations below, near, or above the latent iron-binding capacity (LIBC). When iron was added at levels exceeding the LIBC of the plasma sample (40.9 μm), transferrin was 100% saturated, and BDI became detectable (Table III). Interestingly, the sample to which 33 μm iron had been added also contained BDI, although transferrin was only 80% saturated (Table III). This finding is in agreement with previous observations that in plasma of some hemochromatosis patients and preterm infants, BDI is present even when transferrin is not fully iron-saturated (13Evans P.J. Evans R. Kovar I.Z. Holton A.F. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 30Aruoma O.I. Bomford A. Polson R.J. Halliwell B. Blood. 1988; 72: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the control plasma sample without added iron and the sample to which 16 μm iron had been added, no BDI was detected, and transferrin saturation was < 50% (Table III).Table IIIIron status of adult plasma supplemented in vitro with different concentrations of iron(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2BDITotal ironLIBCTIBCTransferrin saturationμmμmμmμmμm%0ND11.440.952.321.816ND26.227.954.148.4330.3643.710.654.380.5501.4158.9054.8100752.3181.6059.91001004.66105.7065.9100Ferrous ammonium sulfate hexahydrate [(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 · 6H2O] was added to plasma at the concentrations indicated in the first column, and BDI, total iron, latent iron-binding capacity (LIBC), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (%) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In order to minimize dilution of the plasma, the added volume of the (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 stock solution was ≤2% (v/v) of the final volume. For further details, see legend to Fig. 2. ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Ferrous ammonium sulfate hexahydrate [(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 · 6H2O] was added to plasma at the concentrations indicated in the first column, and BDI, total iron, latent iron-binding capacity (LIBC), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (%) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In order to minimize dilution of the plasma, the added volume of the (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 stock solution was ≤2% (v/v) of the final volume. For further details, see legend to Fig. 2. ND, not detected. The above plasma samples were incubated at 37 °C, and AA consumption and lipid hydroperoxide formation were followed. In the control sample, AA was oxidized slowly (t½ = 34.7 h), and lipid peroxidation began after AA had been depleted (Fig.2), in agreement with the above data (Fig.1 D). In the samples containing added iron below the LIBC, AA was oxidized more rapidly (t½ = 4.3 h), and lipid hydroperoxides were detected earlier than in the control incubation (Fig. 2). When iron was added above the LIBC, a dramatic increase in the rate of AA oxidation was observed (t½ = 5.7 min), and detectable lipid peroxidation started within the first 2 h of incubation. Despite the presence of ≥1.4 μm BDI in these samples (Table II), however, there was initially no detectable lipid peroxidation, and lipid hydroperoxides were formed only after >90% of endogenous AA had been depleted (Fig. 2). The amount of lipid hydroperoxides formed in each sample at the end of the incubation was directly related to the amount of added iron (Fig. 2 B) but not BDI nor the initial AA concentration, which was the same in all samples. These data indicate that the added iron interacted with AA, causing its rapid oxidation; however, despite this apparent interaction AA did not exert a pro-oxidant effect toward lipids but rather prevented detectable lipid peroxidation until its depletion. Finally, to conclusively show that AA acts as an antioxidant, not a pro-oxidant, in plasma containing excess iron, normal adult plasma was either treated with ascorbate oxidase (to oxidize endogenous AA), left untreated, or supplemented with 200 μm AA, resulting in AA concentrations of <1, 58, and 260 μm AA, respectively. These samples were incubated at 37 °C with 33 or 75 μm added iron. In confirmation of the above data (Fig.2 A), the rate of AA oxidation was higher in the presence of 75 than 33 μm iron (t½ = 8.3 min and 2.6 h, respectively, for the sample containing 58 μmAA and 22.4 min and 2.2 h, respectively, for the sample containing 260 μm AA). Importantly, those plasma samples containing the highest levels of AA were most effectively protected against lipid peroxidation, whereas in those samples devoid of detectable AA, lipid peroxidation began immediately after the addition of iron (Fig.3, A and B). These data demonstrate that AA inhibits rather than promotes iron-induced lipid peroxidation in plasma. The aim of this study was to determine whether AA in conjunction with BDI or excess iron acts as a pro-oxidant in human plasma in vivo and in vitro. To this end, we compared BDI and AA concentrations in plasma of 29 preterm infants and 5 adult controls with the levels of nonesterified F2-isoprostanes and protein carbonyls, in vivo markers of lipid and protein oxidative damage, respectively. In addition, we measured AA oxidation and lipid hydroperoxide formation in incubations of pooled plasma samples from preterm infants, as well as adult plasma to which iron had been added. In all these studies we consistently observed that in plasma containing BDI or excess iron, vitamin C does not act as a pro-oxidant toward lipids or proteins; to the contrary, it strongly inhibits lipid peroxidation in vitro. BDI is a form of potentially redox-active iron present in plasma of some human neonates and certain adult patients, which has been suggested to cause oxidative damage to biomolecules in vivo(13Evans P.J.

We found BDI in plasma of 19 out of 29 preterm infants, and the concentrations were comparable with those reported by Evanset al. (13Evans P.J. Evans R. Kovar I.Z. Holton A.F. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) but somewhat lower than those reported by other investigators for preterm infants (14Moison R.M.W. Palinckx J.J.S. Roest M. Houdkamp E. Berger H.M. Lancet. 1993; 341: 79-82Abstract PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Berger H.M. Mumby S. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radical Res. 1995; 22: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Plasma AA concentrations were significantly higher in preterm infants than in adults, consistent with studies showing higher plasma AA concentrations in neonates than their mothers (11Gopinathan V. Miller N.J. Milner A.D. Rice-Evans C.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 12Berger T.M. Rifai N. Avery M.E. Frei B.

The observed mother-infant gradient is likely the result of an active placental AA transport (31Streeter M.L. Rosso P. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1981; 34: 1706-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Choi J.-L. Rose R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C110-C113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, plasma levels of F2-isoprostanes were more than 3-fold higher in preterm infants than adults. These data suggest that preterm infants are under increased oxidative stress, which could be due to increased generation of oxidants and/or decreased antioxidant defenses. Compromised antioxidant defenses in human neonates have been previously described and attributed to low activities of antioxidant enzymes (4Sosenko I.R.S. Frank L. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: R693-R698PubMed Google Scholar) or low concentrations of vitamin E (33Jain S.K. Semin. Hematol. 1989; 26: 286-300PubMed Google Scholar), transferrin (34Lindeman J.H.N. Houdkamp E.

Lab. Med. 1981; 14: 257-329Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that there may be increased generation of oxidants in premature infants due to the presence of BDI and high concentrations of AA (13Evans P.J. Evans R. Kovar I.Z. Holton A.F. Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Moison R.M.W. Palinckx J.J.S. Roest M. Houdkamp E. Berger H.M.

Free Radical Res. 1996; 25: 439-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We observed a statistically significant positive correlation between F2-isoprostanes and AA in all preterm infants. However, if AA were to act as a pro-oxidant, this correlation should be observed only in those infants with BDI, which was not the case. In addition, F2-isoprostane and protein carbonyl levels were not different between preterm infants with and without BDI. These observations do not support the notions that AA acts as a pro-oxidant in preterm infants and that BDI causes oxidative damage in vivo (14Moison R.M.W. Palinckx J.J.S. Roest M. Houdkamp E. Berger H.M. Lancet. 1993; 341: 79-82Abstract PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Berger H.M. Mumby S. Gutteridge J.M.C.

Conclusive evidence that AA does not act as a pro-oxidant toward lipids in plasma containing BDI or excess iron, and in fact acts as an antioxidant, is provided in the present paper by three different types of experiments: (i) Incubation of plasma from preterm infants containing BDI does not result in detectable lipid hydroperoxide formation as long as AA concentrations are high (Fig. 1, Aand B). (ii) When iron is added to adult plasma in amounts exceeding the LIBC, BDI is detected, and the rate of AA oxidation is increased dramatically. However, despite this apparent interaction between AA and added iron, detectable lipid peroxidation is prevented as long as AA is present at >10% of its initial concentration (Fig.2). (iii) Iron-induced lipid peroxidation in plasma is inhibited, not promoted, in a concentration-dependent manner by AA (Fig.3). These findings are in agreement with our previous observations that AA strongly inhibits iron- and copper-induced oxidation of low density lipoprotein, presumably by destroying metal-binding sites on apolipoprotein B-100 (35Retsky K.L. Freeman M.W. Frei B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1304-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Retsky K.L. Frei B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1257: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 37Martin, A., and Frei, B. (1997) Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., in press.Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which AA prevents iron-induced lipid peroxidation in plasma may involve the inhibition of iron-binding to plasma lipoproteins. In addition, it has been reported that the simultaneous presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+is required for the initiation of lipid peroxidation and that there is no lipid peroxidation as long as AA is present at concentrations high enough to keep iron in the reduced state (38Miller D.M. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem Biophys. 1989; 27: 113-119Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism would explain, at least in part, the antioxidant activity of AA in the presence of excess iron observed in the present study. However, the notion that both Fe2+ and Fe3+ are required for initiation of lipid peroxidation has been disputed (39Aruoma O.I. Halliwell B. Laughton M.J. Quinlan G.J. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Our data are in close agreement with those of Minetti and colleagues (24Minetti M. Forte T. Soriani M. Quaresima V Menditto A. Ferrari M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), who found that addition of iron to plasma in excess of the LIBC leads to rapid AA oxidation but not formation of hydroxyl radicals, as monitored by spin trapping epr spectroscopy. Even when these researchers attempted to promote hydroxyl radical formation in iron-overloaded plasma by adding hydrogen peroxide and azide, the latter an inhibitor of plasma ferroxidase (Fe2+ → Fe3+) and catalase activities, no spin trap adducts with hydroxyl radicals were formed (24Minetti M. Forte T. Soriani M. Quaresima V Menditto A. Ferrari M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The authors speculated, therefore, that iron in excess of the amount bound to transferrin may not support the formation of hydroxyl radicals or that hydroxyl radicals were formed but effectively scavenged at their site of formation by plasma constituents, particularly proteins, before they could react with the spin trap molecules (24Minetti M. Forte T. Soriani M. Quaresima V Menditto A. Ferrari M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A similar interpretation was suggested by Gutteridge et al. (17Gutteridge J.M. Rowley D.A. Griffiths E. Halliwell B. Clin. Sci. ( Lond. ). 1985; 68: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), who were unable to detect hydroxyl radical formation in serum of a hemochromatosis patient containing 19.4 μm BDI, a very high concentration of BDI. It is interesting to note that numerous studies have reported hydroxyl radical formation and/or stimulation of lipid peroxidation by plasma or other biological fluids containing BDI (16Gutteridge J.M.C. Rowley D.A. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17Gutteridge J.M. Rowley D.A. Griffiths E. Halliwell B. Clin. Sci. ( Lond. ). 1985; 68: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Carmine T.C. Evans P. Bruchelt G. Evans R. Handgretinger R. Niethammer D. Halliwell B. Cancer Lett. 1995; 94: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40Kaur H. Halliwell B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but all of these studies have used diluted or ultrafiltered samples. Such conditions significantly alter the protein concentration and antioxidant capacity of these fluids and also lead to the redistribution of iron (18Grootveld M. Bell J.D. Halliwell B. Aruoma O.I. Bomford A. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4417-4422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results obtained by these studies, therefore, are unlikely to reflect reactions occurring in these fluidsin vivo. In contrast, in the present study using nondiluted plasma we did not find evidence for a pro-oxidant role of BDI itself or in combination with AA, and in vitro AA clearly acted as an antioxidant, not a pro-oxidant, toward lipids in iron-overloaded plasma. It remains possible, of course, that pro-oxidant effects are exerted upon other biomolecules, such as DNA. We thank Dr. Urs Rüttimann for help with the statistical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1987162287,"Previously, our laboratory reported that lactosylceramide (LacCer) stimulated human aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation via specific activation of p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the p21 ras /Raf-1/MEK2 pathway and induced expression of the transcription factor c-fos downstream to the p44 MAPK signaling cascade (Bhunia A. K., Han, H., Snowden, A., and Chatterjee S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 10660–10666). In the present study, we explored the role of free oxygen radicals in LacCer-mediated induction of cell proliferation. Superoxide levels were measured by the lucigenin chemiluminescence method, MAPK activity was measured by immunocomplex kinase assays, and Western blot analysis and c-fos expression were measured by Northern blot assay. We found that LacCer (10 μm) stimulates endogenous superoxide production (7-fold compared with control) in human aortic smooth muscle cells specifically by activating membrane-associated NADPH oxidase, but not NADH or xanthine oxidase. This process was inhibited by an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), and by antioxidants,N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. NAC and DPI both abrogated individual steps in the signaling pathway leading to cell proliferation. For example, the p21 ras ·GTP loading, p44 MAPK activity, and induction of transcription factor c-fos all were inhibited by NAC and DPI as well as an antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or reduced glutathione (GSH). In contrast, depletion of GSH byl-buthionine (S,R)-sulfoximine up-regulated the above described signaling cascade.In sum, LacCer, by virtue of activating NADPH oxidase, produces superoxide (a redox stress signaling molecule), which mediates cell proliferation via activation of the kinase cascade. Our findings may explain the potential role of LacCer in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis involving the proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells.

Our findings may explain the potential role of LacCer in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis involving the proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,2Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2434-2440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cell mobility (3Sadahira Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S.I. Igarashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 89: 9686-9690Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and programmed cell death (apoptosis) (4Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannum Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Lactosylceramide (LacCer), a ubiquitous GSL, has been implicated in diverse biological functions (5Hakomori S.I. Kanfer J.N. Hakomori S.I. Spingolipid Chemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 52-53Google Scholar). For example, we have found that LacCer exhibits a time- and concentration-dependent proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMC) (1Chatterjee S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because proliferation of smooth muscle cells is considered a hallmark in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, we previously measured the levels of LacCer and other GSLs in human subjects who had this disease. We found that the levels of LacCer and glucosylceramide were markedly higher in the plaque and calcified plaque than in unaffected aorta from patients who died from atherosclerosis at The Johns Hopkins Hospital (6Chatterjee S. Dey S. Shi W.Y. Thomas K. Hutchins G.M. Glycobiology. 1996; 7: 57-65Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, we observed that LacCer stimulated the activation of p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p44 MAPK) and the expression of the transcription factor c-fos (7Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10660-10666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which perhaps regulates the genes essential for cell proliferation. Moreover, upstream activators of p44 MAPK; p21 ras, Raf, and MEK2, but not MEK1, are involved in the activation of p44 MAPK by LacCer. Although our findings suggested that LacCer stimulated this kinase cascade, it is unclear whether LacCer itself or second messengers generated by LacCer are responsible for the activation of this signaling cascade. A class of highly diffusible and ubiquitous molecules, termed reactive oxygen species, has recently been recognized to act as signaling intermediates for cytokines including interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (8Tiku M.A. Liesch J.B. Robertson F.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 690-696PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) encompass species such as superoxide (O·̄2), hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, and hydroxyl radicals (10Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4464) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress, which is an excess production of ROS, plays a role in different pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis and cancer (11Guyton K.Z. Kensler T.W. Br. Med. Bull. 1993; 49: 523-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 12Kehrer J.P. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1993; 23: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). In addition, O·̄2 has numerous effects on cell function including induction of growth, regulation of kinase activity, and inactivation of endothelial derived relaxation factor, nitric oxide (13Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3429) Google Scholar, 14Larsson R. Cerutti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17452-17458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus superoxide and its metabolites can function as intracellular and intercellular second messengers, transducing receptor stimulation into biochemical response. Because they are very small, rapidly diffusible, and highly reactive, free radical and redox stress are now thought to participate in cellular signaling (13Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3429) Google Scholar, 15Staal F.J.T. Anderson M.T. Staal G.E. Herzenberg L.A. Gitler C. Hergenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Current evidence indicate that the different stimuli use reactive oxygen species as signaling messengers to activate transcription factors and induce gene expression (17Puri P.L. Avantaggiati M.L.

The functional role of GSLs, particularly LacCer, in generating free oxygen radicals has not been reported to the best of our knowledge. In the present study, we found that LacCer stimulated the generation of O·̄2 via activation of NADPH oxidase in H-ASMC. Alteration in the redox status by the LacCer-dependent production of O·̄2 stimulated the loading of GTP to Ras, p44 MAPK activation, c-fos expression, and cell proliferation. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 mCi/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [32P]orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4) (carrier-free) and [3H]thymidine were purchased from Amersham Life Science Inc. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI) obtained from LC Laboratories. Glycosphingolipids and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Bovine erythrocyte membrane-derived LacCer was a gift from Prof. T. Taki (Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan). Human plaque intima-derived LacCer was prepared in our laboratories. The purity of glycosphingolipids (>99%) was assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography and/or high pressure thin layer chromatography. Anti-p21 ras antibody and anti-MAPK antibody (Specific for p44 MAPK and p42 MAPK) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake placid, NY). cDNAs for c-fos and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were a generous gift from Prof. Daniel Nathans (The Johns Hopkins University) and Dr. D. Dewitt (Department of Biochemistry, Michigan State University), respectively. The polyethyleneimine TLC plates were purchased from E. M. Separations (Gibbstown, NJ). H-ASMC were prepared and cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum; penicillin (100 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (50 μg/ml), according to the procedure of Ross (19Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Isolation, purification, characterization, and quantitation of LacCer from human atherosclerotic plaque intima was pursued according to the standard published protocol in our laboratory (6Chatterjee S. Dey S. Shi W.Y. Thomas K. Hutchins G.M. Glycobiology. 1996; 7: 57-65Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Stock solution of LacCer were prepared in chloroform-methanol (1:2, v/v), dried under a stream of nitrogen, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and added to culture medium to give the desired concentrations of LacCer. Cells incubated with 0.01% Me2SO served as a control. PMA, staurosporine, or DPI stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C until use. Aqueous solutions of NAC and allopurinol were prepared either in medium or in buffer. Lucigenin, an acridylium compound (Sigma) that emits light upon reduction and interaction with O·̄2, was used to measure O·̄2 production (20Gyllenhammer H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 97: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured H-ASMC were harvested, and cell pellets were suspended in a balanced salt solution (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 35 mm phosphoric acid, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The viability of the suspended cells as determined by the trypan blue exclusion principle was >90%. To measure O·̄2 production, intact cells preincubated at room temperature were added to a 96-well plate containing dark-adapted lucigenin (500 μm) in balanced salt solution. Next, LacCer was added to it as a stimulant, and photon emission was measured every 20 s for 10 min in a scintillation counter (Packard TOP counter). The GSL solutions (dissolved in Me2SO) were added to cells to reach a final concentration of Me2SO of 0.01%. Moreover, vehicle (0.01% Me2SO) served as a control in most experiments. The amount of O·̄2 produced at each time point was calculated by comparison with a standard curve generated using xanthine/xanthine oxidase. H-ASMC were incubated with 10 μmLacCer, and control cells were incubated with Me2SO (final concentration 0.01%). In some experiments, cells were preincubated with 100 μg/ml BSO, an inhibitor of de novo GSH synthesis, followed by incubation with 10 μm LacCer. At various time intervals cells were harvested, and cell pellets were suspended in a solution of 25% metaphosphoric acid and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), sonicated for 10 min, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for the GSH assay fluorometrically at 420 nm (excitation wave length 350 nm) using o-phthalialdehyde (Sigma) as a fluorescence reagent (21Hissin P.J. Hilf R. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (3720) Google Scholar). Confluent H-ASMC were incubated with 10 μm LacCer. At different time intervals, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate- buffered saline, harvested, and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mmEGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The membrane (both plasma membrane and mitochondrial membrane) and cytosol was prepared by centrifugation of cell homogenate at 29,100 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C (22Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Membrane was resuspended in the original volume of lysis buffer. NADH and NADPH oxidase activity was measured in both cytosolic and membrane fraction as described previously by the lucigenin chemiluminescence method (22Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm sucrose, and 500 μm lucigenin as the electron acceptor and either 100 μm NADPH or 100 μm NADH as an electron donor. The reaction was initiated by the addition of membrane homogenate (150–200 μg of protein). Luminescence was monitored as described above. In some experiments, NADPH oxidase activity was measured in the membrane preparations in the presence of 1 mm KCN (mitochondrial poison). Protein content was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 256-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin serving as a standard. ASMC were lysed in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmpepstatin, 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, and Nonidet P-40. The lysate was centrifuged and immunoprecipitated with anti-MAP kinase antibody conjugated with protein A-agarose as described earlier (7Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10660-10666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Part of the immunocomplex was directly used for the MAP kinase activity assay (24Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μl of total reaction mixture contained 1 mg/ml myelin basic protein (peptide APRTPGGRR), 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1800 cpm/pmol), 0.5 mm adenosine 3′-5′-cyclic monophosphate-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, and assay dilution buffer containing 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, and 2–3 μg of immunoprecipitated protein. The reaction was initiated upon the addition of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C and terminated with the addition of 10 μl of ice-cold 40% trichloroacetic acid and spotted onto p81 phosphocellulose paper. Free [γ-32P]ATP was removed by five washes (5 min each) with 1% phosphoric acid. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Immunocomplexes, prepared as described above, were subjected to electrophoresis in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein was then transferred onto a polyvinylidine membrane and blotted with anti-MAP kinase antibody as described previously (7Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10660-10666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). H-ASMC were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free media for 16 h as described previously (7Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10660-10666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and incubated with 10 μm LacCer with or without antagonists. At different time points, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with human p21 ras antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were washed, and bound nucleotides (GTP and GDP) associated with p21 ras were eluted with 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% SDS, 0.5 mm GTP, and 0.5 mm GDP at 68 °C for 20 min as described (25Downward J. Grages J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The eluted nucleotides were separated on polyethyleneimine TLC plates using 0.75 mKH2PO4 (pH 3.4) as a solvent and then exposed to an x-ray film. Total cellular RNA was isolated from H-ASMC that had been preincubated with 15 mm NAC for 30 min, 5 μm diphenylene iodonium for 30 min, 100 μg/ml l-buthionine (S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) for 4 h, followed by stimulation with 10 μm LacCer for 1 h prior to RNA extraction (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63230) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) formaldehyde), transferred to a ζ-probe blotting membrane (Bio-Rad), and hybridized with32P-labeled c-fos cDNA probes as described. As a control, the blot was stripped off and reprobed with32P-labeled cDNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase analysis and photographed. H-ASMC were incubated with different antagonists with or without LacCer (10 μm) for 24 h. Next, [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/ml media) was added. After incubation for 2 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine in H-ASMC was measured as described previously (1Chatterjee S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase activity in the culture medium was measured as described (1Chatterjee S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Intact H-ASMC were incubated with different GSLs and their constituent sugars as indicated. Only LacCer induced the generation of O·̄2 (Fig. 1). Other GSLs and constituents did not stimulate the O·̄2 generation in ASMC (Fig. 1) up to a concentration of 200 μm (data not shown). LacCer stimulated O·̄2 production in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 A) as measured by the lucigenin chemiluminescence assay. Maximal generation of O·̄2 (7-fold increase as compared with control) was observed with 10 μm LacCer. Kinetic analysis revealed that the lucigenin chemiluminescence signal was maximal (7-fold) at 2.5 min and then decreased to about 4.5-fold at 30 min (Fig. 2 B). To examine the specific effect of LacCer in the stimulation of O·̄2generation, we incubated H-ASMC with two additional sources of LacCer. Bovine erythrocyte membrane LacCer (LacCer(E)) or LacCer derived from human atherosclerotic plaque intima (LacCer(P)) (Fig. 1) both exerted a concentration- (Fig. 2 C) and time- (Fig. 2 D) dependent stimulation of O·̄2 production with similar kinetics as stearoyl LacCer (Fig. 2, A andB). To test whether the membrane integrity of cells was lost upon incubation of cells with LacCer, we measured LDH activity in the culture medium. No increase of LDH activity was observed in culture medium up to 50 μm LacCer in the incubation mixture (Fig.2 E). These data indicate that membrane integrity was intact during LacCer- (10 μm) induced O·̄2generation.Figure 2Generation of O·̄2 in intact H-ASMC and the effect on membrane integrity after incubation of cells with LacCer.

But NAC or PDTC, both cell-permeable antioxidants (28Hockenberg D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3296) Google Scholar), abrogated lucigenin signals (O·̄2 production) in control cells and in cells incubated with LacCer (Fig. 3 A). The addition of LacCer (10 μm) to cell homogenate (before subcellular fractionation) also generated O·̄2 (Fig. 3 B). This phenomenon was blocked by the addition of 100 units/ml SOD (Fig. 3 B) or 15 mm NAC or 100 μm PDTC (Fig.3 C). Intracellular level of GSH was decreased in a time-dependent manner by LacCer (Fig. 4 A). A low level of GSH was observed upon incubation of cells with BSO (100 μg/ml) and also with BSO plus LacCer (Fig. 4 A). The level of GSH was also decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in cells incubated with BSO only (Fig. 4 B). Concomitantly, the basal level of O·̄2 was high (1.1 nmol/mg of protein) (Fig. 4 C) in cells preincubated with 100 μg/ml BSO, an inhibitor of de novo GSH synthesis, (15Staal F.J.T. Anderson M.T.

Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 24 h. Moreover, chemiluminescence signals (O·̄2 production) were further increased (about 8-fold compared with control) upon incubation of BSO-preincubated cell with LacCer (Fig. 4 C). At various time points, following stimulation of H-ASMC with LacCer, NADPH oxidase activity was measured in a plasma membrane preparation with NADPH as a co-factor. NADPH oxidase activity in control cells (vehicle only) was 2.9 ± 0.03 nmol/min/mg of protein but was increased 4-fold within 2.5 min, as compared with control (Fig. 5 A). NADPH oxidase activity was 3-fold higher in cells incubated with LacCer at 10 min compared with control. The mitochondrial poison KCN did not inhibit LacCer-induced NADPH oxidase activity (data not shown). Preincubation of LacCer-stimulated plasma membrane preparations with 5 μm DPI, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (30Ruppersberg J.P. Stocker M. Pongs O. Heinemann S.H. Frank R. Koenen M. Nature. 1991; 352: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 31Lo Y.Y.C. Wong J.M.S. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15703-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), completely abrogated LacCer stimulated NADPH oxidase activity (Fig.5 A). No NADPH oxidase activity was observed in cytosolic fraction (Fig. 5 B). No stimulation of NADH oxidase activity was observed in LacCer-stimulated cytosol or in membrane preparation (Fig. 5 C). An addition of exogenous LacCer after the isolation of plasma membrane preparations of nonstimulated cells did not alter NADPH oxidase activity (data not shown). These findings suggest that LacCer induced generation of O·̄2 due to the activation of NADPH oxidase. To ascertain that LacCer-mediated O·̄2 production is due to the activation of NADPH oxidase and not NADH oxidase, we measured O·̄2 generation in intact cells preincubated with DPI (5 μm) prior to stimulation with LacCer. DPI completely inhibited LacCer-mediated O·̄2 generation (Fig. 6 A). A moderate inhibition of O·̄2 production also occurred in control cells incubated with DPI (Fig. 6 A). The addition of staurosporine (STP), a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, or depletion of protein kinase C by treatment of cells with PMA (100 nm) for 24 h (32Nakadate T. Jeng A.V. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1541-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Bhunia A.K. Sarker D. Das P.K. J. Eukariot. Microbiol. 1996; 43: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) failed to impair the LacCer-mediated stimulation of O·̄2 production (Fig. 6 B). The contribution of xanthine oxidase in O·̄2 generation in LacCer-stimulated H-ASMC was examined next. Incubation of cells with 100–200 μmallopurinol, a specific inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (34Friedl H.P. Till G.O. Ryan U.S. Ward P.A. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2512-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 35Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not inhibit O·̄2 production by LacCer (Fig. 6 C). These observations suggested that LacCer-induced O·̄2 generation was dependent on NADPH oxidase but independent of PKC or xanthine oxidase. Western blot assay employing antibody against p42 MAPK and p44 MAPK followed by densitometric scan (scan data not shown) revealed that LacCer specifically stimulated the phosphorylation of p44 MAPK approximately 3.5-fold as compared with control (Fig. 7 A). H-ASMC pretreated with 15 mm NAC for 30 min or 100 μm PDTC for 1 h or 15 mm GSE for 4 h abrogated LacCer-induced p44 MAPK phosphorylation. However, BSO, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis (by inhibiting GSH-synthesizing enzyme, γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase) (15Staal F.J.T. Anderson M.T. Staal G.E. Herzenberg L.A. Gitler C. Hergenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3619-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 29Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stimulated the phosphorylation of p44 MAPK approximately 2-fold. Co-incubation of cells with BSO plus LacCer had an additive effect on the phosphorylation of p44 MAPK. LacCer also stimulated the activity of MAPK approximately 3.5-fold as compared with control (Fig.7 B). In contrast, NAC, DPI, PDTC, GSE, and GSH abrogated LacCer-induced MAPK activity. Incubation of cells with BSO stimulated MAPK activity about 2-fold compared with control. Co-incubation of cells with BSO and LacCer only moderately stimulated MAPK activity (4-fold) further, as compared with LacCer alone (3.5-fold) (Fig.7 B). LacCer exerted a time-dependent stimulation of Ras·GTP loading compared with control. Maximum stimulation of Ras·GTP loading occurred 1 min after incubation of cells with LacCer (Fig. 8 A). NAC and DPI both abrogated LacCer-induced Ras·GTP loading (Fig. 8, B andC). In contrast, cells preincubated with BSO alone showed significant (above base-line value) (Fig. 8 D) Ras·GTP loading. Co-incubation of cells with BSO and LacCer exerted further effects on Ras·GTP loading within 1 min, and loading was sustained at this high level for 2.5 min (Fig. 8 E). This observation indicates that free radicals are involved in LacCer-mediated Ras activation. Northern blot assay revealed that LacCer increased the c-fos mRNA levels approximately 4-fold (densitometric scan not shown) compared with control (Fig. 9). This phenomenon was abrogated by NAC and DPI. In contrast, BSO had a moderately additive effect on the LacCer-mediated induction of c-fos mRNA levels in H-ASMC. Interestingly, LacCer did not alter the mRNA levels of c-jun and c-mycin H-ASMC (7Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol"

We cloned the vibrator mutation using an in vivo positional complementation approach and complete resequencing of the resulting 76 kb critical region from vibrator and its parental chromosome. The mutation is an intracisternal A particle retroposon insertion in intron 4 of the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein α gene, causing a 5-fold reduction in RNA and protein levels. Expression of neurofilament light chain is also reduced in vibrator, suggesting one signaling pathway that may underlie vibrator pathology. The vibrator phenotype is suppressed in one intercross.

https://openalex.org/W2021248045,"A putative vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) was overexpressed in developing Xenopus spinal neurons by injection of rat VAChT cDNA or synthetic mRNA into Xenopus embryos. This resulted in a marked increase in the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents at neuromuscular synapses, reflecting an over 10-fold increase in the vesicular packaging of acetylcholine (ACh). The effect appeared in developing neurons even before synaptogenesis and was blocked by L-vesamicol, a specific blocker of ACh uptake into synaptic vesicles. Mutational studies showed that two highly conserved aspartate residues within putative transmembrane domains 4 and 10 are essential for the transport activity. These results provide direct evidence for the physiological function of a putative VAChT and demonstrate that quantal size can be regulated by changes in vesicular transporter activity."
https://openalex.org/W2123422722,"Several oxidative DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation, can generate multiply damaged sites in DNA. Among the postulated lesions are those with abasic sites located in close proximity on opposite strands. The repair of an abasic site requires strand scission by a repair endonuclease such as human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (Ape) or exonuclease III inEscherichia coli. Therefore, a potential consequence of the “repair” of bistranded abasic sites is the formation of double-strand breaks. To test this possibility and to investigate the influence of the relative distance between the two abasic sites and their orientation to each other, we prepared a series of oligonucleotide duplexes containing abasic sites at defined positions either directly opposite each other or separated by 1, 3, or 5 base pairs in the 5′- or 3′-direction. Analysis following Ape and exonuclease III treatment of these substrates indicated a variety of responses. In general, cleavage at abasic sites was slower in duplexes with paired lesions than in control duplexes with single lesions. Double-strand breaks were, however, readily generated in duplexes with abasic sites positioned 3′ to each other. With the duplex containing abasic sites set 1 base pair apart, 5′ to each other, both Ape and exonuclease III slowly cleaved the abasic site on one strand only and were unable to incise the other strand. With the duplex containing abasic sites set 3 base pairs apart, 5′ to each other, Ape protein was unable to cleave either strand. These data suggest that closely positioned abasic sites could have several deleterious consequences in the cell. In addition, this approach has allowed us to map bases that make significant contact with the enzymes when acting on an abasic site on the opposite strand.

The cytotoxic effects of many agents are believed to be the result of damage to DNA. In addition to producing isolated DNA base and deoxyribose lesions, several important antineoplastic agents, including ionizing radiation and drugs such as bleomycin and neocarzinostatin, can generate clustered lesions or locally multiply damaged sites (LMDS) 1The abbreviations used are: LMDS, locally multiply damaged site(s); AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; Ape, human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease; bp, base pair(s); GST, glutathioneS-transferase; dU, deoxyuridine. located within one or two helical turns (1Prise K.M.

Such LMDS may be critical lesions in the DNA as they present an additional challenge to the repair machinery of the cell. One type of LMDS, the DNA double-strand break, has been the subject of considerable study and is considered to contribute significantly to cytotoxicity (6Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 7Illiakis G. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, the biological consequences of other types of LMDS, such as 2 modified bases or two abasic sites close to each other, require further investigation. A great deal will depend on if and how these lesions are recognized by the initial damage recognition enzymes. In the case of abasic sites, the enzymes that recognize these lesions and cleave the DNA have been classified according to mechanism. The major apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) DNA repair endonuclease in human cells is Ape (8Demple B. Herman T. Chen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) or HAP1 (9Robson C.N. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5519-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The major AP endonuclease of Escherichia coli is the multifunctional enzyme exonuclease III (10Rogers S.G. Weiss B. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Both enzymes, which share several structural and functional similarities, cleave the phosphodiester bond in duplex DNA immediately 5′ to the abasic site and are thus classified as class II AP endonucleases (11Linn S.M. Linn S.M. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985: 59-83Google Scholar). E. coli endonuclease III, on the other hand, cleaves DNA 3′ to an abasic site via a β-elimination mechanism and has therefore been classified as a class I AP endonuclease or AP lyase. An important potential outcome of cleavage of closely opposed abasic sites would be the production of double-strand breaks. Data regarding the enzymatic fate of abasic sites as components of more complex lesions are relatively sparse. Recent physicochemical measurements of an oligonucleotide duplex with a bistranded abasic site were suggestive of a structure in which the lesion forms an extrahelical loop (12Gelfand C.A. Plum G.E. Grollman A.P. Johnson F. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 439-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may explain the earlier observation that abasic sites on opposite strands reduce the efficiency of strand cleavage by Ape (13Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and exonuclease III (14Takeuchi M. Lillis R. Demple B. Takeshita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21907-21914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that bistranded abasic sites site-specifically placed in shuttle vectors and transfected into E. coli and COS-7 simian cells appear to be highly mutagenic (15Takeshita M. Eisenberg W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All these studies, however, were restricted to stable synthetic analogues of deoxyribose, such as tetrahydrofuranyl groups, placed directly opposite each other. Povirk and Houlgrave (16Povirk L.F. Houlgrave C.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), on the other hand, examined the enzymatic cleavage of abasic sites generated within the complex lesions induced by bleomycin and neocarzinostatin. They observed that considerably higher concentrations of E. coli exonuclease III (but not endonuclease III) were required to effect DNA cleavage at these lesions in comparison to the more spatially isolated abasic sites generated by heat depurination. We have previously modeled LMDS using plasmid DNA constructs containing site-specific bistranded dihydrothymine lesions and abasic sites and studied the response of the glycosylase and AP lyase activities ofE. coli endonuclease III toward such damage (17Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). With substrates containing modified bases set 1 and 3 bp apart, the enzyme was able to remove only one of the dihydrothymines and cleave the resulting abasic site, thereby generating a single-strand break. Treatment of the substrates containing two abasic sites, however, readily yielded double-strand breaks. It was thus possible to infer that the glycosylase activity of endonuclease III, but not the AP lyase activity, is inhibited by the presence of a closely positioned break in the opposite strand. In this work, we have extended our modeling of LMDS by preparing oligonucleotide duplexes with bistranded natural abasic sites (i.e.2-deoxy-d-erythro-pentofuranose) set various distances apart and have examined the reactivity of human Ape protein and E. coli exonuclease III with this type of clustered lesion. T4 polynucleotide kinase was supplied by U. S. Biochemical Corp. Uracil-DNA glycosylase was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and Epicentre Technologies. (One unit of uracil-DNA glycosylase catalyzes the release of 1 nmol of free uracil from [3H]poly(dU) in 1 h at 37 °C.) Endonuclease III (fraction IV) was purified from strain λN99C1857 carrying the pHIT1 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. R. P. Cunningham, State University of New York, Albany, NY) according to the procedure of Asahara et al. (18Asahara H. Wistort P.M. Bank J.F. Bakerian R.H. Cunningham R.P.

The concentration of the original stock of GST fusion protein was 500 μg/ml (100,000 units/ml). For our purposes, the enzyme was diluted to 7 μg/ml in enzyme reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 50% glycerol. This protein stock, which was stable at −20 °C for several months, was further diluted to achieve the desired protein concentrations. Oligonucleotides (23- or 28-mers) containing deoxyuridine (dU) at various positions (see Table I) were synthesized by the DNA Synthesis Core Facility at the University of Alberta. Oligonucleotides were purified according to Sambrook et al.(22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.23-11.28Google Scholar). Briefly, after the electrophoresis of synthetic oligonucleotides on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, the bands containing the oligonucleotides were located, using a fluorescent Merck Silica Gel 60 F254 thin-layer chromatography plate (Brinkmann Instruments) and UV illumination from above in a Brinkmann Chromato-Vue (Model CC 20) apparatus, and excised. The gel slices were crushed, and the oligonucleotides were eluted in a buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 0.5 m ammonium acetate, and 10 mmmagnesium acetate at 37 °C for 12 h in a shaker incubator. The solution was filtered through a Millex HV filter (0.45 μm Millipore Corp.), and oligonucleotides were isolated from a Waters reversed-phase Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. The oligonucleotides (10 pmol) were labeled at the 5′-end with 15 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase in the reaction buffer provided by the enzyme supplier (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol; 10 mCi/ml; Amersham Corp.) at 37 °C for 30 min. Labeled oligonucleotides were purified by ethanol precipitation (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.23-11.28Google Scholar), and a sample was run on a 16% polyacrylamide gel to verify their size and purity.Table IDNA sequences of oligonucleotide duplexesDuplexSequence1-aX designates a dU or an abasic site.

Open table in a new tab For each oligonucleotide duplex, two separate hybridizations were carried out, either with labeled top or bottom strand (see Table I). The unlabeled strand was always in 2-fold molar excess in the hybridization reaction. The oligonucleotides were taken up in uracil-DNA glycosylase buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) and heated for 10 min at 60 °C. The hybridization was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1 h, followed by the addition of 1–3 units of uracil-DNA glycosylase/20–30 pmol of oligonucleotide. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the oligonucleotides were precipitated at 0 °C for 30 min with 4 volumes of 5 m ammonium acetate and 12.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. The removal of uracil from the DNA was confirmed by monitoring the cleavage at the abasic sites by gel electrophoresis after incubation of the oligonucleotide with 0.5 m NaOH at 37 °C for 1 h or with endonuclease III (6 ng of enzyme/10 pmol of oligonucleotide) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 1 h. To minimize nonspecific cleavage at the abasic sites, vortexing, vigorous pipetting, and freezing/thawing of the oligonucleotides were avoided. Oligonucleotide duplex substrates (2.5 × 105 cpm, ∼1 pmol) were incubated at 37 °C with 70 pg (unless otherwise indicated) of GST-Ape fusion protein in enzyme reaction buffer (13Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 30 μl. Aliquots were removed at various times, and the reaction was stopped on ice by the addition of an equal volume of gel loading buffer containing 90% formamide, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 2.5 mm EDTA. Approximately 5 × 104 cpm (0.2 pmol) of the oligonucleotide duplex were incubated with different amounts of exonuclease III in 66 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol in a final volume of 10 μl at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped on ice by the addition of an equal volume of gel loading buffer. The reaction products were analyzed on a 1.5-mm-thick 16% polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea. The gel was run at 25 V/cm for 3 h, and after scanning in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Imager™ GS-250 system, Bio-Rad), the cleavage products were quantified with Molecular Analyst™ software (Bio-Rad). The bands corresponding to the reaction products and uncleaved material were also excised from the gel after autoradiography. The radioactivity in each gel band was determined with a Beckman Model LS 5801 liquid scintillation counter. A typical gel is shown in Fig. 1. The streak of radioactivity lying between the full-length (23-mer) oligonucleotides and the labeled cleaved products is the result of chemical decomposition at the abasic site occurring during gel electrophoresis. For the purpose of calculating the percentage cleavage, the radioactivity in the streak was added to the radioactivity in the band of uncleaved oligonucleotide. A panel of oligonucleotides (23- or 28-mers) with dU residues at unique sites were synthesized and annealed to their complementary strand to form duplexes. Each duplex contained either a single dU or paired dU nucleosides. The paired dU nucleosides were either sited directly opposite each other or separated by 1, 3, or 5 bp in the 5′- and 3′-directions. The sequences of these duplexes are given in Table I. The unlabeled strand in the duplex was always in molar excess compared with the labeled strand to enhance the hybridization of the labeled strand. The duplexes were treated with uracil-DNA glycosylase to remove the incorporated uracil and thus create abasic sites at these positions. To assess the extent of uracil removal, the oligonucleotide duplexes were subjected to alkali or endonuclease III treatment to induce quantitative cleavage at the abasic sites. (An example of NaOH and endonuclease III analysis for duplex F+A is shown in Fig.5 C.) In accordance with the observation of Eftedal et al. (23Eftedal I. Guddal P.H. Slupphaug G. Volden G. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the efficiency of enzymatic release of uracil was dependent on sequence context. In duplexes F+A, F+K, G+A, H+K, and M+N, the uracils were resistant to uracil-DNA glycosylase and therefore required the use of 3 units of enzyme to effect >90% removal. The subsequent percent cleavage of abasic sites after incubation of these substrates with Ape protein and exonuclease III was normalized according to the available AP sites in each substrate. Oligonucleotide duplexes B+A, F+K, G+K, H+K, and M+N containing a single AP site at various positions (Table I) served as controls. These substrates were incubated with 70 pg of Ape protein for various periods of time, and the percent cleavage at the AP sites was determined after electrophoresis of reaction products on a polyacrylamide gel (see “Experimental Procedures”). The rate of cleavage in these substrates is shown in Fig. 2. With all substrates except H+K, the enzyme rapidly cleaved the oligonucleotide, resulting in >50% cleavage after 5 min of incubation. The cleavage rate of duplex H+K was slow, probably due to the close proximity of the AP site to the 3′-terminus of the oligonucleotide. When cleavage of a longer duplex (M+N; Table I) containing an AP site in the same sequence context as in duplex H+K but farther from the 3′-terminus was examined, the rate of scission matched closely that of the other substrates. Substrates C+A (AP sites directly opposite each other), D+A (AP sites 1 bp apart), and E+A (AP sites 3 bp apart) were incubated with Ape protein, and the degree of oligonucleotide incision was determined at various time points. Two reactions were carried out with each duplex, with only one strand labeled in each reaction, thus permitting the monitoring of cleavage of both strands. Hydrolysis of the strands of duplex E+A is shown as an example in Fig. 1, where the labeled strand is marked with anasterisk. The kinetics of cleavage of these substrates are presented in Fig. 3 A. Substrate B+A, with a single abasic site, is included for comparison. Although cleavage rates were universally slower for the abasic sites in duplexes with bistranded lesions than for the control, there appeared to be no strong influence of distance between the lesions. The rate of incision of substrates F+A (AP sites 1 bp apart), G+A (3 bp apart), and H+A (5 bp apart) resulting from incubation with 70 pg of Ape protein is shown in Fig. 3 B. There is clearly a marked difference between the enzyme response to bistranded lesions in this orientation compared with lesions displaced 3′ to each other. In substrate F+A, strand F was not cleaved even after 1 h of incubation, whereas only ∼30% of strand A could be cleaved during this incubation period. Even more striking was the inability of Ape to incise either AP site in substrate G+A. When the distance between the abasic sites was extended to 5 bp in substrate H+A, we observed a near-normal rate of cleavage for strand A, but no scission of strand H. The slow cleavage of strand H in the control substrate, H+K (Fig. 2), suggested that the lack of strand H cleavage in duplex H+A was in part attributable to the proximity of the abasic site in strand H to the 3′-terminus of the oligonucleotide. This was confirmed when incubation of Ape with the longer duplex, M+L, resulted in substantial cleavage of strand M, although notably still less than scission of strand L, or strand M in the control duplex M+N (Fig.3 C). The refractory nature of the abasic sites in duplexes F+A and G+A was further evaluated by incubation with 210 and 700 pg of the enzyme (data not shown). Incubation of substrate F+A with 210 pg of Ape protein resulted in ∼70% cleavage of strand A, but 700 pg of the enzyme were required to cleave strand F to ∼40% after 1 h of incubation. Incubation of substrate G+A with 700 pg of the enzyme resulted in 30–35% cleavage of AP sites in each strand. To rule out the possibility that the inability of the enzyme to cleave AP sites in substrates F+A and G+A was an artifact due to interference from the glutathione S-transferase component of the fusion protein, the cleavage of these substrates was re-examined using the clipped (GST-free) protein. The substrates, including the control substrate B+A, were incubated with an equal number of units (0.014 units) of GST-Ape and clipped Ape protein for 30 min, and the percent cleavage was determined. The results (Fig. 4) indicate little difference in response between the two forms of the enzyme. We carried out a similar analysis with E. coliexonuclease III in which the substrates were treated with increasing quantities of enzyme. To suppress the exonucleolytic activity of the enzyme, CaCl2 was substituted for MgCl2 in the incubation buffer (14Takeuchi M. Lillis R. Demple B. Takeshita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21907-21914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, some exonucleolytic activity was still evident, especially with the higher concentrations of exonuclease III. Examples of the responses are presented in Fig. 5(A and B). Fig. 5 A shows a comparison of cleavage of strand A with three different complementary oligonucleotides, whereas Fig. 5 B contrasts the incision of the abasic sites in duplex F+A. Fig. 5 C shows the result of cleavage of strand F by endonuclease III (En) or NaOH (Alk) used to measure the induction of abasic sites. (Endonuclease III cleavage generates 3′-termini with 4-hydroxy-2-pentenal phosphate groups, whereas NaOH generates these termini as well as termini with unmodified 3′-phosphate groups, hence the doublet of products seen in the Alk lane.) Analysis of the percent cleavage of the various oligonucleotide duplexes (Fig. 6) demonstrated the following. (i) The rates of scission of all the bistranded lesion-containing duplexes were slower than those of the controls, but varied greatly from one duplex to the next. (ii) Direct opposition of the abasic site (duplex C+A) did not lead to a sharp reduction in the cleavage of either abasic site. (iii) Of those constructs with lesions lying 3′ to each other, the most marked effect was seen with duplex D+A, where the abasic sites were 1 bp apart. (iv) Of the constructs with lesions lying 5′ to each other, the most resistant to enzyme-induced scission was duplex F+A (abasic sites 1 bp apart), with the abasic site in strand F being even more resistant than the opposing abasic site. Of the wide variety of DNA lesions generated by ionizing radiation, double-strand breaks are considered to be the predominant lesion responsible for cell lethality (6Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). However, in addition to the double-strand breaks initially induced by radiation, double-strand breaks can arise after the cessation of irradiation (24Bonura T. Smith K.C. Kaplan H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4265-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Dugle D.L. Gillespie C.J. Chapman J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Ahnstrom G. Bryant P.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1982; 41: 671-676Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and are most likely due to repair of closely opposed damaged or missing bases or damaged/missing bases opposite single-strand breaks. Theoretical calculations (e.g. Refs. 27Brenner D.J. Ward J.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1992; 61: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar and 28Goodhead D. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) and recent experimentation (e.g. Refs. 1Prise K.M. Davies S. Michael B.D. Radiat. Res. 1993; 134: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and 3Milligan J.R. Ng J.Y.-Y. Wu C.C.L. Aguilera J.A. Fahey R.C. Ward J.F. Radiat. Res. 1995; 143: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have indicated that a single deposition of energy from ionizing radiation can lead to the formation of two or more DNA lesions (single-strand break or base damage/loss) within one to two helical turns. In an earlier study (17Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we examined the capacity of E. coli endonuclease III, a well characterized DNA glycosylase/AP lyase, to generate double-strand breaks in substrates containing bistranded base lesions (dihydrothymine). The present study has focused on the major AP endonuclease in human and E. coli cells and their response to bistranded abasic sites. Our data clearly indicate that, for both enzymes, the oligonucleotide constructs elicited a marked variation in response, which was dependent on the distance between the abasic sites and their orientation to one another. If thesein vitro observations reflect the repair responses in human and bacterial cells, this class of locally multiply damaged site would have several deleterious consequences. First, the bistranded abasic sites in most of the configurations that were examined, especially those oriented 3′ to each, gave rise to double-strand breaks when treated with either of the AP endonucleases. Thus, in the cell, such lesions would be anticipated to contribute to lethality caused by double-strand breaks. Second, the reaction of duplex F+A with Ape and exonuclease III generated a single-strand break opposite an endonuclease-resistant abasic site. Third, abasic sites with the configuration seen in duplex G+A are both resistant to the human AP endonuclease. Since unrepaired AP sites represent a potent class of premutagenic lesions (29Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), the latter configuration of bistranded abasic sites must be considered to have a high mutagenic potential unless cells can respond to such endonuclease-resistant abasic sites by an alternative mechanism (e.g. the SOS response in E. coli). In addition to contributing to our understanding of the possible biological consequences of bistranded lesions, this investigation has afforded information regarding the physical interactions between the endonucleases and DNA. The strategy of changing the location of one abasic site while keeping the other constant (strand A or L) in each duplex has allowed us to map at least some of the bases on the opposite strand that strongly interact with the enzymes when acting on the constantly positioned abasic site (Fig. 7). This is a similar approach to the “missing thymine site interference assay” used by Devchand et al. (30Devchand P.R. McGhee J.D. van de Sande J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3437-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to map thymines essential for binding of the lac repressor to the lac operator. Exonuclease III and Ape cleave abasic sites in double-stranded DNA far more efficiently than in single-stranded substrates (31Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 32Shida T. Noda M. Sekiguchi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4572-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); thus, reduction of activity toward a substrate with abasic sites could be due to either partial denaturation of the substrate or loss of interaction with a specific base. Data on denaturation caused by paired abasic sites, although limited, do suggest that there is sufficient denaturation to alter enzyme activity. For example, paired abasic sites set 1 and 3 base pairs apart cause sufficient destabilization to allow the single strand-specific nuclease, S1 nuclease, to induce double-strand breaks (33Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3805-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The analysis of a duplex with abasic sites situated directly opposite each other demonstrated a melting temperature 12 °C lower than the duplex lacking an abasic site (12Gelfand C.A. Plum G.E. Grollman A.P. Johnson F. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 439-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Partial denaturation may therefore be responsible for the modest decrease in the rate of incision by both enzymes of duplexes C+A, D+A, and E+A (Figs. 3 A and 6). In the case of duplexes F+A and G+A with Ape and duplex F+A with exonuclease III, the resistance of the substrates to cleavage is much more severe, suggesting a strong interaction with the missing base. Inspection of the B-form of the DNA helix reveals that the bases missing in duplexes F+A and G+A are situated close to each other across the minor groove. (Those in duplexes D+A and E+A face each other across the major groove.) In their model of exonuclease III/DNA interaction based on x-ray crystallographic data, Mol et al. (34Mol C.D. Kuo C.-F. Thayer M.M. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) proposed two minor groove binding domains that would make significant contact with the DNA: the first involving Arg-90 and Lys-36 interacting with the phosphate backbone while Tyr-63 stacks with the sugar ring of the deoxyribose and the second being the βV-βVIloop. While no x-ray crystallographic model has been published for Ape, we would predict a similar interaction with possibly even more extensive contact with bases in the minor groove given the greater resistance to Ape than to exonuclease III demonstrated by duplex G+A. A recent methylation interference analysis of Ape interaction with a synthetic oligonucleotide duplex carrying an abasic site on one strand displayed a substantial interference signal from an adenine two nucleotides 5′ to the abasic site (equivalent to the guanine lying between the two thymines marked in Fig. 7) (35Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). If this is due to alkylation of N-3 of adenine, it would also be strongly indicative of binding within the minor groove. The x-ray crystallography of exonuclease III (34Mol C.D. Kuo C.-F. Thayer M.M. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) also indicated that the enzyme has a relatively large positively charged DNA-binding face (55 Å long). It is therefore possible that subtle differences in DNA charge and hydrophobicity due to sequence context close to the abasic site could influence DNA binding and may account for the unexpected preferential cleavage of strand A in duplex F+A (Fig. 6). Alternatively, sequence context may influence the degree to which the two abasic sites can protrude into the enzyme's active site for cleavage. Again, we anticipate that similar properties would account for the same strand-specific cleavage of this duplex shown by Ape (Figs. 3 B and 4). It is worth noting that many of the more potent chemicals that produce complex lesions bind to the minor groove and abstract hydrogen atoms from deoxyribose carbon atoms on opposite strands that protrude into the minor groove. Neocarzinostatin, for example, generates a lesion very similar to the product of duplex F+A after Ape or exonuclease III cleavage, i.e. a single-strand break opposite an abasic site situated 2 bases 5′ to the strand break (36Povirk L.F. Houlgrave C.W. Han Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19263-19266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the abasic site is oxidized to a 2-deoxyribonolactone moiety (37Kappen L.S. Goldberg I.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen if the resistance of the abasic site to exonuclease III (38Povirk L.F. Goldberg I.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) is due to its oxidation or to the presence of a strand break as seen with the product of duplex F+A. Finally, the relatively slow rate of Ape-catalyzed scission of strand H in duplex H+K, where the abasic site lies 7 bases from the 3′-terminus, in comparison to strand M in duplex M+N (Fig. 2), where the abasic site lies 12 bases from the 3′-terminus, implies that the enzyme interacts with at least the 7 bases 3′ to the abasic site on the same strand. Wilson et al. (13Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) have previously shown an absolute requirement for 3 base pairs on the 3′-side of the lesion. We thank Drs. David Wilson III and Bruce Demple for generosity in supplying purified recombinant Ape protein and Drs. Lynn Harrison and Susan Wallace (University of Vermont) and Dr. John Ward (University of California, San Diego, CA) for thoughtful discussions and advice."
https://openalex.org/W1978071486,"Phosphatidic acid (PA), generated by phospholipase D activation, has been linked to the activation of the neutrophil respiratory burst enzyme, NADPH oxidase; however, the intracellular enzyme targets for PA remain unclear. We have recently shown (McPhail, L. C., Qualliotine-Mann, D., and Waite, K. A. (1995)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 7931–7935) that a PA-activated protein kinase is involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system. This protein kinase phosphorylates numerous endogenous proteins, including p47-phox, a component of the NADPH oxidase complex. Phospholipids other than PA were less effective at inducing endogenous protein phosphorylation. Several of these endogenous substrates were also phosphorylated during stimulation of intact cells by opsonized zymosan, an agonist that induces phospholipase D activation. We sought to identify the PA-activated protein kinase that phosphorylates p47-phox. The PA-dependent protein kinase was shown to be cytosolic.cis-Unsaturated fatty acids were poor inducers of protein kinase activity, suggesting that the PA-activated protein kinase is not a fatty acid-regulated protein kinase (e.g. protein kinase N). Chromatographic techniques separated the PA-activated protein kinase from a number of other protein kinases known to be activated by PA or to phosphorylate p47-phox. These included isoforms of protein kinase C, p21 (Cdc42/Rac)-activated protein kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Gel filtration chromatography indicated that the protein kinase has an apparent molecular size of 125 kDa. Screening of cytosolic fractions from several cell types and rat brain suggested the enzyme has widespread cell and tissue distribution. The partially purified protein kinase was sensitive to the same protein kinase inhibitors that diminished NADPH oxidase activation and was independent of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate and Ca2+. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that serine and tyrosine residues were phosphorylated on p47-phox by this kinase(s). These data indicate that one or more potentially novel protein kinases are targets for PA in neutrophils and other cell types. Furthermore, a PA-activated protein kinase is likely to be an important regulator of the neutrophil respiratory burst by phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase component p47-phox.

The enzymes involved in the activation of the oxidase, which are downstream of the generation of PA, have not been identified. We have developed a cell-free activation system for NADPH oxidase, which utilizes PA and is phosphorylation-dependent (7Qualliotine-Mann D. Agwu D.E. Ellenburg M.D. McCall C.E. McPhail L.C. J. Biol.

Since a variety of potential enzyme targets for PA are present, this system provides a means to identify these enzymes and their role in activation of the NADPH oxidase. We have recently shown that, during phosphorylation-dependent oxidase activation, PA, but not DG, induces phosphorylation of a wide range of proteins, in which the most prominent protein phosphorylated is the NADPH oxidase component p47-phox (phagocytic oxidase component) (8McPhail L.C.

In vitro studies have shown that PKC, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and isoforms of the newly identified p21 (Cdc42/Rac)-activated protein kinase (PAK) are able to phosphorylate the NADPH oxidase component p47-phox (22Uhlinger D.J.

Potentially, p42 and p44 MAPK isoforms could be activated as a consequence of Raf-1 activation by PA (21Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

In fact, the production of PA from PLD activation has been linked to the activation of PAK isoforms in neutrophils (34Ding J. Badwey J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35Ding J. Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Badwey J.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10 (abstr.): A1268Google Scholar). Thus, while MAPK and PAK isoforms are not known to be activated directly by PA, they could be activated downstream of other protein targets of PA and ultimately be responsible for the phosphorylation of p47-phox. We examined whether the PA-dependent protein kinase activity in human neutrophils was due to the activation of one of these known protein kinases. Our results indicate that this is not the case and that a potentially novel protein kinase, which phosphorylates p47-phox, may be the target for PA in this system. This protein kinase may therefore play a role in the activation of the NADPH oxidase. Sf9-expressed recombinant p47-phox (36Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fugi H. Nunoi H. J. Biol.

Isolated neutrophils were suspended to a concentration of 1 × 108 cells/ml in Buffer A. All cells to be analyzed were sonicated to ∼90% breakage (visualized by microscopy) and processed as follows. To prepare cytosolic and membrane fractions, sonicates were freed of unbroken cells and nuclei by centrifugation (200 × g, 10 min), loaded onto a 15–40% discontinuous sucrose gradient at a 2:1:1 (v/v/v) ratio and centrifuged at 150,000 × g (SW50 rotor, 30 min) (40Caldwell S.E.

Cytosolic fractions were collected from the top layer down to the 15% interface, and membrane fractions were collected from the 15–40% interface and the 40% sucrose layer. To prepare cytosolic fractions only, sonicates were centrifuged at 150,000 ×g (Type 50 rotor, 90 min), and the resulting supernatant was collected. Fractions were stored at −70 °C. Protein was determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein protocol from Pierce, which is based on the Bradford method (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Isolated neutrophils were suspended to 1 × 108 cells/ml in loading buffer (10 mmHepes (pH 7.2), 137 mm NaCl, 0.8 mmMgCl2, and 5.4 mm KCl). [32P]H3PO4 (1 mCi/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 90 min (45Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19910-19915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled neutrophils were centrifuged and resuspended at 1.5 × 108 cells/ml in stimulation buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 137 mm NaCl, 1.8 mmMgCl2, 5.4 mm KCl, and 0.5 mmCaCl2) (45Rotrosen D. Leto T.L.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Stimulation reactions were terminated by the addition of a 10-fold excess of stimulation buffer and immediate centrifugation. Stimulated neutrophils were then resuspended in diisopropylfluorophosphate treatment buffer (stimulation buffer plus 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2, 50 μm leupeptin, 5.4 mmNa3VO4, and 25 mm NaF) and incubated with 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate for 5 min (47Amrein P.C. Stossel T.P. Blood. 1980; 56: 442-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on ice, at which time a 10-fold excess of stimulation buffer was added and the cells were centrifuged.

GST-p47-phox (1 μg/reaction) or recombinant p47-phox (Rp47, 1 μg/reaction) were added to the mixtures as indicated in the figure legends. Six μl of [γ-32P]ATP were added, followed by the immediate addition of activator, as indicated in the figure legends. This mixture was allowed to incubate at 25 °C for 45 min. The reaction was then terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 8–15% SDS-PAGE (40Caldwell S.E. McCall C.E. Hendricks C.L. Leone P.A. Bass D.A. McPhail L.C. J. Clin.

Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar), dried, and analyzed via autoradiography. Protein kinase inhibitors were added 5 min prior to the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. For samples that were analyzed by Western blotting, reactions were performed as above with the following modifications. Cold ATP (10 μm) was used in place of radiolabeled ATP. Proteins were separated by 9% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (50Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were the same as above, except that [γ-32P]ATP, diluted to yield 2 × 106cpm/reaction, was used (final ATP concentration is indicated in figure legends), and samples were allowed to preincubate for 5 min at 25 °C before the addition of sample material to be tested (51Sozzani S. Agwu D.E. McCall C.E. O'Flaherty J.T. Schmitt J.D. Kent J.D. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20481-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 30 min, 75% (112.5 μl) of the reaction mixture was transferred to Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose squares; the squares were washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid and quantitated by Cerenkov counting (52Roskoski R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 53Witt J.J. Roskoski R. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 66: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). 1 μm GTPγS or 0.6 mmCaCl2 were added to samples as indicated under “Results.” For the mixed lipid vesicle experiments, PA, PS, PE, and PC were prepared separately by sonication (7Qualliotine-Mann D. Agwu D.E. Ellenburg M.D. McCall C.E. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23843-23849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PE, PC, and PS were then mixed together (final assay concentration: 25, 25, and 10 μm, respectively) with PA (final assay concentration: 0–300 μm). These mixtures were then used in the place of PA in the reaction mixtures. All samples were assayed in duplicate. Conditions used were linear with respect to protein concentration and time of incubation. Cytosol (2 mg of protein) was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and then adjusted with a solution of saturated ammonium sulfate at 4 °C to yield 40% ammonium sulfate saturation. This mixture was kept on ice for 10 min and was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) to collect precipitated protein. The resulting supernatant was adjusted with saturated ammonium sulfate to yield 70% saturation and was kept on ice for 10 min, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. Both the 40 and 70% protein precipitates were resuspended in 500 μl of Buffer B (Buffer A plus 2 mm dithiothreitol). These samples, plus the resulting 70% supernatant, were cleared of residual ammonium sulfate by passage over a Sephadex G-25 column (90 × 15 mm) in Buffer B. The void volume fraction was collected for each sample and assayed for PA-dependent protein kinase activity using the phosphocellulose binding assay. The ammonium sulfate-free samples were also concentrated by centrifugation with Centricon-30 tubes (Amicon; Beverley, MA) and stored at −70 °C. The 40% ammonium sulfate protein precipitate obtained from 25 mg of cytosolic protein (containing 85% of recovered activity) was resuspended on ice in Buffer B containing 20% ammonium sulfate. After 10 min, the solution was cleared by centrifugation and applied to a Ranin Hydropore column (Woburn, MA), equilibrated with Buffer B containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20% ammonium sulfate (Buffer C). The unretained proteins were collected, and the retained proteins were then eluted with Buffer C containing no ammonium sulfate. Fractions containing the retained and unretained proteins were concentrated via centrifugation using Centricon 30 tubes and were assayed for PA-dependent protein kinase activity, using the phosphocellulose binding assay, and for the presence of various protein kinases by Western blot analysis. Neutrophil cytosol (∼120 mg of protein) was adjusted with a solution of saturated ammonium sulfate at 4 °C to yield 40% ammonium sulfate. This mixture was kept on ice for 10 min and was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) to pellet precipitated protein. The precipitate was resuspended in Buffer B containing 20% ammonium sulfate. After 10 min on ice, the solution was cleared by centrifugation and applied to a Pharmacia Sephacryl S-200 column equilibrated with Buffer C containing no ammonium sulfate. Fractions (4.2 ml) were collected and assayed for PA-dependent protein kinase activity by the phosphocellulose assay.

https://openalex.org/W2037799144,"The SRP54 and SRα subunits of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the SRP receptor (SR) undergo a tightly coupled GTPase cycle that mediates the signal sequence–dependent attachment of ribosomes to the Sec61 complex. Here, we show that SRP54 and SRα are in the empty site conformation prior to contact between the SRP–ribosome complex and the membrane-bound SR. Cooperative binding of GTP to SRP54 and SRα stabilizes the SRP–SR complex and initiates signal sequence transfer from SRP54 to Sec61α. The GTP-bound conformations of SRα and SRP54 perform distinct roles, with SRα performing a predominant role in complex stabilization. Hydrolysis by both SRP54 and SRα is a prerequisite for dissociation of the SRP–SR complex."

For chemotaxis, each binding protein interacts with an inner membrane receptor that transmits the chemotactic signal to the flagellar apparatus via cytoplasmic components (11Clarke S.

A. 1977; 74: 3312-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For example, the galactose-binding protein MglB of Escherichia coli interacts with the inner membrane chemotransducer Trg, and with a transport complex consisting of the MglC inner membrane protein and the MglA ATPase (13Harayama S. Bollinger J. Iino T. Hazelbauer G. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 408-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polypeptide chain of most binding proteins folds in two globular domains (14Quiocho F.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 287-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Their specific ligand binds in a cleft between the two globular domains, which are connected by a movable hinge, and upon ligand binding, the two lobes move close to each other and enclose the ligand (15Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Interaction of binding proteins with transport and chemotaxis membrane proteins probably involves the rim of the substrate-binding cleft, opposite the hinge region (16Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhang Y. Conway C. Rosato M. Suh Y. Manson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22813-22820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the binding proteins interact with the porins of the outer membrane (18Ferenci T. Boos W. J. Supromol. Struct. 1980; 13: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The amount of each binding protein in the periplasm exceeds by approximately 50-fold that of cognate membrane components (reaching a concentration of 1 mm for MglB or OppA) and seems to be in excess of the amount required for maximal transport and chemotaxis activities (1Boos W.

They can distinguish native proteins from their non-native forms, owing to the specificity of their peptide binding site, and they catalyze protein folding and renaturationin vitro (reviewed in Refs. 19Ellis R.J.

The major classes of bacterial chaperones comprise DnaK/Hsp70 (and its assistant proteins DnaJ and GrpE), GroEL/Hsp60 (and its assistant protein GroES), HtpG/Hsp90, and the small heat shock proteins (19Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 20Georgopoulos C. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Ang D. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A.

Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Most of the known bacterial molecular chaperones are located in the cytoplasm. The bacterial periplasm contains specialized chaperones implicated in pilus biogenesis, such as PapD (22Hultgren S.J. Norwack S. Abraham S.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 363-415Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar), but little is known about the existence of general chaperones in this compartment (23Lazar S.W. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the periplasmic substrate-binding proteins, in a manner similar to that of molecular chaperones, increase the refolding of unfolded proteins, protect proteins against thermal denaturation, and form complexes with unfolded proteins. We propose that, in addition to their role in transport and chemotaxis, these overabundant proteins might help in protein folding and renaturation in the periplasm.DISCUSSIONWe present biochemical evidence suggesting that periplasmic substrate-binding proteins have a chaperone-like function in protein folding, protection against thermal denaturation, and interaction with unfolded proteins. All three binding proteins tested (OppA, MalE, and MglB) increase approximately 3-fold the yield of active citrate synthase and α-glucosidase renaturation as do molecular chaperones. The stimulation factors of protein renaturation are not much lower than those obtained with DnaK, DnaJ, Hsp90, or small Hsps (this study) (31Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F. Kiefhaber T.

Half-maximal reactivation of citrate synthase occurs in the presence of micromolar binding protein concentrations, similar to those of DnaK and DnaJ (this study), and somewhat higher than those of Hsp90 or small Hsp (however, the concentration of small Hsp was expressed in 30-mer in Jakob et al. (31Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the concentration in monomers is consequently 30-fold higher (31Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, these concentrations are of the same order of magnitude as that of unfolded citrate synthase in the reaction mixture, which reflects a strong interaction between binding proteins and unfolded proteins. Notably, the binding protein concentrations used in this study (within the micromolar range) are at least 100-fold lower than their estimated concentration in the periplasmic space (up to 1 mm).Periplasmic substrate-binding proteins protect citrate synthase from thermal denaturation. This protection requires higher concentrations of binding proteins than those used in protein folding. These concentrations (around 30 μm) are 5-fold higher than the concentrations of DnaK (this study) and of small Hsp (expressed as monomers) required for a similar protection. Binding protein concentrations required for an efficient protection of citrate synthase are more than 30-fold lower than their periplasmic concentration. Furthermore, the other proteins tested (bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and lysozyme) do not protect citrate synthase efficiently.Periplasmic substrate binding proteins form stable complexes with unfolded proteins. The OppA·R-CMLA and DnaK·R-CMLA complexes display a similar stability (this study) (38Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 383-392Crossref Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Like DnaK (39Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 22: 14491-14496Google Scholar), binding proteins interact with unfolded BPTI, but not with native BPTI, and thus appear to discriminate between unfolded and native proteins.Periplasmic substrate binding proteins possess a binding site for a small molecular weight ligand and protein binding sites that are involved in their interaction with a transport complex, a chemoreceptor, and among themselves (in multimerization) (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 1175-1209Google Scholar, 2Ames G.F. Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Shymala V.

The binding protein-dependent refolding of citrate synthase is not affected by the presence of their specific low molecular weight ligand. This suggests that neither the ligand binding site of binding proteins nor their ligand-induced conformational change is involved in their protein renaturation activity. While the ligand-induced conformational change of binding proteins has been implicated in many of their functions (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 1175-1209Google Scholar), it has been recently shown that liganded and unliganded binding proteins interact with equal affinity with their cognate membrane complex (43Ames G.F.-L. Liu C.E. Joshi A.K. Nikaido K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14264-14270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that there is relatively strong binding of non-native proteins to a potential hydrophobic site on periplasmic binding proteins. While periplasmic binding proteins are considered to be remarkably hydrophilic molecules (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 1175-1209Google Scholar), mutational studies suggest that several hydrophobic amino acids are directly involved in their interaction with membrane transport components (44Shilton B.H. Shuman H.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 45Martineau P. Saurin W. Hofnung M. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochimie. 1990; 72: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These amino acids might constitute hydrophobic patches responsible for a nonspecific and strong interaction between binding proteins and unfolded proteins. The huge amount of binding protein molecules in the periplasm might constitute a reservoir of chaperone-like molecules serving as a buffer in preventing the aggregation of non-native proteins. Binding proteins might help in the folding of translocated proteins, and during heat shock, they might bind an impressive amount of denatured proteins until permissive renaturation conditions are restored (binding proteins are heat-stable (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 1175-1209Google Scholar), and their huge higher amount over their membrane partners leaves most of them free to interact with non-native proteins, more especially since both their liganded and ligand-free forms possess chaperone-like properties).Several molecular chaperones (small Hsps (31Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PapD (22Hultgren S.J. Norwack S. Abraham S.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 363-415Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar)) appear to function without the help of any ATPase activity, in contrast to chaperones (such as DnaK or GroEL) that possess a peptide-dependent ATPase (19Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 20Georgopoulos C. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Ang D. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A.

Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar) or chaperones (such as SecB or Hsp90), which can recruit an assistant ATPase (SecA or Hsp70, respectively) (19Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 20Georgopoulos C. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Ang D. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A.

The periplasmic binding proteins do not possess any ATPase activity, and probably function as a chaperone buffer, as suggested above. Nevertheless, it cannot be entirely excluded that a binding protein conformational change linked with their activity in transport (which is energized by an ATPase) is involved in their protein binding function. The ATP-binding cassette transporters (which comprise the binding protein-dependent transport systems) have already been implicated in the regulation of heterologous membrane functions (47Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).All three binding proteins tested appear to possess similar efficiencies for protein renaturation and protection against thermal denaturation. This suggests that other binding proteins should possess similar properties, including the substrate-binding lipoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria, which are the counterparts of the periplasmic substrate-binding proteins of Gram-negative bacteria (48Gilson E. Alloing G. Schmidt T. Claverys J.P. Dudler R. Hofnung M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3971-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). While most binding proteins are inducible, with a low level of expression in the absence of their specific inducer, the oligopeptide-binding protein OppA is constitutively expressed in large amounts, and could playde facto a prominent chaperone role. In addition to playing an essential role in the uptake of peptides as nutrients, the peptide transport systems of Gram-positive bacteria are involved in sporulation, competence, and adherence to eukaryotic cells (49Perego M. Higgins C.F. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 50Magnuson R. Solomon J. Grosman A.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 207-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 51Cundell D.R. Pearce B.J. Sandros J. Naughton A.M. Masure H.R. Infect.

Although, in some cases, these additional functions can be explained by the peptide binding/transport properties of these permeases (49Perego M. Higgins C.F. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), some functions should perhaps be reconsidered in the light of a possible chaperone function of oligopeptide binding proteins. The fact that many binding proteins appear to possess a chaperone-like activity might explain why binding protein-deficient single mutants are not impaired in the expression of periplasmic or outer membrane proteins. Interestingly, a prlB mutant (prl stands forprotein localization defect), which can phenotypically suppress lamB signal sequence mutations, was identified as a mutant harboring a small deletion in the ribose binding protein gene rbsB (53Benson S.A. Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 51: 101-134Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 54Emr S.D. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5852-5860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The periplasmic binding proteins of Gram-negative bacteria constitute a set of at least 30 proteins that are involved in the transport of, and chemotaxis toward, substrates (reviewed in Refs.1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 1175-1209Google Scholar, 2Ames G.F. Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Shymala V.

These proteins bind a variety of ligands, such as sugars, amino acids, peptides, ions, and vitamins with submicromolar dissociation constants (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C.

Binding protein concentrations required for an efficient protection of citrate synthase are more than 30-fold lower than their periplasmic concentration. Furthermore, the other proteins tested (bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and lysozyme) do not protect citrate synthase efficiently.Periplasmic substrate binding proteins form stable complexes with unfolded proteins. The OppA·R-CMLA and DnaK·R-CMLA complexes display a similar stability (this study) (38Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 383-392Crossref Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Like DnaK (39Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 22: 14491-14496Google Scholar), binding proteins interact with unfolded BPTI, but not with native BPTI, and thus appear to discriminate between unfolded and native proteins.Periplasmic substrate binding proteins possess a binding site for a small molecular weight ligand and protein binding sites that are involved in their interaction with a transport complex, a chemoreceptor, and among themselves (in multimerization) (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 1175-1209Google Scholar, 2Ames G.F. Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Shymala V.

The binding protein-dependent refolding of citrate synthase is not affected by the presence of their specific low molecular weight ligand. This suggests that neither the ligand binding site of binding proteins nor their ligand-induced conformational change is involved in their protein renaturation activity. While the ligand-induced conformational change of binding proteins has been implicated in many of their functions (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 1175-1209Google Scholar), it has been recently shown that liganded and unliganded binding proteins interact with equal affinity with their cognate membrane complex (43Ames G.F.-L. Liu C.E. Joshi A.K. Nikaido K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14264-14270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that there is relatively strong binding of non-native proteins to a potential hydrophobic site on periplasmic binding proteins. While periplasmic binding proteins are considered to be remarkably hydrophilic molecules (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 1175-1209Google Scholar), mutational studies suggest that several hydrophobic amino acids are directly involved in their interaction with membrane transport components (44Shilton B.H. Shuman H.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 45Martineau P. Saurin W. Hofnung M. Spurlino J.C. Quiocho F.A. Biochimie. 1990; 72: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These amino acids might constitute hydrophobic patches responsible for a nonspecific and strong interaction between binding proteins and unfolded proteins. The huge amount of binding protein molecules in the periplasm might constitute a reservoir of chaperone-like molecules serving as a buffer in preventing the aggregation of non-native proteins. Binding proteins might help in the folding of translocated proteins, and during heat shock, they might bind an impressive amount of denatured proteins until permissive renaturation conditions are restored (binding proteins are heat-stable (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1995: 1175-1209Google Scholar), and their huge higher amount over their membrane partners leaves most of them free to interact with non-native proteins, more especially since both their liganded and ligand-free forms possess chaperone-like properties).Several molecular chaperones (small Hsps (31Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PapD (22Hultgren S.J. Norwack S. Abraham S.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 363-415Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar)) appear to function without the help of any ATPase activity, in contrast to chaperones (such as DnaK or GroEL) that possess a peptide-dependent ATPase (19Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 20Georgopoulos C. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Ang D. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A.

Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar) or chaperones (such as SecB or Hsp90), which can recruit an assistant ATPase (SecA or Hsp70, respectively) (19Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 20Georgopoulos C. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Ang D. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A.

The periplasmic binding proteins do not possess any ATPase activity, and probably function as a chaperone buffer, as suggested above. Nevertheless, it cannot be entirely excluded that a binding protein conformational change linked with their activity in transport (which is energized by an ATPase) is involved in their protein binding function. The ATP-binding cassette transporters (which comprise the binding protein-dependent transport systems) have already been implicated in the regulation of heterologous membrane functions (47Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).All three binding proteins tested appear to possess similar efficiencies for protein renaturation and protection against thermal denaturation. This suggests that other binding proteins should possess similar properties, including the substrate-binding lipoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria, which are the counterparts of the periplasmic substrate-binding proteins of Gram-negative bacteria (48Gilson E. Alloing G. Schmidt T. Claverys J.P. Dudler R. Hofnung M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3971-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). While most binding proteins are inducible, with a low level of expression in the absence of their specific inducer, the oligopeptide-binding protein OppA is constitutively expressed in large amounts, and could playde facto a prominent chaperone role. In addition to playing an essential role in the uptake of peptides as nutrients, the peptide transport systems of Gram-positive bacteria are involved in sporulation, competence, and adherence to eukaryotic cells (49Perego M. Higgins C.F. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 50Magnuson R. Solomon J. Grosman A.D.

Although, in some cases, these additional functions can be explained by the peptide binding/transport properties of these permeases (49Perego M. Higgins C.F. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), some functions should perhaps be reconsidered in the light of a possible chaperone function of oligopeptide binding proteins. The fact that many binding proteins appear to possess a chaperone-like activity might explain why binding protein-deficient single mutants are not impaired in the expression of periplasmic or outer membrane proteins. Interestingly, a prlB mutant (prl stands forprotein localization defect), which can phenotypically suppress lamB signal sequence mutations, was identified as a mutant harboring a small deletion in the ribose binding protein gene rbsB (53Benson S.A. Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 51: 101-134Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 54Emr S.D. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5852-5860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We present biochemical evidence suggesting that periplasmic substrate-binding proteins have a chaperone-like function in protein folding, protection against thermal denaturation, and interaction with unfolded proteins. All three binding proteins tested (OppA, MalE, and MglB) increase approximately 3-fold the yield of active citrate synthase and α-glucosidase renaturation as do molecular chaperones. The stimulation factors of protein renaturation are not much lower than those obtained with DnaK, DnaJ, Hsp90, or small Hsps (this study) (31Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,36Buchner J. Schmidt M. Fuchs M. Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Schmid F. Kiefhaber T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 37Lilie H. Lang K. Rudolph R. Buchner J. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1490-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Half-maximal reactivation of citrate synthase occurs in the presence of micromolar binding protein concentrations, similar to those of DnaK and DnaJ (this study), and somewhat higher than those of Hsp90 or small Hsp (however, the concentration of small Hsp was expressed in 30-mer in Jakob et al. (31Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the concentration in monomers is consequently 30-fold higher (31Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, these concentrations are of the same order of magnitude as that of unfolded citrate synthase in the reaction mixture, which reflects a strong interaction between binding proteins and unfolded proteins. Notably, the binding protein concentrations used in this study (within the micromolar range) are at least 100-fold lower than their estimated concentration in the periplasmic space (up to 1 mm). Periplasmic substrate-binding proteins protect citrate synthase from thermal denaturation. This protection requires higher concentrations of binding proteins than those used in protein folding. These concentrations (around 30 μm) are 5-fold higher than the concentrations of DnaK (this study) and of small Hsp (expressed as monomers) required for a similar protection. Binding protein concentrations required for an efficient protection of citrate synthase are more than 30-fold lower than their periplasmic concentration. Furthermore, the other proteins tested (bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and lysozyme) do not protect citrate synthase efficiently. Periplasmic substrate binding proteins form stable complexes with unfolded proteins. The OppA·R-CMLA and DnaK·R-CMLA complexes display a similar stability (this study) (38Langer T. Lu C. Echols H.

Cross-linking of BCR induces phosphorylation of Btk at Tyr551 and Tyr223. However, the functional requirement of these phosphorylation for BCR signaling remains unclear. We demonstrate here that mutation of Tyr551, not Tyr223, abrogates the BCR-induced calcium mobilization. Not only Lyn, but also Syk was required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk in BCR signaling. These results suggest that transphosphorylation of Btk on Tyr551 is essential for BCR function and that this phosphorylation is mediated through the concerted actions of Lyn and Syk. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is required for B cell development and B cell antigen receptor (BCR) function. Cross-linking of BCR induces phosphorylation of Btk at Tyr551 and Tyr223. However, the functional requirement of these phosphorylation for BCR signaling remains unclear.

Stimulation of the BCR induces the enzymatic activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of three distinct families of nonreceptor cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), the Src family, Syk, and Btk. The Src family kinases are rapidly activated after BCR engagement, and their activation correlates with the initial tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif on the BCR Igα and Igβ subunits (reviewed in Refs.1Pleiman C.M. D'Ambrosio D. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 393-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin.

Witte O.N. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This sequential activation potentially places Btk and Syk downstream of Src family kinases. Utilizing co-overexpression system in fibroblasts and COS cells, it has been demonstrated that Lyn transphosphorylates Btk on Tyr551 in the catalytic domain, a site homologous to the Src family kinase consensus autophosphorylation site (6Mahajan S.

This results in a 5–10-fold increase in Btk enzymatic activity (7Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.-C. Witte O.N. Kinet J.-P.

The identical phosphopeptides were generated after cross-linking of the BCR, indicating that these sites are also tyrosine phosphorylated in B cells (7Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I.

To genetically define the functional relationship among Lyn, Syk, and Btk in BCR signaling, we established each PTK-deficient DT40 B cells (10Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 11Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Our previous results have shown that the BCR-induced calcium mobilization is abrogated in Btk-deficient DT40 cells and that the loss of Btk does not significantly affect the activation of Lyn and Syk in BCR signaling (11Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Here we show that BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk is abolished in Lyn/Syk double-deficient DT40 cells, suggesting that Btk acts downstream of Lyn and/or Syk in BCR signaling. Moreover, this phosphorylation is partially inhibited in Lyn- or Syk-deficient cells, indicating contribution of both Lyn and Syk to Btk phosphorylation. The Btk Y223F mutant was able to restore the BCR-induced calcium mobilization, whereas the Y551F mutant could not. Thus, these results suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr551 of Btk through Lyn and Syk is essential for BCR signaling. DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. Anti-chicken IgM mAb M4 and anti-phospholipase C (PLC)-γ2 Ab were described previously (10Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) and anti-T7 mAb were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and Novagen, respectively. T7-tagged and mutant Btk cDNAs were created by polymerase chain reaction, and the resulting constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. These cDNAs were cloned into pApuro expression vector (10Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). For DNA transfection into DT40 cells, DNA was linearized, electroporated, and selected in the presence of puromycin (0.5 μg/ml). The expression of Btk was analyzed by Western blotting. DT40 cells were stimulated by mAb M4 for indicated time. Cells were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) containing 50 mm NaF, 10 μm molybdate, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate supplemented with protease inhibitors described previously (10Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were sequentially incubated (1 h at 4 °C for each incubation with Ab and protein A-Sepharose). For immunoblotting, samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Corp.). Filters were incubated with mAb 4G10 or anti-T7 mAb. After washing, filters were developed using a sheep anti-mouse IgG Ab conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). For in vitro kinase assay, the immunoprecipitates were washed with 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, and 150 mm NaCl after washing with lysis buffer. Added to each sample was 50 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 10 mm MnCl2) in the absence or presence of ATP (1 μm). Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing a cytoplasmic domain of mouse Igα (glutathione S-transferase/Igα) was made and used as an exogenous substrate (6Mahajan S. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Kut S.A. Saouaf S.J. Bolen J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The reactions were allowed at 30 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of sample buffer. For calcium analysis, cells (5 × 106) were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mm glucose, 0.025% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm CaCl2 and loaded with 3 μmFura-2/AM at 37 °C for 45 min. Cells were washed twice and adjusted to 106 cells/ml with continuous monitoring of fluorescence spectrophotometer (model F-2000; Hitachi) at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Calibration and calculation of calcium level were done as described (12Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For phosphoinositide analysis, cells (106/ml) were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol (10 μCi/ml, 105 Ci/mmol) for 4–5 h in inositol-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, then stimulated in the presence of 10 mm LiCl with mAb M4. The soluble inositol phosphates were extracted with trichloroacetic acid at indicated time points, and applied to AG1-X8 (formate form) ion exchange columns (Bio-Rad) preequilibrated with 0.1 m formic acid. The columns were washed with 10 ml of H2O and 10 ml of 60 mmammonium formate, 5 mm sodium tetraborate. Elution was performed with increasing concentrations of ammonium formate (0.1–0.7m). We have used a genetic approach to determine the requirements for Btk tyrosine phosphorylation following BCR engagement. We utilized three mutants of the chicken B cell line DT40, generated by inactivation of either lyn, syk, or both genes by homologous recombination (10Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 11Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Since the Ab raised against chicken Btk does not immunoprecipitate efficiently, we expressed an epitope-tagged version of Btk (designated T7-Btk) into wild type and these mutant DT40 cells. Clones expressing similar levels of T7-Btk in these deficient DT40 cells were selected. These clones were lysed prior to and following BCR ligation, and T7-Btk was immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 mAb. As shown in Fig. 1, Btk was inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated following BCR stimulation in wild type DT40 cells, consistent with previous reports (5Saouaf S.J. Mahajan S. Rowley R.B. Kut S.A.

In contrast to wild type cells, Lyn/Syk double-deficient DT40 cells failed to exhibit any Btk tyrosine phosphorylation following BCR ligation, indicating requirement of Lyn and/or Syk for the BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk. In Lyn-deficient DT40 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk at 1 and 3 min after BCR ligation was significantly reduced, whereas this phosphorylation at 10 min reached almost the same level as that in wild type cells. Compared with Lyn-deficient DT40 cells, Syk-deficient cells showed a complementary time course of the BCR-induced phosphorylation of Btk; phosphorylation of Btk was only observed at 1 and 3 min after BCR stimulation. These data suggest that either Lyn or Syk alone is capable of phosphorylating Btk at least to some extent and that the concerted actions of Lyn and Syk are required for full phosphorylation of Btk in BCR signaling. It has been demonstrated recently that transphosphorylation of Btk at Tyr551 results in increased its enzymatic activity, leading to autophosphorylation of a second tyrosine Tyr223 in a fibroblast system (8Park H. Wahl M.I. Afar D.E.H. Turck C.W. Rawlings D.J. Tam C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.-P. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1996; 4: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To determine that this sequential phosphorylation of Btk occurs also after BCR stimulation, we transfected Y551F and Y223F mutants of Btk into Btk-deficient DT40 cells (Fig. 2 A). Stimulation of BCR did not enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk(Y551F) (Fig. 3). This result suggests the possibility that Tyr551 of Btk is only target of Lyn/Syk-dependent phosphorylation after BCR stimulation in DT40 cells. Alternatively, phosphorylation at Tyr551 is a critical step for subsequent phosphorylation of Btk in BCR signaling context. In contrast to Btk(Y551F), Btk(Y223F) showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation upon BCR stimulation, although this phosphorylation was only observed at 1 min after receptor cross-linking (Fig. 3). Thus, these results implicate that a primary target of tyrosine through concerted actions of Lyn and Syk is Tyr551 of Btk in BCR signaling, leading to phosphorylation of Tyr223. Since Btk(Y223F) did not show significant tyrosine phosphorylation at 3 and 10 min after receptor stimulation, our finding also suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr223 is required for sustained Btk phosphorylation in BCR signaling.Figure 3BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk(Y223F) and Btk(Y551F). At the indicated time points after M4 stimulation (4 μg/ml), Btk-deficient cells expressing these constructs were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 mAb. Immunoprecipitates were loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE, and the blotted membrane was incubated with mAb 4G10. After the filter was stripped, the same blot was reprobed with anti-T7 mAb. pY, phosphotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Utilizing Btk-deficient DT40 cells expressing Btk(Y551F) and Btk(Y223F), we analyzed the effects of these mutations on BCR signaling. Wild type and kinase-negative T7-Btk were also transfected into Btk-deficient DT40 cells as a positive and a negative control, respectively (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether these mutations affect tyrosine kinase activity, Btk immunoprecipitates were used forin vitro kinase assays with glutathioneS-transferase/Igα as an exogenous substrate. Btk(R525Q) exhibited no kinase activity, indicating that the immunoprecipitates are largely free of contaminating tyrosine kinases. When the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation is normalized to the amount of protein present in each kinase assay, both Btk(Y551F) and Btk(Y223F) had similar transphosphorylation activity compared with wild type Btk (Fig.2 B). We showed previously that the BCR-induced PLC-γ2 activation is abrogated in Btk-deficient DT40 cells, leading to loss of calcium mobilization (11Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether these mutations were able to restore these defects or not. As shown in Fig.4 A, DT40 cells expressing Btk(Y223F) exhibited normal calcium mobilization, whereas Btk(Y551F) was able to mobilize only small amount of calcium upon receptor cross-linking. Consistent with these data, cross-linking of BCR on DT40 cells expressing Btk(Y223F) stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2, although these parameters were lower than wild type Btk (Fig. 4,B and C). This might reflect the lower expression level of Btk(Y223F) than wild type Btk (Fig. 2 B). The BCR-induced IP3 production and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 in DT40 cells expressing Btk(Y551F) was essentially the same as those in DT40 cells expressing Btk(R525Q) (Fig. 4 and data not shown). These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tyr551, not Tyr223, is essential for BCR signaling. In Lyn-deficient DT40 cells, BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk was significantly inhibited at 1 and 3 min after stimulation (Fig. 1), indicating that Btk phosphorylation is mediated by Lyn in BCR signaling in these early time points. However, at 10 min after stimulation, this phosphorylation reached almost the same level in wild type cells, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk at 10 min after BCR stimulation is independent of Lyn. In contrast to Lyn-deficient DT40 cells, Syk-deficient cells show the profound inhibition of the BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk at 10 min after receptor cross-linking, implicating that this Btk phosphorylation is mediated by Syk. Taken together, these data suggest that the initial Btk phosphorylation and sustained phosphorylation are mediated by coordinated actions of Lyn and Syk after BCR cross-linking. Our conclusion is somewhat inconsistent with the previous reports using COS cell and fibroblast expression systems (6Mahajan S. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Kut S.A. Saouaf S.J. Bolen J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.-C. Witte O.N. Kinet J.-P. Science. 1996; 271: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In these systems, Lyn is able to phosphorylate Btk, whereas Syk is not. One of the possibilities about this disparity between the heterologous systems and DT40 B cell system is that Syk is maximally activated through transphosphorylation at Tyr518 and/or Tyr519 by Lyn in DT40 cells (16Kurosaki T. Johnson S.A. Pao L. Sada K. Yamamura H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpressed Syk itself may not be fully activated in heterologous systems. To test this possibility, we transfected T7-Btk into Syk-deficient cells expressing Syk mutant in which Tyr518/Tyr519 is changed to Phe518/Phe519. In this mutant DT40 cell, the BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk was similar to that in Syk-deficient DT40 cells (data not shown), implicating that the requirement of Syk is due to up-regulated Syk through transphosphorylation of Tyr518/Tyr519. It is also possible that Btk may not be a direct substrate of Syk. Assuming that another PTK acts downstream of Syk in BCR signaling, our data might be accounted for by the involvement of this Syk-regulated PTK in tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk. It has been reported that two tyrosines, Tyr551 and Tyr223, are phosphorylated after cross-linking of BCR. Btk(Y551F) exhibited no tyrosine phosphorylation upon BCR cross-linking, whereas Btk(Y223F) showed an increase of tyrosine phosphorylation at 1 min after receptor stimulation, suggesting that Tyr551 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation of Btk in BCR signaling events. Thus, these results support the previous contention that phosphorylation of Btk at Tyr551 is followed by its autophosphorylation at Tyr223 (7Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S.

Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.-P. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1996; 4: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Since Btk(Y223F) did not show significant tyrosine phosphorylation at 3 and 10 min after receptor stimulation, phosphorylation of Tyr223 appears to be required for sustained Btk phosphorylation. Recent crystallographic analysis of Itk (Btk/Tec family PTK expressed in T cells) may provide insights into the function of phosphorylation of Tyr223 of Btk (17Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Based on this analysis, the proline-rich domain adjacent to the SH3 domain of Btk/Tec family kinases contains an SH3 ligand (Fig. 2 A), allowing intramolecular interaction. Interestingly, Tyr223of Btk is located within the interface of this interaction. Thus, phosphorylation of Tyr223 may disrupt this intramolecular interaction, thereby changing the conformation of Btk. This conformational change might be required for sustained phosphorylation of Btk in BCR signaling. Our functional data clearly indicate that Tyr551 is essential for BCR signaling, whereas Tyr223 is dispensable for BCR-induced PLC-γ2 activation. Since phosphorylation of Tyr551 was already reported to increase the kinase activity of Btk with 5–10-fold (7Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.-C. Witte O.N. Kinet J.-P. Science. 1996; 271: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), one of the consequence of phosphorylation of Tyr551 is increased kinase activity upon BCR cross-linking. Although we carried out in vitro kinase assay on Btk immunoprecipitates in wild type DT40 cells, the BCR-induced activation of its in vitro kinase activity could not be reproducibly observed. Previous reports suggest that the magnitude of the BCR-induced activation of Btk is significantly smaller than that of maximum Btk phosphorylation by Lyn in heterologous systems (6Mahajan S. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Kut S.A. Saouaf S.J. Bolen J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.-C. Witte O.N. Kinet J.-P. Science. 1996; 271: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Indeed, in our hand, this 5–10-fold activation of Btk in COS cells could be reproducibly detected. Thus, the most likely explanation is that the increase of Btk enzymatic activity through phosphorylation of Tyr551 in DT40 cells is too small for our detection system. In the case of Syk, it has been demonstrated that in addition to recruitment of Syk to phosphorylated Igα/Igβ, phosphorylation at tyrosine (Tyr519 and/or Tyr518) within its activation loop is critical for BCR signal transduction (16Kurosaki T. Johnson S.A. Pao L. Sada K. Yamamura H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that phosphorylation of Tyr551 on Btk activation loop is also an obligatory mechanism for its participation in BCR signaling. Thus, cytoplasmic PTK cascade through phosphorylation of tyrosine located in the activation loop may be one of the general mechanisms for cytoplasmic signal transduction. We thank Dr. H. Sugawara for construction of a Btk mutant and Dr. Y. Homma for anti-PLC-γ2 Ab."
https://openalex.org/W2019280950,"Immunoglobulin (Ig) E production by B cells requires two primary signals provided by T cells, interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-13 and CD40 ligand (CD40L). In addition, costimulatory signals, such as CD23-CD21 interaction, contribute further ensuring a selective control over this production. Recently, CD28, expressed on T cells, has been reported to be involved in this process. The CD28 ligands, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), are expressed on human tonsillar B cells, and their expression is up-regulated by IL-4, IL-13, and/or an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb). We have investigated whether signaling via the B7 molecules affects IgE synthesis. Human B cells were stimulated by IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb in the presence of different anti-B7 mAbs. Cross-linking of CD86 with IT2.2 potentiated IgE and IgG4 production and ε transcripts expression. The production of the other isotypes was not modulated. Conversely, the anti-CD80 and the other anti-CD86 mAbs tested had no effect. The increase of IgE and IgG4 production induced by IT2.2 was accompanied by an increase in proliferation, in cell surface density of CD23, and in CD23 binding to CD21-expressing B cells. In contrast, the expression of other B cell surface molecules such as CD11a, CD30, and CD58 remained unaffected. Since IT2.2 favors CD23-CD21 pairing, we tested whether blocking this interaction affected IT2.2-increased IgE production. The neutralizing anti-CD23 mAb, Mab 25, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the effect of IT2.2 on IgE synthesis. Finally, IT2.2 potentiation on B cell proliferation and IgE production required the two primary signals, IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb, since IT2.2 alone or in combination with only one of these stimuli did not show any effect on B cells. This study is the first demonstration of a signaling role for CD86. Together with IL-4 or IL-13 and CD40L, CD86 favors CD23-CD21 pairing and consequently functions as a selective and potent costimulus for human IgE and IgG4 synthesis.

An efficient activation of T cells requires the engagement of the T cell receptor with the antigen-major histocompatibility complex and the engagement of appropriate costimulatory signals. A potent pathway of costimulation is the one involving the interaction of CD28 and CTLA-4 on T cells with their ligands CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) expressed by numerous antigen-presenting cells, including B cells (1Freeman G.J.

Indeed, an abnormal in vivo Ig production has been observed in CD28 knockout mice (14Shahinian A. Pfeffer K. Lee K.P. Kundig T.M. Kishihara K. Wakeham A. Kawai K. Ohashi P.S. Thompson C.B. Mak T.W.

IgE synthesis is also tightly controlled by costimulatory signals provided by T cells, including the interaction between cell surface molecules. Among them, the ligation of CD21 (26Aubry J.P.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 10-20PubMed Google Scholar) on B cells with their specific ligands up-regulates IgE synthesis. CD28 expressed on T cells could also control IgE synthesis (17Life P. Aubry J.P. Estoppey S. Schnuriger V. Bonnefoy J.Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the CD28 ligand(s) that may regulate IgE production remains unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the B7 molecules on IgE synthesis. The results show that ligation of CD86 on IL-4 or IL-13 plus anti-CD40 mAb-stimulated human tonsillar B cells transduces a positive costimulatory signal since it favors CD23-CD21 pairing and potentiates selectively IgE and IgG4 production. The anti-CD86 mAbs FUN-1 and IT2.2 (2Azuma M. Ito D. Yagita H. Okumura K. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Somoza C. Nature. 1993; 366: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), and BU63 was from Ancell (Bayport, MN). The anti-CD80 mAbs MAB104 and L307.4 were from Immunotech (Marseille Luminy, France) and Becton Dickinson (Mountain View, CA), respectively. Based on previous data, the molecule recognized by the BB1 mAb (purchased from Ancell) was defined as B7-3 (3Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Gribben J.G. Daley J. Gray G. Nadler L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11059-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The anti-CD40 mAb B-B20 was from Serotec (Oxford, U. K.). All of these mAbs were azide-free except L307.4 and FUN-1, which were dialyzed before use. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled IT2.2, MAB104, and BB1 mAbs were from the same companies. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD11a, -CD11c, -CD49d, -CD54, and -CD58 mAbs were from Serotec. Anti-CD30 mAb was from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Anti-CD11b, -CD21, -CD23, and -CD25 were from Immunotech. Control IgG1 and IgG2a were from Becton Dickinson. Fluorescent CD23- and glycophorin A-liposomes (used as a negative control) were made as described (27Pochon S. Graber P. Yeager M. Jansen K. Bernard A. Aubry J.P. Bonnefoy J.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids encoding the full-length extracellular portions of human CD80 (CD80wt) and CD86 (CD86wt) and single domain variants of these, fused to rat Fcγ2b at the hinge, have already been described (33Ellis J.H. Burden M.N. Vinogradov D.V. Linge C. Crowe J.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 56: 2700-2709Google Scholar). These were transfected into COS cells using Transfectam (Promega, Madison, WI) and supernatants containing fusion protein harvested after 4 days. The Ig fusion protein concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (33Ellis J.H. Burden M.N. Vinogradov D.V. Linge C. Crowe J.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 56: 2700-2709Google Scholar). Anti-CD86 mAbs, control IgG1, IgG2b, and anti-rat IgG antiserum (all from Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U. S. A.) were coated onto 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in 0.1 mcarbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and then saturated with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. COS supernatants (100 μl/well) were applied for 1 h. After washing, bound fusion proteins were detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG2b (Binding Site, Birmingham, U. K.) and revealed usingo-phenylenediamine. The colorimetric reaction was stopped with 2 m H2SO4. Optical density values were determined at 492 nm. Human tonsillar B cells were purified as described and cultured in enriched Iscove's medium (29Henchoz-Lecoanet S. Jeannin P. Aubry J.P. Graber P. Bradshaw C.G. Pochon S. Bonnefoy J.Y. Immunology. 1996; 88: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). B cells (2 × 105/200 μl/well) were added to 96-well plates (Nunc) precoated with 1 μg/well of the mAb tested and stimulated, in quintuplicate, with 200 units/ml IL-4 (Geneva Biomedical Research Institute), 20 ng/ml IL-13 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN), 0.1 μg/ml anti-CD40 mAb, or combinations of IL-4 or IL-13 plus anti-CD40 mAb. In some sets of experiments, B cells stimulated with IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb in the presence or absence of IT2.2 were incubated with 0.2–20 μg/ml of the neutralizing anti-CD23 mAb, Mab 25 (25Bonnefoy J.Y. Shields J. Mermod J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Immunotech) or of control mouse IgG1 (Sigma). In others, these stimulated B cells were incubated with CD80wt or CD86wt. In all cases, supernatants were collected at day 12 to quantify Ig. IgA, IgE, IgG4, and IgM were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (25Bonnefoy J.Y. Shields J. Mermod J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Henchoz-Lecoanet S. Jeannin P. Aubry J.P. Graber P. Bradshaw C.G. Pochon S. Bonnefoy J.Y. Immunology. 1996; 88: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 were quantified as follows. 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/well anti-IgG1 mAb (clone NL16) (Oxoid Unipath, Hampshire, U. K.), 0.2 μg/well anti-IgG2 mAb (clone HP6002), or 0.2 μg/well anti-IgG3 mAb (clone HP6050) (both from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, U. S. A.) in 0.1 mcarbonate-bicarbonate buffer and then saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell culture supernatants diluted in phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 were incubated for 4 h at room temperature. After washing, peroxidase-conjugated anti-human γ-chain (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin/Tween was incubated at room temperature for 3 h, and bound Abs were detected usingo-phenylenediamine. The colorimetric reaction was stopped with 2 m H2SO4. Optical density values were determined at 492 nm. Standard curves were realized with purified IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 (Sigma). Results are expressed in ng/ml or in percent of increase defined as A −O ÷ O × 100, where A andO were the concentrations of Ig produced by B cells stimulated with or without IT2.2, respectively. B cells (2 × 105/200 μl/well) were stimulated in triplicate in 96-well plates precoated or not with the mAb tested, as described above. After a 48-h incubation, cells were pulsed with 0.25 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (Amersham International, Amersham, U. K.). Radioactive incorporation was measured by standard liquid scintillation counting. Results are given as stimulation index calculated as follows: A ÷O, where A and O are the counts/min values obtained when B cells were stimulated or not with the mAb tested, respectively. Surface phenotyping of B cells and liposome binding assays were performed by flow cytometry, as described previously (27Pochon S. Graber P. Yeager M. Jansen K. Bernard A. Aubry J.P. Bonnefoy J.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Results were expressed either as the mean fluorescence intensity after subtraction of the MFI obtained with the control Ab or as a percentage of MFI increase defined as follows: A− O ÷ O × 100 where A andO are the MFI obtained with B cells activated or not with the mAbs tested, respectively. B cells were either cultured for 2 days with or without IL-4 or for 10 days with IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb in the presence or absence of immobilized IT2.2. Total RNA extraction and hybridizations with 32P-labeled cRNA probes complementary to Cε and to β-actin mRNA were performed as described (20Gauchat J.F. Lebman D.A. Coffman R.L. Gascan H. de Vries J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the same experiment, IgE was quantified in the 10-day cell-free supernatants. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. CD80 and CD86 were expressed on freshly isolated tonsillar B cells but at a lower extent than B7-3 (Table I). A significant increase of CD80 and B7-3 expression occurred after a 3-day stimulation with IL-4 (increase of 106 and 109%, respectively) (Table I). A 3-day stimulation with anti-CD40 mAb also enhanced CD80 expression (increase of 200%) but did not significantly affect B7-3 expression (Table I). Concerning CD86 expression, a significant increase occurred earlier, after a 24-h stimulation with IL-4 or with anti-CD40 mAb alone (increase of 100 and 207%, respectively) (Table I). Finally, a stimulation with both IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb induced a potent and early increase of CD80, CD86, and B7-3 expression (increase of 169, 321, and 100% at day 1, respectively). Stimulation with IL-13 plus anti-CD40 mAb also up-regulated CD86 expression to the same extent (increase of 314% at day 1). The different anti-CD80 and anti-CD86 mAbs tested gave identical results (data not shown).Table ICD80, CD86, and B7–3 expression on human tonsillar B cellsStimulusCD80CD86B7–3Day 1Day 3Day 1Day 3Day 1Day 3None13 ± 415 ± 414 ± 518 ± 331 ± 1132 ± 8IL-412 ± 331 ± 928 ± 543 ± 935 ± 1267 ± 15IL-13NDND30 ± 845 ± 11NDNDAnti-CD4022 ± 845 ± 1643 ± 1352 ± 1335 ± 1535 ± 11IL-4 + anti-CD4035 ± 952 ± 1059 ± 1565 ± 1562 ± 1673 ± 18IL-13 + anti-CD40NDND58 ± 666 ± 12NDNDB cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with 200 units/ml IL-4, 20 ng/ml IL-13, 0.1 μg/ml anti-CD40 mAb, IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb, or IL-13 plus anti-CD40 mAb. CD80, CD86, and B7–3 expression was evaluated by FACS analysis using FITC-labeled mAbs. Results are expressed in MFI values − background (mean ± S.D.,n = 6); ND means not done. Open table in a new tab B cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with 200 units/ml IL-4, 20 ng/ml IL-13, 0.1 μg/ml anti-CD40 mAb, IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb, or IL-13 plus anti-CD40 mAb. CD80, CD86, and B7–3 expression was evaluated by FACS analysis using FITC-labeled mAbs. Results are expressed in MFI values − background (mean ± S.D.,n = 6); ND means not done. Thus, the expression of the B7 molecules is detectable on fresh human tonsillar B cells and is strongly up-regulated by stimulation with IL-4 or IL-13 plus anti-CD40 mAb. To determine whether the B7 molecules are involved in the regulation of IgE synthesis, B cells were stimulated by IL-4, IL-13, and/or anti-CD40 mAb in the presence of immobilized anti-B7 mAbs. When B cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with IL-4, IL-13, or anti-CD40 mAb alone, the ligation of CD80 (with MAB104 or L307.4 mAbs), CD86 (with IT2.2, FUN-1, or BU63 mAbs), or B7-3 (with BB1 mAb) did not induce IgE nor IgG4 production. Representative results obtained with the IT2.2 mAb are presented in Fig. 1, a and b. Interestingly, IgE and IgG4 synthesis induced by a stimulation with IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb was potentiated by IT2.2 (Fig. 1, aand b, and Table II). In contrast, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgM production were unaffected (Fig. 1 c). According to the subject tested (n = 6), the increase of IgE and IgG4 production induced by IT2.2 was from 4- to 10-fold and from 5- to 12-fold, respectively. This effect of IT2.2 was not enhanced when suboptimal concentrations of IL-4 (from 5 to 200 units/ml) and of anti-CD40 mAb (from 5 to 100 ng/ml) were used in combination (data not shown). Moreover, IT2.2 also potentiated the production of IgE and IgG4 induced by IL-13 plus anti-CD40 mAb (Fig. 1, a andb). Neutralizing experiments showed that IT2.2 acted on B cells by triggering specifically CD86 since its effect on IgE production was strongly inhibited (80% inhibition) by the addition of CD86wt but not of CD80wt fusion proteins (data not shown).Table IIEffect of CD80, CD86, and B7–3 triggering on IgE and IgG4 productionmAb and cloneImmunoglobulinsIgEIgG4ng/mlNone89 ± 1399 ± 19CD80 MAB10485 ± 10105 ± 28 L307.482 ± 1396 ± 15CD86 IT2.2467 ± 51940 ± 256 BU6388 ± 15110 ± 32 FUN-176 ± 1298 ± 18B7–3 BB191 ± 16119 ± 29Human tonsillar B cells were stimulated with IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb in the absence or presence of different anti-B7 mAbs. At day 12, IgE and IgG4 were quantified in the supernatants. Results are expressed in ng/ml, mean ± S.D., n = 6. Open table in a new tab Human tonsillar B cells were stimulated with IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb in the absence or presence of different anti-B7 mAbs. At day 12, IgE and IgG4 were quantified in the supernatants. Results are expressed in ng/ml, mean ± S.D., n = 6. In contrast, the anti-CD80 mAbs, the BB1 mAb, and the other anti-CD86 mAbs tested (FUN-1 and BU63) did not affect IgE or IgG4 production by stimulated-B cells (Table II). The different effects of the anti-CD86 mAbs could result from a binding to different epitopes. CD86 is a member of the Ig superfamilly with an extracellular region containing both a V (Ig-V-like) domain, which is known to contain the CTLA-4 binding site, and a C (C2-like) domain (2Azuma M. Ito D. Yagita H. Okumura K. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Somoza C. Nature. 1993; 366: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar,4Freeman G.J. Gribben J.G. Boussiotis V.A. Ng J.W.

Immunol. 1996; 56: 2700-2709Google Scholar). Mapping experiments showed that the three anti-CD86 mAbs bound to the CD86 V-region (Fig. 2). However, in agreement with other (34Engel P. Gribben J.G. Freeman G.J. Zhou L.J. Nozawa Y. Abe M. Nadler L.M. Wakasa H. Tedder T. Blood. 1994; 84: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have observed by FACS analysis that FUN-1 and BU63 did not block the binding of IT2.2 to CD86-expressing B cells (data not shown). These results suggest that IT2.2 binds to an epitope located in the CD86-V domain different from that identified by FUN-1 or BU63. Thus, the epitope of CD86 recognized by IT2.2 has a unique signaling role in human B cells since it potentiates IgE and IgG4 production induced by a costimulation with both IL-4 or IL-13 plus anti-CD40 mAb. Whereas IL-4 induces the expression of the germline ε transcript in tonsillar B cells (18Lebman D.A. Coffman R.L. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 19Lundgren M. Persson U. Larson P. Magnusson C. Smith C.I. Hammarston L. Severinson E. J.

Med. 1990; 172: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), both IL-4 and anti-CD40 mAb are required to induce the expression of the productive ε transcript encoding for IgE (Fig.3) (20Gauchat J.F.

Clark E.A. Saxon A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1836-1842PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we have evaluated the effect of CD86 triggering on ε transcript expression. The expression of both the germline and productive ε mRNA transcripts was increased by IT2.2 in B cells stimulated with IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb (Fig. 3). This result shows that B7-2 triggering increases IgE synthesis by enhancing the expression of ε mRNA transcripts. In addition to inducing IgE and IgG4 production, a stimulation of B cells with IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb induces proliferation (35Clark E.A. Shu G.L. Luscher B. Draves K.E. Banchereau J. Ledbetter J.A. Valentine M.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3873-3880PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we have evaluated the effect of CD86 cross-linking on B cell proliferation. The IT2.2 mAb but not the other anti-CD86 mAbs tested significantly increased B cell proliferation induced by IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb (stimulation index = 3 ± 0.8, mean ± S.D., n = 5) or by IL-13 plus anti-CD40 mAb (stimulation index = 2.7 ± 0.4). This effect was not enhanced when suboptimal concentrations of IL-4 and of anti-CD40 mAb were used in combination (data not shown). Moreover, IT2.2 did not induce or modulate the proliferation of B cells either unstimulated or stimulated with anti-IgM Ab plus IL-2 or with IL-4, IL-13, or anti-CD40 mAb used alone (data not shown). Thus, IT2.2 potentiates IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb-induced B cell proliferation. The CD23-CD21 interaction is involved in IgE and IgG4 synthesis induced by IL-4 plus anti-CD40 mAb (25Bonnefoy J.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2033344321,"The protein splicing element (intein) of the vacuolar ATPase subunit (VMA) of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>catalyzes both protein splicing and site-specific DNA cleavage. It has been demonstrated that the conserved splice junction residues are directly involved in protein splicing and the central dodecapeptide motifs are required for DNA cleavage. To examine whether the splicing activity of the intein can be structurally separated from the endonuclease motifs, we made large in-frame deletions at the central region of the intein. We demonstrate for the first time that protein splicing can proceed efficiently after the removal of the central region of the intein including the endonuclease motifs. Our results suggest that the N- and C-terminal regions of the <i>Sce</i> VMA intein may form a separate domain that is not only catalytically sufficient for protein splicing but also structurally independent from the endonuclease domain."

Bax/Bak lethality was suppressed by coexpression of Bcl-2 family members that are anti-apoptotic in vertebrates, namely Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and A1. Furthermore, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 suppressed Bax toxicity by distinct mechanisms in yeast. Bad, Bcl-xS, and Ced-9 lacked suppressor activity. These inactive proteins bound to anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family but not to Bax or Bak. In contrast, most Bcl-2 family proteins that attenuated death bound to Bax and Bak. However, two mutants of Bcl-xL suppressed Bax-induced cell death while having no Bax binding activity. Therefore, Bcl-xL functions independently of Bax binding, perhaps by interacting with a common target or promoting a pathway that antagonizes Bax. Thus, the pathways downstream of Bax and Bcl-xL may be conserved between vertebrates and yeast. This suppressor assay could be used to isolate components of these pathways. Bcl-2 family members are regulators of cell death. The precise biochemical properties of these proteins are unclear although intrafamily protein-protein association is thought to be involved.

Cell death is a highly regulated process involving interactions among extracellular molecules, intracellular signal transduction pathways, and resident suicide/rescue programs (1Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar, 2Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C. Stoneman V.E.A. Longthorne V.L. Culhane A.C. Williams G.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Studies inCaenorhabditis elegans have pointed to a cell suicide pathway that includes several molecules that have homologs in vertebrates (3Miura M. Yuan J. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1996; 32: 139-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Central among these death-regulating proteins is Ced-9, which suppresses programmed cell death in C. elegans(4Hengartner M. Ellis R. Horvitz H. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Bcl-2, the vertebrate homolog of Ced-9, was identified independently through its translocation in many B cell follicular lymphomas in man (5Tsujimoto Y. Cossman J. Jaffe E. Croce C. Science. 1985; 228: 1440-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar, 6Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5214-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 inhibits cell death in various circumstances in vertebrate cells and functionally substitutes for Ced-9 in C. elegans (7Reed J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar, 8Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Subsequent investigations have identified a number of proteins in vertebrates that are structurally related to Bcl-2 (7Reed J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). These proteins constitute a family, the members of which share a number of regions of homology, termed BH1 (Bcl-2 homology), BH2, and BH3 domains (9Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 10Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Some of these Bcl-2 related proteins, such as Bcl-xL, also prevent cell death, whereas others, such as Bax, provoke cell elimination. The biochemical and biophysical mechanisms that confer these properties on the Bcl-2 family of proteins remain enigmatic, although recent structural data suggest that they may be pore-forming proteins (11Muchmore S.M. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.P. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). However, Bcl-2 and many of its related proteins can participate in homo- and heteromeric complexes, and it has been suggested that the activity of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family is neutralized by their association with anti-apoptotic members (12Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar, 13Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9238-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). There are a number of caveats in the interpretation of the role of Bcl-2 family members in the regulation of cell death in vertebrates. First, the effects of Bcl-2 family members are often assessed in models where cell death is triggered by an exogenous means such as growth factor withdrawal or addition of a toxin or virus to the culture medium. While this is more relevant to the physiological situation, it adds a level of ambiguity as to whether the effects are mediated through intrafamily interactions. Second, a given cell type may already express the gene of interest as well as other known and potentially unknown members of the Bcl-2 family. Thus, there is uncertainty as to precisely which proteins interact to produce the observed effect. Finally, Bcl-2 family members are differentially expressed, andbcl-2- and bcl-x-null mice have distinct phenotypes (14Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Kuida K. Shinkai Y. Louie M.C. Fields L.E. Lucas P.J. Stewart V. Alt F.W. Loh D.Y. Science. 1993; 261: 1584-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 15Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. Loh D.Y. Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Together, these data imply that the various Bcl-2-like proteins have functional differences. Indeed, there are indications that Bcl-xL need not dimerize with Bax to suppress cell killing and that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have differential activities in some assays (14Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Kuida K. Shinkai Y. Louie M.C. Fields L.E. Lucas P.J. Stewart V. Alt F.W. Loh D.Y. Science. 1993; 261: 1584-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 15Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A.

A. 1994; 91: 7350-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, from the mechanistic standpoint, there is a need for a model in which the role of Bcl-2 family members in cell death can be determined without the foregoing ambiguities. Recently, several studies reported that the expression of Bax is lethal in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Hanada M. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J., C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11962-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 20Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 21Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This is despite the fact that yeasts express no identifiable members of the Bcl-2 family and are not known to undergo programmed cell death. This afforded the opportunity to develop a suppressor assay in which the ability of Bcl-2 family members to attenuate Bax killing could be determined quantitatively. Moreover, since the model is in essence the same as a two-hybrid system, protein-protein association can be assessed simultaneously. It is shown that Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and A1 can suppress death induced by Bax and Bak in yeast, whereas Ced-9, Bad, and Bcl-xS are inactive. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL do not have identical structure-activity relationships for death suppression in yeast, indicating that they have distinct modes of action. Moreover, several Bcl-xL mutants suppressed Bax lethality without binding to Bax, indicating that Bcl-xL can function by a mechanism other than direct association with Bax. This implies that mechanisms downstream of Bcl-xL and Bax are conserved in yeast and that this system could be used to isolate these molecules. The S. cerevisiae strain S260 (ura3 trp1) contained a genomicLEXA-operator-LACZ fusion reporter gene and was described previously (22Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast growth, maintenance, and transformations were as described (23Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins with the LexA DNA binding domain were constructed in the yeast expression plasmid, Y.LexA (22Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which carries the S. cerevisiae TRP1 gene as a selectable marker. Fusion proteins with the VP16 transcriptional activation domain were generated in pSD.10a, which harbors theURA3 selection marker (24Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Constructs lacking heterologous fusion sequences were made in pSD.10a after deletion of the VP16 codons. LexA and VP16 fusions of murine Bax, Bcl-2, and A1 were reported previously (22Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding murine Bcl-x, Bak, and Bad were obtained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using mouse brain RNA and polymerase chain reaction primers based upon published sequences. Murine mcl-1 cDNA was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screening for Bax-binding proteins. 1C. Kurschner and J. I. Morgan, unpublished data. A Ced-9 cDNA was a gift from Dr. M. O. Hengartner, and plasmid p996 containing acrmA cDNA (25Ray C. Black R. Kronheim S. Greenstreet T. Sleath P. Salvesen G. Pickup D. Cell. 1992; 69 (2nd Ed.): 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. D. Pickup. Truncation and deletion mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction. The sequences of all constructs were verified. For in vitrotranscription/translation reactions, cDNAs encoding full-length Bcl-xL and two of its mutants (XF14 and XF15) were inserted into the vector pT7βplink (24Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). A full-length murine bax cDNA was cloned in pT7βplink-TagN (22Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this construct, an epitope tag derived from human c-MYC protein is fused to the N terminus of Bax. This epitope is recognized by the monoclonal antibody 9E10. Proteins were translated in vitro as described (22Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MYC-tagged Bax was translated in the absence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Life Science, Inc.), and untagged Bcl-xL and its mutants XF14 and XF15 were translated in the presence of [35S]methionine. For coimmunoprecipitations, 2 μl of the Bax-MYC translation reaction were mixed with 10 μl of the Bcl-xL, XF14, or XF15 translation reactions, respectively. Incubation and washing steps were performed as described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) in NETgel buffer with 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The precipitating antibody was 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) was used to precipitate the immune complexes. S260 was transformed with two plasmids encoding a LexA fusion construct and a VP16 hybrid. Transformants were grown and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described (22Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The development of blue color in the yeast colonies was monitored for 24 h. S260 was (co)transformed with expression plasmids encoding Bcl-2 family members. Selective media containing 2% glucose was inoculated with a single colony of transformants and incubated overnight at 30 °C. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with H2O. Typically, 20 ml of selective medium (with 2% galactose) was inoculated with 2.56 × 107 cells, and incubation was continued. Samples were taken at different time points, and cell density was measured by determining the OD at 660 nm. To compare results from different experiments, a growth index (GI) 2The abbreviations used are: GI, growth index; ICE, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme; TM, transmembrane. was devised. (OD660/22 h − OD660/0 h (cells containing Bax or Bak and the test protein))/(OD660/22 h − OD660/0 h(cells containing Bax or Bak and LexA or VP16)). Yeast cells were lysed mechanically as described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (30 μg/lane) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunostaining was performed in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with a rabbit anti-murine Bax polyclonal antibody, 13686E (1:1000 dilution) (Pharmingen), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antiserum (1:1000) (Amersham), both for 2 h. Immunoblots were developed using diaminobenzidine as chromogen (27Gallagher S. Hurrel J.G.R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY1993: 10.8.1-10.8.14Google Scholar). For Bcl-xL immunostaining, the membrane was stripped of bound antibody, reprobed with a monoclonal anti-Bcl-x antibody, B22620 (1:250) (Transduction Laboratories). The immunoblots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham). Since Bax kills yeast (19Hanada M. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J., C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), additional members of the Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-xS, A1, Mcl-1, Bad, Bak, and Ced-9) were tested for this property. Besides Bax, only Bak was lethal, although it was consistently less potent (Table I). Moreover, like native Bax, the LexA and VP16 fusion proteins of Bax and Bak used in the two-hybrid assay were also lethal (Fig.1, A and B, and Table I), making it possible to correlate binding activity with biological activity in subsequent studies.Table IRelationship between heterodimerization and suppression of cell death for Bcl-2 family members in yeastY.LexABcl-2Bcl-xLBcl-xSA1Mcl-1BadCed-9BaxBakBax Binding−++−++−−++ Suppression1.00 5.18 5.551.01 3.60 8.050.821.10NANDBak Binding−++−++−−++ Suppression1.0029.1529.870.9727.7528.441.241.120.13NAS260 yeast were cotransformed with either VP16-fused Bax or Bak and one of the indicated Bcl-2 family members fused to LexA.

The death-suppressive activities of the Bcl-2 family members were determined in the yeast growth assay. GI values are indicated. ND, not done; NA, not applicable. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments. To quantitatively determine the suppression of Bax/Bak toxicity in yeast, cDNAs encoding LexA or VP16 fusions of various Bcl-2 family members were coexpressed with either Bax or Bak. Coexpression of the Bcl-xL fusion proteins generated for the two-hybrid system inhibited Bax and Bak toxicity (Fig. 1 A and Table I). In addition, LexA fusions of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and A1 inhibited both Bax and Bak killing (Fig. 2 and Table I). Bcl-xS, Bad, and Ced-9 did not attenuate Bax or Bak lethality (Table I). To ensure that the results were not artifacts of LexA or VP16 fusion proteins, these data were confirmed using native (unfused) protein sequences. Both native Bcl-2 (GI, 7.4) and native Bcl-xL (GI, 8.0) suppressed the killing elicited by native Bax (GI, 1.0). In the yeast two-hybrid assay, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and A1 all bound to Bax and Bak, whereas Bcl-xS, Bad, and Ced-9 did not (Table I). Therefore, anti-death activity was associated with the ability to bind to Bax or Bak. Proteins such as Ced-9, Bcl-xS, and Bad that did not bind to Bax/Bak did not inhibit killing, whereas proteins that could associate, such as Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, were inhibitory. Since the lack of death suppressor activity of Ced-9 was unexpected, its association with anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family was determined. LexA-Ced-9 (as well as LexA-Bcl-xS and LexA-Bad) bound to Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and A1 (data not shown). Therefore, Ced-9 had the binding and activity profiles of proteins such as Bcl-xS rather than Bcl-2. To further pursue the relationship between heterodimerization and biological activity, a series of truncation and deletion mutations of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were made. When coexpressed with Bax, the majority of these mutants failed to bind to Bax and did not suppress death (Fig. 2, A and B). However, two Bcl-xL mutants, XF14 and XF15, were active in suppression of Bax toxicity but either bound weakly or not all in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2 A). To ensure that these data were not a product of the LexA sequences, unfused XF14 and XF15 were examined for their suppressive effects on native Bax toxicity and for coimmunoprecipitation with MYC-tagged Bax. Both unfused XF14 (GI, 8.7) and XF15 (GI, 8.8) were potent suppressors of Bax lethality (GI, 1.0). For coimmunoprecipitation, the proteins were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine, whereas a MYC epitope-tagged Bax (MYC-Bax) was translated in the absence of the radionuclide. After appropriate mixing and incubation, Bcl-xL was specifically immunoprecipitated with MYC-Bax but not the MYC epitope alone (Fig.3). In contrast, neither XF14 nor XF15 was precipitated specifically with MYC-Bax and the anti-MYC monoclonal antibody (Fig.3). XF15 showed no evidence of Bax binding. XF14 gave a relatively high background immunoprecipitation that was not augmented by the presence of MYC-Bax, indicating that it does not bind to Bax. This analysis confirms a prior report using these and similar constructs (28Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To preclude the possibility that coexpression of Bcl-xL or the mutants either reduced the expression or promoted the degradation of Bax, steady-state protein levels were determined by immunoblotting. Fig.4 A shows the immunoblot analysis of Bax and Bcl-xL proteins in yeast. Cells were cotransformed with constructs encoding LexA-Bax and one of unfused Bcl-xL mutants, XF14 or XF15. An ∼45-kDa LexA-Bax fusion protein accumulated to maximal levels within 12 h after galactose induction. Expression of ∼26-kDa Bcl-xL, ∼20-kDa XF14, and ∼21-kDa XF15 immunoreactive bands were also detected 12 h after galactose induction. None of the anti-death proteins altered the levels or time course of LexA-Bax expression (Fig.4 A). Additional Bax-reactive proteins of lower molecular mass were also induced with similar kinetics to LexA-Bax. The levels of these proteins were also unaffected by Bcl-xL expression (Fig.4 A). It is unclear whether these bands are proteolytic fragments of LexA-Bax or incomplete transcription/translation products. No such proteins were observed when unfused Bax was expressed with Bcl-xL in yeast (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the additional bands do not represent selective processing of Bax sequences. Whereas expression of Bax is lethal, yeast transformed with the Bax plasmid did grow if cultured for longer periods (data not shown). This phenomenon is important in that it has implications for the use of this system as a suppressor screening assay. The growth effect could arise in a number of ways. First, a mutation in the vector could either inhibit expression of Bax or render it biologically inactive. Second, yeast may produce their own suppressor of Bax or lose a target of Bax. To test these possibilities, yeasts were cotransformed with Bax and Bcl-xL and subjected to immunoblot analysis after 100 h of culture. Fig. 4 B shows that cells containing Bax and LexA plasmids no longer expressed immunoreactive Bax. However, an ∼21-kDa Bax was still present in the cells containing Bax and LexA-Bcl-xL. Thus, mutations are selected for in Bax-expressing yeast that result in a loss of Bax expression. In the presence of Bcl-xL, this selective pressure is absent, and high (normally lethal) levels of full-length Bax are expressed. This effect must be considered when using this suppressor assay to identify proteins that functionally interact with Bax/Bak. Since Bax and Bcl-xL may function independently, the mechanisms that mediate Bax toxicity were investigated. Another study has established that Bax lethality in yeast is not associated with DNA laddering (21Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), although it may involve proteolysis. Indeed, proteases belonging to the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) subfamily (recently termed caspases) have been implicated in cell death in phylogenetically disparate species (2Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C. Stoneman V.E.A. Longthorne V.L. Culhane A.C. Williams G.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). A search of the yeast genome for the consensus active site of ICE proteases (QACRG) yielded no hits, suggesting that these enzymes could not mediate death in yeast. To further examine this point, yeasts were cotransformed with Bax and CrmA, an inhibitor of ICE proteases that is derived from cowpox virus (25Ray C. Black R. Kronheim S. Greenstreet T. Sleath P. Salvesen G. Pickup D. Cell. 1992; 69 (2nd Ed.): 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). CrmA did not rescue Bax toxicity and alone had no effect upon yeast growth (data not shown). Together, the data indicate that ICE-like proteases do not mediate Bax lethality in yeast. Several studies have suggested that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have distinct properties (15Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. Loh D.Y. Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 17Tuscano J.M. Druey K.M. Riva A. Pena J. Thompson C.B. Kehrl J.H. Blood. 1996; 88: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gottschalk A.R. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Quintans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7350-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structure-activity relationships for Bax dimerization and suppression were determined for the two molecules in yeast. Two regions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL distinguished the biological properties of the two proteins. We confirm that the transmembrane (TM) domain of Bcl-2 is not essential for suppression of Bax toxicity in yeast and its elimination does not affect Bax binding (see mutant BF3 in Fig. 2 B) (21Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, elimination of the TM domain in Bcl-xL leads to both the loss of Bax binding and suppressor activity (see mutant XF3 in Fig.2 A). As shown above, deletion of the putative loop region in Bcl-xL (mutants XF14 and XF15) (11Muchmore S.M. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.P. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar) results in a loss of Bax binding but retention of Bax suppressor activity (Fig. 2 A). Whereas an equivalent mutation in Bcl-2 (BF6) retained suppressor activity, it still bound well to Bax (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that the loop region may be important for the interaction of Bcl-xL with Bax, whereas the equivalent domain in Bcl-2 is not. Together, the results indicate that whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, both, can suppress Bax toxicity in yeast, they may not do so in an identical manner. As in vertebrate cell death models, members of the Bcl-2 family can be grouped into three functional classes in yeast. The first group comprises proteins, such as Bax and Bak, which are lethal per se. The second group includes Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and A1, which bind to and suppress Bax and Bak lethality. The third group bind to anti- but not pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. These proteins, which include Bad, Bcl-xS, and the C. elegansCed-9, are functionally inactive in terms of direct killing or death suppression. In vertebrates, proteins such as Bad and Bcl-xS are not considered to be lethal per se but rather are thought to potentiate killing by binding to anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (29Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar, 30Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar). Thus, mammalian Bcl-2 family members have the same spectrum of biological activities in yeast as they do in vertebrate cells. One unexpected result was that whereas Ced-9 did bind to anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, it did not bind to Bax and did not suppress Bax/Bak killing. Although we can find no study that has used Ced-9 to rescue death in a vertebrate cell, it is the presumed homolog of Bcl-2 (8Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) and was expected to suppress killing. However, the properties of Ced-9 are more akin to those of Bcl-xS than they are to Bcl-2. It is conceivable that Ced-9 binds specifically to a C. elegans homolog of Bax, although no such gene has been identified. However, the possibility exists that family members such as Ced-9 and Bcl-xS might exert their functions through mechanisms other than intrafamily binding. Genetic analysis in C. elegans has shown that Ced-9 acts via Ced-4, a protein of unknown function, and Ced-3, an ICE-like cysteine protease (4Hengartner M. Ellis R. Horvitz H. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). It is possible that Ced-9, and by implication Bcl-xS and Bad, might act by binding to Ced-4 or related proteins in vertebrates. However, whereas many studies have implicated cysteine proteases in cell death in vertebrates (2Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C. Stoneman V.E.A. Longthorne V.L. Culhane A.C. Williams G.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that ICE-like proteases mediate Bcl-2 family effects in yeast. First, Bax lethality is not inhibited by coexpression of the ICE protease inhibitor, CrmA. Second, no consensus sequence for the active site of ICE proteases has been found in the yeast genome. Therefore, Bax lethality may not involve the activation of ICE-like proteases in yeast. Indeed, Bax killing has been shown to be independent of this class of proteases in at least one vertebrate model (31Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Analysis of the structural requirements of Bcl-xL for suppression of Bax toxicity in yeast revealed that deletions at both the N and C termini eliminated biological activity. In one mutant, XF3, deletion of the last 22 amino acids, which included the TM domain, resulted in loss of suppressor activity. This result suggests that membrane targeting is essential for the protective effect of Bcl-xL in yeast. However, the equivalent domain in Bcl-2 is not required for rescue (19Hanada M. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J., C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11962-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), indicating that these two related proteins may have divergent mechanisms of action. Such a notion is underscored by the distinct phenotypes of mice that lack functional bcl-2 or bcl-x alleles and by the unique protective effects of Bcl-xL in some cell death models (14Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Kuida K. Shinkai Y. Louie M.C. Fields L.E. Lucas P.J. Stewart V. Alt F.W. Loh D.Y. Science. 1993; 261: 1584-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 15Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. Loh D.Y. Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 17Tuscano J.M.

A. 1994; 91: 7350-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Whereas the TM domain is thought to be necessary for the activity of Bcl-xL in vertebrate cells, the situation for Bcl-2 is controversial (12Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar, 32Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaere E. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 33Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the recent demonstration that Bcl-xL has structural similarities to the pore-forming subunit of diphtheria toxin suggests that its biological function may occur at or within cellular membranes (11Muchmore S.M. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.P. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Therefore it is conceivable that there are proteins in yeast that can dock Bcl-2, but not Bcl-xL, to membranes thereby obviating the requirement for a TM domain. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can also be discriminated by their structure-activity relationship for binding to Bax. Mutants of Bcl-xL that had the putative loop domain deleted (XF14 and XF15) did not bind Bax, whereas an equivalent deletion in Bcl-2 (BF6) did bind in the two-hybrid assay. Since the loop regions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are not conserved, these data may be an indication that these domains can selectively modify dimerization, although they may not be part of the dimerization interface. Dimerization between Bcl-2 family members is considered central to their biological activity. Indeed, in one model it is the stoichiometry of various pro- to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members that is supposed to determine cell fate (34Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). However, the view that dimerization is the sole determinant of activity has been questioned. For example, some Bcl-xL mutants that failed to associate with Bax still rescued 70–80% of Sindbis virus-induced cell death (16Cheng E.H.-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, it could be argued that Sindbis virus-triggered cell death may not be mediated by Bax. Indeed, there is evidence of Bax-independent cell death pathways inbax-null mice (35Knudson C.M. Tung K.S.K. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Recently, some Bcl-xL mutations were described that had reduced, or no, binding activity to Bax but that rescued vertebrate cells from death triggered by IL-3 deprivation (11Muchmore S.M. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.P. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar,28Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Therefore we compared the activity of these deletions with other Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 mutants as suppressors of Bax toxicity in yeast. All full-length Bcl-2 family members and mutants that bound to Bax inhibited killing, whereas those that did not bind were inactive. However, the two internal deletion mutants of Bcl-xL, XF14 and XF15, that did not bind to Bax were potent suppressors. This indicates that dimerization is not essential for Bcl-xL to suppress Bax lethality in yeast. The observation that Bcl-xL can antagonize Bax killing in yeast independent of heterodimerization has several important implications. First, it argues against the effects of Bax in yeast as being nonspecific toxicity that can be attenuated by any Bax-binding protein. Second, it suggests that Bax and Bcl-xL either interact with, or compete for, a common downstream target or pathway in yeast. Alternatively, they could influence antagonistic mechanisms. Third, the data suggest that Bax and Bcl-xL act upon mechanisms that have been conserved from yeast to mammals, although these processes may only have been adapted for the control of cell elimination in multicellular organisms. The assay described here can be used as a genetic suppressor screen to identify potential components of this pathway in yeast and vertebrates. We thank Dr. Craig B. Thompson for helpful discussions and Dr. Steven Dalton for providing the yeast expression plasmids pSD.10a and Y.LexA, in vitro translation plasmids, and the S. cerevisiae reporter strain S260."

Radioligand binding studies demonstrated that the purified receptor, in the reconstituted vesicles, bound its tridecapeptide ligand (α-factor) with a K D (155 nm) consistent with the affinity expected for this receptor in the absence of its associated G protein. Efficient restoration of ligand binding activity upon reconstitution required the addition of solubilized membranes prepared from a yeast strain lacking the receptor.

The α-factor receptor (Ste2p) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; BAP, bacterial alkaline phosphatase; DBM,n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; FT, FLAG tag; G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; HT, His6 tag; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine; POPG, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol.1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; BAP, bacterial alkaline phosphatase; DBM,n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; FT, FLAG tag; G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; HT, His6 tag; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine; POPG, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol. that, upon the binding of a ligand, transduce a signal via an associated guanine-nucleotide binding protein (G protein) (1Dohlman H.G.

Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 113-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GPCRs function in physiological processes ranging from vision (the rhodopsins), to smell (the olfactory receptors), to neurotransmission (e.g. muscarinic acetylcholine, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors) (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 2Fraser C.M. Lee N.H. Pellegrino S.M. Kerlavage A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 113-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the binding of the peptide pheromones (a-factor and α-factor) to their receptors initiates the cascade of events that lead to the mating of haploid yeast cells (3Blumer K.J. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4363-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,4Kurjan J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 147-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). GPCRs are integral membrane proteins ranging in size from 400 to 1000 amino acids. Hydrophobicity analysis of the GPCRs reveals the presence of 7 hydrophobic regions predicted to form membrane-spanning α-helices, suggesting a similar structural arrangement of these proteins in the membrane (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Several amino acids in the hydrophobic domains are conserved among all GPCRs, suggesting their importance in the proper folding of the protein within the membrane. Other amino acids are conserved only within a particular GPCR subclass and are therefore thought to confer binding specificity for a certain class of ligands (5Hibert M.F. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar, 6Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Hibert M. J. Med.

The hydrophilic domains of GPCRs (the extracellular and intracellular loops and the cytosolic tails) exhibit a large variation in size and amino acid composition. Site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical characterization of the GPCRs has demonstrated that for the smaller ligands (like catecholamines) the transmembrane helices 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 carry determinants for ligand recognition (6Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Hibert M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3448-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 8Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The binding of larger ligands, such as peptides or glycoproteins, is less well characterized, but the extracellular hydrophilic domains of the receptor appear to be involved in ligand binding to some extent (8Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 9Coughlin S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The third cytoplasmic loop of the receptors is implicated in the interaction with and activation of the associated heterotrimeric G protein (10Clark C.D. Palzkill T. Botstein D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8831-8841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11König B. Gratzel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Detailed biophysical studies of GPCRs (such as structure determination by x-ray or electron crystallography) have been hampered by the difficulties in obtaining large quantities of purified receptors from natural sources. One exception is bovine rhodopsin, available in large quantities from bovine rod cells. Recently, Schertler and Hargrave (12Schertler G.F. Hargrave P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11578-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) succeeded in forming well diffracting two-dimensional crystals of rhodopsin. The electron diffraction data permitted the production of a projection map of rhodopsin at 9 Å resolution, showing high density areas corresponding to the seven putative membrane-spanning α-helices. The successful determination of a high resolution structure of bacteriorhodopsin (13Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckman E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2520) Google Scholar) and light-harvesting complex II (14Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar) by electron diffraction of two-dimensional crystals suggests that a high resolution structure of rhodopsin may be available in the future. Overexpression in heterologous expression systems (such as insect cells, yeast, or E. coli) has been used to produce GPCRs. Several GPCRs have been expressed in a functional form using the baculovirus system, including the D4 and D2 dopamine receptors (15Mills A. Allet B. Bernard A. Chabert C. Brandt E. Cavegn C. Chollet A. Kawashima E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Javitch J.A. Kaback J. Li X. Karlin A. J. Recept. Res. 1994; 14: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (17Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The D2S dopamine receptor has been functionally expressed in both S. cerevisiae andSchizosaccharomyces pombe (19Sander P. Grünewald S. Maul G. Reiländer H. Michel H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 1193: 255-262Google Scholar, 20Sander P. Grünewald S. Reiländer H. Michel H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and an E. coli expression system has also been successfully used for expression of GPCRs (21Chapot M.P. Eshdat Y. Marullo S. Guillet J.G. Charbit A. Strosberg A.D. Delavier-Klutchko C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Grisshammer R. Duckworth R. Henderson R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Yeast-based expression systems for GPCRs have several advantages over other systems. First, the cost of growing yeast in large fermentors is small compared with the costs of insect cell maintenance and growth. Second, a yeast-based system is genetically flexible. It is possible to easily construct, express, and purify mutant versions of receptors without the complications of recombinant virus selection and viral amplification encountered in the baculovirus system. Third, certain vertebrate GPCRs heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiaecells are able to elicit growth arrest in response to their natural agonists (23King K. Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 250: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 24Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Hadcock J.R. Ozenberger B.A. Pausch M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As a result, mutants of these GPCRs (truncations or point mutants useful in biophysical studies) can be functionally characterized in S. cerevisiae cells. Here we describe overexpression, purification, and initial in vitro characterization of Ste2p, the α-factor receptor fromS. cerevisiae. Because the purification requires only a single column and yields approximately 1 mg of receptor protein, detailed biophysical studies of the α-factor receptor are now possible. Other results using this system indicate that this expression and purification protocol is applicable to the overexpression and purification of other GPCRs, making future structural work on this class of molecules less expensive and more tractable.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The pNED1 vector (see Fig. 1) was constructed using the progenitor plasmid pG3 (28Schena M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). TheSTE2 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two sequences functioning as affinity tags, encoding DYKDDDDK (the FLAG tag (FT)) and HHHHHH (His6 tag (HT)), were introduced at the C terminus of Ste2p. Once constructed, the nucleotide sequence of the entire STE2 gene open reading frame was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). Radioligand binding medium (YM1 + i medium) contained 5 g/liter yeast extract, 10 g/liter peptone, 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 10 g/liter succinic acid, 6 g/liter sodium hydroxide, 10 g/liter glucose, 10 mmNaN3, 10 mm KF, and 10 mm p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester (30Raths S.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Factor is a tridecapeptide with the sequence Trp-His-Trp-Leu-Gln-Leu-Lys-Pro-Gly-Gln-Pro-Met-Tyr. [Nle12]α-Factor has an affinity for Ste2p that is indistinguishable from wild-type α-Factor (30Raths S.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H,Nle12]α-Factor was produced by catalytic tritiation of a dehydroproline residue as described previously (30Raths S.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. The peptide was then diluted to 0.01 mg/ml with a storage buffer (20% ethanol, 1 mm methionine, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. [d-Ala9,Nle12]α-Factor and [l-Ala9,Nle12]α-factor were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems synthesizer and purified to near homogeneity by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Details of the synthesis and the biological activity of these peptides against whole cells will be described elsewhere. The masses of all peptides used in these studies were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Because all of the α-factor peptides used in this work contained the norleucine substitution at position 12 (which makes the peptides more resistant to oxidation) instead of the naturally occurring methionine, subsequent references to these peptides in the text shall lack the Nle12 denotation for the sake of clarity. The nucleotide sequence encoding the final 131 residues of Ste2p was inserted in frame into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and introduced into the BL21 DE3 E. coli strain by transformation. The pET15b expression vector allows for the rapid purification of expressed proteins, primarily due to the fact that cloning into the vector introduces an N-terminal polyhistidine tag. The His-tagged 131-amino acid Ste2p subdomain was purified to homogeneity by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Rabbits were immunized essentially as described by Harlow and Lane (31Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). Bleeds were tested for immunoreactivity by immunoblot analysis and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Antibodies generated in this work showed no cross-reactivity with whole cell extracts from strain DK102, which carries a deletion mutation (ste2Δ) of the α-factor receptor gene. All manipulations with membranes and all purification steps were carried out in the presence of the following protease inhibitor mixture: 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 17.4 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. DK102, RC629, DK102 [pNED1], and BJ2168 [pNED1] were grown to midexponential phase (A 600 ≈ 1). DK102 and RC629 were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium (32Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1979Google Scholar), while the strains transformed with pNED1 were grown at 30 °C in a synthetic medium without tryptophan (32Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1979Google Scholar) to maintain selection for the plasmid. For the large-scale growth of cells for the purification of Ste2p.FT.HT, BJ2168 cells carrying the pNED1 plasmid were grown at 26 °C to A 600 ≈ 3 in medium lacking tryptophan using a 200 liter fermentor. Cell paste was harvested, frozen as cakes (60 g), and stored at −80 °C until use. All steps were performed at 4 °C, and all buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors. For small-scale experiments, cells equivalent toA 600 = 5 were resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9) and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 700 × g, and the membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 150,000 × g. For large scale preparation of membranes for purification of Ste2p.FT.HT, approximately 60 g of yeast cell paste (1 frozen cake) were thawed and resuspended in 90 ml of 10% (w/v) sucrose in buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, and 500 nmα-factor). The cells were lysed by vigorous shaking with glass beads for three 2-min pulses in a Braun Scientific (Allentown, PA) cell homogenizer. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 700 × g, and the membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 186,000 × g for at least 1 h. Cell lysate corresponding to a suspension of A 600 = 5 (in 100 μl) was solubilized in sample buffer (50 mmNa2CO3, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 15% (w/v) sucrose, 2.5% SDS). A volume corresponding to 3% of this starting material was subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For immunoblot analysis, the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and analyzed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal 131 amino acids of wild-type Ste2p. The dilution factors were chosen so as to give comparable signals when the immune complexes were visualized by ECL. The response of cells carrying pNED1 to α-factor was analyzed by halo assay (33Julius D. Blair L. Brake A. Sprague G. Thorner J. Cell. 1983; 32: 839-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Different amounts of α-factor (100 ng, 500 ng, and 1000 ng) were spotted on filter paper disks and placed on agar plates containing DK102, RC629, or DK102 [pNED1]. Plates were grown at 30 °C for 48 h, and the sizes of the halos were determined. All steps were performed at 4 °C, and all buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors and 500 nm α-factor. Yeast membranes from 60-g cells were homogenized in 90 ml of 10% (w/v) sucrose in the buffer A described under “Membrane Preparation.” Discontinuous sucrose gradients were made from 14 ml of 43% (w/v) and 6 ml of 53% (w/v) sucrose in buffer A. Aliquots (15 ml) of the homogenized membranes were layered on the gradients and centrifuged overnight at 27,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28 rotor. The band between 10–43% (w/v) sucrose was collected, diluted with dH2O, and centrifuged at 186,000 × gfor 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of 50% glycerol and added to 25 ml of 2% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DBM) (Anatrace, Maumee, OH), 50% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and 150 mm NaCl. After 1 h of incubation, unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 186,000 ×g for 30 min. The soluble fraction was diluted with 12.5 ml of 99% glycerol and 200 ml of buffer B (0.075% DBM, 15% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 0.4 mg/ml soybean l-α-lecithin (type II-S from Sigma)). The sample was loaded at 12 ml/h onto a 4-ml Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The column was then washed with 80 ml of buffer B. The concentrations of NaCl and glycerol were reduced by washing with 20 ml of buffer C (buffer B with 150 mm NaCl) and 60 ml of buffer D (buffer C with 7.5% glycerol). Ste2p.FT.HT was eluted with buffer D adjusted to 200 mm imidazole (pH 6). Protein composition was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on high Tris 12% gels according to Fling and Gregerson (34Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Deglycosylation of Ste2p.FT.HT was carried out using PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Purified Ste2p.FT.HT (0.17 μg in 20 μl) was incubated with 30 units of PNGase F at room temperature for 1 h. The deglycosylation products were analyzed by immunoblot using an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The method used was a modification of the octyl glucoside-mediated reconstitution of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (35Lévy D. Gulik A. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 508: 283-298Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG) were mixed 60:40 (w:w) in chloroform and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. Remaining traces of solvent were removed under vacuum for at least 1 h. The dried lipid film was suspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA at a concentration of 7.5 mg of lipid/ml. Liposomes were obtained by bath sonication for 1 h at 10–20 °C under nitrogen gas. The liposomes were diluted to 3.75 mg of lipid/ml and then saturated with the detergent n-nonyl-β-d-glucoside (Anatrace) as follows. Incorporation of the detergent into vesicles was monitored by measuring the A 540 of the lipid-detergent suspension until the initial turbidity just started to decrease rapidly. The pooled Ni-NTA fractions containing purified Ste2p.FT.HT (∼10 ml at a concentration of ∼0.1 mg Ste2p.FT.HT/ml) were incubated with 6.5 ml of the detergent-saturated liposomes for 1 h at 4 °C. Excess detergent was removed by overnight batch adsorption to 0.4 ml of moist Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) per ml of total suspension at 4 °C. The resulting suspension of proteoliposomes was separated from the Bio-Beads and then collected by centrifugation at 229,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was washed with the HEPES-buffered solution before resuspension and use in radioligand binding assays. For reconstitutions in the presence of solubilized yeast membranes, the above protocol was modified as follows. Total DK102 (ste2Δ) membranes were isolated as described under “Membrane Preparation” and solubilized at a final protein concentration of at least 10 mg/ml in 1% DBM, 45% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. After mixing for 1 h at 4 °C, unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 229,000 × g for 45 min. The solubilized DK102 (ste2Δ) extract (2 ml) was incubated with a 1-ml aliquot of the pooled Ni-NTA fractions containing purified Ste2p.FT.HT for 3 h at 4 °C. The detergent-saturated, 60:40 POPC:POPG liposomes (3 ml) were then added to this mixture, and the subsequent steps were carried out as described above. The concentration of Ste2p.FT.HT present in reconstituted liposomes was determined by quantitative immunoblot. The accuracy of this measurement technique was confirmed by comparing the values determined this way with the values determined by the Bradford protein assay on purified Ste2p.FT.HT solubilized with DBM, the epitope-tagged FLAG-BAP protein standard (Sigma) in DBM, and bovine serum albumin in DBM. In brief, serial dilutions of both the FLAG-BAP protein and the liposome suspension were electrophoresed on the same SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were then immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting and probed with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. The dilution factors of the FLAG-BAP protein and of the liposome suspension were chosen so as to give comparable signals when the immune complexes were visualized by ECL. This quantitative immunoblot technique has also been used to measure the amount of Ste2p.FT.HT present in membrane preparations. The values obtained were consistent with the values obtained from radioligand binding measurements. The dissociation constant (K D) and the number of binding sites per cell (B max) for the binding of [3H]α-factor to whole cells were determined using minor modifications of the procedure of Raths et al. (30Raths S.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was measured by adding a 1000-fold molar excess of competing non-radioactive α-factor. This approach gives similar values to those obtained for the nonspecific association of [3H]α-factor with MATα cells, which do not produce Ste2p (data not shown). Determination of theK D and B max for the binding of the [3H]α-factor to isolated cell membranes was performed essentially as described by Blumer and Thorner (3Blumer K.J. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4363-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), with two exceptions. First, the binding buffer was replaced with YM1 + i medium. Second, the membrane amounts from different strains were normalized using their A 600 rather than their total protein content assessed via the Bradford method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). This normalization method was motivated by the observation that membrane lipids interfered with accurate assessment of protein concentration. By usingA 600 of the membrane suspension, a more reasonable approximation of bulk membranes could be made as a means to normalize the total amount of membrane protein from strain to strain. For determination of K D andB max for the purified receptor, Ste2p.FT.HT was reconstituted into lipid vesicles, resuspended in YM1 + i medium, and then subjected to ligand binding measurements. The reactions were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, diluted with 1.5 ml of ice-cold YM1 + i medium, and rapidly filtered through GF/F glass microfibre filters (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) presoaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine (Sigma) (3Blumer K.J. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4363-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The reaction tubes and filters were washed three times with 1.5 ml of ice-cold YM1 + i medium. The amount of bound [3H]α-factor was determined by scintillation counting of the glass filters in ScintiVerse BD scintillation mixture (Fisher) after overnight solubilization. Nonspecific binding was determined as described above. K D and B maxwere determined for each experiment using least squares fitting analysis to the Langmuir isotherm equation [Bound] =B max/(1 + K D /[Free]). All manipulations in these studies were carried out using minisorp tubes (Fisher) and siliconized pipette tips (Fisher) to reduce adsorption of [3H]α-factor to plasticware. For the generation of competition binding curves using isolated membranes containing the overexpressed receptor, a concentrated suspension of membranes from strain DK102 [pNED1] was diluted to a finalA 600 of 0.001 (approximately 10 μg/ml of membrane protein). This concentration was chosen to minimize ligand depletion that would invalidate the estimation of K D from IC50. [3H]α-Factor was added to the diluted membrane suspension to a final concentration of 4 nm. Two peptides were compared for their ability to displace the bound [3H]α-factor, [l-Ala9]α-factor and [d-Ala9]α-factor. Concentrations of the α-factor analogs were determined using theA 280 for each peptide as determined by Rathset al. (30Raths S.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation constants (K D) for each analog were estimated using the equation K D, Analog = IC50/(1 + [Tracer]/K D, Tracer), where IC50 is the concentration of analog required to compete 50% of specifically bound [3H]α-factor. Incubations were carried out at room temperature for 90 min and then collected on glass filters as described above. [3H]α-Factor competition studies on the purified receptor were similar to those for membranes except that the concentration of [3H]α-factor used in the assays was 40 nm. The sequence modifications made to the C terminus of the receptor did not compromise its ability to mediate growth arrest in response to α-factor, as demonstrated in an in vivo bioassay (see Fig. 2). DK102 (which does not express Ste2p) showed no response to α-factor, as expected. RC629 and DK102 [pNED1] (Fig. 1) showed similar halo patterns (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the FLAG and His6"
https://openalex.org/W2008814445,"The region between the 10th and 12th cysteine (Cys88-Cys105 in human thyroid-stimulating hormone β-subunit (hTSHβ)) of the glycoprotein hormone β-subunits corresponds to the disulfide-linked seat-belt region. It wraps around the common α-subunit and has been implicated in regulating specificity between human choriogonadotropin (hCG) and human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH), but determinants of hTSH specificity are unknown. To characterize the role of this region for hTSH, we constructed hTSH chimeras in which the entire seat-belt region Cys88-Cys105 or individual intercysteine segments Cys88-Cys95 and Cys95-Cys105 were replaced with the corresponding sequences of hCG and hFSH or alanine cassettes. Alanine cassette mutagenesis of hTSH showed that the Cys95-Cys105 segment of the seat-belt was more important for TSH receptor binding and signal transduction than the Cys88-Cys95 determinant loop region. Replacing the entire seat-belt of hTSHβ with the hCG sequence conferred full hCG receptor binding and activation to the hTSH chimera, whereas TSH receptor binding and activation were abolished. Conversely, introduction of the hTSHβ seat-belt sequence into hCGβ generated an hCG chimera that bound to and activated the TSH receptor but not the CG/lutropin (LH) receptor. In contrast, an hTSH chimera bearing hFSH seat-belt residues did not possess any follitropic activity, and its thyrotropic activity was only slightly reduced. This may in part be due to the fact that the net charge of the seat-belt is similar in hTSH and hFSH but different from hCG. However, exchanging other regions of charge heterogeneity between hTSHβ and hFSHβ did not confer follitropic activity to hTSH. Thus, exchanging the seat-belt region between hTSH and hCG switches hormonal specificity in a mutually exclusive fashion. In contrast, the seat-belt appears not to discriminate between the TSH and the FSH receptors, indicating for the first time that domains outside the seat-belt region contribute to glycoprotein hormone specificity. The region between the 10th and 12th cysteine (Cys88-Cys105 in human thyroid-stimulating hormone β-subunit (hTSHβ)) of the glycoprotein hormone β-subunits corresponds to the disulfide-linked seat-belt region.

Thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)) 1The abbreviations used are: TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; hTSH, human TSH; hTSHβ, human TSH β-subunit; CG, choriogonadotropin; FSH, follitropin; LH, lutropin; rh, recombinant human; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; wt, wild-type.1The abbreviations used are: TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; hTSH, human TSH; hTSHβ, human TSH β-subunit; CG, choriogonadotropin; FSH, follitropin; LH, lutropin; rh, recombinant human; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; wt, wild-type. choriogonadotropin (CG), follitropin (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)), and lutropin (luteinizing hormone (LH)) are structurally related heterodimers that together form the glycoprotein hormone family (1Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). These hormones belong to the superfamily of cystine-knot growth factors (2Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C.

Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of the α-subunit, which is encoded by a single gene, is identical in these hormones. The distinct β-subunits, despite conservation of all 12 cysteine residues and similar overall folding, are sufficiently different to confer specificity to each hormone (1Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F.

The molecular mechanisms whereby glycoprotein hormones activate their receptors are largely unknown, but multiple contact points between ligand and receptor, perhaps in a stepwise fashion, appear necessary to induce conformational changes favoring receptor G-protein coupling and subsequent second messenger generation (5Szkudlinski M.W.

Previous studies have shown that the region between the 10th and 12th cysteine of the β-subunit is important not only for subunit association, receptor binding, as well as activation (14Keutmann H.T.

In the crystal structure of hCG (2Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W.

This seat-belt consists of two intercysteine segments, a surface-exposed hydrophilic loop between the 10th and 11th cysteine (Cys88-Cys95 in hTSHβ) and a carboxyl-terminal segment between the 11th and 12th cysteine (Cys95-Cys105 in hTSHβ), and is in close proximity to α-subunit domains important for the structural integrity and activity of the glycoprotein hormones (2Lapthorn A.J.

Canfield R.E. Hendrickson W.A. Structure ( Lond. ). 1994; 2: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In contrast to the work on the gonadotropins, the role of the seat-belt for hTSH is not known. A single study using a set of overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the entire hTSH subunit (21Morris J.C. McCormick D.J. Ryan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1881-1884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that none of the peptides encompassing the seat-belt region, hTSHβ 81–85 or hTSHβ 91–105, inhibited TSH receptor binding, but a peptide containing the carboxyl terminus (β101–112) possessed the highest TSH receptor binding activity. However, the role of the seat-belt region in the context of the intact hTSH heterodimer has not been investigated. Interestingly, recent studies on a naturally occurring hTSHβ mutation from patients with secondary hypothyroidism have shown the importance of Cys105 (corresponding to Cys110 in hCG) for hTSH activity (22Medeiros-Neto G. Herodotou D.T. Rajan S. Kommareddi S. de Lacerda L. Sandrini R. Boguszewski C.S. Hollenberg A.N. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. J. Clin.

In the present study, using a chimeric mutagenesis approach, we demonstrate the importance of the seat-belt for hTSH action as well as specificity. Moreover, our findings reveal previously unrecognized differences in the regulation of specificity among the glycoprotein hormones. The following materials were generous gifts.

Individual intercysteine segments C10-C11 (hTSHβ Cys88-Cys95) or C11-C12 (hTSHβ Cys95-Cys105) of the hTSH β-minigene were replaced with nucleotides coding for the respective sequence of hCG and hFSH or Ala cassettes. To replace the entire seat-belt (hTSHβ Cys88-Cys105), chimeras with individually mutated intercysteine segments were used as templates for subsequent PCR reactions. The hTSHβ seat-belt was introduced into the hCG β-subunit in a single PCR reaction using a primer coding for the entire hTSHβ seat-belt. Further hTSH/hFSH chimeras were constructed in which the carboxyl-terminal residues hTSHβ 105–112 or amino acids hTSHβ 44–52 were replaced with the sequence of hFSH. In addition, Asp94 of the determinant loop was replaced with Lys (TSHβLys94) or Glu (TSHβGlu94). After subcloning into the expression vectors, the entire PCR products of all constructs were sequenced to verify the mutations and to rule out any undesired polymerase errors. Construction of the quadruple α-subunit mutant bearing Lys residues at positions α13, 14, 16, and 20 (α4K) was described previously (13Szkudlinski M.W. Teh N.G. Grossmann M. Tropea J.E.

After culture in CHO serum-free medium (CHO-SFM, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 48 h, conditioned media including control medium from mock transfections were harvested, concentrated with Centriprep 10 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and stored at −70 °C to prevent neuraminidase digestion. Wild type and mutant hTSH analogs were quantified with a panel of four different hTSH immunoassays, which were described in detail previously (12Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Dias J.A. Xia H. Wong R. Puett D. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hCG immunoreactivities were measured with two different specific third-generation immunoassays without crossreactivity to other glycoprotein hormones (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), and hFSH immunoreactivity was measured with an hFSH-specific third-generation immunoassay (Nichols Institute). The TSH receptor-binding activity of wild type and hTSH mutants was determined by their ability to displace125I-bTSH from a solubilized porcine thyroid membrane receptor preparation (Kronus, Dana Point, CA), as described previously (10Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Zeng H. Kraiem Z. Ji I. Tropea J.E. Ji T.H. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 948-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding to the CG/LH receptor was studied in MA-10 cells following a previously employed protocol (13Szkudlinski M.W. Teh N.G. Grossmann M. Tropea J.E. Weintraub B.D. Nat.

Zhang Y. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25289-25294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the various chimeras to induce cAMP production was studied at the TSH receptor using JP09 cells (23Costagliola S. Swillens S. Niccoli P. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Ludgate M. Endocrinology. 1992; 75: 1540-1544Google Scholar), at the CG/LH receptor using MA-10 cells (24Ascoli M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13034-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells in 96-well tissue culture plates were incubated in a modified Krebs Ringer buffer for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with serial dilutions of wild type and mutant hTSH, as well as control medium from mock transfections. The amount of cAMP released into the medium was assayed by radioimmunoassay (10Grossmann M. Szkudlinski M.W. Zeng H. Kraiem Z. Ji I. Tropea J.E. Ji T.H. Weintraub B.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 948-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Progesterone production at the CG/LH or FSH receptor was determined using a commercially available progesterone radioimmunoassay kit (ICN) after incubation of the chimeric constructs with MA-10 cells or Y-1 cells, respectively, as detailed previously (20Dias J.A. Zhang Y. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25289-25294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Replacing individual intercysteine segments C10-C11 of the hTSH β-subunit (the determinant loop, hTSHβ Cys88-Cys95) or C11-C12 (the carboxyl-terminal segment, hTSHβ Cys95-Cys105) (Fig.1) with Ala cassettes or with the corresponding sequences of hCG and hFSH generated hTSHβ constructs designated89Ala94, 96Ala104,89CG94, 96CG104,89FSH94 and 96FSH104, and exchange of the entire hTSH β seat-belt chimeras89CG104 and 89FSH104. The hCG/hTSH chimera 94TSH109 was obtained by introduction of the hTSHβ seat-belt residues into the hCG β-subunit (Fig. 2). In addition, hTSHβ Asp94, which is conserved in all known β-subunits and essential for hCG activity (27Chen F. Wang Y. Puett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19357-19361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was replaced with Lys (hTSHβLys94) or with Glu (hTSHβGlu94). Finally, sequences of the hTSH β-subunit outside the seat-belt were replaced with the corresponding sequence of hFSH to create 44FSH52 and105FSH112. These regions were chosen because they display the greatest charge heterogeneity among these β-subunits, based on the proposed role of variable charges for glycoprotein hormone specificity (17Moore W.T.

KTR1 and KTR3encode related proteins that are highly similar to the Kre2p/Mnt1p Golgi α1,2-mannosyltransferase (Lussier, M., Camirand, A., Sdicu, A.-M., and Bussey, H. (1993) Yeast 9, 1057–1063; Mallet, L., Bussereau, F., and Jacquet, M. (1994) Yeast 10, 819–831). Examination of the electrophoretic mobility of a specifically O-linked protein from mutants and an analysis of their total O-linked mannosyl chains demonstrates that Ktr1p, Ktr3p, and Kre2p/Mnt1p have overlapping roles and collectively add most of the second and the third α1,2-linked mannose residues onO-linked oligosaccharides. Determination of the mobility of the specifically N-linked glycoprotein invertase in different null strains indicates that Ktr1p, Ktr3p, and Kre2p are also jointly involved in N-linked glycosylation, possibly in establishing some of the outer chain α1,2-linkages.

These glycoproteins then proceed through the Golgi complex where their oligosaccharides are further modified. TheO-modified proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiaepossess a linear carbohydrate chain of up to 5 mannose residues (1Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 2Lehle L. Tanner W. Montreuil J. Schachter H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1995: 1-35Google Scholar).O-Glycosylation is initiated in the ER with dolichyl phosphate-d-mannose as the immediate sugar donor for the mannosyl residue transferred to the hydroxy-amino acids serine and threonine (2Lehle L. Tanner W. Montreuil J. Schachter H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1995: 1-35Google Scholar, 3Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). GDP-Man is utilized as the sugar donor in the subsequent elongation of O-linked carbohydrate chains resulting in a linear glycan in which the second and third mannoses possess α1,2-linkages, whereas the terminal fourth and fifth mannosyl residues have α1,3-linkages (1Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 2Lehle L. Tanner W. Montreuil J. Schachter H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1995: 1-35Google Scholar). Yeast N-linked modified proteins can acquire two different types of glycan chains after the addition of a Man8GlcNAc2 core in the endoplasmic reticulum, a process common to the majority of eukaryotes (1Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 2Lehle L. Tanner W. Montreuil J. Schachter H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1995: 1-35Google Scholar). This primary oligosaccharide can undergo maturation in the Golgi resulting in a Man8–13GlcNAc2 carbohydrate structure, or it may be extended by an outer chain of variable size (up to 200 mannose residues) that is made up of a backbone of α1,6-mannosyl residues to which are attached branched α1,2- and α1,3-mannosyl side chains. Some of the enzymes involved in the elaboration of O-linked oligosaccharides and in the synthesis of N-linked outer chains have been identified, and their structural genes have been isolated. At least four different genes of the seven-memberedPMT1–7 gene family encoding dolichyl phosphate-d-mannose:proteinO-d-mannosyltransferases are responsible for initiating the O-linked glycans (4Gentzsch M. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5752-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). ProteinO-glycosylation is essential for cell function because mutants of S. cerevisiae lacking different combinations of three of the PMT genes are not viable (4Gentzsch M. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5752-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). TheOCH1 gene is responsible for adding the first α1,6-mannose residue involved in initiating N-linked outer chain elaboration (5Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 6Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two enzymes in particular have been shown to participate in both O- and N-linked glycosylation. The KRE2/MNT1 gene encodes a medial Golgi α1,2-mannosyltransferase required for the addition of the third mannose residue on O-linked chains (7Häusler A. Ballou L. Ballou C.E. Robbins P.W. Proc.

The fourth mannose residue is added by the Golgi localized α1,3-mannosyltransferase Mnn1p, which also terminally mannosylates core and outer chain modified N-linked glycans (8Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M.

To further characterize protein glycosylation in yeast and identify some of the responsible glycosyltransferases, we have studied a gene family encoding proteins that are highly homologous to Kre2p/Mnt1p. This nine-membered KTR mannosyltransferase gene family contains the KRE2/MNT1, YUR1, KTR1,KTR2, KTR3, KTR4, KTR5,KTR6, and KTR7 genes (14Lussier M. Camirand A. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H.

Ktr6p and Ktr5p with 24% identity constitute the two most divergent enzymes in the family. Initial functional characterization of Yur1p, Ktr1p, and Ktr2p has revealed that they are Golgi mannosyltransferases involved inN-linked glycosylation, possibly as redundant enzymes, but when inactivated they show no defects in O-linked glycosylation (9Hill K.

Here, we report that KTR1,KTR3, and KRE2, which form a related subfamily encode α1,2-mannosyltransferases that together add the second and the third α1,2-linked mannose residues on O-linked carbohydrate chains and that also participate in N-linked outer chain elaboration. All yeast strains used were based on SEY6210 (MATa, leu2–3, ura3–52, his3-Δ200, lys2–801, trp1-Δ901, suc2-Δ9) and were grown under standard conditions (Yeast extract, Peptone, Dextrose, Yeast Nitrogen Base) as described previously (18Brown J.L.

Disruption of theKTR3 locus was made by a single-step gene replacement procedure (19Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). First, the KTR3 gene was synthesizedin vitro by the polymerase chain reaction (20Saiki R.K. Scharf S. Faloona F. Mullis K.B. Horn G. Erlich H. Arnheim N. Science. 1985; 230: 1350-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar) using thepfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and CCACCACTTTCAGCATGG and GAACCCAAGAAGGCACTAG as 5′ and 3′ primers, with yeast genomic DNA as a template. The 2-kilobase fragment obtained was then subcloned directly in the pTZ/PC vector as described previously (14Lussier M. Camirand A. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A 294-base pair EcoRV coding sequence fragment was removed and replaced by a 1.8-kilobase EcoRI fragment containing the complete HIS3 gene. A linear 3.5-kilobaseNcoI fragment containing the complete HIS3 gene as well as the flanking regions plus the coding sequences ofKTR3 gene was gel purified and integrated into the isogenic diploid SEY6210 strain. Integrants were verified by Southern analysis (data not shown). The extracellular proteins Kre9p and invertase were expressed at high levels from a 2μ-based multicopy vector in yeast strains bearing different disruptions and concentrated from cultures growing exponentially in YNB selective medium containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and 2% glucose using Amicon centriprep concentrators (W. R. Grace & Co. Danvers, MA). Immunoblots were carried out as described (10Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Camirand A. Bussey H. J. Biol.

Yeast cells were labeled using [3H]mannose, and β-eliminations were performed as described previously (10Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Camirand A. Bussey H. J. Biol.

The possible roles of members of the KTR family in O- and N-linked glycosylation remain to be determined. A testable assumption is that those proteins in the family that are most closely related are most likely to possess functional similarities. A relational homology tree constructed using the catalytic domains of each protein clarifies such relationships and has permitted an attempt to functionally group the different enzymes (16Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Winnett E. Vo D.H. Sheraton J. Düsterhöft A. Storms R.K. Bussey H. Yeast. 1997; 13: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One conclusion drawn from this analysis was that Kre2p is most related to Ktr1p and Ktr3p, indicating that these three proteins form a subfamily with possible related functions (16Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Winnett E. Vo D.H. Sheraton J. Düsterhöft A. Storms R.K. Bussey H. Yeast. 1997; 13: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro studies using O-linked type substrates demonstrated that Ktr1p is a α1,2-mannosyltransferase with enzymatic properties highly similar to those of Kre2p, suggesting that these two enzymes act in similar ways (23Romero P.A. Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Herscovics A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To explore these relationships and examine the role of Ktr3p and reassess the role of Ktr1p and Kre2p in the synthesis of O-linked chains, the extent of O-glycosylation in yeast strains bearing mutations in these genes was investigated. Deletional disruptions ofKRE2 and KTR1 were previously obtained (8Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Ketela T Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 913-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Camirand A. Bussey H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11001-11008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and a disruption of the KTR3 locus was made (see “Experimental Procedures”). Double and triple disruptions were subsequently constructed using standard genetic techniques. The single and all double null mutants showed no growth defects when compared with the wild type strain. However, the haploid kre2 ktr1 ktr3triple null mutant had a slow growth phenotype, indicating a genetic interaction between the three genes. 2A.-M. Sdicu, M. Lussier, and H. Bussey, unpublished observations. O-glycosylation was examined in yeast strains bearing different disruptions by following the mobility of Kre9p (Fig. 1), a protein involved in cell wall assembly that is highly O-mannosylated but receives noN-linked modifications (22Brown J.L. Bussey H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 6346-6356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kre9p produced in a wild type strain migrates at an apparent mass of 55 kDa (10Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Camirand A. Bussey H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11001-11008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Lussier M. Gentzsch M. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Tanner W. J. Biol.

As previously observed, Kre9p isolated from a kre2 null strain migrated more quickly than did the wild type Kre9p, with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 47 kDa (10Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Camirand A. Bussey H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11001-11008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Lussier M. Gentzsch M. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Tanner W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11001-11008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or ktr3 2 single null disruptants was indistinguishable from that produced by a wild type strain. Kre9p produced in a ktr1 ktr3 double null mutant showed a small increase in mobility, whereas Kre9p produced in akre2 ktr3 mutant was similar to Kre9p produced in akre2 single mutant. However, a ktr1 mutant exacerbated the O-mannosylation defects of a kre2mutant as the apparent molecular mass of Kre9p was approximately 5 kDa smaller (42 kDa) than when produced in a kre2 mutant alone. Kre9p was smallest (∼38 kDa) when produced in a triple ktr1 ktr3 kre2 mutant, indicating a cumulative involvement of all three proteins in O-linked modifications.Figure 1Detection of Kre9p synthesized in different yeast null mutants. Kre9p was overexpressed from the 2μ-based plasmid YEp351 (28Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) in different yeast strains and concentrated from exponentially growing cultures. Yeast extracellular protein extracts were immunoblotted with affinity-purified anti-Kre9p polyclonal antibodies. The molecular mass standard is shown in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the extent of this involvement, an analysis was made of total O-linked carbohydrate chains present on glycoproteins of mutants carrying different combinations of the disrupted genes (Fig.2). O-linked carbohydrate chains were specifically released from the total glycoprotein fraction of in vivo [3H]mannose-labeled yeast cells by β-elimination and resolved by chromatography (10, 14, 21; see “Experimental Procedures”). The wild type strain (Fig.2 A) and the ktr1 and ktr3 single null mutants2 showed the normal profile of five oligosaccharide peaks, as was the case with the ktr1 ktr3 double null mutant (Fig. 2 B). As expected, the pattern obtained from thekre2 null strain gave two major peaks (Man1-Man2; Fig.2 C), consistent with failure to add the third α1,2-linked mannose residue and a minor peak indicating that a small proportion of total glycoproteins received a third mannose, an effect previously seen (7Häusler A. Ballou L. Ballou C.E. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6846-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Other yeast enzymes are, therefore, able to carry out this particular reaction to a limited extent. A significant reduction in mannosylation is evident in both thektr1 kre2 and ktr3 kre2 double null mutants, each of which gave two peaks (Man1-Man2) but with a decreased proportion of glycoproteins receiving 2 mannose residues when compared with akre2 disruptant alone (Fig. 2, D andE), suggesting an involvement of both Ktr1p and Ktr3p in adding this mannose to O-modified chains. In those two double mutants, the proportion of O-glycoproteins receiving a third mannose is less than in a kre2 single null, suggesting that both Ktr1p and Ktr3p have a limited capacity to add a third mannose on O-linked chains. In a ktr1 ktr3 kre2 triple mutant, the predominant O-linked oligosaccharides assembled were composed of a single mannose (Fig.2 F), indicating that collectively Ktr1p, Ktr3p, and Kre2p are responsible for adding the third mannose and most of the second onO-linked glycans. At least one other enzyme, still unidentified but possibly encoded by a member of the KTRgene family (16Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Winnett E. Vo D.H. Sheraton J. Düsterhöft A. Storms R.K. Bussey H. Yeast. 1997; 13: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), is responsible for the residual level of attachment of a second mannose (Fig. 2 F). All the enzymes now known to be responsible for the assembly of yeast O-linked sugars are outlined in Scheme FS1. The Kre2p mannosyltransferase is presumably involved in the elaboration of N-linked outer chain glycans (9Hill K. Boone C. Goebl M. Puccia R. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Genetics. 1992; 130: 273-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Camirand A. Bussey H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11001-11008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but the precise mannoses added by this enzyme remain to be determined. In view of the cumulative role of KTR1,KTR3, and KRE2 in O-glycosylation, the effect on N- glycosylation of inactivating different combination of these genes was assessed. The carbohydrate chains of invertase, a specifically N-modified protein, were analyzed by measuring the mobility of the secreted form of this protein (Fig.3), which is extensively modified with core oligosaccharides extended with outer chain glycans (24Orlean P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 682-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Ziegler F.D. Maley F. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular wild type protein, as is the case when it is synthesized in ktr1 and ktr3 single null mutants,2 has a molecular mass of around 150 kDa (Fig. 3). As seen before (10Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Camirand A. Bussey H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11001-11008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), invertase produced in a kre2 null mutant receives less N-modification (∼143 kDa). The oligosaccharides attached to invertase synthesized in a ktr1 ktr3 double null mutant appear unaffected because the approximate molecular mass of the polypeptide chains made in this particular strain equals that of wild type proteins. The oligosaccharidic defects of invertase produced in a ktr1 kre2 double null mutant were similar to those observed in a kre2 single null mutant, whereas a disruption in KTR3 slightly exacerbates theN-mannosylation defects seen in a kre2 mutant because invertase synthesized in a ktr3 kre2 mutant has a molecular mass of ∼137 kDa. However, invertase secreted from aktr1 ktr3 kre2 triple null mutant was found to have a molecular mass of ∼129 kDa demonstrating that, as was the case withO-glycosylation, all three proteins are collectively involved in N-linked modifications. Ktr1p and Ktr3p are involved in the elaboration ofO-linked glycans by adding the second mannose in the linear five mannose carbohydrate chain. This was not initially seen because yeast strains bearing ktr1 and ktr3 single or double disruptions possess a normal O-glycosylation pattern. Only in a ktr1 ktr3 kre2 triple mutant is the full effect of the absence of these enzymes apparent, where the third mannose is absent and a severely reduced level of mannose 2 is observed. In the absence of Ktr1p and Ktr3p, Kre2p is able to add both the second and third α1,2-mannose residue in the linear five mannose carbohydrate chains. Ktr1p and Ktr3p are to a limited extent also capable of attaching the third α1,2-mannose onto O-linked chains. All 3 enzymes, therefore, appear to have overlapping roles in the addition of both the second and third α1,2-linked mannose residues ofO-glycosyl chains in yeast (see Scheme FS1). The exactin vivo contribution of each enzyme to the synthesis of the second and third mannose linkages in wild type cells remains to be determined. The results presented here demonstrate that Ktr1p, Ktr3p, and Kre2p are also implicated in N-linked outer chain elaboration. These transferases do not participate in N-linked core glycan synthesis because the molecular mass of the core modified oligosaccharide received by the late Golgi protein Kex1p (26Cooper A. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) is the same in the ktr1 ktr3 kre2 triple null mutant and in a wild type strain.2 Therefore, the marked reduction in the sugar chains received by invertase in the ktr1 ktr3 kre2 triple mutant indicates that Ktr1p, Ktr3p, and Kre2p act in the Golgi apparatus to elaborate outer chain glycans of N-linked oligosaccharides by making some of the branched mannosyl side chains that are attached to the α1,6-mannosyl residues backbone (see Fig.3). Of the five mannoses constituting this backbone sugar chain, all are substituted by at least one α1,2-linked mannose residue, and three are modified by at least two α1,2-linked mannoses. Because the structure of these N-linked branched mannosyl side chains is reminiscent of O-linked oligosaccharides, it is a reasonable speculation that Ktr1p, Ktr3p, and Kre2p collectively participate in establishing some of these outer chain α1,2-linkages. Recent in vitro enzymatic studies are consistent with this (23Romero P.A. Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Herscovics A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both Kre2p and Ktr1p utilize the N-glycan type oligosaccharidic substrate, Man15–30GlcNAc, which contains the α1,6-mannose outer chain backbone attached to the core sugar but lacks the α1,2-mannose containing branches (see Fig. 3), indicating that both enzymes have the ability to add a first α1,2-linked mannose residues to the outer chain backbone. Moreover, the mannosyltransferase reaction involving Kre2p exhibited biphasic kinetics, with an increase in mannose incorporation into product during the second part of the reaction. Such an activity is in agreement with this enzyme sequentially adding two mannose residues and parallels its role inO-mannosylation. The basis for the multiplicity of mannosyltransferases and the complexity of their involvement in the synthesis of O- andN-mannosyl chains can be addressed in the context of redundancy in gene families. The members of the mannosyltransferase family discussed here have related and overlapping functions that can take at least two forms. Firstly, multiple enzymes act at single biosynthetic steps. For example, Kre2p, Ktr1p, and Ktr3p add the secondO-linked mannose residue. Individual enzymes can also participate in more than one biosynthetic step. Kre2p, Ktr1p, and Ktr3p, which can add the second mannose residue to O-linked chains, are also involved together in adding a third mannose residue, though to differing extents (see Scheme FS1.). The level of apparent redundancy observed between the enzymes can be explained in several ways. It is possible that each enzyme possesses a high affinity for a limited set of amino acid sequence contexts around the Ser/Thr and Asn residues at which mannosylation occurs. By having a number of enzymes of varying specificity, the cell is able to extend the range of mannosylated residues on glycoproteins. There is strong evidence for this notion with the first enzyme required in theO-mannosylation pathway, the protein mannosyltransferase, where some of the seven PMT encoded enzymes have been shown to have differing specificities for the mannosylation of peptide substrates of different sequence (4Gentzsch M. Tanner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5752-5759Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 21Lussier M. Gentzsch M. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2770-2775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Gentzsch M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although there is no direct evidence for this conjecture in the KTR family, variable sequence specificities can be hinted at when comparing Kre9pO-mannosylation patterns with those seen through β-elimination in the total O-mannoprotein fractions of thekre2 ktr1 and kre2 ktr3 double null mutants. The mannosylation deficiencies of Kre9p are smallest in a kre2 ktr3 mutant, whereas the defects of the bulk ofO-modified proteins are far more pronounced in this strain (see Figs. 1 and 2, D and E). This is consistent with these enzymes having different specificities with Kre9p sites being atypical. The redundancy observed here can also be explained by a sequential action through intracellular compartmentalization. If related enzymes have broadly similar or overlapping substrate affinities but are in a distinct Golgi compartments, then those mannosylation sites on proteins that fail to be mannosylated in one compartment have subsequent glycosylation opportunities as they move through the later mannosyltransferase-containing cisternae. If this were the case, Ktr1p and Ktr3p that have less ability to add the third mannose inO-glycosylation might be found in cisternae before Kre2p, the enzyme most responsible for Man3 addition. This would build a level of redundant function into the processive extension of mannose chains in successive Golgi compartments and increaseO-mannosylation efficiency. The Golgi targeting regions of Kre2p, Ktr1p, and Ktr3p are unrelated, consistent with them having different intracellular locations (8Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Ketela T Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 913-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Camirand A. Bussey H. J. Biol.

Studying the roles of gene families such asKTR will be informative both for the analysis of protein glycosylation and to offer insights into the biological reasons that allow such diversity of related gene products to occur.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6153-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The VDE region in the Vma1 protozyme plays a central role for the protein splicing reaction (11Hirata R. Anraku Y.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have also shown that VDE bracketed by only 6 proximal and 4 distal amino acids is autocatalytically processed in vitro (13Kawasaki M. Makino S. Matsuzawa H. Satow Y. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results support the idea that the VDE sequence and a few external amino acids 2S. Nogami, Y. Satow, Y. Ohya, and Y. Anraku, submitted for publication. 2S. Nogami, Y. Satow, Y. Ohya, and Y. Anraku, submitted for publication. contain sufficient information for protein splicing. Only short amino acid sequence motifs are conserved among protein splicing elements (7Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thiol- or hydroxyl-containing Cys, Ser, or Thr is found at both splice junctions. A few hydrophobic amino acids are present in front of an invariant His-Asn dipeptide at the C-terminal splice junction. These residues around the splice sites have been found to play key roles in the protein splicing reaction, based mostly on site-directed mutagenesis studies (5Davis E.O. Jenner P.J. Brooks P.C. Colston M.J. Sedgwick S.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Hodges R.A. Perler F.B. Noren C.J. Jack W.E.

To understand a mechanism and structural integrity for protein splicing in the Vma1 protozyme, we performed a systematic search for splicing-defective mutants. We introduced random mutations throughout the entire VDE region by an error-prone PCR method for the first time and mapped three core regions essential for the splicing reaction. Strains—Escherichia coli strain SCS1 carrying plasmid pGEX-VMA1 (see below) was used to produce the recombinant GST-Vma1 fusion protein. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying plasmid pET-17bVDE (see below) was used to produce recombinant VDE. Yeast strain NY101,2 which is avma1::URA3 derivative of YPH499, containing plasmid pSN001,2 was used to express the full-length VMA1 gene product. To express a GST-Vma1 fusion protein, an expression plasmid pGEX-VMA1 was created as follows. A 652-bpScaI-ScaI fragment from plasmid pMVMA1 (11Hirata R. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was ligated into the vector pGEX-5X-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which had been digested with EcoRI and blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase. The resultant plasmid, which had the insert in the correct orientation, was digested with BglII and SmaI, and then a 1.8-kb BglII-NcoI (blunted) fragment from pMVMA1 was introduced into this gap to generate plasmid pGEX-VMA1. The numbering of the amino acid sequence in this report refers to the numbering of the original VMA1 gene product (2Hirata R. Ohsumi Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6726-6733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To express the full-length VMA1 gene product in yeast cells, the 2.2-kb KpnI-SphI fragment of the pGEX-VMA1 plasmid was ligated into pSN001 that had been digested with the same enzymes. To express recombinant VDEs in E. coli, a plasmid pET-17bVDE was constructed as follows. The pET-17b vector (Novagen) was digested with NheI and BamHI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and self-ligated. The resultant plasmid was digested withEcoRV, and a MluI linker, dGACGCGTC, (New England Biolabs) was inserted into this gap to create a stop codon, yielding pET-17bΔNE. The BamHI-EcoRI fragment of wild-type or mutant pGEX-VMA1 was introduced into theBamHI-EcoRI gap of pET-17bΔNE to create pET-17bVDE. The pET-17bVDE expresses VDE bracketed by 18 proximal (MARIPRNYSNSDAIIYVG) and 17 distal (CGERGNEMAEVLMEFCR) amino acids. VDE cleaves the VMA1 gene, which lacks the VDE coding sequence (VMA1Δvde) at the precise insertion site (14Gimble F.S. Thorner J. Nature. 1992; 357: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Gimble F.S. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21844-21853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid substrate pBS-ΔVDE, which contains a VDE cleavage site, was constructed as follows. The 1.7-kbPvuII-EcoRI fragment of pMVMA1 was inserted into Bluescript SK+ (Stratagene), which had been digested withSmaI and EcoRI, to produce pBS-PE. A VDE cleavage site was generated by a PCR-based deletion mutagenesis using a standard PCR condition and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). One reaction mixture contained oligonucleotide primer A (5′-TTGCTCCAGCTGGTGAGTACA-3′) (codons 557–577); primer B (5′-ACCTCTTTCTCCGCACCCGACATAGATAATGGCGTCA-3′), which has 15 nucleotides (codons 2212–2226) followed by 22 nucleotides (codons 828–849) of the antisense strand; and pMVMA1 as a template. Another reaction mixture contained primer C (5′-ATCTATGTCGGGTGCGGAGAAAGAGGTAATGAAATG-3′), which has 12 nucleotides (codons 838–849) followed by 24 nucleotides (codons 2212–2235) of the sense strand; primer D (5′-TCTCAAAGCTTCAGCCCATCT-3′) (codons 2440–2460); and pMVMA1. The two PCR products were mixed, and the first denaturation and annealing reaction was performed. Then polymerase and primers A and D were added, and elongation and additional cycles were carried out. The PCR product was digested with ScaI andEcoRI, and the resultant 72-bpScaI-EcoRI fragment was gel-purified and introduced into the 1.4-kb ScaI-EcoRI gap of pBS-PE to yield pBS-ΔVDE. The ScaI-EcoRI region of pBS-ΔVDE was confirmed by direct sequencing. Random mutations were introduced throughout the VDE region of pGEX-VMA1 plasmid by error-prone PCR (16Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The 5′-primer was 5′-CGTGGGATCCCCAGGAATTACTCCAATTCT-3′, which contains a BamHI site (underlined). The 3′-primer was 5′-TGGGAATTCCATCAAGACTTCTGCCATTTC-3′, which contains an EcoRI site (underlined). The reaction mixture contained 100 ng of pGEX-VMA1 plasmid, 0.01 OD units of each primer, 0.2 mm dGTP, 0.2 mm dATP, 1 mmdCTP, 1 mm dTTP, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.01% gelatin, 7 mm MgCl2, and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Takara) in a 100-μl volume. To avoid extreme mutagenic effect, MnCl2 was not supplemented. The reaction conditions were as follows: 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and then ligated to pGEX-VMA1 that had been digested with the same enzymes. E. coli strain SCS1 carrying mutagenized pGEX-VMA1 was cultured in 1 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in 24-well tissue culture plates. The culture was grown at 37 °C for about 6 h to the exponential phase. Then 0.1 mm IPTG was added, and the culture was transferred to room temperature. After an additional 3-h incubation, total cell extracts were prepared by pelleting the cells for 2 min at 10,000 ×g followed by lysis in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sampling buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and boiling for 3 min. Samples (5 μl) were directly analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE, and then protein was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Mutants could be classified into roughly five groups. One group of mutants (100 mutants out of the 324 screened mutants) exhibited the excised 50-kDa VDE predominantly near wild-type levels. A second group of mutants (106 mutants) showed a somewhat reduced level of processing, accumulating a comparable amount of the 50-kDa VDE and the 115-kDa precursor. A third group of mutants (33 mutants) exhibited a markedly reduced amount of the 50-kDa VDE and predominant accumulation of the precursor. A fourth group of mutants (44 mutants) failed to show any detectable 50-kDa VDE in a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. A fifth group of mutants (41 mutants) failed to express the full-length precursor, presumably because a stop codon was introduced into the open reading frame. Mutants of the fourth group identified in the initial screen were then subjected to Western blotting analysis, which was done essentially as described previously (2Hirata R. Ohsumi Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6726-6733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then 17 mutants were found not to produce any immunodetectable splicing products. DNA sequencing of these mutant plasmids was done by using the Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) with appropriate primers. The number of amino acid substitutions of each mutant varied from one to six. In addition, mutants 93, 95, 175, 198, 323, and 330 contained a single silent mutation, and mutant 347 had two silent mutations. Then individual mutant plasmid DNAs were dissected by restriction fragment swapping to identify which amino acid changes were responsible for the defect of splicing activity. The VDE-coding region was divided into three intervals: segment 1 (530-bpBamHI-BglII), segment 2 (760-bpBglII-SacII), and segment 3 (150-bpSacII-EcoRI). These segments of each mutant DNA were individually ligated into wild-type pGEX-VMA1 plasmid to replace the corresponding regions. As for the mutant 330, which had a mutation upstream of the KpnI site, DNA was dissected to segment 0 (60-bp BamHI-KpnI) and segment 1′ (470-bpKpnI-BglII). Mutant 197 could not be dissected, because the mutation abolished the BglII restriction site. Then splicing activities of the reconstituted mutants (designated by the addition of hyphened segment numbers) were reexamined by immunoblotting. Nineteen reconstituted mutants did not show any detectable amount of the 50-kDa VDE (among them, the mutant 239-1 showed a very slight amount of the 50-kDa VDE near the background level of detection). The other mutants with splicing ability were excluded. Yeast strain NY101 carrying pSN001 plasmid was used for the complementation test of mutantVMA1 genes. pYO314 plasmid was used as a control vector.2 The complementation test was done using YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, 2% glucose) supplemented with 100 mm CaCl2. Wild-type and mutant cell extracts were prepared from cultures grown at 30 °C in YNBD medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2% glucose) supplemented with 0.5% casamino acids and buffered with 50 mmsuccinate/NaOH, pH 5.0. Preparation of cell extract and Western blotting analysis was done as described previously (2Hirata R. Ohsumi Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6726-6733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kawasaki M. Makino S. Matsuzawa H. Satow Y. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying plasmid pET-17bVDE was cultured in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A 0.1-ml overnight culture was added to 5 ml of fresh medium and grown at 23 °C to the early exponential phase (A 600 = 0.07). Protein expression was then induced by the addition of 0.1 mm IPTG for 4 h to an A 600 of about 0.2. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mmMgCl2) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma). After incubation on ice for 30 min, cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. The subsequent purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant up to 70% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm EDTA). The resuspended solution was dialyzed against buffer A for 2 h. The dialysate was batch-loaded onto 0.2 ml of CM-Sepharose CL-6B beads (Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The mixture was rotated for 10 min, and beads were pelleted and washed with 1 ml of buffer A. Bound proteins were then eluted with 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl. This fraction was dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and used for endonuclease activity analysis. The protein concentration of the sample was estimated using BCA reagent (Pierce). Endonuclease activity was assayed according to a modification of the method of Gimble and Stephens (17Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) using pBS-ΔVDE as a substrate. Purified recombinant VDE (0.5 μg) was incubated withXmnI-linearized plasmid pBS-ΔVDE (600 ng) in 15 μl of cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) for 1 h at 37 °C. Five μl of the reaction mixture was electrophoresed in a 0.7% agarose gel with 0.5 × TAE (Tris acetate-EDTA) buffer and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. A bacterial expression system was used to produce normal and mutagenized recombinant Vma1 protozymes for monitoring their processing activity. The sequence, which covers the entire VDE region and the C-terminal segment of the VMA1 gene, was fused to the GST gene under control of the tac promoter (Fig.1 A). This construct expresses a chimeric protein (GST-Vma1) that is composed of GST and 11 residues from the Vma1 N-terminal region (∼30 kDa), VDE (50 kDa), and the Vma1 C-terminal region (35 kDa). When this authentic GST-Vma1 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli, a 115-kDa precursor was processed into a 50-kDa VDE and a 65-kDa GST-Vma1 C-terminal fusion protein. The 115-kDa precursor and the excised 50-kDa VDE were easily detected by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 B) and also by anti-VDE polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1 C). The 65-kDa spliced product (GST-Vma1C) was hardly detected by Coomassie Blue staining, but it was detected by 5M39 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1 D), which recognizes the C-terminal region of Vma1p (11Hirata R. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We found that protein splicing efficiency in E. coli was temperature-sensitive. Induction at 37 °C resulted in predominant accumulation of the 115-kDa precursor in an insoluble fraction (data not shown). Induction at lower temperatures yielded a larger amount of the processed 50-kDa VDE, which was recovered in a soluble fraction.Figure 1Construction and expression of wild-type and mutant GST-Vma1 fusion proteins in E. coli. A, the region that covers VDE and the C-terminal segment of theVMA1 gene was fused to the GST gene.

The mutagenized 1.4-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment covers the entire VDE and external 14 proximal and 13 distal amino acids. After induction at room temperature with 0.1 mm IPTG, total proteins of E. coli cell lysate were examined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The splicing activity of mutants was estimated by comparing the density of the 115-kDa precursor band with the density of the 50-kDa band of excised VDE. Defective mutants (44 mutants of the 324 candidate mutants) that accumulated the precursor and did not show detectable splicing products in the Coomassie Blue-stained gels were then subjected to the second level of screening using Western blotting analysis. Of the 44 mutants tested, 17 mutants showed no immunodetectable amount of the excised 50-kDa VDE against the anti-VDE antibody. The plasmid DNAs from these 17 mutants were purified and sequenced within the mutagenized region. The results of the sequencing are shown in Table I.Table IMutations that abolish protein splicing of GST-Vma1p in E. coliMutant No.No. of amino acid changesBamHI-KpnIKpnI-BglIIBglII-SacIISacII-EcoRI894K539R,N594YH725L,N737I933M311K,N434TN737S952R325SN737K1153M330K,T361I,M392T1293A463T,D607G,A648V1752T357S,H362L1976K322E,V365AD446V,1-aThe D446V mutation of mutant 197 abolished theBglII restriction site.G451V,I485F,E524V1985D277G,N303T,R325SV644G,A682T2383V291G,M293TY475H2393T357S,D399VY664N2651C284Y2825N290K,I298FL449P,Q460LE740A3033H362LL640I,T658A3232V403DS639P3273K478ND724V,L729P3302G283VT368A3472K552R,L602H1-a The D446V mutation of mutant 197 abolished theBglII restriction site. Open table in a new tab Mutations were distributed throughout the entire mutagenized region, and the number of amino acid substitutions in each mutant varied from one to six. To identify which amino acid changes are responsible for the defect of splicing activity, individual mutant plasmid DNAs were dissected by restriction fragment swapping (see “Experimental Procedures”). Then the splicing activity of the reconstituted mutants was reexamined by immunoblotting. Nineteen reconstituted mutants did not yield any detectable 50-kDa VDE. These mutations were distributed in their sequences as shown in Fig. 2. Of the 19 plasmids, 7 plasmids contained a single amino acid substitution. Two of them (G283V and C284Y) were at the N-terminal splice junction, and another two (N737S and N737K) were at the C-terminal junction. These four mutations at the splice junctions are in agreement with previous studies (5Davis E.O. Jenner P.J. Brooks P.C. Colston M.J. Sedgwick S.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Hodges R.A. Perler F.B. Noren C.J. Jack W.E.

We found three additional new mutants within the VDE region (H362L, V403D, and S639P). As for the conserved His362 (7Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), it was substituted in two mutants (175-1 and 303-1). We next tested whether these mutants defective in splicing in E. coli show the defect in yeast cells as well. The mutant VDE genes were introduced into a plasmid carrying the entire VMA1 gene to replace the wild-type VDE region. The splicing activity of mutant Vma1 protozymes was tested by their ability to complement the calcium-sensitive growth defect of Δvma1 cells. A loss of protein splicing of the Vma1 protozyme leads to a lack of Vma1p, the 70-kDa catalytic subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase. Since yeast mutants that lack Vma1p are sensitive to calcium-containing medium (18Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the ability to complement calcium sensitivity correlates with the splicing activity in yeast (11Hirata R. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We found that several mutants were capable of complementing the calcium-sensitive growth defect of Δvma1 strain fully or partially (Fig. 3 and Table II), suggesting that the efficiency of protein splicing may be different in yeast and E. coli cells.Table IIGrowth phenotypes of yeast cells carrying mutant VDEsMutant numberMutationsSplicing in E. coliYeast growth2-a++, +, ±, and − indicate successively weaker growth than that of wild type.23 °C30 °C37 °CWild-typeNone+++++++++89–3H725L,N737I−−−−93–1M311K,N434T−++++±93–3N737S−−−−95–3N737K−−−−115–1M330K,T361I,M392T−++±−129–2A463T,D607G,A648V−+++±175–1T357S,H362L−−−−197K322E,V365A,D446V,G451V,I485F,E524V−+±−198–2V644G,A682T−+++++238–1V291G,M293T−−−−239–1T357S,D399V±++++++265–1C284Y−NT2-bNT, not tested.NTNT282–2L449P,Q460L−+++++303–1H362L−±±±323–1V403D−++++±323–2S639P−++++±327–3D724V,L729P−−−−330–0G283V−NTNTNT347–2K552R,L602H−+++±2-a ++, +, ±, and − indicate successively weaker growth than that of wild type.2-b NT, not tested. Open table in a new tab Of 17 mutants tested, six mutants (89-3, 93-3, 95-3, 175-1, 238-1, and 327-3) could not complement calcium sensitivity at all and also did not yield correctly excised products in yeast cell lysates (Figs. 2 and4). Thus, we concluded that these six mutants had lost the splicing activity completely. Western blotting analysis with anti-VDE antibody was performed on yeast cell lysates from the mutant strains. The excised 50-kDa VDE was detected in the cell lysates in response to their ability to grow on the calcium-containing medium, showing that protein splicing occurred normally in some strains (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, we could detect several protein species with intermediate sizes between the 120-kDa precursor and excised 50-kDa VDE in four mutants 89-3, 95-3, 175-1, and 303-1. These species were further characterized by their sizes and reactivity to the antibodies raised against the three regions of the Vma1 protozyme (Fig. 4 B); R70 (monoclonal antibody for the 30-kDa N-terminal region), anti-VDE polyclonal antibody, and 5M39 (monoclonal antibody for the 40-kDa C-terminal region; Refs. 11Hirata R.

Commun. 1996; 222: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In all four mutants, a 120-kDa precursor polypeptide accumulated, which was recognized clearly by the three antibodies (Fig.4 B). Anti-VDE and 5M39 antibodies reacted with a 90-kDa polypeptide accumulated in the mutants 89-3 (H725L and N737I) and 95-3 (N737K), suggesting that the cleavage occurred only at the N-terminal splice site. The mutant 95-3 also accumulated a more slowly migrating polypeptide around 200 kDa that was recognized by all the three antibodies, suggesting that it could be a branched protein (19Xu M.-Q. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We are not certain about the origin of a 54-kDa band in the mutants 89-3 and 95-3, which was detected only by anti-VDE antibody. As for mutants 175-1 (T357S and H362L) and 303-1 (H362L), an 80-kDa polypeptide was detected with anti-VDE and R70 antibodies, suggesting that the cleavage occurred only at the C-terminal splice site.

Intercellular transfer of mtDNA between cultured mammalian cells has been used extensively for studying the contribution of mtDNA or cytoplasmic genetic factors to the expression of various phenotypes such as tumorigenicity (1Hayashi J-I. Werbin H. Shay J.W. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 4001-4006PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hayashi J-I. Yonekawa H. Tagashira Y.

Cell. 1985; 43: 777-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, this mtDNA transfer system is problematic in that the mtDNA donor cells must be resistant to chloramphenicol for selective isolation of cells with exogenously transferred mtDNA (cybrids) (5Wallace D.C. Bunn C.L. Eisendtadt J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 174-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Shay J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2461-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, chloramphenicol selection and subsequent cultivation in the presence of chloramphenicol could not completely remove endogenous wild-type (chloramphenicol-sensitive) mtDNA in the host cells (7Oliver N. Wallace D.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1982; 2: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Hayashi J-I. Gotoh O. Tagashira Y. Tosu M. Sekiguchi T. Yoshida M.C. Somatic Cell Genet. 1982; 8: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, the influence of the remaining host-cell mtDNA on the expression of the phenotypes cannot be excluded completely. This problem could be overcome by using mtDNA-less (ρ0) cells as host cells. Recently, ρ0 cells were isolated from avian (9Desjardins P. de Muys J-M. Morais R. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and human (10King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 11Hayashi J-I. Ohta S.

Cytoplasmic transfer of mtDNA to these cells (particularly to ρ0 human cells) has been used extensively to provide unambiguous evidence of whether accumulation of the candidate mutant mtDNAs found in patients with mitochondrial diseases are responsible for the pathogenesis of the diseases (11Hayashi J-I.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human ρ0 cells were used to study the correlation between aging and mtDNA mutations. Our previous study showed that the age-associated reductions in the activities of mitochondrial translation and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cytochromec oxidase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DC, ditercalinium. (one of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes) observed in fibroblasts from aged subjects were not co-transferred to ρ0 HeLa cells together with their mtDNA, suggesting that mtDNA mutations are not involved in at least the age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction of human fibroblasts (19Hayashi J-I. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Kondo H. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6878-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported that mitochondrial dysfunction and accumulation of mtDNA mutations that have been shown to be pathogenic in mitochondrial diseases are associated with aging, particularly in human post-mitotic highly oxidative tissues such as brain and muscles (20Ikebe S-i. Tanaka M. Ohno K. Sato W. Hattori K. Kondo T. Mizuno Y. Ozawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 21Cortopassi G.A. Arnheim N.

Since fresh human tissues with highly oxidative activities are difficult to obtain from healthy subjects, mouse tissues must be used for further investigations of whether the age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in highly oxidative tissues is due to the accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations. We reported previously that a common feature of age-associated changes in both human and mouse mitochondrial respiratory functions is the decrease in mitochondrial translational activity (24Takai D. Inoue K. Shisa H. Kagawa Y. Hayashi J-I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); therefore, mouse brain can be used as a model to understand the causes of age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in non-dividing highly oxidative tissues. Since mtDNA cannot be transferred from any mouse cells or tissues to ρ0 human cells due to the incompatibility between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of different species (25Hayashi J-I. Tagashira Y. Yoshida M.C. Ajiro K. Sekiguchi T. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 147: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), ρ0 cell lines must be isolated from mouse cells for further studies. However, exposure of mouse cells to EtBr (which has been used effectively for isolation of ρ0 human cells) frequently induced EtBr-resistant mutant cell lines containing mtDNA as reported previously (26Hayashi J-I. Tanaka M. Sato W. Ozawa T. Yonekawa H. Kagawa Y. Ohta S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and there have been no reports of successful isolation of ρ0 cell lines from mouse cells. In this study, we tested various chemicals that could be expected to decrease the mtDNA content and finally succeeded in isolating ρ0 mouse cell lines. We then obtained cybrid clones with neuronal mtDNA by fusion with brain synaptosomes (which are equivalent to synaptic endings isolated from nerve cells). These cybrids all showed similar mitochondrial translation activity regardless of whether the neuronal mtDNA was imported from young or aged mice, which at least suggests that defects in mitochondrial genomes are not responsible for the age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction observed in the brain of aged mice. Furthermore, we trapped in the cybrid clones a very small amount of a 5823-bp deletion mutant mtDNA (ΔmtDNA5823) that was observed in mouse synaptosomes from all the individuals we tested. No effective system has been established thus far for transfecting artificially mutagenized mammalian mtDNA into mitochondria for isolation of cells with pathogenic mutant mtDNA, but we could trap mutant mtDNA accumulated in synaptosomes into ρ0 mouse cells, and these should be available for isolation of mtDNA-knockout mice. The mouse myoblast line C2C12 (C2 cells) and mouse fibroblast lines (5P cells derived from the B6mtJ strain and NIH3T3 cells) were grown in normal medium (RPMI 1640 (Nissui Seiyaku, Tokyo) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml uridine, and 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate). A mouse pancreatic beta cell line (MIN6) was cultivated as described previously (27Soejima A. Inoue K. Takai D. Kaneko M. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Hayashi J-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of all mouse cells except 5P cells are derived from Mus musculus domesticus. The mitochondrial genomes of 5P cells and the B6mtJ strain are derived from Mus musculus molossinus, whereas their nuclear genomes are from M. m. domesticus. Cells were plated at 1 × 102–5 × 104 cells/dish, and beginning 24 h after plating they were treated with ditercalinium (DC, an antitumor bis-intercalating agent) for 1 month. C2 and NIH3T3 cells were treated with 1.5 μg/ml DC, while MIN6 cells were treated with 56 ng/ml DC. The medium containing the drug was changed every 2 days. After 1 month, colonies growing in the medium were clonally isolated by the cylinder method. The cloned cells were then cultivated in normal medium without the drug."

In humans, two highly similar enzymes, NDP kinase A and NDP kinase B, displaying 89% identity, are equally active and form mixed hexamers (5Gilles A.M. Presecan E. Vonica A. Lascu I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8784-8789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decreased expression level of NDP kinase A, product of the Nm23-H1gene has been correlated with the increased metastatic potential of some human tumors but not of others (for a review see Ref. 6De La Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The other isoform, NDP kinase B, product of the Nm23-H2 gene, acts as a transcription factor of the oncogene c-myc,in vitro and in vivo (7Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A.

Finally, the cDNA encoding for a forth human NDP kinase has recently been cloned (11Milon L. Rousseau-Merck M.-F. Munier A. Erent M. Lascu I. Capeau J. Lacombe M.-L. Hum.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 659-667PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the S120G mutant was almost as active as the wild-type enzyme, but its stability to denaturation was decreased. Serine 120 is conserved in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic NDP kinases. We show here that altered folding properties of the recombinant S120G mutant protein lead to the accumulation of a molten globule intermediate. The cDNA for the wild-type NDP kinase A was cloned as described (14Engel M. Veron M. Theisinger B. Lacombe M.-L. Seib T. Dooley S. Welter C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Kunkel method (15Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Full-length wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in high yields using a pET-derived expression vector, pJC20. Bacteria were grown in a rich medium (2 × YT (per liter, 16 g of bacto-tryptone, 10 g of bacto-yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl)) in the presence of 200 μg/ml ampicillin. Induction was performed for 3 h with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, at 37 °C at aA 600 between 2 and 3 (additional 200 μg/ml of ampicillin were added at that time). The crude extract was directly applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column. After washing with 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in the same buffer. When expression was high, essentially pure protein was obtained in just one step. Otherwise, the active fractions were subjected to an additional blue Sepharose chromatography in the same buffer as above but at pH 7.5. The enzyme was eluted with 1.5 mm ATP and then with 2m NaCl. Both the wild-type and S120G mutant protein lacked the amino-terminal methionine as determined by automated Edman degradation. Analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry revealed, in addition to the expected peaks, minor m+15 and m+30 peaks in both proteins, probably due to oxidation of cysteines and/or methionines. Protein concentration was determined from the optical density at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.35 for 1 mg/ml, which was calculated from the amino acid composition according to Ref. 16Gill S.G. von Hippel P.H.

Enzymatic assay and stability studies to denaturation by heat and urea were performed as described previously (17Lascu I. Chaffotte A. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Veron M. J. Biol.

All measurement (unless otherwise specified) were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Additional details can be found in the figure legends. Molar concentrations of proteins were expressed as subunit concentrations. Full-length wild-type and S120G mutant NDP kinase A were expressed in bacteria in high yields and purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity. They elute in a position expected for a hexameric structure in size exclusion chromatography on calibrated Superose 12 column. The mutant enzyme could be fully phosphorylated (0.9 phosphate groups/enzyme subunit, using the nonisotopic method described by Lascuet al. (20Lascu I. Pop R.D. Porumb H. Presecan E. Proinov I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). The k cat (580 s−1 and 420 s−1), the apparentK m for ATP (76 μm and 40 μm at 100 μm dTDP), and the apparentK m for dTDP (148 μm and 207 μm at 1 mm ATP) of the wild-type and S120G mutant enzymes were similar. The thermal stability was significantly reduced by the S120G mutation. When analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry, both proteins displayed a single calorimetric peak only having the T m of 58 °C (wild-type protein) and 50 °C (S120G mutant protein). The T mvalues correspond to the temperatures of half-inactivation temperatures, measured at similar protein concentration and heating rate. A detailed analysis of catalytic and structural properties will be reported elsewhere. Denaturation by urea was followed by intrinsic protein fluorescence. The mutant enzyme was considerably less stable than the wild-type protein (Fig. 1 A). Because the human NDP kinase A contains three tryptophan residues, it is not easy to correlate fluorescence changes with loss of quaternary structure and of native structure. A notable feature was the absence of a cooperative transition upon renaturation of the urea-denatured mutant protein. To detect possible folding intermediate, ANS was added to the final concentration of 56 μm to each sample, and its fluorescence was measured. The hydrophobic dye ANS has no affinity for either native or completely unfolded proteins, but it strongly binds to molten globule folding intermediates (21Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Katyshenko V.P. Ebert B. Blanck J. Ptitsyn O. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 22Jones B.E. Jennings P.A. Pierre R.A. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15250-15258Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The wild-type enzyme bound very little ANS. In contrast, the S120G mutant protein bound ANS, as observed by an increase in the fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1 B) and a blue shift in the spectrum (maximum moved from about 520 to 480 nm). This suggests that a molten globule intermediate accumulated both in the denaturation and the renaturation pathway of the S120G mutant NDP kinase, whereas it was undetectable with the wild-type protein. Further support was obtained by CD experiments. CD was used to measure the extent of secondary structure (in the far UV) and tertiary structure, reflected by the asymmetric environment of the aromatic residues, (in the near UV). Diluting the urea-denatured S120G enzyme into buffer generated a species having about 60% of the secondary structure content of the native enzyme, as calculated from the signal at 220 nm, whereas no tertiary structure was detected (Fig.2). In the control experiment with the wild-type enzyme, both secondary and tertiary structure were recovered to a similar extent (not shown). By size-exclusion chromatography on a calibrated column of Superose 12 the Stokes radius of the intermediate species accumulated during the refolding of the S120G mutant appeared between that of the folded and unfolded monomer (Fig. 3 D). It was devoid of enzymatic activity (not shown). Under the same conditions, the wild-type protein refolded and assemble to hexamers (Fig.3 B), which had enzymatic activity. Finally, the electrophoretic pattern of denaturation and renaturation of the S120G mutant of NDP kinase A subjected to electrophoresis in a transverse-urea gradient (23Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) showed a folding defect in the mutant protein. There is a clear transition from the native hexamer to the unfolded protein with the S120G mutant (Fig.4 A) and with the wild-type protein (not shown). A renaturation transition is absent when refolding of the S120G mutant, analyzed by this technique (Fig. 4 B). At the lowest urea concentrations, the protein aggregated. Under the same conditions, the wild-type enzyme renatured mostly to folded monomer and to some hexamer (Fig. 4 C). The mutant S120G of the human NDP kinase A had catalytic properties similar to those of the wild-type protein, incorporated one phosphate group per subunit, and was hexameric but was less stable to denaturation by heat or urea. The most important distinctive feature was the accumulation of a folding intermediate while renaturing the urea-denatured mutant enzyme. This species had several characteristics of a molten globule (24Ptitsyn O.B. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman & Co, New York1993: 243-300Google Scholar, 25Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1993Google Scholar): (a) absence of tertiary structure whereas the secondary structure is largely present, (b) size intermediate between the native monomer and the denatured protein, (c) binding of the hydrophobic dye ANS, and (d) the propensity to aggregate. Despite the folding defect, the mutant protein was expressed at very high yield in bacteria in a native hexameric state. It was also found in human tumors to be active (13Chang C.L. Strahler J.R. Thoraval D.H. Qian M.G. Hinderer R. Hanash S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 659-667PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that chaperone proteins assist folding/assembly in vivo. Moreover, once assembled, eukaryotic NDP kinases are stabilized by their quaternary structure (18Lascu I. Deville-Bonne D. Glaser P. Véron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20268-20275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Giartosio A. Erent M. Cervoni L. Moréra S. Janin J. Konrad M. Lascu I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17845-17851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the natural mutant P97S inDrosophila NDP kinase (K-pn mutation) is affected in assembly but not in folding. A gel filtration experiment clearly showed that the folded monomers were the most proeminent species (17Lascu I. Chaffotte A. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12775-12781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The defect resulting from the K-pn mutation is therefore different in nature from the S120G mutant of human NDP kinase A described above. 4The anonymous referee made the interesting remark that a defect in subunit association is a possible cause of accumulation of the folding intermediate. The highly cooperative hexameric structure may in fact act as a “thermodynamic trap.” However, the P96S (K-pn) mutation in DrosophilaNDP kinase (17Lascu I. Chaffotte A. Limbourg-Bouchon B. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12775-12781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the P105G mutation in Dictyostelium NDP kinase (18Lascu I. Deville-Bonne D. Glaser P. Véron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20268-20275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) affect only the subunit association but not their folding. As a consequence, the main renaturation product were in both cases thefolded monomers. The K-pnmutation generates a dominant, lethal, and conditional phenotype inDrosophila (26Biggs J. Tripoulas N. Hersperger E. Dearolf C. Shearn A. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1333-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Human NDP kinase A is 89% identical to the other cytosolic isoform, NDP kinase B. The structure of the latter protein is known at high resolution (27Moréra S. Lacombe M.-L. Yingwu X. Lebras G. Janin J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1307-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Webb P.A. Perisic O. Mendola C.E. Backer J.M. Williams R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 574-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Serine 120 is located near the active site histidine 118, which is phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle. The Oγ is hydrogen-bonded to Glu129, which is also hydrogen-bonded to His-118. Despite the proximity of the active site, the absence of the Oγ atom does not have an important effect on the catalytic efficiency of the mutant enzyme. However, serine 120 appears to be of crucial importance for correct protein folding and stability. The total conservation of this residue in all known NDP kinases, including the bacterial enzymes, points to an essential function. We suppose that the hydrogen bond of serine 120 to glutamate 129 is necessary for the final arrangement of the protein structure after the hydrophobic collapse and secondary structure formation. Inspection of the tertiary structure suggests that this hydrogen bond anchors the carboxyl-terminal part to the protein core. By breaking just one hydrogen bond by mutation, folding intermediates were also detected in β-lactamase (29Craig S. Hollecker M. Creighton T.E. Pain R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and barstar (30Nath U. Udgaonkar J.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the final folding step is slowed down by local chain flexibility because two glycine residues are adjacent in the mutant protein. More experiments are under way in our laboratories to further characterize the nature of the defect. The S120G mutation of NDP kinase A has been identified in human neuroblastomas (12Chang C.L.

The question arises whether there exists a link between the folding defect and the tumoral phenotype of the host cells. Chang et al. (13Chang C.L. Strahler J.R. Thoraval D.H. Qian M.G. Hinderer R. Hanash S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 659-667PubMed Google Scholar) detected by immunoprecipitation in neuroblastoma cells a protein interacting with the mutant but not with the wild-type protein. Moreover, transfection of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells with the S120G mutant of NDP kinase A cDNA failed to decrease the cell motility, whereas transfection with the wild-type cDNA has a sizable effect on cell motility. This parameter can be correlated with the metastatic potential of the tumor cells (31MacDonald N.J. Freije J.M.P. Stracke M.L. Manrow R.E. Steeg P.S. J. Biol.

Recent evidence indicates that several disease-causing mutations may exert their effect by altering protein folding (32Bychova V.E. Ptitsyn O.B.

https://openalex.org/W2021470165,"Cholera and Escherichia coli heat-labile toxins (CT and LT) require proteolysis of a peptide loop connecting two major domains of their enzymatic A subunits for maximal activity (termed ""nicking""). To test whether host intestinal epithelial cells may supply the necessary protease, recombinant rCT and rLT and a protease-resistant mutant CTR192H were prepared. Toxin action was assessed as a Cl- secretory response (Isc) elicited from monolayers of polarized human epithelial T84 cells. When applied to apical cell surfaces, wild type toxins elicited a brisk increase in Isc (80 microA/cm2). Isc was reduced 2-fold, however, when toxins were applied to basolateral membranes. Pretreatment of wild type toxins with trypsin in vitro restored the ""basolateral"" secretory responses to ""apical"" levels. Toxin entry into T84 cells via apical but not basolateral membranes led to nicking of the A subunit by a serine-type protease. T84 cells, however, did not nick CTR192H, and the secretory response elicited by CTR192H remained attenuated even when applied to apical membranes. Thus, T84 cells express a serine-type protease(s) fully sufficient for activating the A subunits of CT and LT. The protease, however, is only accessible for activation when the toxin enters the cell via the apical membrane."

Oxygen equilibrium curves show nonlinear lower asymptote of Hill plots, indicating the occurrence of heme-heme interactions within the T state. Analysis of the curves according to the co-operon model (Brunori, M., Coletta, M., and Di Cera, E. (1986) Biophys.

The complete amino acid sequence of eel anodic hemoglobin has been established and compared with that of other fish hemoglobins. The presence of the Root effect correlates with a specific configuration of the α1β2 switch interface, which at low pH would stabilize subunit ligation in the T state without changing the quaternary structure.

In contrast to mammals, fish show a large variation in the number of hemoglobin (Hb) components and in the mechanisms of oxygen binding modulation, which relates to their ability to adapt to widely different environmental conditions (1Weber R.E. Addink A.D.F. Spronk N. Exogenous and Endogenous Influences on Metabolic and Neural Control. 1. Pergamon Press Ltd., Oxford1982: 87-102Crossref Google Scholar, 2Weber R.E. Val A.L. Almeida-Val V.M.F. Randall D.J. Physiology and Biochemistry of the Fishes of the Amazon. Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia (INPA), Manaus, Brazil1996: 75-90Google Scholar). Conventionally, fish hemoglobins are divided into electrophoretically “cathodic” components (with high isoelectric points, pI ≥ 8.0) and “anodic” ones (with low isoelectric points, pI ≤ 8.0) that differ markedly in their functional properties (3Weber R.E. Comp. Physiol. 1990; 6: 58-75Google Scholar). The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) may be considered as the simplest model with two functionally distinct major hemoglobins (4Weber R.E. Lykkeboe G. Johansen K. J. Exp. Biol. 1976; 64: 75-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): a cathodic Hb with high oxygen affinity that is weakly affected by pH (with a small Bohr effect) (5Fago A. Carratore V. di Prisco G. Feuerlein R.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Weber R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18897-18902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and an anodic Hb showing low oxygen affinity and large Bohr and Root effects similar to many anodic fish hemoglobins.The Root effect of teleost fish is a large decrease in the oxygen affinity at low pH whereby the hemoglobin molecule cannot be fully saturated with oxygen even at very high oxygen tensions (6Scholander P.V. Van Dam L. Biol. Bull. ( Woods Hole ). 1954; 107: 247-259Crossref Google Scholar). The physiological role of Root-effect hemoglobins is to secrete oxygen into the swim bladder and the eye against high oxygen pressures following local acidification of the blood in a countercurrent capillary system (7Pelster B. Weber R.E. Advances in Comparative and Environmental Physiology. 8. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 51-77Google Scholar). During respiratory or metabolic acidosis, oxygen binding to anodic hemoglobins may be hampered by their strong Bohr and Root effects, whereby oxygen transport may increasingly depend on the pH-independent and highly cooperative cathodic components that are commonly found in active fish species.The Root effect originates from a strong, proton-dependent stabilization of the low affinity T (tense) quaternary structure relative to the high affinity R (relaxed) state (8Noble R.W. Parkhurst L.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6628-6633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibits the T → R allosteric transition and causes a drastic reduction in the Hill coefficient n 50 (the degree of cooperativity) to values close to unity or below. The T → R quaternary transition involves a rotation of the two α1β1 and α2β2dimers relative to each other so that large conformational changes occur at the interdimer α1β2 and α2β1 interfaces, whereas the intradimer α1β1 and α2β2interfaces remain virtually unaffected (9Baldwin J. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 175-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Salt bridges and hydrogen bonds are broken in the transition from the T to the R state, resulting in the release of Bohr protons. These noncovalent interactions stabilize the T relative to the R state and act as constraints that determine the low affinity of the T state (10Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar).Although several mechanisms have been proposed, the molecular basis for the extraordinarily high stability of the T state in Root-effect hemoglobins is not yet fully understood. In the stereochemical model of Perutz and Brunori (11Perutz M.F. Brunori M. Nature. 1982; 299: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the substitution of Cys-F9β (in human HbA) with Ser (in Root-effect fish hemoglobins) was indicated as a crucial factor. However, site-directed mutagenesis experiments on human HbA showed that this substitution is not sufficient to induce the Root effect (12Luisi B.F. Nagai K. Nature. 1986; 320: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). More recent studies on the crystal structure of the carbonmonoxy form of spot Hb (Leiostomus xanthurus) have suggested that electrostatic repulsions between the positively charged residues (including the N terminus of the β chain Lys-EF6β, Arg-H21, and His-HC3β) protruding into the central cavity between the β chains would destabilize the R state at low pH and induce the R → T transition that characterizes Root-effect hemoglobins (13Mylvaganam S.E. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Getzoff E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In spot Hb in the R state, the central cavity is narrower than in human HbA due to the presence of bulky Trp-NA3β and Met-EF2β residues (replacing Leu and Val in human HbA, respectively) and to a 3° larger rotation of the α1β1 relative to the α2β2 dimer (a similar rotation is found also in the Hb1 of the antarctic teleost Pagothenia bernacchii (14Camardella L. Caruso C. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Rutigliano B. Tamburrini M. Fermi G. Perutz M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)). However, this mechanism alone does not satisfactorily explain the absence of the Root effect in Hb1 of another antarctic nototheniid, Trematomus newnesi (15D'Avino R. Caruso C. Tamburrini M. Romano M. Rutigliano B. Polverino de Laureto P. Camardella L. Carratore V. di Prisco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9675-9681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has all the necessary key residues except that Lys-EF6β is replaced by Ala (the same substitution is present in Notothenia angustata Hb1, which shows the Root effect (16Fago A. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 210: 963-970Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). A bulky Met residue at position E19β in T. newnesi Hb1 has been suggested to interfere with the cluster formation (13Mylvaganam S.E. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Getzoff E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), although a bulky Ile residue is present at this position in other Root-effect hemoglobins like those of goldfish or carp.It appears that the search for the structural basis of the Root effect should not only concern the structural differences between the two end states, i.e. the fully deoxygenated T and the fully ligated R state, but should also focus on the molecular mechanisms that allow the hemoglobin molecule to remain in the T state even when it is in the ligated form.According to the two-state MWC model 1The abbreviations used are: MWC, Monod, Wyman, and Changeaux; RP-HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: MWC, Monod, Wyman, and Changeaux; RP-HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. (17Monod J. Wyman J. Changeaux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6084) Google Scholar), cooperativity of oxygen binding arises from a concerted transition between the T and R states, both with noncooperative oxygen binding. The MWC model satisfactorily describes highly cooperative systems with a major allosteric equilibrium, which is the reason for its widespread utility in the analysis of ligand interactions. Nevertheless, T state crystals of human HbA bind oxygen cooperatively (18Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Tsunehige A. Yonetani T. Eaton W.E. Henry E.R. Proteins Struct. Funct.

The presence of complex positive (intradimer) and negative (interdimer) cooperative interactions has been revealed in the T state of human HbA (21Ackers G.K. Doyle M.C. Myers D. Daugherty M.A. Science. 1992; 255: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 22LiCata V.J. Dalessio P.M. Ackers G.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 279-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on analysis of tetramer-dimer dissociation equilibria at different ligation stages, Ackers and co-workers (22LiCata V.J. Dalessio P.M. Ackers G.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 279-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) identified a third and intermediate allosteric structure between the T and R states of human HbA where ligand-induced tertiary conformational changes are accommodated within the T quaternary structure while the α1β2 interface acts as a constraint. The quaternary transition to the R state occurs when the two dimers have at least one ligated subunit, since the α1β2interface is then no longer stable in the T conformation. Accordingly, the release of the Bohr protons upon oxygenation is stepwise and comprises a tertiary Bohr effect, which reflects ligation within the T state and a quaternary Bohr effect, following the T → R transition (23Daugherty M.A. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10345-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The presence of cooperative interactions nested within a quaternary structure (24Wyman J. Q. Rev. Biphys. 1984; 17: 453-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) becomes apparent when the cooperativity originating from the major T ⇌ R allosteric equilibrium is inhibited as it is for Root-effect hemoglobins. As they may remain in the T state, even in the presence of oxygen, Root-effect hemoglobins represent ideal candidates for the study of the cooperative interactions occurring within the T state of tetrameric vertebrate hemoglobins.We have analyzed the allosteric properties of the Root-effect anodic eel Hb following the co-operon model (25Brunori M. Coletta M. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 23: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Gill S.J. Robert C.H. Coletta M. Di Cera E. Brunori M. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 747-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) by assuming cooperative interactions within the T quaternary state along with the T ⇌ R cooperative transition. The co-operon model has been successfully applied to many cooperative systems, including those of the giant oxygen-carrying molecules from invertebrates, where a concerted allosteric reaction of >100 subunits (according to the MWC model) appears unlikely (25Brunori M. Coletta M. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 23: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first report of such analysis of the allosteric properties of a Root-effect hemoglobin. Moreover, this study reports the amino acid sequence of the anodic eel Hb, which reveals a possible structural mechanism for the Root effect and allows identification of the potential binding sites for Bohr protons. It emerges from this study that an essential condition for the occurrence of the Root effect is that at low pH the α1β2 interface remains stable in the T state upon oxygen binding. This extends the basic stereochemical interpretation proposed by Perutz and Brunori (11Perutz M.F. Brunori M. Nature. 1982; 299: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and, more recently, by Mylvaganam et al. (13Mylvaganam S.E. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Getzoff E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONA remarkable feature of the oxygen equilibrium curves for the anodic Hb of eel is the deviation from linearity of the lower asymptote, which reflects the presence of cooperative interactions within the T state. Such behavior has not been reported before in other fish hemoglobins where such low oxygen saturation levels were not analyzed. In T state crystals of human HbA, a small amount of cooperativity compensates for inequivalent binding to the α and β subunits, resulting in perfectly noncooperative (n 50 = 1) oxygen binding (18Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Tsunehige A. Yonetani T. Eaton W.E. Henry E.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 25: 425-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fits neatly with the unitary slope of the lower asymptote observed in an extended Hill plot of human HbA in solution, which allows the use of the two-state MWC model for analysis of the allosteric properties. In the anodic eel Hb as well as in other Root-effect hemoglobins (38Brunori M. Coletta M. Giardina B. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. Gibson Q.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), highly biphasic oxygen binding curves with apparent negative cooperativity are observed at low pH and in the presence of organic phosphate (Fig. 5). These particular oxygen binding properties together with the nonlinear lower asymptote cannot be described by the MWC model. We show that the functional properties of eel anodic Hb can be described by assuming the presence of cooperative interactions in the T state, as included in the co-operon model (25Brunori M. Coletta M. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 23: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Gill S.J. Robert C.H. Coletta M. Di Cera E. Brunori M. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 747-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In its original formulation, the model assumes that the hemoglobin tetramer consists of two independent αβ dimers, each representing a cooperative unit or co-operon. However, later studies have shown that the two αβ dimers (α1β1 and α2β2) cannot be considered as functionally unrelated but that in the T state, ligation at one subunit enhances ligation at the other subunit of the same dimer and inhibits ligation at the opposite dimer (22LiCata V.J. Dalessio P.M. Ackers G.K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 279-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In our study, the parameter i therefore includes not only the intradimer cooperativity as in the original model but also any functional interaction between dimers across the α1β2 interface. Moreover, the situation in Root-effect hemoglobins is complicated by a large functional heterogeneity of the chains in the T state (40Noble R.W. Kwiatkowski L.D. De Young A. Davis B.J. Tam L.-T. Riggs A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 41Fago A. Romano M. Tamburrini M. Coletta M. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which is responsible for biphasic oxygen equilibrium curves at low pH and with organic phosphates and would contribute negatively to the T state cooperativity and decrease the value of i. This would explain both the low values of i (Table I) andn 50 (Fig. 4) found under these conditions, where the tetrameric molecule is essentially in the T state. It is important to note that the effect of organic phosphates is to shift the allosteric equilibrium toward the T state and to increase the pK a of Bohr groups (Fig. 4) rather than to enhance functional subunit heterogeneity in itself (41Fago A. Romano M. Tamburrini M. Coletta M. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), in agreement with the conclusion that organic phosphates and protons have a similar allosteric effect (42Gillen R.G. Riggs A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 678-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The apparent negative cooperativity between the α and β chains found at low pH with GTP therefore reflects a larger pH dependence (or a larger tertiary Bohr effect) of one of the two chains in the T state. By this mechanism, eel anodic Hb may release oxygen even in the absence of the T → R quaternary transition, which is the basis for the large Bohr effect observed in Root-effect hemoglobins. The increase in L and in the functional subunit heterogeneity at low pH is the basis for the larger decrease in oxygen saturation at high oxygen pressures found in Root-effect hemoglobins. In human HbA, a pH decrease produces an increase in L and a decrease in K T (32Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Haemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1982: 87-229Google Scholar) so that the decrease in oxygen saturation is larger at low oxygen tension. These two different mechanisms may relate to the different physiological roles of the two pH effects. The Bohr effect enhances the amount of oxygen released in the metabolizing tissues (at low oxygen tension), and the Root effect allows release of a large amount of oxygen in the eye and swim bladder (at high oxygen tensions (38Brunori M. Coletta M. Giardina B. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)).The inverse relationship between L and i suggests that in the T state of eel anodic Hb, positive cooperative interactions prevail in the presence of the T → R transition, whereas negative interactions become apparent in the absence of the quaternary transition. Although a detailed analysis of the opposing factors contributing to heme-heme interactions is impossible at this stage, it appears that at the level of the α1β2interface, cooperative interactions in the T state may either be negative (and produce the T → R transition, as in human HbA (22LiCata V.J.

Thus, a fundamental difference between Root-effect hemoglobins and hemoglobins with a normal Bohr effect such as human HbA is that at low pH, Root-effect hemoglobins remain in the T state, indicating that the α1β2 interface remains stable in the T state upon oxygenation, whereas human HbA switches to the R conformation. The comparison of the primary structure of the anodic hemoglobin of the eel with that of the cathodic Hb and other fish hemoglobins reveals that several concomitant factors may contribute to the expression of the Root effect in fish hemoglobins: a particular configuration of the α1β2 and β1β2 interfaces and the presence of proton binding groups.The α1β2 ContactSide-chain packing at this interface is likely to be the major reason for the larger rotation of the two dimers in the R state found in the hemoglobins of spot and P. bernacchii compared with human HbA. Moreover, a different α1β2 interface in fish hemoglobins is consistent with the lower tendency to split into dimers than human HbA (43Edelstein S.J. McEwen B. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7632-7637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In human HbA, at the dovetailed α1β2 switch contact (between the C helix and CD corner of the α subunit with the FG corner of the β subunit), His-FG4β packs between the side chains of Pro-CD2α and Thr-C6α in the T state, passes over one helix turn during the T → R transition, and packs between Thr-C6α and Thr-C3α in the R state. The ability of Root-effect hemoglobins to remain in the T state even when ligated may be related to a switch region different from that of human HbA and other fish hemoglobins (Table II). On the α chain, Gln is present at position C3, Thr or Ala is present at C6, a small residue (Ser, Ala, Thr) replaces the bulky Pro at position CD2, and Trp is highly conserved at CD4 whereas His is conserved at position FG4 of the β chain. Moreover, fish hemoglobins possess an additional residue in position CD5 of the α chain compared with human HbA (Table II). Ligation of β subunits within the T state of human HbA results in profound steric hindrance between the side chains of His-FG4β and Pro-CD2α (44Arata Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The substitution of Pro-CD2α with a smaller and more flexible residue in Root-effect hemoglobins (Ser, Ala, or Thr; Table II) is likely to stabilize β chain ligations in the T state. Ligation of α subunits in the quaternary T state may be favored by replacements at the flexible joint interface between the FG corner of the α chain and the C helix of the β chain. In deoxy human HbA, Arg-FG4α is bound to Glu CD2β, which is replaced by a neutral amino acid residue in Root-effect hemoglobins (Ser, Ala or Gly; Table II), so that Arg-FG4α may instead form a hydrogen bond with Gln-C5β (conserved in all fish hemoglobins) as found in deoxy trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) HbI (45Tame J.R.H. Wilson J.C. Weber R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The same interaction between Arg-FG4α and Gln-C5β is present in oxygenated crystals of T state human HbA (20Paoli M. Liddington R. Tame J. Wilkinson A. Dodson G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 775-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which indicates that the replacement of Glu-CD2β may stabilize intermediates in the oxygenation process of T state molecules (45Tame J.R.H. Wilson J.C. Weber R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Hemoglobin molecules that remain in the low affinity T state at low pH even when ligated will also have a larger number of oxygen-linked protons or a larger Bohr factor than hemoglobins that switch to the R state upon ligation. This means that the number of proton-binding sites in Root-effect hemoglobins does not need to be higher than in human HbA. The stabilization of the T state in Root-effect hemoglobins may be achieved not by an increased number of salt bridges but by a different allosteric mechanism where the stabilization of the α1β2 interface upon oxygenation is an essential condition.Proton-binding SitesAnodic eel Hb can bind seven to eight Bohr protons per tetramer in the presence of GTP at physiological pH. A major candidate as a proton-binding site is His-HC3β, which is conserved in all Root-effect hemoglobins (Table II). Glu-FG1β is also generally conserved in Root-effect hemoglobins (except for one of the three Root-effect hemoglobins of the antarctic Pleuragramma antarcticum where it is substituted by Gln (46Tamburrini M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23780-23785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)), indicating that a salt bridge between these two residues may be formed in the T state, as known for human HbA (where Asp is in position FG1β). Quite unexpectedly, in the crystal structure of the deoxygenated P. bernacchii Hb1 (47Ito N. Komiyama N.H. Fermi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), His-HC3β was found free in solution and not bound to Glu-FG1β, which leaves a major part of the Bohr and Root effects difficult to explain. Asp-G1α and Asp-G3β were indicated as possible Bohr groups in this hemoglobin, as they move closer to each other upon deoxygenation and could thereby increase their pK a and share a proton. By analogy with P. bernacchii, Hb1, Asp-G1α, and Asp-G3β have been proposed as binding sites for two of the four oxygen-linked protons in spot Hb, where the remaining two protons would bind between the N terminus and His-HC3 of each β subunit (13Mylvaganam S.E. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Getzoff E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the contribution to the Bohr effect of these two Asp residues appears questionable since they are conserved in all fish hemoglobins including trout HbI, which exhibits pH-independent oxygen binding. Moreover, in the deoxygenated form of trout HbI, Asp-G3β makes a salt bridge with Arg-G6β (conserved in fish hemoglobins or replaced by Lys in antarctic teleosts), thus preventing the two Asp residues from increasing their pK a and participating in the Bohr effect (45Tame J.R.H. Wilson J.C. Weber R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).We propose that another major Bohr group in eel anodic Hb and other Root-effect hemoglobin may be His-FG4β, located at the switch interface. Histidines in both positions HC3β and FG4β are replaced in the cathodic hemoglobins of eel (5Fago A. Carratore V. di Prisco G. Feuerlein R.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Weber R.E. J. Biol.

Cas belongs to a new family of structurally related proteins that are thought to act as “docking molecules,” i.e. regulating the assembly of several SH2 and SH3 domain-containing proteins into signaling complexes. This family includes three members so far: Cas, HEF1/Cas-L (25Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp.

They all contain an SH3 domain in the N-terminal region; a cluster of SH2 domain-binding motifs that have been named the “substrate domain” (27Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar); and, with the exception of HEF1/Cas-L, several potential binding motifs for SH3 domains. Following β1 integrin cross-linking, Cas phosphorylation was most prominent in B cell lines representative of a more differentiated state, such as the multiple myeloma cell lines ARH-77, IM-9, and RPMI 8226, and was minimally detectable in normal mature B cells (24Manié S. Beck A. Astier A. Law S. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B. Avraham H. Haghayeghi N. Sattler M. Salgia R. Griffin J. Golemis E. Freedman A. J. Biol.

In contrast, HEF1 was consistently tyrosine-phosphorylated in all immature, mature, and terminally differentiated B cell lines as well as in normal B cells following both β1 integrin and B cell antigen receptor ligation. Therefore, the phosphorylation of these two related molecules appears to be differentially regulated in B cells. Proteins interacting with Cas include FAK and PTP-1B, which bind to the Cas SH3 domain (31Polte T. Hanks S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5′-fragments of the cDNAs with an in-frame XbaI site were generated using polymerase chain reaction and cloned together with the corresponding 3′-fragment into the restriction sites XbaI andEcoRI of pSP65-SRα.2-HAtag-Hygro. The expression plasmids were used to transiently transfect COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran/Me2SO method as described (48Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation studies, cell lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala) and then preincubated with specific antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. For precipitations with GST fusion proteins, lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 25 μg of fusion proteins bound to glutathione beads (Pharmacia). Precipitated proteins were washed four times with lysis buffer and subjected to kinase assay or eluted by boiling in sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 0.02% bromphenol blue). For sequential immunoprecipitation, washed beads were boiled for 5 min in the presence of 2% SDS, and the supernatants were reprecipitated with antibodies in lysis buffer containing a 0.1% final SDS concentration. In vitro kinase assays were performed by washing Cas immunoprecipitates once in kinase buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.3, containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm sodium vanadate) and incubating the pellet in kinase buffer containing 0.1 mm ATP (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon-P™ membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 130 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h with specific antibodies in TBS-T. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) and chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). To examine Cas-associated tyrosine kinase(s), the B cell line ARH-77 was stimulated with the anti-β1 integrin mAb K20 followed by rabbit anti-mouse Ig. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Cas antibody, and subjected (+) or not (−) to an in vitrokinase assay for 10 min (Fig. 1 A, upper panels). Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis showed that Cas immune complexes contained a transient tyrosine kinase(s) activity (maximally detected at 5 and 15 min), which resulted in increasedin vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas plus an additional main band ranging from 55 to 60 kDa. The same membrane was reprobed with anti-Cas antibody to show that equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitated Cas were loaded in each lane (Fig. 1 A,middle panels). The in vitro phosphorylated 55–60-kDa band contained a sharp 59-kDa protein, which was suggestive of the presence of p59Fyn kinase. To investigate this possibility, the membrane was reprobed with anti-p59Fynantibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, (lower panels), anti-Fyn antibody reacted with a faint band detectable only in the5 and 15 min lanes of stimulation. To further confirm the identity of this 59-kDa protein, anti-Cas or control (Ct) immunoprecipitates from 15-min β1 integrin-stimulated ARH-77 cells were subjected to in vitro kinase assays (Ip 1), and half of the samples were then reimmunoprecipitated with anti-Fyn antibody (Ip 2). As shown in Fig. 1 B (lower panel), Fyn could be reimmunoprecipitated from Cas immune complexes, but not from control immunoprecipitates. Fyn was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig.1 B, upper panel) and comigrated with the sharp pp59. These results indicate that Fyn kinase associates in an integrin-regulated manner with Cas and strongly suggest that it participates in Cas phosphorylation. The C terminus of Cas contains a proline-rich sequence (RPLPSPP) and a YDYV motif, which have been shown to bind to Src SH3 and SH2 domains, respectively (37Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Since we have previously reported that a GST fusion protein containing the RPLPSPP sequence bound to Fyn (24Manié S. Beck A. Astier A. Law S. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B. Avraham H. Haghayeghi N. Sattler M. Salgia R. Griffin J. Golemis E. Freedman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we further examined the requirement of this region of Cas for Fyn/Cas interaction. cDNAs encoding HA-tagged wild-type Cas or deletion mutants of Cas were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells in the presence or absence of cDNA encoding Fyn. The mutants of Cas included the following: Cas ΔSD, in which the sequence from amino acids 213 to 514, which contains the substratedomain with 15 out of 27 potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation within Cas, was deleted; and Cas ΔSB, in which the sequence from amino acids 638 to 889, which contains the Src SH2 and SH3 domain-binding motifs, was deleted (37Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). To discriminate transfected Cas proteins from endogenous Cas proteins, lysates of transfected COS-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA tag antibody. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of the anti-HA tag immunoprecipitations indicated that the presence of cotransfected Fyn led to Cas phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). The Cas ΔSD mutant, although lacking some of the potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation, showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of Fyn. In contrast, the Cas ΔSB mutant cotransfected with Fyn demonstrated reduced tyrosine phosphorylation when compared with Cas or Cas ΔSD. Therefore, the SB domain of Cas was necessary for Fyn-mediated Cas phosphorylation. Comparable levels of expression of Cas, Cas mutants (Fig. 3 B), and Fyn (Fig. 3 D) were detected regardless of the cotransfection conditions. More important, Fyn kinase was co-immunoprecipitated with Cas and Cas ΔSD, but not with Cas ΔSB (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the SB region was required for a physical interaction between Fyn and Cas.Figure 3Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by coexpression with Fyn kinase in COS-7 cells requires the Src-binding site of Cas. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with control plasmid (Mock) or with plasmid encoding HA-tagged wild-type Cas (Cas WT), HA-tagged Cas with the Src-binding site deleted (ΔSB), or HA-tagged Cas with the substrate domain deleted (ΔSD). A second set of cells were also cotransfected with a plasmid encoding Fyn (+ Fyn). Transfected Cas was immunoprecipitated (Ip) using anti-HA antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) antibody (P-Tyr) (A). The positions of Cas, Cas ΔSB, Cas ΔSD, and Fyn are indicated. The membrane was then stripped and reblotted with anti-Cas (Cas; B) or anti-Fyn (Fyn; C) antibodies as indicated. Cotransfected cell lysates were also immunoprecipitated with anti-Fyn antibodies to control for the amount of Fyn expression within the cells (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further study the interaction between Cas and Fyn, we performed binding experiments with truncated GST-Fyn fusion proteins corresponding to the SH2 or SH3 domain of Fyn. Fusion proteins were incubated with lysates of unstimulated (Fig. 4 A, 0 lanes) or β1 integrin-stimulated (β1 lanes) ARH-77 cells, and the presence of Cas was analyzed by immunoblotting. To control for the integrin-mediated Cas tyrosine phosphorylation, anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations from the same samples were also analyzed. Fig.4 A shows that Cas did not bind to GST protein alone. In contrast, Cas that was derived from stimulated cells was able to bind to the GST-Fyn SH2 domain, whereas Cas from both unstimulated and stimulated cells bound to the GST-Fyn SH3 domain. In this experiment, Cas was seen to migrate as 105- and 130-kDa bands as described previously (24Manié S. Beck A. Astier A. Law S. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B. Avraham H. Haghayeghi N. Sattler M. Salgia R. Griffin J. Golemis E. Freedman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), with the main increased phosphorylation in the 130-kDa form. Hyperphosphorylated Cas precipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or GST-Fyn SH2 protein resolved with a slower migration (27Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The membrane was reprobed with anti-GST antibody to show that comparable amounts of GST fusion proteins were used to precipitate Cas (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that the Fyn SH3 domain binds to Cas in vitro and that integrin-stimulated phosphorylation of Cas creates a binding site for the Fyn SH2 domain. To investigate the presence of a Cas-associated tyrosine phosphatase, Cas immunoprecipitates from β1 integrin-stimulated ARH-77 cells were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with or without the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate (Fig. 5 A). The tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was markedly increased with the addition of sodium vanadate in the kinase assay. These results indicate that a tyrosine phosphatase activity is associated with Cas immunoprecipitates. Because the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 has been shown recently to associate through its SH2 domains with the Cas-related Cas-L (HEF1) protein (25Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we tested whether SHP2 also associated with Cas. Unstimulated or β1 integrin-stimulated ARH-77 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cas (Cas) or control (Ct) antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-SHP2 antibody (Fig. 5 B). Compared with unstimulated cells and control immunoprecipitates, a 72-kDa band reactive with anti-SHP2 antibody was clearly increased in Cas complexes isolated from β1 integrin-stimulated cells. ARH-77 cells were then β1 integrin-stimulated for 0, 2, 5, and 15 min, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cas antibody (Fig. 5 C). Cas quantification was comparable at 2, 5, and 15 min and showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation, which correlated with Cas-SHP2 complex formation, which was increased at the 5- and 15-min time points. These results suggest that similar to HEF1/Cas-L, SHP2 associates with Cas in an integrin-regulated manner. Therefore, SHP2 is likely to be associated with the phosphatase activity observed in vitro and might play a role in the in vivo control of Cas dephosphorylation. Integrins are involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival in a variety of cell types, events that are dependent upon tyrosine phosphorylation (49Schwartz M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1503-1506PubMed Google Scholar). Cas has been identified to be a major tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate following integrin ligation (20Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K.

In this study, we found that precipitations of Cas immune complexes from integrin-stimulated cells contained both tyrosine kinase and tyrosine phosphatase activities, which modulated the in vitro phosphorylation of Cas. Furthermore, Fyn tyrosine kinase and SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase were recruited in Cas complexes, suggesting that they participate in modulating Cas phosphorylation. The C-terminal proline-rich region of Cas can associate in vitro with several Src kinases, including p59Fyn, p59/62Hck, and p53/56Lyn (24Manié S. Beck A. Astier A. Law S. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B.

In this study, we found that in ARH-77 cells, Fyn was the most obvious kinase detectable. The focal adhesion kinases FAK and RAFTK can associate with Cas (18Astier A. Avraham H.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2467-2472PubMed Google Scholar). In B cells, RAFTK and, to a lesser extent, FAK are both tyrosine-phosphorylated following integrin ligation (14Manié S. Astier A. Wang D. Phifer J. Chen J. Lazarovits A. Morimoto C. Freedman A. Blood. 1996; 87: 1855-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Astier A. Avraham H. Manié S.N Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Similar to Src kinases, the kinase activity of RAFTK and FAK correlates with an increase in autophosphorylation activity in certain cell types (15Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D. Li J. Jiang S. Pasztor L.M. White R.A. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27742-27751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 50Hildebrand J. Schaller M. Parsons J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, we previously reported that Cas associated with RAFTK is mainly nonphosphorylated on tyrosine residues (18Astier A. Avraham H. Manié S.N Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition, we did not observe tyrosine-phosphorylated bands corresponding in size to RAFTK and FAK, 120 and 125 kDa, respectively. This results suggest that in nontransfected cells and under the conditions of these assays, these two kinases may not be sufficient for Cas phosphorylation. Further support of this is the observation that Cas phosphorylation is reduced in fibroblasts lacking Src kinases, but remains unaffected in fibroblasts lacking FAK (34Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Morino N. Furuya H. Nakamoto T. Aizawa S. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a cotransfection assay in COS-7 cells, we found that the Fyn/Cas physical interaction and subsequent Fyn-mediated Cas phosphorylation required amino acids 638–889 in the C-terminal region of Cas. This sequence contains a polyproline stretch (RPLPSPP) and a YDYV motif to which both Fyn SH3 and SH2 domains could bind in vivo.In vitro studies using GST fusion proteins derived from the SH2 and SH3 domains of Fyn indicated that both domains could participate in this Fyn/Cas interaction. However, the in vivo association of Fyn and Cas was transient and correlated with Cas tyrosine phosphorylation, implying a regulation of this interaction. Whether the Fyn SH3 domain is primarily involved in Cas binding or is subsequent to Fyn SH2 binding to reinforce the interaction between the two proteins is not known. A precedent for the predominant binding of the SH2 domain over the SH3 domain has been described for the interaction of p120Cbl with phosphoinositol 3′-kinase (51Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S. Panchamoorthy G. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19141-19150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The Cas-like protein Sin leads to activation of Src kinase activity on binding of Sin to the c-Src SH3 domain (30Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Similarly, it is possible that Fyn binding to Cas will stimulate the kinase activity of Fyn, which in turn will lead to the effective phosphorylation of Cas and allow the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing molecules such as the adapter proteins of the Crk family (23Petruzzelli L. Takami M. Herrera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7796-7801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,24Manié S. Beck A. Astier A. Law S. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B. Avraham H.

N., Law, S. F., Canty, T., Hagheyeghi, N., Druker, B. J., Salgia, R., Golemis, E. A., and Freedman, A. S. (1997) Leukemia Lymphoma, in press. In support of this is the finding that Fyn-phosphorylated Cas in COS cells interacts with Crk (data not shown). The assembly of this complex of proteins might further enable recruited proteins to interact with and potentially be phosphorylated by Fyn. Since the phosphorylation of Cas is likely to be an important event in the propagation and amplification of downstream signals of integrin ligation, a mechanism of down-regulating that process is critical. A role for SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase in modulating the phosphorylation of Cas in B cells came from the finding that SHP2 was recruited in Cas complexes following integrin ligation. The Cas-SHP2 association correlated with the extent of Cas tyrosine phosphorylation. In view of the recent finding that SHP2 associates with HEF1/Cas-L through its SH2 domains (25Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it is possible that a similar mechanism occurs for Cas-SHP2 assembly. This might result in activation of SHP2 activity since engagement of its SH2 domains following binding to platelet-derived growth factor receptor β stimulates its tyrosine phosphatase activity (52Lechleider R.J. Sugimoto S. Bennett A.M. Kashishian A.S. Cooper J.A. Shoelson S.E. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21478-21481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two other protein-tyrosine phosphatases, namely PTP-1B and PTP-PEST, can also associate with Cas (33Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 38Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and might participate in the Cas-associated phosphatase activity. The precise mechanism by which integrin cross-linking leads to the activation of the kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) is presently unclear. Integrin-mediated phosphorylated Cas localizes to focal adhesions, whereas nonphosphorylated Cas remains in the cytosol (22Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Such Cas localization may be driven by its constitutive association through its SH3 domain with FAK, due to the FAK C-terminal focal adhesion targeting domain (50Hildebrand J. Schaller M. Parsons J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Therefore, redistributed Cas during integrin stimulation might localize Cas to a region of the cell where Cas will be accessible to tyrosine kinases. Support for this hypothesis is that optimal Cas phosphorylation requires an intact cytoskeleton since inhibitors of cytoskeletal assembly also inhibit integrin-mediated Cas tyrosine phosphorylations (20Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

A potential sequence of events leading to Cas phosphorylation in ARH-77 cells could be that integrin-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization allows the co-compartmentalization of Cas and Fyn. Activated Fyn, possibly by its binding to Cas, phosphorylates Cas, leading to the formation of a signaling complex including Crk family members and SHP2. SHP2, which becomes activated following SH2-mediated binding to phosphorylated Cas, could then participate in downstream signaling events and/or attenuate the activity of the complex by dephosphorylating Cas. Cas and the Cas-like protein HEF1 are both expressed in normal B cells and most B cell lines (24Manié S. Beck A. Astier A. Law S. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B. Avraham H. Haghayeghi N. Sattler M. Salgia R. Griffin J. Golemis E. Freedman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, Cas is the predominant substrate that is phosphorylated in terminally differentiated B cell lines following β1 integrin ligation, whereas HEF1 is the major phosphorylated substrate in normal tonsillar B cells and other B cell lines. It is unknown why Cas or HEF1 is the favored substrate in certain cells, although this may be related to the compartmentalization and activation of specific kinases during integrin-induced cytoskeleton reorganization.

In particular, it is able to bind to symmetric and asymmetric sites with the same affinity, with both sites being functional in A. nidulans. Here, we show that unlike the other proteins of the Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster family, AlcR binds most probably as a monomer to its cognate targets. Two molecules of the AlcR protein can simultaneously bind in a noncooperative manner to inverted repeats. The consensus core has been determined precisely (5′-CCGCN-3′), and the AlcR-binding site in the aldApromoter has been localized. The sequence downstream of the zinc cluster is necessary for high affinity binding. Furthermore, our data show that the use of the carrier protein glutathioneS-transferase in AlcR binding experiments introduces an important bias in the recognition of DNA sites due to its tertiary dimeric structure.

Among the Zn2Cys6 zinc binuclear cluster proteins, some have been characterized both biochemically and structurally by analysis of their three-dimensional conformations. Most of them, such as GAL4, PPR1, and UaY, bind to symmetric DNA sites as dimers through their coiled-coil dimerization element. HAP1 recognizes asymmetric sites (9Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and it has been shown recently that the Zn2Cys6 zinc cluster is responsible for asymmetric binding, with the coiled-coil region stabilizing the complex (10Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, other proteins of this family, e.g. ARGR2 and MAL63 (11Reece R.J. Ptashne M. Science. 1993; 261: 909-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), have been suggested to function as monomers. AlcR, the specific transactivator of the alc cluster involved in ethanol utilization and in other related carbon metabolic pathways (12Felenbok B. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Martinelli S. Kinghorn J.R. Genetics and Physiology of Aspergillus nidulans. 29. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1994: 141-179Google Scholar, 13Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), appears to be different from the other members of the Zn2Cys6 family. It contains in its DNA-binding domain, between the third and fourth cysteines, an unusual extended sequence of 16 residues instead of the six to eight usually found, and no predicted dimerization regions were found downstream of the zinc cluster. Furthermore, unlike the other members of this family, AlcR appears to bind with the same affinity to both symmetric and asymmetric sites containing the consensus motif 5′-CCGCA-3′ (14Kulmburg P.

Both types of targets localized in the alcR andalcA promoters have been shown to be functional in vivo (15Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol.

The AlcR-binding sites have been determined previously using a bacterial expression system with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay.1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. fusion protein (GST-AlcR-(7–60)) (14Kulmburg P.

Bacterially expressed fusion proteins are widely used to identify specific DNA sequences that are recognized by regulators. Among them, GST presents several advantages since it provides high yields of protein that can be easily purified to homogeneity. Furthermore, cleavage by thrombin releases the DNA-binding protein (17Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein system was successfully used to determine the DNA-binding sites for a number of proteins such as SWI5 in yeast (18Brazas R. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5424-5437Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), N-Myc in mouse (19Alex R. Sozeri O. Meyer S. Dildrop R.

Cell. 1991; 65: 1073-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In A. nidulans, binding sites for the CreA repressor (16Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1453-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) activators have been localized using GST fusion proteins. The binding sites have been shown to be functional in vivo, as for AlcR-binding sites. In this report, we have compared the binding specificities of the GST-AlcR-(1–60) fusion protein and a longer AlcR-(1–197) protein, tagged at its carboxyl terminus with six histidine residues. We demonstrate that the use of GST introduces an important bias in the recognition of DNA sites as the result of its quaternary dimeric structure. It prevented the identification of an AlcR-binding site in the aldA promoter that is now established. It hindered the important observation that the AlcR protein binds presumably as a monomer to DNA, unlike the other proteins of the Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster family. Two molecules of the AlcR protein can simultaneously bind in a noncooperative manner to symmetric sites, whereas only one molecule occupies a direct repeat site. Finally, we show also that the sequence downstream of the zinc cluster is necessary for high affinity binding. To construct the GST-AlcR fusion expression vector, a DNA fragment encompassing the AlcR DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–60) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in frame with the GST gene in the pGEX-2T plasmid (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The protein was expressed from thetac promoter and purified as described earlier (17Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar, 14Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The protein obtained was 80–90% pure as judged by SDS gel electrophoresis using Coomassie Blue staining. The AlcR peptide was separated from GST by cleavage with thrombin (1 unit/mg of fusion protein; Sigma) in the presence of 2.5 mmCaCl2 for 10 min at 30 °C. The mixture was loaded onto a Resource S high pressure liquid chromatography column (6 ml; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) pre-equilibrated in 10 mm phosphate (pH 7.2) and 0.1 m NaCl. AlcR was eluted using an increasing gradient of 1 m NH4Cl, 10 mmphosphate (pH 7.2), and 0.1 m NaCl. The eluted AlcR peptide was then passed through a p-aminobenzamidine column (Sigma) to remove contaminating thrombin, and pH was adjusted to 6.0. A plasmid expressing AlcR-(1–197) tagged with His6 at its C terminus was constructed by cloning theNcoI-BamHI fragment into the pET-22b vector (QIAGEN Inc.). The NcoI site was introduced into the ATG codon during polymerase chain reaction amplification. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells bearing the expression plasmid were grown at 37 °C to A 600 = 0.6. After 3 h of induction with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in the presence of 20 μm ZnCl2, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.9) containing 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μm ZnCl2. After sonication, the AlcR protein was partially purified on a Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column according to the recommendations of the supplier (QIAGEN Inc.) using a stepwise gradient of imidazole. The fraction eluted at 40 mm imidazole was directly used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The purity of the His-tagged AlcR protein was estimated to be 15% by SDS gel electrophoresis. It migrated as a 33-kDa polypeptide. Background contamination arose from E. coli proteins bound nonspecifically to Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose rather than from products of AlcR-(1–197)-His6 degradation since even at high protein concentration, no extra DNA complex was observed in gel band shift experiments (see Figs. 3 and 4).Figure 1Schematic representation of AlcR proteins. A, schematic representation of the AlcR proteins used in this study. GST-AlcR-(1–60) contains only the DNA-binding domain of AlcR. Cleavage by thrombin of this protein results in the AlcR-(1–60) peptide, which contains two additional amino acids at its N terminus. AlcR-(1–197) carries the Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster and the downstream region. It has a leader sequence (exportation of the foreign protein in E. coli) at its N terminus and six histidine residues at its C terminus for purification on a Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column.B, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of different AlcR samples. 1–2 μg of GST-AlcR-(1–60) or AlcR-(1–60) and 10 μg of partially purified AlcR-(1–197)-His6 were loaded per lane.C, amino acid sequence of the DNA-binding fragment of AlcR-(1–197).

DNA binding shift assays were carried out as described previously (14Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with several modifications. They were performed in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 4 mm spermidine, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm ZnCl2, 2 μg of (dI-dC) n, 5% glycerol, 20–40 fmol of radiolabeled DNA probe, and increasing amounts of AlcR protein. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, samples were loaded onto 6% polyacrylamide gels and run in 0.25 × TBE buffer (Tris borate/EDTA) at 4 °C and 18 V/cm for 45 min. 10% polyacrylamide gels were utilized for EMSA with the AlcR-(1–60) peptide to increase the separation between the probe and the complex. Double-strand oligonucleotides containing a specific target for AlcR were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.). However, single-strand oligonucleotides present in the same mixture were also end-labeled, which results in two different types of probes on the EMSA gels. Single-strand oligonucleotides migrated faster than double-strand oligonucleotides (see Figs. 2 and 4); therefore, to calculate the AlcR relative affinity, only the double-strand probe had to be taken into account. The relative apparent affinity of AlcR was defined from gel shift reactions as the concentration of AlcR protein required to bind half of double-strand DNA. Quantification was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.).Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyProbe (gene)Sequence of the top strand 5′ to 3′ 1-aConsensus motifs are indicated in boldface.Sizeb (alcA)GATGCATGCGGAACCGCACGAGGGC25-mer1/2bGATGCATGCGGAAATAACCGAGGGC25-merc (alcA)GGTACTGTCCGCACGGGATGTCCGCACGGAGA32-merA (alcR)GATGGGCTAGCGGAAATGCGGGGGGCGGC29-merB1 (aldA)GCCTCAACAAGAGCGGCTCCGCTTGACC28-mer1-a Consensus motifs are indicated in boldface. Open table in a new tab Two plasmids of different length encoding the AlcR N-terminal region, namely AlcR-(1–163) and AlcR-(1–197), were constructed by cloning amplified DNA fragments into the T7 expression vector pET-22b digested withNcoI and XhoI or with NcoI andBamHI, respectively. The corresponding proteins were expressed in a transcription-translation system (Promega) according to the recommendations of the supplier by adding 1 μg of each plasmid either alone or mixed into the reaction mixture. Expression of AlcR proteins was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. 5–10 μl of translation products were used directly in DNA mobility shift assays. The DNAs used in the footprinting analysis were oligonucleotides containing AlcR sites as listed in TableI. Methylation interference was performed as described previously (14Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, single-strand DNA was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), annealed with its complementary nonlabeled strand, and used for EMSAs. End-labeled DNA probes were partially methylated by dimethyl sulfate following the procedure of Maxam and Gilbert (22Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9012) Google Scholar). The chemically modified probes (103 counts/s) were incubated with 1000 ng of partially purified AlcR-(1–197) as described above. Bound and unbound DNAs were sliced from a preparative EMSA gel and electroeluted onto DEAE NA45 membrane in 1 × TBE buffer. Recovered DNAs were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, cleaved by 1 m piperidine according to Maxam and Gilbert (22Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9012) Google Scholar), and subjected to electrophoresis on a 16% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Previous studies have shown that the GST-AlcR-(7–60) fusion protein binds to inverted and direct repeat sites with the same consensus core (5′-CCGCA-3′) in the alcR and alcA promoters. Both types of sites have been shown to be functional in vivo(15Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21146-21153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol.

Felenbok, unpublished results. Surprisingly, the interactions between the AlcR fusion proteins and guanines within the motif appeared to be different in both types of targets (14Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21146-21153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since GST (the fusion protein carrier) is known to be dimeric in solution (23Mannervik B. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1985; 57: 357-417PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lim K. Ho J.X. Keeling K. Gilliland G.L. Ji X. Ruker F. Carter D.C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3735: 2233-2244Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and hence could introduce a bias in the DNA binding specificity, we decided to perform in parallel the same binding experiments with another bacterially synthesized AlcR protein consisting of six histidine residues fused to the C terminus of the truncated AlcR protein (residues 1–197) and purified on a nickel column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Such chimeric proteins are also widely used. For example, NMR studies of the Fru repressor from E. coli showed that the extra histidine residues have no influence on the protein conformation and its activity (25Scarabel M. Penin F. Bonod-Bidaud C. Negre D. Cozzone A.J. Cortay J.C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 153: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The three AlcR proteins utilized in this DNA binding study are depicted in Fig. 1 (A and B). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the GST-AlcR-(1–60) protein migrated on SDS gels according to its predicted size (34 kDa), whereas the AlcR-(1–197) (≈25 kDa) and AlcR-(1–60) (≈7 kDa) proteins exhibited aberrant electrophoretic mobility. These results remained unexplained. In the case of the AlcR-(1–60) peptide, the molecular mass determined by mass spectroscopy appeared to be 7.1 kDa. 4R. Cerdan and E. Guittet, personal communication. The GST-AlcR-(1–60) protein contains only the AlcR DNA-binding domain, including the amino terminus (amino acids 1–6), which was deleted in our previous studies. Cleavage by thrombin resulted in the isolated AlcR-(1–60) peptide, which was purified (see “Experimental Procedures”). The His-tagged AlcR-(1–197) protein (Fig.1 C) comprises additional domains equivalent to those present in other proteins of the zinc cluster family, the so-called linker and dimerization regions. Therefore, questions may also be addressed to the role in AlcR binding of these two regions described as essential elements for the binding specificity of proteins of this Zn2Cys6 class. Two chimeric proteins, His-tagged AlcR-(1–197) and GST-AlcR-(1–60), were initially tested by gel retardation assays with a wild-type inverted repeat probe (probe b in the alcA promoter) (Fig.2). Upon an increase in the AlcR-(1–197) protein concentration, a second complex of higher molecular mass was formed (Fig. 3 A). Competition experiments showed that both AlcR-(1–197) complexes (I and II) are specific (data not shown). The apparent K d for complex I was estimated as 4 × 10−8m and that for complex II as 2 × 10−8m, which is not significantly different. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the mobility of the fast migrating complex (complex I) corresponded to that of the complex obtained with a single copy site (probe 1/2b), indicating the DNA interaction of one AlcR molecule. Therefore, the slow migrating complex (complex II) contains two AlcR molecules bound noncooperatively to a palindromic sequence. With the AlcR-(1–60) peptide containing only the zinc binuclear cluster, at very high protein concentration (1000 ng), two complexes were observed, indicating the binding of two AlcR molecules (Fig.3 B). The low affinity binding observed with the AlcR DNA-binding domain alone supports the idea that the sequence downstream of the zinc cluster (amino acids 61–197) contributes significantly to high affinity binding. This is indicative of either an increase in stability or thermostability of the complex and/or additional contacts between AlcR and DNA. Interestingly, it was observed previously that the binding of the AlcR-(7–60) peptide is unstable, and DNA binding activity was restored by changing the conditions of gel band shift experiments as described in Ref. 14Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and under “Experimental Procedures.” With GST-AlcR-(1–60), only one complex was obtained whatever the protein concentration (Fig. 3 C). The apparentK d was estimated as 10−9m, indicating a high affinity binding of GST-AlcR-(1–60). Therefore, the presence of the GST moiety enhances GST-AlcR-(1–60) affinity for its specific target by 10-fold. The presence of only one complex is not surprising since the GST protein naturally occurs as a dimer, and thus, one single complex contains two AlcR molecules. Therefore, the dimeric structure of the GST protein prevents AlcR binding to single sites. The simplest interpretation of these experiments is that AlcR is able to bind DNA as a monomer. To test this hypothesis, transcription-translation assays in the reticulocyte lysate system were performed using two plasmid constructions encompassing alcR encoding His-tagged proteins of different length: AlcR-(1–163)-His6 and AlcR-(1–197)-His6. The AlcR-(1–163) protein contains the region corresponding to the two heptad repeats in GAL4 involved in dimerization, and the AlcR-(1–197) protein contains an additional downstream region (Fig. 1 C). Fig. 4 A shows that the two35S-labeled AlcR proteins were produced in the in vitro reticulocyte transcription-translation system and could be expressed simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 4 B, no AlcR heterodimer-DNA complex was formed when the two different AlcR proteins expressed simultaneously in the reticulocyte lysate were assayed against the inverted repeat probe b target in the alcApromoter. These results show that within the AlcR protein containing 197 residues, no dimerization sequence is present. It is a strong indication that AlcR binds DNA as a monomer. One intriguing question was the localization of AlcR-binding sites in the promoter of the aldA gene (26Pickett M. Gwynne D.I. Buxton F.P. Elliot R. Davies R.W. Lockington R.A. Scazzocchio C. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 51: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the transcription of which is absolutely dependent upon alcRexpression (12Felenbok B. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Martinelli S. Kinghorn J.R. Genetics and Physiology of Aspergillus nidulans. 29. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1994: 141-179Google Scholar). Analysis of the promoter showed the presence of an inverted repeat with T instead of A in the fifth position of the consensus core (5′-AGCGGCTCCGCT-3′) (Fig. 2 and TableI). Previous gel band shift experiments with GST-AlcR-(7–60) and overlapping restriction fragments in thealdA promoter failed to demonstrate any retardation (1Kulmburg P. Prangé T. Mathieu M. Sequeval D. Scazzocchio C. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to test this potential AlcR target with the AlcR-(1–197) protein in parallel with the GST-AlcR-(1–60) protein. This sequence is similar to the functional inverted repeat target in the alcR promoter (14Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with a symmetric change of the last base pair A to T (probe aldA (B1)). As shown in Fig. 5, nucleotide change prevented completely the binding of the GST-AlcR-(1–60) fusion protein to the probe. In contrast, the His-tagged AlcR-(1–197) protein was able to form two complexes with a slightly lower affinity as compared with the inverted repeat sequence present in the alcA promoter. A similar pattern of binding was observed when the last A was replaced by C. Taken together, these results imply that there is no strong preference in the fifth position of the consensus motif for tight binding. Therefore, the presence of the GST moiety hinders the identification of an AlcR palindromic target in the aldApromoter. Previous footprinting and gel retardation experiments have shown that the direct repeat sequence in the alcR promoter (probe A) (Table I and Fig. 2) may be occupied by the GST-AlcR-(7–60) fusion protein only if the adjacent inverted repeat target (probe B) is bound by the fusion protein (14Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 A, no binding to the alcR direct repeat target was observed with the GST-AlcR-(1–60) fusion protein, even at high protein concentration. Conversely, the His-tagged AlcR-(1–197) protein formed a single complex with a lower affinity compared with the alcA direct repeat target (probe c) (see below). It is evident that one AlcR molecule is able to bind to the natural direct repeat in thealcR promoter, whereas the GST-AlcR fusion protein does not. The direct repeat target (probe c) (Table I and Fig. 2) in thealcA promoter was recognized with high affinity by both AlcR proteins (apparent K d = 3.10−8m for the fusion and His-tagged proteins, respectively). Similarly, a single complex was observed, indicating the binding of one AlcR-(1–197) molecule and of one dimeric GST-AlcR-(1–60) molecule, respectively (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, it was important to address the question whether the two sites could be occupied randomly, or if AlcR-(1–197) occupies preferentially one site. In addition, it was interesting to determine if the different pattern of binding specificity observed with GST-AlcR-(1–60) and His-tagged AlcR-(1–197) could be attributed to differences in the interacting guanines in the sites. As illustrated in Fig. 7, interactions by methylation interference showed that AlcR-(1–197) made strong contacts with the two central guanines (positions −183 and −185) in the bottom strand within the 3′-site (with G at position −186 being also protected, however less), whereas the central G (position −200) in the top strand did not interfere. These results differ from those obtained with GST-AlcR-(1–60) 5F. Lenouvel and B. Felenbok, unpublished results. or with GST-AlcR-(7–60) (15Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21146-21153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (note that the affinity was too low to perform footprint experiments with AlcR-(1–60)): (i) both sites were protected instead of one; and (ii) all the guanines in the consensus motifs interfered with the complex formation, and furthermore, the methylation of the two upstream guanines in the motifs (positions −204 and −191) interfered (although differently) with the GST-AlcR-(1–60) protein. These experiments show clearly that in addition to the altered DNA specificity with GST-AlcR-(1–60) for the direct repeat probe c target, there is also a change in the interaction between the GST-AlcR fusion protein and DNA. Analyses of eukaryotic site-specific DNA-binding proteins are generally carried out either with bacterially synthesized chimeric proteins using fusion proteins such as glutathioneS-transferase and β-galactosidase or with chimeric proteins consisting of additional histidine residues. We show here the limit of the approach based on the utilization of a heterologous protein linked to a DNA-binding domain for defining a specific target. Until now, to our knowledge, it had not yet been described that such an approach would introduce a serious bias related to the quaternary structure of the heterologous carrier protein. For example, the GST protein is a dimer in solution (23Mannervik B. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1985; 57: 357-417PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lim K. Ho J.X. Keeling K. Gilliland G.L. Ji X. Ruker F. Carter D.C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3735: 2233-2244Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase is a tetramer (27Goldberg M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Therefore, these proteins fused to a DNA-binding domain impose a conformation resulting from their quaternary structure for selecting the DNA targets. This was clearly demonstrated by comparing the binding activities of the GST-AlcR-(1–60) and His-tagged AlcR-(1–197) proteins. As a first approach, the localization of AlcR-specific binding sites was performed with the GST-AlcR-(7–60) protein containing only the zinc binuclear cluster domain. Results were confirmed using the isolated and purified AlcR-(7–60) peptide cleaved by thrombin (14Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,15Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21146-21153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, two important elements were missing in this analysis. First, the absence of the region downstream of the zinc cluster shown to be necessary for high affinity binding prevented further analysis of the molecular interactions between AlcR-(1–60) and its cognate targets. Second, the utilization of AlcR with its six amino-terminal residues deleted (GST-AlcR-(7–60)) unexpectedly resulted in a change in binding specificity. 6I. Nikolaev, F. Lenouvel, and B. Felenbok, submitted for publication. Therefore, this study was performed with a longer AlcR protein (AlcR-(1–197)) containing the amino terminus and the region downstream of the zinc cluster that includes the so-called linker and dimerization regions found in most proteins of the Zn2Cys6 class. Comparisons with GST-AlcR-(1–60) binding specificity showed that AlcR-(1–197) recognizes the same motif (5′-CCGCA-3′) organized in direct and inverted repeat sequences. In agreement with these results, physiological studies on A. nidulans have shown by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis that both types of targets are functional in the promoters of the alcR(16Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) 7M. Mathieu and B. Felenbok, unpublished results. and alcA (15Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21146-21153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)3genes. However, the use of the GST-AlcR-(1–60) fusion protein in previous studies has prevented the identification of important features that place AlcR in an original and unique position in the zinc binuclear cluster family. The most significant result is probably that AlcR is able to bind as a monomer to its targets. That could explain its unusual specificity for both inverted and direct repeats. In agreement with this result, the region downstream of the zinc cluster, which is organized in heptad repeats in the other zinc cluster proteins (GAL4 (3Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), PPR1 (4Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and HAP1 (5Timmerman J. Vuidepot A.-L. Bontems F. Lallemand J.-Y. Gervais M. Shechter E. Guiard B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)), is not present in AlcR. In fact, in AlcR, two downstream regions could be similar to leucine zippers. They contain four leucine or hydrophobic amino acids (able to replace leucine) every seven residues. However, proline residues are also present (12Felenbok B. Sealy-Lewis H.M. Martinelli S. Kinghorn J.R. Genetics and Physiology of Aspergillus nidulans. 29. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1994: 141-179Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 C), which are known to impair α-helical structures (29Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The second and strong argument is that no functional dimerization elements were detected in these regions since no formation of heterodimers by transcription-translation assays in the reticulocyte lysate system was detected with two AlcR proteins of different length. The use of the AlcR-(1–197) protein allowed us to establish the AlcR-binding site in the aldA promoter. The localization of one palindromic site (see Fig. 2) is important for understanding the absolute dependence of aldA transcriptional induction on AlcR. The same consensus motif differing at its last nucleotide from the one determined previously (14Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was observed. This indicates that within the consensus site (5′-CCGCA-3′), the last base does not contribute significantly to AlcR binding. Moreover, results obtained with different direct repeat sites (probes A and c) clearly show that in addition to the consensus core, the flanking regions contribute significantly to AlcR binding. Another important observation is the absence of cooperativity between the two AlcR molecules upon binding to symmetric sites. This differentiates, once again, AlcR from GAL4 which synergizes transcriptional activation of structural genes under its control and is thought to result mainly from this binding cooperativity (30Xu H.E. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7677-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). ThealcA promoter is one of the strongest inducible genes found in filamentous fungi (31Felenbok B. Sequeval D. Mathieu M. Sibley S. Gwynne D.I. Davies R.W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 73: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and is widely used for heterologous protein expression (32Felenbok B. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 17: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It was shown by deletion and mutational analyses that the strong synergistic transcriptional activation of the alcA gene is mediated via AlcR binding to the clustered targets organized as direct and inverted repeats. The target immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site (probe c) comprises a direct repeat sequence separated by 15 nucleotides from a single copy site. Surprisingly, the three sites were shown to be necessary for full transcriptional activation, showing the importance of the isolated site. 8C. Panozzo, V. Capuano, S. Fillinger, and B. Felenbok, submitted for publication. Therefore, these results are in agreement with our finding that AlcR can bind as a monomer to its binding sites. It opens the question of the functional AlcR targets that in vivo are organized in tandem or inverted repeats and that in vitro occur as single copy sites with the same consensus core. We will have to consider for our future research that other proteins could be involved in the specific activation process mediated by the AlcR activator. We are grateful to Dr. S. Fillinger for critical reading of the manuscript and to Dr. M. Blight for its English version."

Metcalf B.W. Drug Dev. Res. 1990; 21: 1-17Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Since imide bonds are known to exhibit conformational cis-trans heterogeneity, the existence of such cleavage sites leads to questions concerning the conformational specificity of the protease. It has been demonstrated that cleavage of Xaa-Pro imide bonds by prolidase, aminopeptidase P, and carboxypeptidase P is specific for the trans conformation of Xaa-Pro dipeptides (2Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5037-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4King G.F.

Acta. 1984; 791: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Indeed, this conformational specificity of chymotryptic cleavage for the P2–P3 bond has provided the basis for assays used to demonstrate the existence of peptidyl proline isomerases (10Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that HIV protease might be specific for the trans imide bond conformation: 1) crystallographic studies of inhibitors containing proline (11Slee D.H. Laslo K.L. Elder J.H. Ollmann I.R. Gustchina A. Kervinen J. Zdanov A. Wlodawer A. Wong C.-H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 11867-11878Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or thiazolidine (12Baldwin E.T. Bhat T.N. Gulnik S. Liu B. Topol I.A. Kiso Y. Mimoto T. Mitsuya H. Erickson J.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) indicate a trans conformation; 2) the ability of the protease to cleave ordinary amide bonds as well as imide bonds suggests a capability for cleaving trans imide bonds (1Debouck C. Metcalf B.W. Drug Dev. Res. 1990; 21: 1-17Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize, however, that neither of these observations provides unambiguous proof. For example, it is well established that inhibitors that exhibit close structural relationships to natural substrates can nevertheless bind to enzymes in dramatically different conformations (13Charlton, P. A., Young, D. W., Birdsall, B., Feeney, J., and Roberts, G. C. K. (1979) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm., 922–924.Google Scholar). There are several motivations for understanding the conformational selectivity of HIV protease. 1) Many of the test peptides used to assay the protease contain imide Xaa-Pro bonds. In the event of conformational selectivity, the overall kinetic characterization of these assays should be generalized to include a combination of cleavage and isomerization rates, with the specific mix determined by the physical conditions such as temperature, buffer, etc. 2) Conformational selectivity by the protease could have significant implications for the kinetics of the cleavage process in vivo, closely analogous to the effect of cis-trans imide bond isomerism on protein folding and unfolding. The recent discovery of a close association between the peptidyl proline isomerase cyclophilin and the Gag polypeptide of HIV-1 (14Luban J. Bossolt K.L. Franke E.K. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 15Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Gottlinger H.G.

Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) underlines the potential significance of this proteolytic selectivity. The kinetic behavior of a trans-selective protease considered to cleave a trans bond irreversibly has been discussed by Lin and Brandts (2Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and can be described by the following kinetic scheme, cis peptidekt⥮kctrans peptide+E ⇌k−1k1 E−S →ktH E+product peptides SCHEME 1where k c and k t are the rate constants corresponding to the cis →trans and trans → cisinterconversions, respectively, related byf trans k t =f cis k c, wheref trans and f cis are the fractional trans and cis concentrations, and the other rate constants are defined as indicated above. The corresponding differential equations describing the hydrolysis reaction can be solved using various numerical packages, and we have utilized the programMathematica. 2J. E. Vance, D. A. LeBlanc, and R. E. London, submitted for publication. 2J. E. Vance, D. A. LeBlanc, and R. E. London, submitted for publication. These simulations indicate that conformational selectivity of a proteolytic enzyme can be demonstrated by kinetic measurements performed with protease concentrations high enough to allow separation of hydrolysis and isomerization. In the limit in which free and enzyme-complexedtrans peptide are in equilibrium, i.e. k 1 ≫ k t andk −1 ≫ k tH, such that the system has an effective Michaelis constant: K m = (k −1 +k tH)/k1 ≈k −1/k 1, the hydrolysis will exhibit simple biphasic kinetic behavior if the substrate concentration So ≪ K m. Under such conditions, numerical solutions predict a time-dependent product formation characterized by a biphasic curve: an initial fast phase dominated by the trans rate of hydrolysis, followed by a slow phase dominated by the cis → transisomerization rate. In this limit, the observed fast and slow rate constants approachk tH E o/K m and k c, respectively, while the ratio of the pre-exponential weighting factors approaches the equilibriumtrans/cis ratio. The fluorescent peptide substrate, Arg-Glu(EDANS)-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val-Gln-Lys(DABCYL)-Arg, was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The fluorinated peptide, Ser-Gln-Asn-FPhe-Pro-Ile-Val-Gln (FPhe = 4-fluoro-l-phenylalanine) was obtained from Macromolecular Resources (Ft. Collins, CO). HIV protease was obtained from Bachem, Inc. Recombinant human cyclophilin was obtained from Sigma. HIV protease activity was measured using a Fluoroskan Ascent plate reader (LabSystems, Needham Heights, MA). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 355 and 485 nm, respectively. Assay conditions were 1.0 m NaCl, 0.2% polyethylene glycol, and 0.1 m MES, pH 5.5, at room temperature (22 °C) in 200 μl total volume. For the studies shown, data were obtained every 0.5 s for 3 min. Fluorine-19 NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian UnityPlus 500 NMR spectrometer operating at a 19F resonance frequency of 470.996 MHz using a 5-mm 19F{1H} probe.cis/trans isomerization rates at higher temperatures were determined using magnetization transfer techniques analogous to those described previously in 19F NMR studies of 4-fluoroPhe-labeled bradykinin (18London R.E. Davis D.G. Vavrek R.J. Stewart J.M. Handschumacher R.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10298-10302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A DANTE pulse sequence (19Morris G.A. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1978; 29: 433-462Google Scholar) was used to invert selectively either the cis or trans 19F resonances. A typical series of delays was 10 μs, 0.1 s, 0.2 s, 0.3 s, 0.4 s, 0.5 s, 0.6 s, 0.7 s, 0.8 s, 0.9 s, 1.0 s, 1.1 s, 1.2 s, and 15 s. Data were analyzed using the formalism of Perrin and Engler (20Perrin C.L. Engler R.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 363-369Google Scholar). In addition to the high temperature measurements, magnetization transfer studies were also performed at 25 °C in the presence of 10 μm recombinant human cyclophilin (Sigma). Other conditions for these studies were: 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 25% D2O. At lower temperatures, the isomerization rates were measured based on dilution of the fluorinated peptide from a concentrated solution in 0.4m LiCl/trifluoroethanol, which has previously been reported to augment the cis/trans ratios of other proline-containing peptides (21Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colon-Bonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), into the final buffer containing 1m NaCl, 50 mmacetate-d 3, pH = 5.0, and 100% D2O. A series of time-dependent spectra was obtained to determine the isomerization rate constants. The approach is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.2 Fig. 1 presents fluorescence data from studies performed on the fluorescent peptide substrate (Arg-Glu(EDANS)-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val-Gln-Lys(DABCYL)-Arg) (Molecular Probes), the sequence of which is derived from the Pr55 gag p17/p24 cleavage site (22Matayoshi E.D. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Erickson J. Science. 1990; 247: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Also shown are the product,cis, and trans normalized concentrations simulated using the kinetic model given above. As predicted, the time-dependent fluorescence intensity exhibits clear evidence of two distinct phases. Furthermore, other data acquired over a range of protease concentrations (1.9–3.2 μm) also exhibit a slow kinetic phase despite the high protease concentration. The slow rate constant for the assay conditions shown in Fig. 1 is determined to be 0.022 s−1 by a least squares fit of this data to a bi-exponential function. Similar values (0.022–0.023 s−1) were obtained at several protease concentrations and at two different concentrations of NaCl (1.0 and 0.4 m). Whereas the activity of the protease increased approximately 3-fold at the higher salt conditions, the observed value of the slow rate constant remained essentially constant. Thus, the slow rate constant observed in kinetic studies such as that shown in Fig. 1 does not correspond to a slower hydrolysis of the cis conformer, but rather to an enzyme-independent cis → transisomerization. Cis → trans isomerization rates at various temperatures were determined independently by NMR, using an analogous, fluorine-labeled test peptide also derived from the p17/p24 cleavage site, in which fluorine is substituted for the tyrosyl hydroxyl group: Ser-Gln-Asn-FPhe-Pro-Ile-Val-Gln (FPhe = 4-fluoro-l-phenylalanine). The 19F NMR spectrum of this peptide exhibits two well separated resonances (Δδ = 0.6 ppm) at an intensity ratio of cis/trans = 0.3, which can be shown to correspond to a single, interconverting species by magnetization transfer NMR methods. Values for the cis →trans rate constant were obtained at high temperatures (50–80 °C) using magnetization transfer techniques analogous to those described previously in 19F NMR studies of 4-fluoroPhe-labeled bradykinin (18London R.E. Davis D.G. Vavrek R.J. Stewart J.M. Handschumacher R.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10298-10302Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Alternatively, rate constants at lower temperatures (0–10 °C) were obtained by initially dissolving the peptide in a solvent (0.4 m LiCl/trifluroethanol), which has been found to augment the cis/transratios of other peptides (21Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colon-Bonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), followed by dilution into a 1m NaCl buffer. The rates determined from these studies are given in Fig. 2 as an Arrhenius plot, which shows the expected dependence on 1000/T with ΔG = 17.4 kcal/mol. The cis → trans isomerization rate constant (k c) determined using the fluorescent peptide is shown in Fig. 2 (○), where it clearly is in excellent agreement with the anticipated rate constant at 22 °C determined by linear regression of the NMR isomerization data (dashed line). The development of protease inhibitors is based on HIV protease assays, which typically, although not always, involve cleavage of Xaa-Pro peptide bonds (22Matayoshi E.D. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A.

(1995) in Modern Countercurrent Chromatography(Conway, W. D., ed) ACS Symposium Series, Vol. 593, pp. 111–118, American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C..Google Scholar). In these studies and the many reported kinetic studies using this approach, it is in general not clear how thecis-trans isomerization behavior has been dealt with. The results of such assays generally depend on the enzyme and substrate concentrations and on the physical parameters utilized in the studies. Simulations performed using the trans-selective hydrolysis model given above indicate that at protease concentrations 10 times less than those used to model the data of Fig. 1, product production curves are obtained that are qualitatively close to those predicted by simple, non-selective Michaelis-Menten kinetic schemes. However, for the non-selective model, an effective catalytic rate constant must be invoked such that k cat =f trans k tH, wheref trans is the fractional concentration of the peptide with trans Xaa-Pro conformation. In this limit, the formation of product peptides is also fairly well approximated by a single exponential time course according to the following equation, Prod[t]=So−Soe−kapp f trans tEquation 1 where k app =k tH E o/(So + (k −1 +k tH)/k 1) ≈k tH E o/K m :E o and So are the total enzyme and substrate concentrations. As discussed below, the association of cyclophilin, an enzyme with peptidyl-proline cis-trans isomerase activity, with the Gag substrate of HIV protease suggests that it may function as an auxiliary enzyme to facilitate conversion of the non-cleavable, cispeptide conformation into active trans substrate for the protease. The cis-trans isomerization kinetics of the fluorinated peptide in the presence of recombinant human cyclophilin were determined at T = 25 °C using the magnetization transfer NMR method. Typical NMR spectra observed in the absence (panels 1) and presence (panels 2) of cyclophilin are presented in Fig. 3. For clarity,cis (A) and trans (B) peaks are scaled to equal heights at equilibrium. Although isomerization of the peptide in solution at 25 °C is normally too slow to measure using this technique, the interconversion is readily observed in the presence of 10 μm cyclophilin. In Fig. 3 A(panel 2), the increased isomerization rate is manifest as a decreased net magnetization (peak height) of the cis peak astrans conformers with inverted spins rapidly convert tocis conformers and, conversely, cis conformers with non-inverted spins rapidly convert to the trans form. In Fig. 3 B (panel 2) the initially inverted magnetization of the trans peak returns to equilibrium noticeably faster than in Fig. 3 B (panel 1), where the interconversion rate is slow relative to the spin-lattice relaxation rate. Analysis of these spectra indicate that the cyclophilin-enhanced cis → trans rate, seen in Fig. 2 (♦) is significantly faster than that predicted by regressing the peptide isomerization rates measured in the absence of cyclophilin.Figure 1Fluorescence intensity measurements (circles) and kinetics simulation (lines) of the fluorescent peptide (Arg-Glu(EDANS)-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val-Gln-Lys(DABCYL)-Arg) (Molecular Probes) as a function of time in the presence of HIV-1 protease. The assay contained 1 μm fluorescent peptide and 1.9 μm HIV-1 protease (Bachem Bioscience, Inc.). Assay conditions were 1.0 m NaCl, 0.2% polyethylene glycol, and 0.1 m MES, pH 5.5, at room temperature (22 °C) in 200 μl total volume. Data were obtained every 0.5 s for 3 min using a Fluoroskan Ascent plate reader (LabSystems). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 355 and 485 nm, respectively. The theoretical curves shown represent the normalized product,cis, and trans concentrations calculated by numerical solution of the kinetic scheme given in the text using the DSolve command of the program Mathematica. Parameters used for the simulation were: So = 1 μm,E o = 1.9 μm,k c = 0.022 s−1,f trans = 0.73, k 1 = 3 × 104 mm−1 s−1,k −1 = 0.3 × 104s−1, and k tH = 25 s−1. The k 1 and k −1 values are somewhat arbitrary and are chosen to be significantly greater than the other rate constants involved (Michaelis approximation). Note that the ratio (k −1/k 1) corresponds to a Michaelis constant K m = (k −1 +k tH)/k 1 ∼ 0.1 mm, as reported for a similar peptide by Wang et al. (25Wang G.T. Matayoshi E. Huffaker H.J.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 6493-6496Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas a k cat(k tH) value somewhat higher than that reported by Wang is appropriate here, perhaps reflecting the additional arginine residues in the Molecular Probes peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 319 F NMR magnetization transfer spectra of 1 mm fluorine-labeled peptide (Ser-Gln-Asn-FPhe-Pro-Ile-Val-Gln) (FPhe = 4-fluoro-l-phenylalanine) in the absence and presence of (10 μm) recombinant human cyclophilin (Sigma) at 25 °C, pH 7.0, in 200 mm NaCl, 20 mmNaPO4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 25% D2O. Observed are the cis (A) andtrans (B) resonances in the absence (panels 1) and presence (panels 2) of cyclophilin after delays of 10 μs, 0.1 s, 0.2 s, 0.3 s, 0.4 s, 0.5 s, 0.6 s, 0.7 s, 0.8 s, 0.9 s, 1.0 s, 1.1 s, 1.2 s, and 15 s following a selective inversion (DANTE pulse train) of the transresonance. The transfer of magnetization from the invertedtrans to the (initially) unperturbed cisresonances is evident in A (panel 2) as a delay-dependent dip in the intensity of the cispeak. To extract quantitative isomerization rates, cis-transinterconversion must occur on a time scale similar to that of theT 1 relaxation processes (the dominant feature inB (panels 1 and 2). An analysis similar to that of Ref. 20Perrin C.L. Engler R.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 363-369Google Scholar determines the cis →trans isomerization rate of the fluorine-labeled peptide in the presence of cyclophilin to be 1.01 s−1 at 25 °C (see Fig. 2). The isomerization rate at 25 °C in the absence of cyclophilin is too slow to be accurately measured by this method but is predicted by the linear regression of NMR data in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus, we have found that cleavage by HIV-1 protease of a peptide related to the Pr55 gag p17/p24 junction is selective for thetrans conformation of the Tyr-Pro bond, and second, that a tyrosyl OH → F peptide analog is a substrate for recombinant human cyclophilin. Taken together, these observations suggest a possible role of the Gag-associated cyclophilin as an auxiliary enzyme for the protease. In vitro studies of the homodimeric enzyme show it to be fairly unstable at pH 7 (31Tyagi S.C. Simon S.R. Carter C.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and, in particular, the active dimeric enzyme is stabilized in the presence of either inhibitors (32Holzman T.F. Kohlbrenner W.E. Weigl D. Rittenhouse J. Kempf D. Erickson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19217-19220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or substrates (33Kuzmic P. Garcia Echeverria C. Rich D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194(1): 301-305Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Once dissociated, the monomeric unit unfolds and becomes an excellent substrate for the active dimeric protease (34Tomasselli A.G. Mildner A.M. Rothroch D.J. Sarcich J.L. Lull J. Leone J. Heinrikson R.L. Takahashi K. Aspartic Proteinases: Structure, Function, Biology, and Biomedical Implications. Plenum Press, New York1995: 387-398Google Scholar). To the extent that peptide cleavage and protease inactivation due to dimer dissociation are competing processes in vivo, cyclophilin could act to convert the Pr55 gag p17/p24 cleavage site, as well as the other Phe-Pro sites, from protease-inactive cisconformations to protease-active trans conformations, thereby optimizing cleavage in the presence of an unstable protease. The association of cyclophilin with the Gag protein would appear to be consistent with this function. Beyond the question of protease stability, the presence of cis Xaa-Pro conformations could also alter the order of cleavage of the different sites by the protease. The order of cleavage of the Gag-Pol scissile bonds may also be important to achieve normal viral structure and function (35Pettit S.C. Moody M.D. Wehbie R.S. Kaplan A.H. Nantermet P.V. Klein C.A. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8017-8027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of cyclophilin would reduce or eliminate perturbations of the normal order of cleavage resulting from the presence of a mixture of cis and trans Xaa-Pro bonds. Finally, the presence of cis conformations of target bonds could favor proteolytic cleavage of less susceptible alternate bonds, for example the Leu5-Trp6 bond of the protease itself (34Tomasselli A.G. Mildner A.M. Rothroch D.J. Sarcich J.L. Lull J. Leone J. Heinrikson R.L. Takahashi K. Aspartic Proteinases: Structure, Function, Biology, and Biomedical Implications.

Based on studies of the viral life cycle, Braatenet al. (17Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also suggest that cyclophilin A functions within the virion, but only after proteolysis and assembly are completed. They conclude that there is some (unknown) effect of cyclophilin that is important early in the viral life cycle and that the absence or inactivation of cyclophilin leads to no biochemically detectable assembly defects. This could indicate either that cyclophilin serves another purpose in addition to a role as an auxiliary enzyme for the protease or that some very subtle structural features resulting from the presence of incompletely or incorrectly cleaved Gag-Pol become significant at a time point prior to viral-directed DNA synthesis. Further studies will be required to sort out these possibilities."

Little is known about the in vivo assembly of these clusters and the role that this sequence motif plays in that process. In this study, we have used structure as a guide in attempts to direct the formation of a [4Fe-4S]2+/+ in the [3Fe-4S]+/0location of native (7Fe) Azotobacter vinelandiiferredoxin I (AvFdI) by providing the correct three-dimensional orientation of cysteine ligands without introducing a CysXXCysXXCys motif. Tyr13 ofAvFdI occupies the position of the fourth ligating cysteine in the homologous and structurally characterized 8Fe ferredoxin fromPeptococcus aerogenes and a Y13C variant ofAvFdI could be easily modeled as an 8Fe protein. However, characterization of purified Y13C FdI by UV-visible spectra, circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, and by x-ray crystallography revealed that the protein failed to use the introduced cysteine as a ligand and retained its [3Fe-4S]+/0cluster. Further, electrochemical characterization showed that the redox potential and pH behavior of the cluster were unaffected by the substitution of Tyr by Cys. Although Y13C FdI is functional in vivo it does differ significantly from native FdI in that it is extremely unstable in the reduced state possibly due to increased solvent exposure of the [3Fe-4S]0 cluster. Surprisingly, the x-ray structure showed that the introduced cysteine was modified to become a persulfide. This modification may have occurred in vivo via the action of NifS, which is known to be expressed under the growth conditions used. It is interesting to note that neither of the two free cysteines present in FdI was modified. Thus, ifNifS is involved in modifying the introduced cysteine there must be specificity to the reaction.

The sequence for the NH2-terminal half ofAvFdI is homologous to the sequences of the much smaller clostridial-type ferredoxins that contain two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters (1Bruschi M. Guerlesquin F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 54: 155-175Crossref Google Scholar). Comparisons of these and many other [Fe-S] protein sequences have shown that the presence of a highly conserved CysXXCysXXCys motif can be used to predict that a [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster will be present (for reviews, see Refs. 2Johnson M.K.

During the evolution of the 7Fe ferredoxins from the 8Fe ferredoxins, two residues were inserted into this motif between the second and third cysteines to form a CysXXCysXXXXCys motif (1Bruschi M. Guerlesquin F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 54: 155-175Crossref Google Scholar). This insertion moved the second cysteine out of reach of the cluster resulting in the inability to form a [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster and the appearance of a [3Fe-4S]+/0 cluster in that position (7Stout G.H.

The structural consequences of inserting the two additional residues between the second and third cysteines are shown in Fig.1, which compares the structure of nativeAvFdI (7Stout G.H. Turley S.

The comparison in Fig. 1 reveals that the chain trace ofPaFd is puckered out in AvFdI, leaving theAvFdI Cys11 removed away from the position of the ligating cysteine in PaFd. Cys11 could therefore not be used as a cluster ligand without substantial structural rearrangement. A further structural difference in this region is that the COOH-terminal half of AvFdI, which is absent in the much smaller PaFd, wraps around theAvFdI residue 8–16 loop shielding it from solvent (9Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used structure as a guide in attempts to direct the formation of a [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster in the [3Fe-4S]+/0 location of native AvFdI by providing the correct three dimensional orientation of cysteine ligands. As shown in Fig. 1, Tyr13 of AvFdI occupies the position of the fourth ligating cysteine inPaFd so here we report the purification and characterization of Y13C FdI. Native AvFdI was purified as described previously (14Stephens P.J. Jensen G.M. Devlin F.J. Morgan T.V. Stout C.D. Martin A.E. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3200-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ammonium sulfate was from Fisher and all other materials were obtained from the vendors listed previously (15Shen B. Martin L.L. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Stout C.D. Jensen G.M. Stephens P.J. La Mar G.N. Gorst C.M. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25928-25939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide used for the mutagenesis had the sequence GCAAGTACTGCCATTGTGTTGGTGCAAGTGCACCGATTG. This sequence differs from the wild-type sequence (16Morgan T.V. Lundell P.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1370-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by the change of codon 14 from TAC to TGC, resulting in the change of FdI residue 13 from a tyrosine to a cysteine. The success of the mutagenesis was confirmed at the DNA level by dideoxy-DNA sequencing and at the protein level by NH2-terminal protein sequencing (which was carried out in the protein sequencing facility in the department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at the University of California, Irvine) and by x-ray crystallography. Unless otherwise indicated, oligonucleotide-directedin vitro mutagenesis (15Shen B. Martin L.L. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Stout C.D. Jensen G.M. Stephens P.J. La Mar G.N. Gorst C.M. Burgess B.K. J.

The purification of Y13C was carried out anaerobically using a modification of purification method two described by Stephens et al. (14Stephens P.J. Jensen G.M. Devlin F.J. Morgan T.V. Stout C.D. Martin A.E. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3200-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A. vinelandii containing the overexpression vector for Y13C FdI was grown and cell-free extracts were prepared from 1.1 kg of cell paste. No sodium dithionite was used in the purification of Y13C FdI because it became obvious after repeated attempts to purify the protein according to the native FdI purification scheme that the presence of 2 mm sodium dithionite in the buffers denatured this variant of FdI. All steps, however, were carried out anaerobically using thoroughly degassed buffers. The cell-free extracts were not heat treated as described in the purification of nitrogenase (18Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) due to the possibility that Y13C FdI would be heat-labile. Cell-free extracts were loaded onto a 5 cm × 20-cm DE52 cellulose column equilibrated with extensively degassed 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Following loading and washing, the column was chromatographed with a 0.1 to 0.4 m NaCl gradient (1.6 liters of each, 570 ml/h) in the same buffer. After this initial gradient Y13C FdI was eluted from the column batchwise with 0.5 m NaCl. The ferredoxin fraction was immediately diluted 1:2 in the same buffer without salt and loaded onto a 2.5 cm × 10-cm DE52 cellulose column. After loading, the column was washed with 4 liters of 0.025 mTris-KCl, pH 7.4, 0.12 m KCl, at a rate of 300 ml/h. A gradient from 0.12 to 0.3 m KCl (800 ml of each) followed, and Y13C FdI eluted close to 0.25 m KCl. The protein was concentrated on a DE52 cellulose column, and 10-ml samples of concentrated protein were then loaded onto a 1 m × 2.5-cm Sephadex G75 superfine gel filtration column equilibrated in 0.025m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m in NaCl. Following elution from that column, 40 ml of 70–80% saturated ammonium sulfate in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was added slowly with stirring to 13 ml of Y13C FdI. The protein precipitated over the course of 2 h and was centrifuged in airtight centrifuge tubes in a SS34 rotor at 6,000 rpm for 35 min. TheA 280 /A 400 ratio of Y13C FdI following ammonium sulfate precipitation was 1.7 and theA 280 /A 260 ratio was 1.2, values very similar to those reported for the native protein (14Stephens P.J. Jensen G.M. Devlin F.J. Morgan T.V. Stout C.D. Martin A.E. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3200-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The final yield of Y13C FdI was 19 mg. For spectroscopic studies, all samples were prepared anaerobically under argon in a vacuum atmospheres glove box (O2 < 1 ppm) using degassed buffers. Where indicated samples were first concentrated using a Centricon-10 microconcentrator and were then buffer exchanged into 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, or into a mixture of 50 mm PIPES and 50 mm TAPS buffers at pH 6.0 or 8.3. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were obtained using a Bruker 300 Ez spectrophotometer, equipped with an Oxford Instrument ESR-9002 liquid helium continuous flow cryostat. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained using a JASCO J720 spectropolarimeter, and UV-visible spectra were obtained with a HP 8452A diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer. Purified water of resistivity ∼18 ohm/m (Millipore) was used in all experiments, and each of the reagents was at least analytical grade. DC (staircase) cyclic voltammetry was carried out using an Autolab electrochemical analyzer (Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands). The all-glass cell, electrodes, and application of protein film voltammetry have been described previously (15Shen B. Martin L.L. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Stout C.D. Jensen G.M. Stephens P.J.

Chem. 1992; 38: 117-163Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The saturated calomel reference electrode was held at 22 °C, and potential values were converted to the standard hydrogen electrode scale by using E (saturated calomel reference electrode) = +243 mV. The pyrolytic graphite edge working electrode (area approximately 0.18 cm2) was prepared for protein film formation by polishing with an aqueous alumina slurry (Buehler Micropolish 1.0 μm) and sonicating extensively in water to remove traces of Al2O3. All voltammetric experiments were carried out in an anaerobic glove box (Belle technology) with the O2 < 2 ppm. To prepare films, ∼1 μl of protein solution (typically 100 μm in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 m NaC1 with 200 μg/ml polymyxin as co-adsorbate) was applied to the surface of the chilled pyrolytic graphite edge electrode using a glass capillary tip. The buffer-electrolyte solution in the cell contained 0.1 mNaCl, 20 mm mixed buffer (5 mm of acetate, Mes, Hepes, and TAPS) and 200 μg/ml polymyxin. Reduction potentials were determined from the average of peak positions measured in the directions of increasing (E pa) and decreasing (E pc) potentials. All crystallization experiments were done in an anaerobic glove box at <1 ppm O2 using degassed solutions. Y13C FdI is less soluble than native FdI so we were unable to induce nucleation using seed crystals of native FdI or other mutants as done previously (20Shen B. Jollie D.R. Diller T.C. Stout C.D.

Subsequently, crystallization screening was done using the vapor diffusion method and conditions developed by E. A. Stura (22Stura E.A. Satterthwait A.C. Calvo J.C. Kaslow D.C. Wilson I.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 448-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clusters of small needle-like crystals were observed using sodium citrate as a precipitant. However, refinement of these conditions did not produce larger crystals, although the crystals could be grown reproducibly. On an attempt to induce nucleation in droplets that had not formed the small needle-like crystals after 18 days, several of the crystallization plates were transferred in sealed containers from the glove box at 27 °C to a room at 18 °C for 7 days, then to an incubator at 8 °C for 10 days, and then returned to the glove box. Temperature shifts are known to induce nucleation of the native protein (8Stout C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9256-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After five months (nine months total elapsed time) large, black rod shaped single crystals were observed in several of the drops. Two crystals were mounted in sealed capillaries for data collection (Table I). Both crystals were grown from a 13 mg/ml protein solution in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and in both cases the droplets consisted of 2 μl of protein solution mixed with 2 μl of a 1.0-ml reservoir solution. For the first crystal mounted, the reservoir solution was 1.26 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (βME). For the second crystal mounted, the reservoir solution was 1.32 msodium citrate, pH 7.0, without βME added.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsCrystal+βME−βMESize, mm1.0 × 0.2 × 0.10.7 × 0.15 × 0.07No. of observations25,13310,648No. of independent reflections9,1155,346Rsymm (F), all data0.0670.114I/ς(I), all data9.94.5I/ς(I), last shell1.90.7Resolution of last shell,Å2.43–2.352.73–2.67Completeness, all data85.2%73.3%Completeness, last shell32.9%21.9%R factor0.2160.203Resolution,Å 8.0–2.35 8.0–2.67Reflections >0ς(F)85774474No. of protein atoms16701670No. of iron atoms1414No. of sulfur atoms1818No. of H2O molecules00Average B factor, Å 2 MoleculeA9.649.05 MoleculeB9.639.61Root-mean-square deviations from ideality Bonds, Å0.0160.017 Angles, degree3.553.88 Planes, Å1.491.81 Open table in a new tab Diffraction data were collected using CuKα radiation from a Ru200 x-ray generator operated at 40 kV, 80 mA, and equipped with a graphite monochromator and Siemens area detector mounted on a four-circle goniostat. Data were collected by both φ and ω scans in increments of 0.25° with exposure times of 400 s/frame. To minimize the effect of decay, the first crystal was translated in the beam twice. The total time for data collection was 9 days for the first crystal (with βME) and 4 days for the second crystal (without βME). The data from both crystals were indexed, integrated, merged, and scaled using the Xengen suite of programs (Table I) (23Howard A.J. Nielsen C. Xuong N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 452-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The space group of both crystals is P21with a = 39.3, b = 73.7,c = 45.1A, and β = 98.4 ° and two molecules (A and B) of Y13C FdI (2.67 Å3/Da) per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the data set from the first crystal and the Xplor version 3.1 suite of programs (24Br 129 nger A.T. Karplus M. Petsko G.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1989; 45: 50-61Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The native FdI structure from tetragonal crystals (8Stout C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9256-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with residue 13 modeled as a glycine was used as a search model. Rigid body, positional, and isotropic B factor refinement of the structure representing the two best solutions to the rotation and translation searches resulted in an R factor of 0.23 for all data in the resolution range 8.0–2.5 Å. An unbiased 2‖Fo ‖-‖Fc ‖ Fourier map computed with all data in the range 20.0–2.5 Å revealed 5ς electron density at residue 13 in place of tyrosine of native FdI in both molecules A and B, indicative of cysteine persulfide. The electron density was characteristic of both a cysteine side chain and a disulfide (Fig. 2). A model for a cysteine persulfide residue (CSS) was constructed and fit to the density using the XtalView suite of programs (25McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-47Crossref Google Scholar). The model consists of a cysteine amino acid side chain (Cα, Cβ, Sγ) with an additional sulfur atom (Sδ) bonded at 2.02 Å to Sγ). The Cβ-Sγ-Sδ bond angle is tetrahedral. The CSS residues were refined in Xplor using charge and energy restraints of a disulfide for the Sγ–Sδ bond and a protonated cysteine sulfur for the terminal Sδ atom. The side chains of a total of 34 Glu, Asp, Lys, Arg, and Gln residues on molecules A and B were adjusted to fit the electron density in 2‖Fo ‖-‖Fc ‖ maps due to changes in their conformation in the monoclinic crystal form relative to the tetragonal form. The final model was refined against all observed data to 2.35 Å (Table I). There are no outliers in the Ramachandran plot except for four glycines in both moleculesA and B. Co-ordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank. Because the first crystal was grown from a droplet containing βME, the possibility existed that the additional density observed on the cysteine introduced at position 13 was due to βME, if slow oxidation of the cysteine had occurred over the extended crystallization time. Although no additional density was observed for carbon and oxygen atoms of βME on either molecule A or B, it was possible that these atoms could have been disordered while sulfur bonded to Cys13 was not. Therefore, a second data set was collected from a crystal grown in the absence of βME (Table I). The data from this crystal was scaled to the first, and a ‖Fo ‖-‖Fc ‖ map was calculated using data in the range 20.0–3.0 Å and phases based on the refined model of Y13C FdI, including CSS residues on both molecules A and B. The difference Fourier map was featureless at residue 13, indicating no difference in the crystals grown without βME versus βME. Subsequently, a 2‖Fo ‖-‖Fc ‖ map calculated with all data in the range 20.0–2.67 Å revealed a very similar density for the CSS residue on molecules A andB as observed in the first crystal (Fig. 2). Therefore, we conclude that βME is not a factor in the formation of monoclinic Y13C FdI crystals, and it is not present as a modification of Cys13. The Y13C FdI structure was also refined against all observed data to 2.67 Å (Table I). In addition to the shape and height of the electron density for both CSS13 and CSS213 in both the structure with and without βME added (Fig. 2), the presence of a cysteine persulfide was demonstrated by a series of refinement calculations in which each sulfur or oxygen of each non-ligand cysteine and serine was modeled as oxygen and sulfur, respectively (Table II). For example, Cys11was modeled as “Ser11,” and Ser56 was modeled as “Cys56.” Similarly, the terminal atom on the Cys13 side chain was modeled as sulfur (the CSS residue) or oxygen, a possible Cys13-SOH residue. The only other free Cys or Ser in FdI is Cys24, which was also modeled as “Ser24.” The corresponding residues in moleculeB were modified in the same way. A series of refinement calculations were carried out using the 2.3 Å data from the crystal grown with βME (Table I), Xplor3.1, and the same charge and energy restraints used to refine the Y13C FdI structure (Table I). For the test Cys13-SOH side chain, the residue was defined to have a Sγ–Oδ bond of 1.8 Å, tetrahedral angle for Cβ-Sγ-Oδ and OH group as in serine. The eight models, in which only one sulfur or oxygen atom at a time was changed, were independently refined. Three of these models with Ser11, Ser24, and Cys56 were also refined against the native FdI data (9Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) at the same resolution by the same protocol as a further control, since the native FdI crystallizes in a different space group. Finally, the correct native structure with Cys11, Cys24, and Ser56 was refined at 2.3 Å for comparison.Table IIRefinement of sulfur versus oxygen at 2.3 Å resolutionControl structureTest caseResidueAtomElectron densityBResidueAtomElectron densityBςÅ 2ςÅ 2Y13C FdI data Cys11Sγ+53.1Ser11Oγ+52.0 CSS13Sγ+57.3Cys13Sγ+56.9 CSS13Sδ+412.0Cys13Oδ+42.0 Cys24Sγ+58.6Ser24Oγ+52.0 Ser56Oγ+1.513.8Cys56Sγ+1.525.6 Cys211Sγ+54.5Ser211Oγ+42.0 CSS213Sγ+59.9Cys213Sγ+45.7 CSS213Sδ+413.6Cys213Oδ+42.0 Cys224Sγ+54.4Ser224Oγ+52.0 Ser256Oγ+1.517.4Cys256Sγ+1.527.2Native FdI data Cys11Sγ+58.0Ser11Oγ+52.0 Cys24Sγ+57.9Ser24Oγ+52.0 Ser56Oγ+1.512.1Cys56Sγ+1.522.8 Open table in a new tab Table II summarizes the results of the test refinement calculations. The height of the electron density of the atom in question in a 2‖Fo ‖-‖Fc ‖ map, calculated in each case with all data in the range 20.0–2.3 Å, is given in intervals of 1ς of the electron density, and the isotropic temperature factor (B factor) for each atom in question is given. In each and every case where a sulfur atom was modeled as an oxygen, the B factor refined to 2.0 Å2, the minimum allowed by the program, indicative that the model had insufficient electron density at that site. In particular, a model with oxygen bonded to Sγ of Cys13refines to 2.0 Å2 on both molecules A andB, while the Sγ atom retains a B factor similar to that observed with a persulfide (CSS residue) as a model. Conversely, when an oxygen is modeled as a sulfur (Ser → “Cys”) the B factor always becomes much larger, indicative of excess electron density at the site in the model. Thus, the fact that a Sδ atom on CSS13 and CSS213 refines to a reasonable Bfactor indicates that it is not oxygen. Finally, the electron density in each and every case is 4–5ς for sulfur, whether modeled as sulfur or oxygen, and 1.5ς for oxygen in serine, whether modeled as sulfur or oxygen. Together, these data demonstrate that Cys and Ser can be discriminated at 2.3 Å resolution, and that the atom bonded to Sγ of Cys13 is more massive than oxygen and has electron density comparable to that of sulfur in other cysteine residues with comparableB factors. In principle, this atom could be aluminum, silcon, phosphorus, chlorine, or argon in terms of x-ray scattering; however, none of these atoms are likely or able to bond singly to sulfur. Therefore, we conclude that the CSS residue is a cysteine persulfide. Ferredoxins are small acidic electron transfer proteins that contain [Fe-S] clusters attached to the polypeptide via cysteine residues. When a ferredoxin contains a [4Fe-4S]2+/+cluster three of the four cysteine ligands are usually supplied by a highly conserved CysXXCysXXCys sequence motif (1Bruschi M. Guerlesquin F. FEMS Microbiol.

Little is known about the in vivo assembly of these clusters and the role that the sequence motif plays in that process. Where x-ray structures are available it is clear that the clusters are buried (7Stout G.H. Turley S. Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Earlier work has shown that RNase E degrades its own mRNA, autoregulating production of the RNase E protein. Here we show that in cells lacking RNase E activity, the 3.6-kilobase rne gene transcript is cleaved site specifically at two locations near its center by a novel endonuclease whose activity is modulated by the presence or absence of amino acids in the culture medium. These cleavages produce a 2-kilobase RNase E-sensitive RNA fragment corresponding to the 3′ half of the transcript. Using primer extension and RNase protection analysis, we mapped RNase E-independent cleavages to sites 1558 and 1576 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the rne transcript (coordinates 1738 and 1747 of the rne gene).

Biol. 1996; 255: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Inactivation of RNase E activity in these temperature-sensitive mutants by culture at nonpermissive temperature prolongs the decay of bulk mRNA and of specific transcripts (4Cohen S.N. McDowall K.J.

Academic Press, San Diego1993: 53-70Crossref Google Scholar). Overexpression of the rne gene by high copy number plasmids slows cell growth and can result in plasmid loss or the acquisition ofrne mutations (13Claverie-Martin F. Diaz-Torres M.R. Yancey S.D. Kushner S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, raising the rnegene copy number 21-fold in E. coli fails to produce a corresponding increase in production of the RNase E protein, suggesting that RNase E concentration is tightly controlled in vivo(14Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This appears to occur by RNase E autoregulation of the stability of its own mRNA by cleavage of rne mRNA in the 5′-untranslated region; inactivation of RNase E prolongs the half-life of the rne transcript (14Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 15Mudd E.A. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, despite evidence for RNase E cleavage of rne transcripts by primer extension analysis and in vitro cleavage assay, norne-dependent decay intermediate was observed by Northern blotting (14Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 15Mudd E.A. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting that the RNase E-generated products are rapidly degraded. During the course of investigation of the effect of cell growth rate on the stability of rne mRNA, we observed a 2-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CAA, casamino acid(s). RNA species corresponding to the 3′ half of the rne mRNA in the E. coli rne-3071ts mutant strain grown in minimal medium containing casamino acids. However, accumulation of this rnetranscript fragment at a nonpermissive temperature indicated that it was not produced by RNase E cleavage of full-length rnemRNA. Our subsequent investigations aimed at understanding the mechanism of production of this rne-derived transcript species have shown that inactivation of RNase E in cells growing in minimal medium leads to accumulation of full-length rnemRNA, which is processed in culture medium containing casamino acids to the 2-kb fragment. Our results imply that in the absence of RNase E activity, an rne-independent, physiologically regulated endoribonuclease is activated, and that this previously unidentified endonuclease cleaves full-length rne mRNA to produce an RNase E-degraded decay intermediate. TheE. coli strains used for studying therne mRNA process were N3433 and N3431 (rne-3071; Ref. 16Goldblum K. Apirion D. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 128-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

For plasmid constructions, theXmnI DNA fragment (Fig. 1 B) was ligated to a filled-in HindIII site of plasmid pT7/T3α19 (Life Technologies, Inc.); we then screened recombinant plasmids for the expression of riboprobe c from the T7 promoter (Fig. 1 B). From this plasmid, the DNA fragment, which contains the 5′ end portion of the rne gene to the MluI site (Fig.1 B), was further deleted and self-ligated to generate a second plasmid in which the expression of the riboprobe d was under the control of the T3 promoter as shown (Fig. 1 B). Luria-Bertani broth (18Roth J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17A: 3-35Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was used to grow E. coli for plasmid DNA preparation. The medium used to grow cultures for RNA studies was MOPS minimal medium (19Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 1.32 mm K2HPO4, 0.02 mm(equal to 6.75 mg/ml) thiamine, and 0.04 mg/ml of the appropriate amino acids. 1% casamino acids (Difco) or a mixture of 20 individual amino acids (final concentration of 50 μg/ml, Sigma) was added in certain experiments as indicated. Fresh overnight cultures grown at 33 °C in MOPS/glucose were diluted 1:100 with fresh medium as described in each experiment and cultured at 33 °C, or alternatively shifted to 43 °C, for different lengths of time prior to RNA isolation. Cell growth was monitored by taking the optical density reading at 460 nm using a Beckman DU-62 spectrophotometer. Total cellular RNA was isolated as described (20Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1991; 65 (2 Ed.): 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) at various times after rifampicin (250 μg/ml culture) treatment or after temperature upshift of logarithmic phase cultures (A 460 = 0.4), except that after RNA precipitation at −20 °C, cellular chromosomal DNA that forms strands in the solution was removed by spooling on a micropipette tip, and the precipitated RNA was then centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min. For RNA sample preparation for gel electrophoresis analysis, the RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and was then vacuum-dried and resuspended in 15 μl of 1 × formaldehyde gel-loading dye (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 40 μg/ml ethidium bromide. RNA samples were denatured at 65 °C for 15 min and separated on 1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gels (20 x 24 x 0.5 cm) in 1 × formaldehyde-MOPS buffer at 75 V for 10 h (bromphenol blue migrated approximately 16 cm from the well). A photograph of the individual gel showing ribosomal RNAs in each RNA sample was taken using Type 665 Polaroid film (Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, MA) and was used to control the amount of RNA loaded in each well. The RNA gel was then soaked in 10 × SSC for 30 min at room temperature and transferred to a Zeta-Probe blotting membrane (Bio-Rad) using 10 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m trisodium citrate) for 12 h. RNA on membranes was then cross-linked to the membrane using a UV-Stratalinker 1800 (0.12 J, 2 min, Stratagene). The membrane was baked in an 80 °C oven for 1 h and kept in a sealed bag at room temperature until used. Hybridization procedures using either 32P-labeled random-priming double-stranded DNA probe (22Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal.

The radioactively hybridized bands were analyzed using either a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager or an x-ray autograph. Films showing ribosomal RNAs in each RNA sample were scanned and quantitated by the 300S MD computing densitometer. The riboprobes used for the RNase protection assays are indicated in Fig. 4 A, and RNase protection was performed as described by the vendor's instruction (Ambion). Primer extension analysis was done as described previously (23Lin-Chao S. Chen W.T. Wong T.-T. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 15Mudd E.A. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we found that a transcript approximately the size of full-length rnemRNA accumulates in N3431 at a temperature nonpermissive for cell growth (43 °C), but not at a permissive temperature (33 °C) (Fig.1 A). However, in N3431 cultured at 43 °C in the same medium supplemented with casamino acids (CAA), but not in media lacking CAA, in addition to the full-length rnemRNA, an rne transcript species about 2 kb in length was observed (Fig. 1). Using Northern blot analyses and double-stranded DNA probes (indicated as ds in Fig. 1, B and C) corresponding to either the 5′-end region (5′ probe a (ds)) or 3′-end region (3′ probe b (ds)) to further identify the origin of the 2-kb transcript species, we found that the 3′-end probe but not the 5′-end probe hybridized to the 2-kb species (Fig. 1 C). Additional studies (Fig. 1 C) using single strand-specific riboprobes confirmed that this species is transcribed in the same direction as the full-length rne transcript rather than in the orientation of a transcript known to extend in an antisense direction into the 3′ end of the rne gene coding region from a downstream promoter (17Casaregola S.A. Jacq D. Laoudj G. McGurk G. Margarson S. Tempete M. Norris V. Holland I.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and thus implies that the 2-kb transcript species is a decay intermediate produced from full-length rne transcripts. As RNase E produced in strain N3431 is inactivated at 43 °C (16Goldblum K. Apirion D. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 128-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the results show that the production of the 2-kb transcript species occurs by an RNase E-independent mechanism and furthermore that this mechanism is dependent on the presence of CAA in the culture medium. Analysis of the kinetics of decay of full-length rne mRNA and formation of the 2-kb transcript species at various times following rifampicin treatment of a culture that was temperature-upshifted from 33 to 43 °C for 15 (T15) or 30 (T30) min before the rifampicin was added, which inhibits new RNA synthesis, showed that the 2-kb transcript species was formed continuously (Fig. 2,T15 and T30, respectively) and that the intracellular concentration of full-length mRNA declined. Thus, production of the 2-kb species occurs despite inhibition of new RNA synthesis and therefore is in fact an rne decay intermediate. The 2-kb RNA intermediate observed at T30 is more abundant (Fig. 2) because the rifampicin was added 15 min later than T15 culture thus allowing the production of the very stable (see Figs.2 and 3) decay intermediate to continue for another 15 min. AlthoughE. coli N3433 whose RNase E is active under both 33 and 43 °C growing temperatures was studied, we found no detectablerne transcript (either full-length or decay intermediate) in cells cultured in minimal medium supplemented with or without CAA (data not shown). These results are consistent with a previous report (14Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) showing that in the presence of RNase E activity the rnemessage is extremely unstable.Figure 3Production of rne decay intermediate requires casamino acids in minimal medium prior to temperature upshift.

We found that a decrease in the level of full-length rnemRNA and significant accumulation of the decay intermediate started about 20 min after temperature upshift to 43 °C. (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–6, and B,bottom panel). However, accumulation of the 2-kb decay intermediate did not occur when CAA was added to minimal medium 10 min after the culture was shifted to 43 °C (Fig. 3 A,lanes 7–11) or just prior to the temperature upshift (data not shown). When CAA was added only one-generation time (i.e. about 40 min) before the temperature upshift, accumulation of the decay intermediate RNA occurred about 30 min after the upshift and was delayed for roughly 10 min compared to the culture grown continuously in CAA (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1–6 versus lanes 7–12). With further shortening of the interval between addition of CAA and temperature upshift, the delay in production of the 2-kb species was further prolonged (data not shown). However, in all cases accumulation of the intermediate RNA was associated with a decrease in the level of the full-length rne transcript (Figs. 2 and 3). Similar kinetics of production of the decay intermediate were observed in minimal medium containing a mixture of 20 individual amino acids (Fig. 4). Collectively, these results indicate that formation of the decay intermediate in the temperature-sensitive rne3071 mutant requires the presence of amino acids prior to RNase E inactivation. RNase protection and primer extension analyses were used to map the 5′ terminus of the decay intermediate. Using two32P-labeled RNA riboprobes, which are indicated in Fig.5 A (top panel) as probe a and b, respectively, and known RNA size markers in an RNase protection assay (see “Materials and Methods”), we detected two RNA fragments whose sizes are about 270 and 280 nucleotides in length (Fig. 5 A(bottom panel), lanes 5 and 10). Using RNA size markers on the same gel, the 5′ termini of these species were mapped to the vicinity of rne coordinate 1750 (indicated with arrows in Fig. 5 A). Based on these results, we designed an oligonucleotide complementary to a sequence downstream from the 5′ termini locations mapped by RNase protection (i.e. primer A1912, coordinates 1912 to 1886) and used primer extension to map the precise locations of the 5′ termini; DNA sequence reactions using the same primer (A1912) were used as the size standard. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the 5′ termini of the intermediate RNA were detected in N3431 grown at 43 °C but not at 33 °C and were mapped at rne coordinates 1738 and 1747. The intensity of the terminus at position 1738 is stronger than that at 1747, consistent with our RNase protection data showing that the larger species is more abundant (Fig. 5 A, bottom panel, indicated by arrows). Additional primer extension analysis demonstrated that the 2-kb decay intermediate is generated from intact rne mRNA rather than from the previously reported (14Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) RNA species produced by RNase E cleavage 48 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the full-lengthrne transcript. A 5′ terminus at rne gene coordinate 180 that is identical to the rne initiation site mapped by Jain and Belasco (14Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was detected at both temperatures (Fig.5 C) as was a second site at coordinate 146 in N3431 grown at 43 °C (Fig. 5 C, 43 °C). The primer extension signal at the nucleotide position 180 was much greater at 43 °C than at 33 °C, and the second 5′ end at nucleotide position 146 was detected only at 43 °C. These results, which are consistent with our results showing that the CAA-dependent cleavage that produces the 2-kb decay intermediate becomes evident when RNase E is inactivated, indicate that the 2-kb decay intermediate is the cleavage product of the intact full-length rne transcript. Previous work has shown that RNase E autoregulates its production by degrading its own transcript (14Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 15Mudd E.A. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have now found that in the absence of RNase E activity a default mechanism involving cleavage by an endoribonuclease whose activity is regulated by the presence of amino acids in minimal medium initiates degradation of rnetranscripts. In addition, our finding that amino acids in minimal medium can regulate the endoribonuclease activity in vivohas not been reported previously. This kind of default mechanism of regulating RNA decay pathway may also exist for other transcripts to compensate for deficiency in RNase E activity or to respond to different cell growth conditions, including oxygen concentration, which have been shown to modulate RNase E activity (25Georgellis D. Arridson S. von Gabain A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5382-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2Recent data suggest that cell growth stage and oxygen can regulate the level of the rne transcript (A. von Gabain, manuscript in preparation). The cleavages we observed at coordinates 1738 and 1747 in therne message do not result from RNase III, which also has been shown to cleave its own message (i.e. rnc transcript), since in an rnc-105/rne-3071 double mutant strain (SW001), the 2-kb decay intermediate was formed as in N3431 (data not shown). Another major endoribonuclease RNase P, which is essential for tRNA processing, has also recently been reported (26Alifano P. Rivellini F. Piscitelli C. Arraiano C.M. Bruni C.B. Carlomagno M.S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 3021-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) to be involved in mRNA degradation. Whether the observed endoribonuclease whose activity regulated by amino acids in minimal medium is RNase P is unknown. However, there is no reported evidence that RNase P activity is affected by the presence or absence of amino acids. Therefore, production of the 2-kb decay intermediate appears to result from an unidentified endonuclease whose activity requires specific amino acids in the culture medium. Whether there was an initial cleavage at an upstream site coupled with subsequent processing to these termini cannot be ruled out. However, no 5′–3′ exoribonucleases have been identified in E. coli, and other decay intermediates resulting from endonuclease digestion would have been detected by the experiment shown in Fig. 1. The 2-kb decay intermediate observed here was not observed in previous studies (14Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 15Mudd E.A. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) where LB medium rather than CAA minimal medium was used. It is worth noting that an essential glycolytic enzyme, enolase, that catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate has been found in the RNase E complex or degradosome independently by us and others (27Miczak A. Kaberdin V.R. Wei C.L. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3865-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 28Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Bacteria mutated in the eno gene cannot be cultured in glycerol minimal medium, but it can grow if either CAA, succinate, or malate is provided (29Hillman J.D. Fraenkel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 1175-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As tight control of RNase E expression is essential for cell growth (13Claverie-Martin F. Diaz-Torres M.R. Yancey S.D. Kushner S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), it is possible that this CAA or medium composition-rescued phenotype is related to the activation of the observed endoribonuclease activity that hydrolyzes rne mRNA.
