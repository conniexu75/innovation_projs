https://openalex.org/W4206675538,"Abstract The recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is raising concerns because of its increased transmissibility and its numerous spike mutations, which have the potential to evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by COVID-19 vaccines. Here we evaluated the effects of a heterologous BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine booster on the humoral immunity of participants who had received a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine used globally. We found that a heterologous CoronaVac prime vaccination of two doses followed by a BNT162b2 booster induces elevated virus-specific antibody levels and potent neutralization activity against the ancestral virus and the Delta variant, resembling the titers obtained after two doses of mRNA vaccines. Although neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in participants who had received a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac, the BNT162b2 booster resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in neutralization activity against Omicron compared with the two-dose mRNA vaccine. Despite this increase, neutralizing antibody titers were reduced by 7.1-fold and 3.6-fold for Omicron compared with the ancestral strain and the Delta variant, respectively. These findings have immediate implications for multiple countries that previously used a CoronaVac regimen and reinforce the idea that the Omicron variant is associated with immune escape from vaccines or infection-induced immunity, highlighting the global need for vaccine boosters to combat the impact of emerging variants."
https://openalex.org/W4205240144,"The Omicron variant is rapidly becoming the dominant SARS-CoV-2 virus circulating globally. It is important to define reductions in virus neutralizing activity in the serum of convalescent or vaccinated individuals to understand potential loss of protection against infection by Omicron. We previously established that a 50% plaque reduction neutralization antibody titer (PRNT50) ≥25.6 in our live virus assay corresponded to the threshold for 50% protection from infection against wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2. Here we show markedly reduced serum antibody titers against the Omicron variant (geometric mean titer (GMT) < 10) compared to WT virus 3-5 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2 (GMT = 218.8) or CoronaVac vaccine (GMT = 32.5). A BNT162b2 booster dose elicited Omicron PRNT50 titers ≥25.6 in 88% of individuals (22 of 25) who previously received 2 doses of BNT162b2 and 80% of individuals (24 of 30) who previously received CoronaVac. However, few (3%) previously infected individuals (1 of 30) or those vaccinated with three doses of CoronaVac (1 of 30) met this threshold. Our findings suggest that countries primarily using CoronaVac vaccines should consider messenger RNA vaccine boosters in response to the spread of Omicron. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of different vaccines against the Omicron variant are urgently needed."

Here, using whole-genome sequencing of 1,013 clonal haematopoietic colonies from 12 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, we identified 580,133 somatic mutations to reconstruct haematopoietic phylogenies and determine clonal histories. Driver mutations were estimated to occur early in life, including the in utero period. JAK2V617F was estimated to have been acquired by 33 weeks of gestation to 10.8 years of age in 5 patients in whom JAK2V617F was the first event. DNMT3A mutations were acquired by 8 weeks of gestation to 7.6 years of age in 4 patients, and a PPM1D mutation was acquired by 5.8 years of age. Additional genomic events occurred before or following JAK2V617F acquisition and as independent clonal expansions. Sequential driver mutation acquisition was separated by decades across life, often outcompeting ancestral clones. The mean latency between JAK2V617F acquisition and diagnosis was 30 years (range 11–54 years). Estimated historical rates of clonal expansion varied substantially (3% to 190% per year), increased with additional driver mutations, and predicted latency to diagnosis. Our study suggests that early driver mutation acquisition and life-long growth and evolution underlie adult myeloproliferative neoplasms, raising opportunities for earlier intervention and a new model for cancer development. Whole-genome sequencing of 1,013 clonal haematopoietic colonies from myeloproliferative neoplasms of 12 individuals reveals haematopoietic phylogenies and indicates that driver mutations are acquired sequentially, starting early in life."
https://openalex.org/W3174902050,"Host cells initiate cell death programs to limit pathogen infection. Inhibition of transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) by pathogenic Yersinia in macrophages triggers receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)-dependent caspase-8 cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis). A genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screen to uncover mediators of caspase-8-dependent pyroptosis identified an unexpected role of the lysosomal FLCN-FNIP2-Rag-Ragulator supercomplex, which regulates metabolic signalling and the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). In response to Yersinia infection, FADD, RIPK1 and caspase-8 were recruited to Rag-Ragulator, causing RIPK1 phosphorylation and caspase-8 activation. Pyroptosis activation depended on Rag GTPase activity and lysosomal tethering of Rag-Ragulator, but not mTORC1. Thus, the lysosomal metabolic regulator Rag-Ragulator instructs the inflammatory response to Yersinia."
https://openalex.org/W4206442867,"The relevance of extracellular magnesium in cellular immunity remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the co-stimulatory cell-surface molecule LFA-1 requires magnesium to adopt its active conformation on CD8+ T cells, thereby augmenting calcium flux, signal transduction, metabolic reprogramming, immune synapse formation, and, as a consequence, specific cytotoxicity. Accordingly, magnesium-sufficiency sensed via LFA-1 translated to the superior performance of pathogen- and tumor-specific T cells, enhanced effectiveness of bi-specific T cell engaging antibodies, and improved CAR T cell function. Clinically, low serum magnesium levels were associated with more rapid disease progression and shorter overall survival in CAR T cell and immune checkpoint antibody-treated patients. LFA-1 thus directly incorporates information on the composition of the microenvironment as a determinant of outside-in signaling activity. These findings conceptually link co-stimulation and nutrient sensing and point to the magnesium-LFA-1 axis as a therapeutically amenable biologic system."
https://openalex.org/W4205514149,"Single-cell multiomics data continues to grow at an unprecedented pace. Although several methods have demonstrated promising results in integrating several data modalities from the same tissue, the complexity and scale of data compositions present in cell atlases still pose a challenge. Here, we present scJoint, a transfer learning method to integrate atlas-scale, heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. scJoint leverages information from annotated scRNA-seq data in a semisupervised framework and uses a neural network to simultaneously train labeled and unlabeled data, allowing label transfer and joint visualization in an integrative framework. Using atlas data as well as multimodal datasets generated with ASAP-seq and CITE-seq, we demonstrate that scJoint is computationally efficient and consistently achieves substantially higher cell-type label accuracy than existing methods while providing meaningful joint visualizations. Thus, scJoint overcomes the heterogeneity of different data modalities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of cellular phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W4206379337,"Hundreds of microbiota genes are associated with host biology/disease. Unraveling the causal contribution of a microbiota gene to host biology remains difficult because many are encoded by nonmodel gut commensals and not genetically targetable. A general approach to identify their gene transfer methodology and build their gene manipulation tools would enable mechanistic dissections of their impact on host physiology. We developed a pipeline that identifies the gene transfer methods for multiple nonmodel microbes spanning five phyla, and we demonstrated the utility of their genetic tools by modulating microbiome-derived short-chain fatty acids and bile acids in vitro and in the host. In a proof-of-principle study, by deleting a commensal gene for bile acid synthesis in a complex microbiome, we discovered an intriguing role of this gene in regulating colon inflammation. This technology will enable genetically engineering the nonmodel gut microbiome and facilitate mechanistic dissection of microbiota-host interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4200172132,"An outbreak of over 1,000 COVID-19 cases in Provincetown, Massachusetts (MA), in July 2021-the first large outbreak mostly in vaccinated individuals in the US-prompted a comprehensive public health response, motivating changes to national masking recommendations and raising questions about infection and transmission among vaccinated individuals. To address these questions, we combined viral genomic and epidemiological data from 467 individuals, including 40% of outbreak-associated cases. The Delta variant accounted for 99% of cases in this dataset; it was introduced from at least 40 sources, but 83% of cases derived from a single source, likely through transmission across multiple settings over a short time rather than a single event. Genomic and epidemiological data supported multiple transmissions of Delta from and between fully vaccinated individuals. However, despite its magnitude, the outbreak had limited onward impact in MA and the US overall, likely due to high vaccination rates and a robust public health response."
https://openalex.org/W4205256619,"Neurons depend on autophagy to maintain cellular homeostasis, and defects in autophagy are pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease. To probe the role of basal autophagy in the maintenance of neuronal health, we isolated autophagic vesicles from mouse brain tissue and used proteomics to identify the major cargos engulfed within autophagosomes, validating our findings in rodent primary and human iPSC-derived neurons. Mitochondrial proteins were identified as a major cargo in the absence of mitophagy adaptors such as OPTN. We found that nucleoid-associated proteins are enriched compared with other mitochondrial components. In the axon, autophagic engulfment of nucleoid-enriched mitochondrial fragments requires the mitochondrial fission machinery Drp1. We proposed that localized Drp1-dependent fission of nucleoid-enriched fragments in proximity to the sites of autophagosome biogenesis enhances their capture. The resulting efficient autophagic turnover of nucleoids may prevent accumulation of mitochondrial DNA in the neuron, thus mitigating activation of proinflammatory pathways that contribute to neurodegeneration."

https://openalex.org/W4206648771,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had devastating consequences worldwide, including a spike in global mortality. Residents of long-term care homes have been disproportionately affected. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine the scale of pandemic-related deaths of long-term care residents in the province of Ontario, Canada, and to estimate excess mortality due to a positive COVID-19 test adjusted for demographics and regional variations. Crude mortality rates for 2019 and 2020 were compared, as were predictors of mortality among residents with positive and negative tests from March 2020 to December 2020. We found the crude mortality rates were higher from April 2020 to June 2020 and from November 2020 to December 2020, corresponding to Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the pandemic in Ontario. There were also substantial increases in mortality among residents with a positive COVID-19 test. The significant differences in excess mortality observed in relation to long-term care home ownership category and geographic region may indicate gaps in the healthcare system that warrant attention from policymakers. Further investigation is needed to identify the most relevant factors in explaining these differences."

Principles, practices, and uncertainties related to these commitments are offered for future investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4205828268,"TRPC3 and TRPC6 channels are calcium-permeable non-selective cation channels that are involved in many physiological processes. The gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of TRPC6 lead to familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in humans, but their pathogenic mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of human TRPC3 in both high-calcium and low-calcium conditions. Based on these structures and accompanying electrophysiological studies, we identified both inhibitory and activating calcium-binding sites in TRPC3 that couple intracellular calcium concentrations to the basal channel activity. These calcium sensors are also structurally and functionally conserved in TRPC6. We uncovered that the GOF mutations of TRPC6 activate the channel by allosterically abolishing the inhibitory effects of intracellular calcium. Furthermore, structures of human TRPC6 in complex with two chemically distinct inhibitors bound at different ligand-binding pockets reveal different conformations of the transmembrane domain, providing templates for further structure-based drug design targeting TRPC6-related diseases such as FSGS."
https://openalex.org/W4205231985,"Hepatic fibrosis is caused by the increased accumulation and improper degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the liver. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation is a key process in initiating hepatic fibrosis and can be ameliorated by the administration of probiotic strains. This study hypothesized that LAB strains (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Weissella cibaria) might attenuate pro-fibrogenic cytokine TGF-β mediated HSCs activation and induce collagen deposition, expression of other fibrogenic/inflammatory markers, autophagy, and apoptotic processes in vitro. Few studies have evaluated the probiotic effects against fibrogenesis in vitro. In this study, TGF-β exposure increased collagen deposition in LX-2 cells, but this increase was diminished when the cells were pretreated with LAB strains before TGF-β stimulation. TGF-β not only increased collagen deposition, but it also significantly upregulated the mRNA levels of Col1A1, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2), IL-6, CXCL-8, CCL2, and IL-1β in LX-2 cells. Pretreatment of the cells with LAB strains counteracted the TGF-β-induced pro-fibrogenic and inflammatory markers by modulating SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent TGF-β signaling. In addition, LX-2 cells exposed to TGF-β induced the autophagic and apoptotic associated proteins that were also positively regulated by the LAB strains. These findings suggest that LAB can attenuate TGF-β signaling that is associated with liver fibrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4226055853,"Catabolic conditions, such as starvation, inactivity, and cancer cachexia, induce Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor(s) expression and severe muscle atrophy via the induction of ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated muscle proteolysis, resulting in frailty and poor quality of life. Although FOXOs are clearly essential for the induction of muscle atrophy, it is unclear whether there are other factors involved in the FOXO-mediated transcriptional regulation. As such, we identified FOXO-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ) signaling pathway as a novel proteolytic pathway. By comparing the gene expression profiles of FOXO1-transgenic (gain-of-function model) and FOXO1,3a,4-/- (loss-of-function model) mice, we identified several novel FOXO1-target genes in skeletal muscle including Redd1, Sestrin1, Castor2, Chac1, Depp1, Lat3, as well as C/EBPδ. During starvation, C/EBPδ abundance was increased in a FOXOs-dependent manner. Notably, knockdown of C/EBPδ prevented the induction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and decrease of myofibers in FOXO1-activated myotubes. Conversely, C/EBPδ overexpression in primary myotubes induced myotube atrophy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that FOXO1 enhances the promoter activity of target genes in cooperation with C/EBPδ and ATF4. This research comprehensively identifies novel FOXO1 target genes in skeletal muscle and clarifies the pathophysiological role of FOXO1, a master regulator of skeletal muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W4220690703,"The nervous and endocrine systems coordinately monitor and regulate nutrient availability to maintain energy homeostasis. Sensory detection of food regulates internal nutrient availability in a manner that anticipates food intake, but sensory pathways that promote anticipatory physiological changes remain unclear. Here, we identify serotonergic (5-HT) neurons as critical mediators that transform gustatory detection by sensory neurons into the activation of insulin-producing cells and enteric neurons in Drosophila. One class of 5-HT neurons responds to gustatory detection of sugars, excites insulin-producing cells, and limits consumption, suggesting that they anticipate increased nutrient levels and prevent overconsumption. A second class of 5-HT neurons responds to gustatory detection of bitter compounds and activates enteric neurons to promote gastric motility, likely to stimulate digestion and increase circulating nutrients upon food rejection. These studies demonstrate that 5-HT neurons relay acute gustatory detection to divergent pathways for longer-term stabilization of circulating nutrients."

https://openalex.org/W4207035970,"Opioids targeting mu;μ (MOP) receptors produce analgesia in the peri-operative period and palliative care. They also produce side effects including respiratory depression, tolerance/dependence and addiction. The N/OFQ opioid receptor (NOP) also produces analgesia but is devoid of the major MOP side effects. Evidence exists for MOP-NOP interaction and mixed MOP-NOP ligands produce analgesia with reduced side effects. We have generated a HEKMOP/NOP human expression system and used bivalent MOP-NOP and fluorescent ligands to (i) probe for receptor interaction and (ii) consequences of that interaction. We used HEKMOP/NOP cells and two bivalent ligands; Dermorphin-N/OFQ (MOP agonist-NOP agonist; DeNO) and Dermorphin-UFP101 (MOP agonist-NOP antagonist; De101). We have determined receptor binding profiles, GTPγ[35S] binding, cAMP formation and ERK1/2 activation. We have also probed MOP and NOP receptor interactions in HEK cells and hippocampal neurones using the novel MOP fluorescent ligand, DermorphinATTO488 and the NOP fluorescent ligand N/OFQATTO594. In HEKMOP/NOP MOP ligands displaced NOP binding and NOP ligands displaced MOP binding. Using fluorescent probes in HEKMOP/NOP cells we demonstrated MOP-NOP probe overlap and a FRET signal indicating co-localisation. MOP-NOP were also co-localised in hippocampal tissue. In GTPγ[35S] and cAMP assays NOP stimulation shifted the response to MOP rightwards. At ERK1/2 the response to bivalent ligands generally peaked later. We provide evidence for MOP-NOP interaction in recombinant and native tissue. NOP activation reduces responsiveness of MOP activation; this was shown with conventional and bivalent ligands."
https://openalex.org/W4207067361,"Owing to climate change impacts, waterlogging is a serious abiotic stress that affects crops, resulting in stunted growth and loss of productivity. Cassava (Manihot esculenta Grantz) is usually grown in areas that experience high amounts of rainfall; however, little research has been done on the waterlogging tolerance mechanism of this species. Therefore, we investigated the physiological responses of cassava plants to waterlogging stress and analyzed global gene transcription responses in the leaves and roots of waterlogged cassava plants. The results showed that waterlogging stress significantly decreased the leaf chlorophyll content, caused premature senescence, and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) in the leaves and roots. In total, 2538 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in the leaves and 13364 in the roots, with 1523 genes shared between the two tissues. Comparative analysis revealed that the DEGs were related mainly to photosynthesis, amino metabolism, RNA transport and degradation. We also summarized the functions of the pathways that respond to waterlogging and are involved in photosynthesis, glycolysis and galactose metabolism. Additionally, many transcription factors (TFs), such as MYBs, AP2/ERFs, WRKYs and NACs, were identified, suggesting that they potentially function in the waterlogging response in cassava. The expression of 12 randomly selected genes evaluated via both quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was highly correlated (R2 = 0.9077), validating the reliability of the RNA-seq results. The potential waterlogging stress-related transcripts identified in this study are representatives of candidate genes and molecular resources for further understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the waterlogging response in cassava."
https://openalex.org/W4205145431,"Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) is one of the regions where the HIV epidemic continues to grow at a concerning rate. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage in EECA countries has significantly increased during the last decade, which can lead to an increase in the risk of emergence, transmission, and spread of HIV variants with drug resistance (DR) that cannot be controlled. Because HIV genotyping cannot be performed in these countries, data about HIV DR are limited or unavailable.To monitor circulating HIV-1 genetic variants, assess the prevalence of HIV DR among patients starting antiretroviral therapy, and reveal potential transmission clusters among patients in six EECA countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.We analyzed 1071 HIV-1 pol-gene fragment sequences (2253-3369 bp) from patients who were initiating or reinitiating first-line ART in six EECA counties, i.e., Armenia (n = 120), Azerbaijan (n = 96), Belarus (n = 158), Russia (n = 465), Tajikistan (n = 54), and Uzbekistan (n = 178), between 2017 and 2019. HIV Pretreatment DR (PDR) and drug resistance mutation (DRM) prevalence was estimated using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database. The PDR level was interpreted according to the WHO standard PDR survey protocols. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using the Stanford HIV Resistance Database and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Transmission clusters were determined using Cluster Picker.Analyses of HIV subtypes showed that EECA, in general, has the same HIV genetic variants of sub-subtype A6, CRF63_02A1, and subtype B, with different frequencies and representation for each country. The prevalence of PDR to any drug class was 2.8% in Uzbekistan, 4.2% in Azerbaijan, 4.5% in Russia, 9.2% in Armenia, 13.9% in Belarus, and 16.7% in Tajikistan. PDR to protease inhibitors (PIs) was not detected in any country. PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) was not detected among patients in Azerbaijan, and was relatively low in other countries, with the highest prevalence in Tajikistan (5.6%). The prevalence of PDR to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was the lowest in Uzbekistan (2.8%) and reached 11.1% and 11.4% in Tajikistan and Belarus, respectively. Genetic transmission network analyses identified 226/1071 (21.1%) linked individuals, forming 93 transmission clusters mainly containing two or three sequences. We found that the time since HIV diagnosis in clustered patients was significantly shorter than that in unclustered patients (1.26 years vs 2.74 years). Additionally, the K103N/S mutation was mainly observed in clustered sequences (6.2% vs 2.8%).Our study demonstrated different PDR prevalence rates and DR dynamics in six EECA countries, with worrying levels of PDR in Tajikistan and Belarus, where prevalence exceeded the 10% threshold recommended by the WHO for immediate public health action. Because DR testing for clinical purposes is not common in EECA, it is currently extremely important to conduct surveillance of HIV DR in EECA due to the increased ART coverage in this region."
https://openalex.org/W4206172268,"To investigate which cytokines, chemokines and growth factors are involved in the immunopathogenesis of idiopathic uveitis, and whether cytokine profiles are associated with. Serum and aqueous humor (AH) samples of 75 patients with idiopathic uveitis were analyzed by multiplex immunoassay. Infectious controls consisted of 16 patients with ocular toxoplasmosis all confirmed by intraocular fluid analyses. Noninfectious controls consisted of 7 patients with Behçet disease related uveitis and 15 patients with sarcoidosis related uveitis. The control group consisted of AH and serum samples from 47 noninflammatory control patients with age-related cataract. In each sample, 27 immune mediators ± IL-21 and IL-23 were measured. In idiopathic uveitis, 13 of the 29 mediators, including most proinflammatory and vascular mediators such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IP-10, TNF-α and VEGF, were significantly elevated in the aqueous humor when compared to all controls. Moreover, IL-17, IP-10, and IL-21, were significantly elevated in the serum when compared to all controls. We clustered 4 subgroups of idiopathic uveitis using a statistical analysis of hierarchical unsupervised classification, characterized by the order of magnitude of concentrations of intraocular cytokines. The pathogenesis of idiopathic uveitis is characterized by the presence of predominantly proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and vascular endothelial growth factor with high expression levels as compared to other causes of uveitis. There are indications for obvious Th-1/ IL21-Th17 pathways but also IL9-Th9 and increased IFN-γ-inducing cytokine (IL12) and IFN-γ-inducible CXC chemokine (IP-10). The combined data suggest that immune mediator expression is different among idiopathic uveitis. This study suggests various clusters among the idiopathic uveitis group rather than one specific uveitis entity."

https://openalex.org/W4225511319,"Astrocytes release gliotransmitters via connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels into neighboring synapses, which can modulate synaptic activity and are necessary for fear memory consolidation. However, the gliotransmitters released, and their mechanisms of action remain elusive. Here, we report that fear conditioning training elevated Cx43 hemichannel activity in astrocytes from the basolateral amygdala (BLA). The selective blockade of Cx43 hemichannels by microinfusion of TAT-Cx43L2 peptide into the BLA induced memory deficits 1 and 24 h after training, without affecting learning. The memory impairments were prevented by the co-injection of glutamate and D-serine, but not by the injection of either alone, suggesting a role for NMDA receptors (NMDAR). The incubation with TAT-Cx43L2 decreased NMDAR-mediated currents in BLA slices, effect that was also prevented by the addition of glutamate and D-serine. NMDARs in primary neuronal cultures were unaffected by TAT-Cx43L2, ruling out direct effects of the peptide on NMDARs. Finally, we show that D-serine permeates through purified Cx43 hemichannels reconstituted in liposomes. We propose that the release of glutamate and D-serine from astrocytes through Cx43 hemichannels is necessary for the activation of post-synaptic NMDARs during training, to allow for the formation of short-term and subsequent long-term memory, but not for learning per se."
https://openalex.org/W4226145911,"Antimicrobial restrictions prompted the search for cost and biologically effective alternatives to replace antimicrobial growth promoters (AGPs) in food-producing animals. In addition, the efficacy of this alternatives needs to be contrasted in field/commercial trials under different challenge conditions. However only a few studies describing the impact of tannins or others AGP-alternatives in commercial poultry production conditions are actually available. The aim of the present work is to study how the inclusion of a blend of chestnut and quebracho tannins can affect broiler productive performance and health under commercial conditions. Three experiments with different approaches were conducted: (1) a trial comparing the effects of both additives (tannins vs AGP) on different commercial farms at the same time; (2) the follow-up of one farm during an entire productive year; and (3) an experimental trial using a C . perfringens challenge model in broiler chickens. Although productive results from field trials were similar among treatments, evaluations of gut health indicators showed improvements in the tannins treated flocks. Frequency and severity of intestinal gross lesions were reduced in jejunum (42% vs 23%; p&lt;0.05–1.37 vs. 0.73; p&lt;0.01, respectively) and ileum (25% vs. 10%; p&lt;0.0.5–1.05 vs. 0.58; p&lt;0.01) in tannins treated birds. Results from 16S studies, show that cecal microbiota diversity was not differentially affected by AGPs or tannins, but changes in the relative abundance of certain taxa were described, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium groups. Results from experimental C . perfringens necrotic enteritis showed that tannins treated birds had reduced incidence of gross lesions in jejunum (43.75 vs. 74.19%; p&lt;0.01) and ileum (18.75% vs. 45.16%; p&lt;0.05) compared with control. These results suggest that AGPs can be replaced by tannins feed additives, and contribute in the implementation of antimicrobial-free programs in broilers without affecting health or performance."
https://openalex.org/W4205545622,"Epidemiological studies suggested that PM2.5 (particle matters with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) exposure is associated with atherosclerosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are messengers between intracellular communications which are important in diseases procession. At present, whether EVs derived from PM2.5-exposed alveolar epithelial cells (P-EVs) involve in atherosclerosis has not been clearly understood. This study is performed to investigate the effects of P-EVs on the development of endothelium adhesion and atherosclerosis. Here, ApoE-/- mice were randomized into different groups receiving one of the following treatments, filtered air (FA), PM2.5, PBS, PBS-treated alveolar epithelial cells-derived EVs (EVs), or P-EVs. Then the atherosclerosis level in aortas or aorta sections was evaluated by oil red O staining. The results indicated that ApoE-/- mice treated with P-EVs or PM2.5 showed more obvious atherosclerosis plaques in aortas and aortic arches than those treated with EVs or PBS. Endothelial cells (ECs) were treated with PBS, EVs, P-EVs, or PM2.5. The adhesion property, miRNAs level and expressions of IκBα, phosphorylated IκBα, NF-κB p65, phosphorylated NF-κB p65, and VCAM1 in ECs were determined. It was found that P-EVs activated IκBα-NF-κB-VCAM1 signaling and increased adhesion of ECs, and such effects could be reversed by adalimumab (the TNF-α inhibitor) or miR-326-3p inhibitor. Further study suggested that P-EVs induced upregulation of TNF-α and miR-326-3p in recipient ECs and contributed to the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Collectively, EVs derived from PM2.5-exposed alveolar epithelial cells played an important role in the development of atherosclerosis via activating IκBα-NF-κB-VCAM1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4205721250,"Cleanliness of hospital surfaces helps prevent healthcare-associated infections, but comparative evaluations of various cleaning strategies during COVID-19 pandemic surges and worker shortages are scarce.To evaluate the effectiveness of daily, enhanced terminal, and contingency-based cleaning strategies in an acute care hospital (ACH) and a long-term care facility (LTCF), using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assays. Daily cleaning involved light dusting and removal of visible debris while a patient is in the room. Enhanced terminal cleaning involved wet moping and surface wiping with disinfectants after a patient is permanently moved out of a room followed by ultraviolet light (UV-C), electrostatic spraying, or room fogging. Contingency-based strategies, performed only at the LTCF, involved cleaning by a commercial environmental remediation company with proprietary chemicals and room fogging. Ambient surface contamination was also assessed randomly, without regard to cleaning times. Near-patient or high-touch stationary and non-stationary environmental surfaces were sampled with pre-moistened swabs in viral transport media.At the ACH, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on 66% of surfaces before cleaning and on 23% of those surfaces immediately after terminal cleaning, for a 65% post-cleaning reduction (p = 0.001). UV-C enhancement resulted in an 83% reduction (p = 0.023), while enhancement with electrostatic bleach application resulted in a 50% reduction (p = 0.010). ATP levels on RNA positive surfaces were not significantly different from those of RNA negative surfaces. LTCF contamination rates differed between the dementia, rehabilitation, and residential units (p = 0.005). 67% of surfaces had RNA after room fogging without terminal-style wiping. Fogging with wiping led to a -11% change in the proportion of positive surfaces. At the LTCF, mean ATP levels were lower after terminal cleaning (p = 0.016).Ambient surface contamination varied by type of unit and outbreak conditions, but not facility type. Removal of SARS-CoV-2 RNA varied according to cleaning strategy.Previous reports have shown time spent cleaning by hospital employed environmental services staff did not correlate with cleaning thoroughness. However, time spent cleaning by a commercial remediation company in this study was associated with cleaning effectiveness. These findings may be useful for optimizing allocation of cleaning resources during staffing shortages."
https://openalex.org/W4206331854,"The leaf serves as an important assimilation organ of plants, and the anatomical structure of leaves can reflect the adaptability of the plant to the environment to a certain extent. The current study aimed to cultivate superior local cultivars, and 35 healthy individual plants were selected from the Camellia oleifera germplasm resource nursery for a comparative study of the leaf structure. In July 2019, the leaves were collected from 35 selected healthy C . oleifera plants, and the leaf structure was observed by using the paraffin section method. Healthy individual plants were screened using variance analysis, correlation analysis and cluster analysis. The representative indices were selected according to the cluster membership, correlation indices and coefficient of variation (C/V) for a comprehensive evaluation of drought resistance via the membership function. There were extremely significant differences in 11 indices of leaf structure for these 35 healthy plants. C18 had the greatest leaf thickness, C7 the largest spongy tissue, and C38 the largest ratio of palisade tissue thickness to spongy tissue thickness (P/S). The clustering results of the healthy individual plants differed significantly. The membership function showed that the drought resistance of 35 C . oleifera plants was divided into five categories. C18 had very strong drought resistance, and C3, C7 and C40 had strong drought resistance. There were significant differences in terms of the upper epidermis, P/S ratio and spongy tissue among the C . oleifera plants. C18, C3, C7 and C40 exhibited satisfactory drought resistance. Although C39 and C26 had moderate drought resistance, their P/S ratios were high, which might be used to cultivate high-yield and drought-resistant C . oleifera varieties. The leaf P/S ratio of C . oleifera from low-hot valley areas was high. Among various leaf structures, spongy tissue, upper epidermis, P/S ratio and cuticle constitute the drought resistance evaluation indices for C . oleifera grown in low-hot valley areas."
https://openalex.org/W4206698106,"Sarcoptic mange epidemics can devastate wildlife populations. In 2014, mange was first detected in vicuñas ( Vicugna vicugna ) and guanacos ( Lama guanicoe ) in San Guillermo National Park (SGNP), Argentina. This study describes the temporal dynamics of the outbreak, its effects on the park’s wild camelid populations between 2017–2019, and investigates the potential source of the epidemic. From May 2017 to June 2018, transect surveys indicated a sharp decrease in the density of living vicuñas and guanacos by 68% and 77%, respectively. By April 2019 no vicuñas or guanacos were recorded on transect surveys, suggesting their near-extinction in the park. Clinical signs consistent with mange (e.g., intense scratching, hyperkeratosis, alopecia) were observed in 24% of living vicuñas (n = 478) and 33% of living guanacos (n = 12) during surveys, as well as in 94% of vicuña carcasses (n = 124) and 85% of guanaco carcasses (n = 20) examined. Sarcoptes scabiei was identified as the causal agent by skin scrapings, and the cutaneous lesions were characterized by histopathology (n = 15). Genetic characterization revealed that mites recovered from seven vicuñas (n = 13) and three guanacos (n = 11) shared the same genotype, which is consistent with a single source and recent origin of the epidemic. Tracing the potential source, we identified a governmental livestock incentive program which introduced llamas ( Lama glama ) in areas adjacent to SGNP in 2009, some of which had alopecic scaling consistent with sarcoptic mange. Though at the time of our study no llamas with mange were available for confirmatory sampling, we hypothesize that the introduction of mange-infected llamas may have triggered the outbreak in wild camelids. This unprecedented event in SGNP had devastating effects on dominating herbivores with potentially profound cascading effects at the community and ecosystem levels."
https://openalex.org/W4206940298,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused profound health, economic, and social disruptions globally. We assessed the full costs of hospitalization for COVID-19 disease at Ekka Kotebe COVID-19 treatment center in Addis Ababa, the largest hospital dedicated to COVID-19 patient care in Ethiopia. Methods and findings We retrospectively collected and analysed clinical and cost data on patients admitted to Ekka Kotebe with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections. Cost data included personnel time and salaries, drugs, medical supplies and equipment, facility utilities, and capital costs. Facility medical records were reviewed to assess the average duration of stay by disease severity (either moderate, severe, or critical). The data collected covered the time-period March-November 2020. We then estimated the cost per treated COVID-19 episode, stratified by disease severity, from the perspective of the provider. Over the study period there were 2,543 COVID-19 cases treated at Ekka Kotebe, of which, 235 were critical, 515 were severe, and 1,841 were moderate. The mean patient duration of stay varied from 9.2 days (95% CI: 7.6–10.9; for moderate cases) to 19.2 days (17.9–20.6; for critical cases). The mean cost per treated episode was USD 1,473 (95% CI: 1,197–1,750), but cost varied by disease severity: the mean cost for moderate, severe, and critical cases were USD 1,266 (998–1,534), USD 1,545 (1,413–1,677), and USD 2,637 (1,788–3,486), respectively. Conclusions Clinical management and treatment of COVID-19 patients poses an enormous economic burden to the Ethiopian health system. Such estimates of COVID-19 treatment costs inform financial implications for resource-constrained health systems and reinforce the urgency of implementing effective infection prevention and control policies, including the rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, in low-income countries like Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4205932144,"Anthropometry is a Greek word that consists of the two words ""Anthropo"" meaning human species and ""metery"" meaning measurement. It is a science that deals with the size of the body including the dimensions of different parts, the field of motion and the strength of the muscles of the body. Specific individual dimensions such as heights, widths, depths, distances, environments and curvatures are usually measured. In this article, we investigate the anthropometric characteristics of patients with chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart attacks and strokes) and find the factors affecting these diseases and the extent of the impact of each to make the necessary planning. We have focused on cohort studies for 10047 qualified participants from Ravansar County. Machine learning provides opportunities to improve discrimination through the analysis of complex interactions between broad variables. Among the chronic diseases in this cohort study, we have used three deep neural network models for diagnosis and prognosis of the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a case study. Usually in Artificial Intelligence for medicine tasks, Imbalanced data is an important issue in learning and ignoring that leads to false evaluation results. Also, the accuracy evaluation criterion was not appropriate for this task, because a simple model that is labeling all samples negatively has high accuracy. So, the evaluation criteria of precession, recall, AUC, and AUPRC were considered. Then, the importance of variables in general was examined to determine which features are more important in the risk of T2DM. Finally, personality feature was added, in which individual feature importance was examined. Performing by Shapley Values, the model is tuned for each patient so that it can be used for prognosis of T2DM risk for that patient. In this paper, we have focused and implemented a full pipeline of Data Creation, Data Preprocessing, Handling Imbalanced Data, Deep Learning model, true Evaluation method, Feature Importance and Individual Feature Importance. Through the results, the pipeline demonstrated competence in improving the Diagnosis and Prognosis the risk of T2DM with personalization capability."

Genetic polymorphisms in crucial HRR pathway genes might affect genome stability and promote tumorigenesis. Up to our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the impact of HRR gene polymorphisms on BC development in South Indian women. The present population-based case-control study investigated the association of polymorphisms in three key HRR genes (XRCC2-Arg188His, XRCC3-Thr241Met and RAD51-G135C) with BC risk.Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used for genotyping the HRR variants in 491 BC cases and 493 healthy women.We observed that the XRCC3 Met allele was significantly associated with BC risk [OR:1.27 (95% CI: 1.02-1.60); p = 0.035]. In addition, the homozygous mutant (C/C) genotype of RAD51 G135C variant conferred 2.19 fold elevated risk of BC [OR: 2.19 (95% CI: 1.06-4.54); p = 0.034]. Stratified analysis of HRR variants and BC clinicopathological features revealed that the XRCC3-Thr241Met and RAD51-G135C variants are associated with BC progression. Combined SNP analysis revealed that the individuals with RAD51-C/C, XRCC2-Arg/Arg, and XRCC3-Thr/Thr genotype combination have three-fold increased BC risk.The present study imparts additional evidence that genetic variants in crucial HRR pathway genes might play a pivotal role in modulating BC risk in South Indian women."
https://openalex.org/W4206545359,"From various Ethiopian government food security strategies, the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) is one of the strategies to improve households' consumption. As a result, the government needs to know the outcome of the program intervention for further decisions in similar poverty reduction strategies. This study examined the impact of Productive Safety Net Program intervention on food security of rural households in rural western Ethiopia. A cross-sectional survey data were gathered from a total of randomly selected 188 beneficiary and non-beneficiary sample households. Key informants interviews and focus group discussions were employed to triangulate household survey results. A Chi-square test was employed to compare the households' food security status. The propensity score matching method was used to evaluate the impact of a Productive safety net on beneficiary households' food security status. In this study, the Productive Safety net program has significantly increased households' calorie intake. The beneficiaries' households were more food secure than non-beneficiary households by 68% and54% respectively. The mean energy available for the beneficiary and non-beneficiary households is 2488.500 and 2153.394 kcal, respectively. Estimates of the average treatment effect of the treated indicated that a Productive safety net program can impact households food security by 2519.29348 kilocalories, higher in the kernel matching method. This is an encouraging indicator for Programme implementers and funding agents. Therefore, channeling further efforts on this indicator is important for a more pronounced impact of the Programme. Given a certain level of variations of different program impact studies, this study recommends further research with greater scope and at different locations on the impact of PSNP and related Food Security Programs on households' food security status."
https://openalex.org/W4206040355,"Birthweight is an important predictor of newborn health and has been linked to maternal psychological stress during pregnancy. However, it is unclear whether prenatal stress affects birthweight similarly for both male and female infants. We used a well-established pregnancy cohort to investigate the impact of high maternal psychological stress during pregnancy on birthweight as a function of infant sex. Overall, 5702 mother-newborn pairs were analysed. Of these, 198 mothers reported high levels of stress using the Psychological Stress Measure (nine-items version; PSM-9). Maternal psychological stress was assessed between the 24 th and 28 th week of gestation and analyses were performed jointly and independently as a function of neonatal sex (separate analyses for male and female infants). Newborns exposed to high maternal psychological stress during pregnancy (a score above 26 measured using the PSM-9 questionnaire, corresponding to &gt;97.5 th percentile) were compared to newborns of mothers who reported lower stress. ANCOVAs revealed that high levels of maternal stress during pregnancy were linked to infant birthweight as a function of infant sex. Male infants of mothers who reported high levels of stress had a greater birthweight whereas female infants had a lower birthweight under the same conditions, in comparison to mothers who did not report greater levels of stress. Although the effect size is small, these results underline the possibility that male and female fetuses may use different strategies when adapting to maternal adversity and highlight the need to consider infant sex as a moderator of the association between maternal psychological stress during pregnancy and infant birthweight."
https://openalex.org/W4206817668,"Hand gesture recognition tasks based on surface electromyography (sEMG) are vital in human-computer interaction, speech detection, robot control, and rehabilitation applications. However, existing models, whether traditional machine learnings (ML) or other state-of-the-arts, are limited in the number of movements. Targeting a large number of gesture classes, more data features such as temporal information should be persisted as much as possible. In the field of sEMG-based recognitions, the recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) is an advanced method due to the sequential characteristic of sEMG signals. However, the invariance of the pooling layer damages important temporal information. In the all convolutional neural network (ACNN), because of the feature-mixing convolution operation, a same output can be received from completely different inputs. This paper proposes a concatenate feature fusion (CFF) strategy and a novel concatenate feature fusion recurrent convolutional neural network (CFF-RCNN). In CFF-RCNN, a max-pooling layer and a 2-stride convolutional layer are concatenated together to replace the conventional simple dimensionality reduction layer. The featurewise pooling operation serves as a signal amplitude detector without using any parameter. The feature-mixing convolution operation calculates the contextual information. Complete evaluations are made on both the accuracy and convergence speed of the CFF-RCNN. Experiments are conducted using three sEMG benchmark databases named DB1, DB2 and DB4 from the NinaPro database. With more than 50 gestures, the classification accuracies of the CFF-RCNN are 88.87% on DB1, 99.51% on DB2, and 99.29% on DB4. These accuracies are the highest compared with reported accuracies of machine learnings and other state-of-the-art methods. To achieve accuracies of 86%, 99% and 98% for the RCNN, the training time are 2353.686 s, 816.173 s and 731.771 s, respectively. However, for the CFF-RCNN to reach the same accuracies, it needs only 1727.415 s, 542.245 s and 576.734 s, corresponding to a reduction of 26.61%, 33.56% and 21.19% in training time. We concluded that the CFF-RCNN is an improved method when classifying a large number of hand gestures. The CFF strategy significantly improved model performance with higher accuracy and faster convergence as compared to traditional RCNN."
https://openalex.org/W4207050554,"Pain can have a negative impact on sleep and emotional well-being. This study investigated whether this may be partly explained by maladaptive sleep-related cognitive and behavioural responses to pain, including heightened anxiety about sleep and suboptimal sleep hygiene.This cross-sectional study used data from an online survey that collected information about pain (Brief Pain Inventory), sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; Sleep Hygiene Index; Anxiety and Preoccupation about Sleep Questionnaire) and emotional distress (PROMIS measures; Perceived Stress Scale). Structural equation modelling examined the tenability of a framework linking these factors.Of 468 survey respondents (mean age 39 years, 60% female), 29% reported pain (mean severity 1.12), most commonly in the spine or low back (28%). Pain severity correlated with poor sleep quality, poor sleep hygiene, anxiety about sleep and emotional distress. In the first structural equation model, indirect effects were identified between pain severity and sleep quality through anxiety about sleep (β = .08, p < .001) and sleep hygiene (β = .12, p < .001). In the second model, an indirect effect was identified between pain severity and emotional distress through sleep quality (β = .19, p < .01). Combining these models, indirect effects were identified between pain severity and emotional distress through anxiety about sleep, sleep hygiene and sleep quality.This study provides data to support the tenability of a theoretically guided framework linking pain, sleep and emotional distress. If upheld by experimental and/or longitudinal study, this framework holds the potential to inform public health initiatives and more comprehensive pain assessment."

The human opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida glabrata, which causes mucosal and deep-seated infections, is armed with distinct virulence attributes, including a family of 11 glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked aspartyl proteases, CgYapsins. Here, we have profiled total membrane proteomes of the C. glabrata wildtype and 11 proteases-deficient strain, Cgyps1-11Δ, by mass spectrometry analysis and uncovered a novel role for fungal yapsins in glucose sensing and homeostasis. Furthermore, through label-free quantitative membrane proteome analysis, we showed differential abundance of 42% of identified membrane proteins, with electron transport chain and glycolysis proteins displaying lower and higher abundance in Cgyps1-11Δ cells, compared with wildtype cells, respectively. We also demonstrated elevated glucose uptake and upregulation of genes that code for the low-glucose sensor CgSnf3, transcriptional regulators CgMig1 and CgRgt1, and hexose transporter CgHxt2/10 in the Cgyps1-11Δ mutant. We further elucidated a potential underlying mechanism through genetic and transcript measurement analysis under low- and high-glucose conditions and found CgSNF3 deletion to rescue high glucose uptake and attenuated growth of the Cgyps1-11Δ mutant in YPD medium, thereby linking CgYapsins with regulation of the CgSnf3-dependent low-glucose sensing pathway. Last, high ethanol production, diminished mitochondrial membrane potential, and elevated susceptibility to oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors point toward increased fermentative and decreased respiratory metabolism in the Cgyps1-11Δ mutant. Altogether, our findings revealed new possible glucose metabolism-regulatory roles for putative cell surface-associated CgYapsins and advanced our understanding of fungal carbohydrate homeostasis mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4205832174,"Riparian ecosystem restoration has been accomplished through exclusion of livestock using corridor fencing along hundreds of kilometers of streams in the western United States, for the benefit of riparian-obligate wildlife and endangered fishes. Yet, there are limited scientific studies that have evaluated more than short-term shifts in vegetation composition and diversity at a single location or handful of locations following grazing. We sampled riparian vegetation composition along 11-paired grazed and ungrazed (exclosed) stream reaches in northeastern Oregon. Exclosure ages ranged from 2 to >30 years and grazing treatments varied from light grazing every one out of three years to heavy season-long grazing. Species richness and diversity was higher in the ungrazed reaches (p = 0.002). The abundance of native sedges (Carex spp.) and broad-leaved forbs were also significantly (p ≤ 0.05) greater in ungrazed areas. In contrast, exotic species adapted to grazing such as Poa pratensis and Trifolium repens were more abundant in grazed stream reaches. The prevalence of hydrophytic species significantly increased (p ≤ 0.01) in ungrazed reaches, (based on wetland species indicator scores), indicating that wetland-dominated communities within the ungrazed stream reaches were replacing ones adapted to drier environments. The increased abundance of facultative and wetland-obligate species in ungrazed reaches compared to grazed reaches suggests that livestock grazing exacerbates those climate change effects also leading to warmer and drier conditions. Further, riparian-obligate shrub cover along the streambank was higher in 7 of 8 exclosures that were older than 5 years (p = 0.05). As a restoration approach, the inherent resilience of riparian ecosystems exhibited in ungrazed riparian zones suggest positive feedbacks to other beneficial ecosystem processes such as increased species and habitat diversity, increased carbon sequestration, enhanced allochthonous inputs and greater sediment retention, that would affect the aquatic and terrestrial biota, water quality, and stream morphology."
https://openalex.org/W4206914712,"MERRA/Max provides a feature selection approach to dimensionality reduction that enables direct use of global climate model outputs in ecological niche modeling. The system accomplishes this reduction through a Monte Carlo optimization in which many independent MaxEnt runs, operating on a species occurrence file and a small set of randomly selected variables in a large collection of variables, converge on an estimate of the top contributing predictors in the larger collection. These top predictors can be viewed as potential candidates in the variable selection step of the ecological niche modeling process. MERRA/Max's Monte Carlo algorithm operates on files stored in the underlying filesystem, making it scalable to large data sets. Its software components can run as parallel processes in a high-performance cloud computing environment to yield near real-time performance. In tests using Cassin's Sparrow (Peucaea cassinii) as the target species, MERRA/Max selected a set of predictors from Worldclim's Bioclim collection of 19 environmental variables that have been shown to be important determinants of the species' bioclimatic niche. It also selected biologically and ecologically plausible predictors from a more diverse set of 86 environmental variables derived from NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis, an output product of the Goddard Earth Observing System Version 5 (GEOS-5) modeling system. We believe these results point to a technological approach that could expand the use global climate model outputs in ecological niche modeling, foster exploratory experimentation with otherwise difficult-to-use climate data sets, streamline the modeling process, and, eventually, enable automated bioclimatic modeling as a practical, readily accessible, low-cost, commercial cloud service."
https://openalex.org/W4225895901,"Individuals can be characterized in a population according to their brain measurements and activity, given the inter-subject variability in brain anatomy, structure-function relationships, or life experience. Many neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the potential of functional network connectivity patterns estimated from resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to discriminate groups and predict information about individual subjects. However, the predictive signal present in the spatial heterogeneity of brain connectivity networks is yet to be extensively studied. In this study, we investigate, for the first time, the use of pairwise-relationships between resting-state independent spatial maps to characterize individuals. To do this, we develop a deep Siamese framework comprising three-dimensional convolution neural networks for contrastive learning based on individual-level spatial maps estimated via a fully automated fMRI independent component analysis approach. The proposed framework evaluates whether pairs of spatial networks (e.g., visual network and auditory network) are capable of subject identification and assesses the spatial variability in different network pairs' predictive power in an extensive whole-brain analysis. Our analysis on nearly 12,000 unaffected individuals from the UK Biobank study demonstrates that the proposed approach can discriminate subjects with an accuracy of up to 88% for a single network pair on the test set (best model, after several runs), and 82% average accuracy at the subcortical domain level, notably the highest average domain level accuracy attained. Further investigation of our network's learned features revealed a higher spatial variability in predictive accuracy among younger brains and significantly higher discriminative power among males. In sum, the relationship among spatial networks appears to be both informative and discriminative of individuals and should be studied further as putative brain-based biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W4226310184,"Apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells is a critical initial link in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI), recent studies have revealed that Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) was involved in the execution of apoptosis, yet its role in ALI remained unclear. In the present study, we aim to explore the role and mechanism of MBD2 in the pathogenesis of ALI. We have found that MBD2 expression, in parallel to apoptosis, increased in alveolar epithelial cells of mice treated with LPS, knockout of MBD2 reduced apoptosis and protected mice from LPS-induced ALI. In MLE-12 cells, a cell line of murine alveolar epithelial cells, LPS induced MBD2 expression and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Knockdown of MBD2 with shRNA alleviated, while overexpression of MBD2 increased LPS-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, intracellular zinc level decreased when MLE-12 cells were treated with LPS. MBD2 knockdown restored intracellular zinc level after LPS treatment, and MBD2 overexpression further aggravated LPS-induced intracellular zinc loss. Metal transcription factor 1 (MTF1) is a critical transcription factor in charge of intracellular zinc efflux. LPS treatment induced MTF1 expression both in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of MTF1 reduced LPS-induced apoptosis in MLE-12 cells. MBD2 could bind to the promoter region of MTF1 and promote MTF1 expression. Collectively, these data indicated that loss of MBD2-ameliorated LPS-induced alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis and ALI in mice via modulating intracellular zinc homeostasis by upregulating MTF1."
https://openalex.org/W4205333900,"Early clinical studies indicated that estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) might play key roles to impact the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The detailed molecular mechanisms, however, remain unclear. Here, we found ERβ could increase the cancer stem cell (CSC) population via altering the circPHACTR4/miR-34b-5p/c-Myc signaling. Mechanism dissection revealed that ERβ could suppress circular RNA PHACTR4 (circPHACTR4) expression via direct binding to the estrogen response elements (EREs) on the 5′ promoter region of its host gene, phosphatase and actin regulator 4 (PHACTR4) to decrease miR-34b-5p expression. The decreased miRNA-34b-5p could then increase c-Myc mRNA translation via targeting its 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR). The in vivo mouse model with subcutaneous xenografts of ccRCC cells also validated the in vitro data. Importantly, analysis results from ccRCC TCGA database and our clinical data further confirmed the above in vitro/in vivo data. Together, these results suggest that ERβ may increase CSC population in ccRCC via altering ERβ/circPHACTR4/miR-34b-5p/c-Myc signaling and that targeting this newly identified signal pathway may help physicians to better suppress ccRCC progression."

Management with painkillers has adverse implications such as tolerance, addiction, and opioid abuse. Safe, sustainable, cost-effective, and evidence-based solutions are urgently needed. The non-invasive, painless, non-infectious, and safe modality of low-level laser acupuncture (LLLA) has shown promise for SNP management.The overarching aim of this study is to provide evidence of the feasibility and therapeutic efficacy of LLLA for office workers with SNP.This is a pilot, single-blind, double-armed, randomised controlled trial on the feasibility and therapeutic efficacy of a two-week LLLA therapy for office workers with SNP, aged 18 to 65 years. Each of the two study groups will contain 35 participants: the intervention group will receive LLLA from a licensed acupuncturist at the researchers' university clinic (10-20 min/session, 3 sessions/week) for two weeks; the control group will receive usual care without painkillers. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, throughout the two-week intervention, and at trial end. Surveys including open-ended questions will be completed. The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a two-week LLLA therapy for office workers with SNP, as measured by recruitment and completion rates, patient safety, and treatment adherence and compliance. Participants' attitudes, motivation, and challenges to participation, intervention non-compliance, and experience of participating in the trial will be investigated via qualitative data. The secondary outcome is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of LLLA on SNP using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ); the work productivity and activity assessment (WPAI:SHP); 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) for quality of life assessment; and the past 3-month out-of-pocket (OOP) cost for prescription and non-prescription SNP therapy, which is an indicative of the economic burden of SNP on patients and health care systems. This study was approved by Edith Cowan University's Human Research Ethics Committee (No. 2021-02225-WANG).Data collection will commence in December 2021 with anticipated completion by December 2022.Safe, sustainable, cost-effective, evidence-based interventions are needed to minimise the negative implications of SNP in office workers.

https://openalex.org/W4207028537,"The aim of this study was to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms that mediate pathologic foreign body response (FBR) to biomedical implants. The longevity of biomedical implants is limited by the FBR, which leads to implant failure and patient morbidity. Since the specific molecular mechanisms underlying fibrotic responses to biomedical implants have yet to be fully described, there are currently no targeted approaches to reduce pathologic FBR. We utilized proteomics analysis of human FBR samples to identify potential molecular targets for therapeutic inhibition of FBR. We then employed a murine model of FBR to further evaluate the role of this potential target. We performed histological and immunohistochemical analysis on the murine FBR capsule tissue, as well as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on cells isolated from the capsules. We identified IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) as the most promising of several targets, serving as a central molecular mediator in human and murine FBR compared to control subcutaneous tissue. IQGAP1-deficient mice displayed a significantly reduced FBR compared to wild-type mice as evidenced by lower levels of collagen deposition and maturity. Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed that decreasing IQGAP1 resulted in diminished transcription of mechanotransduction, inflammation, and fibrosis-related genes, which was confirmed on the protein level with immunofluorescent staining. The deficiency of IQGAP1 significantly attenuates FBR by deactivating downstream mechanotransduction signaling, inflammation, and fibrotic pathways. IQGAP1 may be a promising target for rational therapeutic design to mitigate pathologic FBR around biomedical implants."
https://openalex.org/W4205763213,"Chagas disease has become a challenge for non-endemic countries since population mobility has increased in recent years and it has spread to these regions. In order to prevent vertical transmission and improve the prognosis of the disease, it is important to make an early diagnosis. And to develop strategies that improve access to diagnosis, it is important to know the factors that most influence the decision of the population to know their serological status. For this reason, this study uses Andersen's Behavioural Model and its proposed strategies to explore the health behaviours of Bolivian population.Twenty-three interviews, two focus groups, and two triangular groups were performed with Bolivian men and women, involving a total of 39 participants. In addition, four interviews were conducted with key informants in contact with Bolivian population to delve into possible strategies to improve the Chagas diagnosis.The most relevant facts for the decision to being diagnosed pointed out by participants were having relatives who were sick or deceased from Chagas disease or, for men, having their pregnant wife with a positive result. After living in Spain more than ten years, population at risk no longer feels identified with their former rural origin and the vector. Moreover, their knowledge and awareness about diagnosis and treatment still remains low, especially in younger people. Limitations on access to healthcare professionals and services were also mentioned, and proposed strategies focused on eliminating these barriers and educating the population in preventive behaviours.Based on Andersen's Behavioural Model, the results obtained regarding the factors that most influence the decision to carry out Chagas diagnosis provide information that could help to develop strategies to improve access to health services and modify health behaviours related to Chagas screening."

Lung epithelial cells are primary targets and replicative niches of influenza viruses; however, the specific regulation of antiviral responses by Tpl2 within lung epithelial cells has not been investigated. Herein, we show that Tpl2 is basally expressed in primary airway epithelial cells and that its expression increases in both type I and type II airway epithelial cells (AECI and AECII) in response to influenza infection. We used Nkx2 . 1 -cre to drive Tpl2 deletion within pulmonary epithelial cells to delineate epithelial cell-specific functions of Tpl2 during influenza infection in mice. Although modest increases in morbidity and mortality were attributed to cre-dependent deletion in lung epithelial cells, no alterations in host cytokine production or lung pathology were observed. In vitro , Tpl2 inhibition within the type I airway epithelial cell line, LET1, as well as genetic ablation in primary airway epithelial cells did not alter cytokine production. Overall, these findings establish that Tpl2-dependent defects in cells other than AECs are primarily responsible for the morbidity and mortality seen in influenza-infected mice with global Tpl2 ablation."

In the last few decades, policymakers have made Emergency Medicine a priority for improving population health. This study aims to contribute to this strengthening of Emergency Medicine, by conducting the country’s first baseline gap analysis of Emergency Medicine Capacity at the pre-hospital and hospital level in order to help identify needs and areas for intervention. Methods This is a cross sectional investigation that utilized a convenience sampling of 22 primary, general and tertiary hospitals. Trained personnel visited the hospitals and conducted 4-hour interviews with hospital administrators and emergency care area personnel. The tool used in the interview was the Columbia University sidHARTe Program Emergency Services Resource Assessment Tool (ESRAT) to evaluate both emergency and trauma capacity in different regions of Ethiopia. The findings of this survey were then compared against two established standards: the World Health Organization’s Essential Package of Emergency Care (EPEC), as well as those set by Ethiopia’s Federal Ministry of Health. Results The tool assessed the services provided at each hospital and evaluated the infrastructure of emergency care at the facility. Triage systems differed amongst the hospitals surveyed though triaging and emergency unit infrastructures were relatively similar amongst the hospitals. There was a marked variability in the level of training, guidelines, staffing, disaster preparedness, drug availability, procedures performed, and quality assurance measures from hospital to hospital. Most regional and district hospitals did not have nurses or doctors trained in Emergency Medicine and over 70% of the hospitals did not have written guidelines for standardized emergency care. Conclusion This gap analysis has revealed numerous inconsistencies in health care practice, resources, and infrastructure within the scope of Emergency Medicine in Ethiopia. Major gaps were identified, and the results of this assessment were used to devise action priorities for the Ministry of Health. Much remains to be done to strengthen Emergency Medicine in Ethiopia, and numerous opportunities exist to make additional short and long-term improvements."

https://openalex.org/W4206680710,"Vertical transmission of HIV remains one of the most common transmission modes. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) decreases the risk of transmission to less than 2%, but maintaining adherence to treatment remains a challenge. Some of the commonly reported barriers to adherence to ART include stress (physical and emotional), depression, and alcohol and drug abuse. Integrating screening and treatment for psychological problem such as depression was reported to improve adherence. In this study, we sought to determine the prevalence of depression and its association with adherence to ART among HIV-positive pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) clinics in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.We conducted a cross-sectional survey from March through November 2018. Participants were conveniently sampled from 12 health institutions offering ANC services. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to screen for depression and the Center for Adherence Support Evaluation (CASE) Adherence index to evaluate adherence to ART. Descriptive statistics was used to estimate the prevalence of depression during third-trimester pregnancy and nonadherence to ART. A bivariate logistic regression analysis was used to get significant predictors for each of the two outcome measures. The final multivariable logistic regression analysis included variables with a P<0.25 in the bivariate logistic regression model; statistical significance was evaluated at P<0.05.We approached 397 eligible individuals, of whom 368 (92.7%) participated and were included in the analysis. Of the total participants, 175(47.6%) had depression. The participants' overall level of adherence to ART was 82%. Pregnant women with low income were twice more likely to have depression (AOR = 2.10, 95%CI = 1.31-3.36). Women with WHO clinical Stage 1 disease were less likely to have depression than women with more advanced disease (AOR = 0.16, 95%CI = 0.05-0.48). There was a statistically significant association between depression and nonadherence to ART (P = 0.020); nonadherence was nearly two times higher among participants with depression (AOR = 1.88, 95%CI = 1.08-3.27).We found a high prevalence of depression among HIV-positive pregnant women in the selected health facilities in Addis Ababa, and what was more concerning was its association with higher rates of nonadherence to ART adversely affecting the outcome of their HIV care. We recommend integrating screening for depression in routine ANC services."
https://openalex.org/W4206972463,"A homogeneously weighted moving average (HWMA) monitoring scheme is a recently proposed memory-type scheme that gained its popularity because of its simplicity and superiority over the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and cumulative sum (CUSUM) schemes in detecting small disturbances in the process. Most of the existing HWMA schemes are designed based on the assumption of normality. It is well-known that the performance of such monitoring schemes degrades significantly when this assumption is violated. Therefore, in this paper, three distribution-free monitoring schemes are developed based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum W statistic. First, the HWMA W scheme is introduced. Secondly, the double HWMA (DHWMA) W scheme is proposed to improve the ability of the HWMA W scheme in detecting very small disturbances in the location parameter and at last, the hybrid HWMA (HHWMA) W scheme is also proposed because of its flexibility and better performance in detecting shifts of different sizes. The zero-state performances of the proposed schemes are investigated using the characteristics of the run-length distribution. The proposed schemes outperform their existing competitors, i.e. EWMA, CUSUM and DEWMA W schemes, in many situations, and particularly the HHWMA W scheme is superior to these competitors regardless of the size of the shift in the location parameter. Real-life data are used to illustrate the implementation and application of the new monitoring schemes."
