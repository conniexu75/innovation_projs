https://openalex.org/W1967946050,"alpha-Amanitin, a toxic substance from the mushroom Amanita phalloides, is a potent inhibitor of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (the nucleoplasmic form) from sea urchin, rat liver, and calf thymus. This compound exerts no effect on the activity of polymerase I (nucleolar form) or polymerase III (also nucleoplasmic). The inhibition is due to a specific interaction with polymerase II or with a complex of DNA and polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W2003532302,"The activity of N-acetyltransferase in the rat pineal gland is more than 15 times higher at night than during the day. This circadian rhythm persists in complete darkness, or in blinded animals, and is suppressed in constant lighting. The N-acetyltransferase rhythm is 180 degrees out of phase with the serotonin rhythm and is similar to the norepinephrine and melatonin rhythms. Experiments in vitro indicate that norepinephrine, not serotonin, regulates the activity of N-acetyl-transferase through a highly specific receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2035767053,"The morphology of active structural and putative ribosomal RNA genes was observed by electron microscopy after lysis of fragile Escherichia coli cells. Conclusions drawn are: most of the chromosome is not genetically active at any one instant; translation is completely coupled with transcription; the 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA cistrons occur in tandem, in regions which are widely spaced on the chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1598527427,"Abstract An aminopeptidase from Escherichia coli has been purified to homogeneity and crystallized. This peptidase is responsible for about 65% of the hydrolytic activity found in crude extracts toward the substrate methionylalanylserine. It resembles the so-called leucine aminopeptidase of hog kidney in several respects, including size, metal requirements, and peptide specificity. Evidence based on substrate specificity suggests that this E. coli peptidase is not involved in cleavage of N-terminal methionine from nascent protein chains."

https://openalex.org/W1531783828,"Abstract Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase has been purified 3550-fold from rat liver mitochondria, which computes to 14,000-fold based on whole liver as the starting material. The enzyme is essentially free of deoxyribonuclease, phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, deoxyguanosine triphosphatase, ribonuclease, nuclear DNA polymerase, and terminal nucleotidyltransferase activities. It is stable when stored at -125° or colder, but loses activity rapidly at higher temperatures and during incubation. All four deoxynucleoside triphosphates are required for activity, the pH optimum of the polymerization reaction is 8.0 to 9.0 in Tris buffer, and there is an absolute dependence on a divalent cation. Mn2+ partially substitutes for Mg2+, while Co2+ and Ca2+ are ineffective. Unlike most DNA polymerases, the enzyme is greatly stimulated by high ionic strength. The optimal salt concentration and degree of stimulation varies with the ion used; maximal activity is obtained at 0.15 m NaCl or KCl. The polymerase seems unable to synthesize polydeoxy-adenylate-thymidylate copolymer in the absence of primer, and cannot incorporate a ribonucleoside triphosphate into DNA in the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+. The enzyme possesses an absolute requirement for DNA which can be met by preparations from a variety of sources. The purified enzyme shows a preference for single stranded DNA; the degree of preference varies among DNA preparations and is markedly influenced by DNA concentration, salt concentration, and nuclease activity."
https://openalex.org/W2018394928,"The body temperature of many mammals is set at or around 37 degrees C. The mechanism for this set point appears to depend on a constant and inherent balance between sodium and calcium ions within the posterior hypothalamus. When this region is perfused in unanesthetized cats, an extracellular excess or a normal physiological concentration of sodium ions evokes a rise in body temperature if calcium is not in the perfusate. At the same site, an excess or normal concentration of calcium ions causes the temperature to fall when sodium is absent."
https://openalex.org/W1565697670,"Abstract Extracts of dichloromethotrexate-resistant Lactobacillis casei provide a rich source of stable thymidylate synthetase, showing 100 times the activity found in extracts of the sensitive strain. The enzyme was purified 17-fold from extracts of resistant cells. It has a molecular weight of 67,000 and is activated by 2-mercaptoethanol. The rate of the reaction as determined by loss of tritium from deoxyuridine monophosphate-5-3H was 84% of the rate observed spectrophotometrically. The enzyme from dichloromethotrexate-resistant L. casei differs from Escherichia coli thymidylate synthetase, in that it will utilize tetrahydrohomofolate as a cofactor in place of tetrahydrofolate. The Km values for tetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrohomofolate are 4.5 x 10-5 m and 7.2 x 10-6 m, respectively, showing that tetrahydrohomofolate is bound to the enzyme more tightly than tetrahydrofolate, although the Vmax obtained with tetrahydrohomofolate is only 6% of that obtained with tetrahydrofolate. The Ki of tetrahydrohomofolate of 4.6 x 10-6 m is close to the Km for that compound. 10-Methyltetrahydrofolate and 11-methyltetrahydrohomofolate were inactive as cofactors. They inhibited the reaction 50% at 4 x 10-6 m and 3 x 10-5 m, respectively. Tetrahydrohomopteroate was neither a substrate nor an inhibitor at 3 x 10-4 m. Methotrexate-resistant strains of L. casei also showed high levels of thymidylate synthetase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2038115521,"THE tryptophan tRNA of CAJ64, a UGA suppressing strain of Escherichia coli1, has an altered structure compared with that isolated from the wild type (CA244). A complete account of this work will be published elsewhere, but the sequence shown in Fig. 1 has two points of immediate interest. First, both the su+ and su− structures contain an adenosine at position 15 and a uridine at position 48. In most other tRNAs guanosine and cytosine, respectively, occupy homologous positions in the sequence. Another exception with adenosine and uridine in these positions has recently been found in a leucine tRNA of E. coli2. The three dimensional model proposed by Levitt3 has hydrogen bonds between the bases in these positions; these coordinate base changes are consistent with the structure and lend support to this feature of it."
https://openalex.org/W1584207025,"The enzymically inactive des-(121–124)-ribonuclease was prepared by limited peptic digestion of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease after the modification of the original method of Christian B. Anfinsen. The circular dichroism, at 210 to 300 mµ of des-(121–124)-ribonuclease, is similar to that of intact ribonuclease with the exception that lower negative circular dichroism around 220 mµ was observed with the former. When reduced des-(121–124)-ribonuclease was completely oxidized by air at a concentration of approximately 0.02 mg of protein per ml, the reoxidized des-(121–124)-ribonuclease was predominantly in the monomeric form. However, the circular dichroism at 210 to 300 mµ of the reoxidized des-(121–124)-ribonuclease was featureless and entirely different from the original pattern, indicating a disordered structure. Analysis by gel filtration of size distribution of cross-linked fragment complexes produced from the reduced-reoxidized des-(121–124)-ribonuclease by BrCN cleavage also indicated the randomly paired disulfide bonds. The results are interpreted to show that the removal of the 4 residues (-Asp-Ala-Ser-Val) from the carboxyl end of the amino acid sequence of reduced ribonuclease causes destruction of the information to form correct disulfide bonds upon oxidation. Thus, it is concluded that the native conformation of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease cannot be formed during biosynthesis until the polypeptide chain has been extended beyond residue 120. The results are consistent with the previously reported observations on an inactive disordered fragment of residues 1 to 126 obtained from staphylococcal nuclease (149 residues)."

https://openalex.org/W1652956792,"Although the corresponding data for 50S subunits are still being assembled, it is doubtful that these data will significantly alter the general features of ribosome structure that have emerged from analysis of the 30S subunits. One overwhelming characteristic of the ribosome is its apparent complexity, which is reflected both in the diversity of ribosomal components and in their dissymmetric arrangement. The absence of repeat-structures implies that the functions of the ribosome are dissymmetric; this should influence the choice of models for protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1512449069,"Abstract An improved procedure which permits large scale preparation of crystalline d-serine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.14) from Escherichia coli is described. The homogeneous holoenzyme has an extinction coefficient (E280 nm1%) of 10.5 in potassium phosphate, pH 6.5 to 7.8, a specific activity of 300, and contains a single peptide chain with a molecular weight near 45,500 as indicated by sedimentation equilibrium measurements of either native or reduced and carboxymethylated enzyme, acrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, quantitative determination of the NH2-terminal amino acid (methionine), and the results of tryptic peptide mapping. One combining site for pyridoxal-P is present per molecule as determined by direct analysis of the holoenzyme for pyridoxal-P, by spectrophotometric titration of the apoenzyme with pyridoxal-P, and by isolation of e-N-pyridoxyllysine from hydrolysates of the sodium borohydride-reduced holoenzyme. The enzyme contains 5 half-cystine residues and no disulfide linkages. Only one of the five sulfhydryl groups is titrated by 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) in the holoenzyme; in the apoenzyme three —SH groups are titrated by either p-chloromercuribenzoate or DTNB. These three groups react with DTNB at markedly different rates (0.54, 0.081, and 0.0033 min-1) under the conditions tested. Individually, none of the three —SH groups appears necessary for activity; however, reaction of two or more with DTNB inactivates the apoenzyme completely by preventing its reassociation with pyridoxal-P."

https://openalex.org/W2163063292,"Abstract A palmityl thioesterase II which is insensitive to inhibition by diisopropyl fluorophosphate has been purified 20-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli. This enzyme exhibits properties which distinguish it from the more substratespecific diisopropyl fluorophosphate-sensitive palmityl thioesterase I known also to be present in E. coli. The present palmityl thioesterase II has a general specificity for long chain fatty acyl thioesters of coenzyme A or acyl carrier protein. The enzyme will catalyze the hydrolysis of saturated, unsaturated, or β-hydroxy fatty acyl coenzyme A thioesters. Palmityl, palmitoleyl, and d(-)-β-hydroxymyristyl derivatives are the preferred substrates in each respective series of homologues and Vmax values are 0.53, 0.49, and 0.20 µmole per min per mg, respectively, for each CoA thioester."
https://openalex.org/W1612791613,"Abstract The heat-stable factor which was responsible for the release of tRNA from ribosomes has been identified as G factor. The release of tRNA specific for phenylalanine from 70 S ribosomes is inhibited by β,γ-methyleneguanosine triphosphate. The G factor-dependent release was not observed when the acceptor site was not occupied with tRNA or peptidyl-tRNA. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the release of tRNA specific for phenylalanine takes place as a consequence of translocation of tRNA because tRNA is pushed out of ribosomes during this process."
https://openalex.org/W1489974113,Abstract A site distinct from that for binding a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate is available on Escherichia coli DNA polymerase for binding a 3'-hydroxylribonucleotide. Strict specificity for nucleotides with both a 3'-hydroxyl group in the ribose configuration and a 5'-phosphate linkage suggest a relationship of this site to the one that binds the primer terminus of a DNA chain.
https://openalex.org/W1501623030,"Abstract d-Serine apodehydratase is much more labile to inactivation by oxidation and denaturation than the corresponding holoenzyme (EC 4.2.1.14). In the presence of dithiothreitol and acetylated serum albumin, which stabilize the apoenzyme at high dilutions, reversible dissociation of holoenzyme (20 nm) to pyridoxal-P and apoenzyme occurred over several hours; both resolution and reactivation with pyridoxal-P are slow processes. The rate of resolution is greatly increased by l-cysteine, and less so by d-cysteine. In phosphate buffer, l-cysteine reacts with free pyridoxal-P about 10 times faster than with d-serine holodehydratase. Inactivation (resolution) of the holoenzyme by l-cysteine proceeds at the same rate as do spectral changes at 325 nm and at 415 nm; it is much faster in imidazole-citrate than in phosphate buffer, and is faster at pH 7.8 than at pH 6.8. 2-Norpyridoxal-P, 2'-methylpyridoxal-P, 2'-hydroxypyridoxal-P, 6-methylpyridoxal-P, 2-nor-6-methylpyridoxal-P, and 5'-methylpyridoxal-P combine with d-serine apodehydratase to yield active analogue-holoenzymes of varied catalytic efficiencies. 2',2'-Dimethylpyridoxal-P, 2'-propylpyridoxal-P, pyridoxal 5'-methylphosphonate, pyridoxal 5'-(β-cyanoethylphosphate), and β-(2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-formylpyridine-5)-propionate combined with the apoenzyme, as shown by both spectral data and inhibition of reactivation by pyridoxal-P, but the complexes formed were catalytically inactive. N-Methylpyridoxal-P, 3-O-methylpyridoxal-P, and 5'-deoxypyridoxal neither activated nor inhibited, and failed to show spectral evidence of interaction with the apoenzyme. Thus a free phenolic group at position 3 and the unsubstituted heterocyclic nitrogen of pyridoxal-P contribute importantly to binding of this coenzyme; they may be required for catalytic activity as well. Alterations at positions 2 and 6 modify the affinity of the coenzyme analogues for the apoenzyme, but do not preclude their functioning in a catalytic capacity. All replacements of the 5'-phosphate group of pyridoxal-P led to analogues that were catalytically inert; however, since the geometry of binding may differ for such analogues, the result does not necessarily imply a catalytic role for the phosphate group. At high concentrations, pyridoxal-P inhibits d-serine holodehydratase, apparently by binding reversibly at a second site on the enzyme."

Phosphate has been shown to cause enzyme activation which may be due to a conformational change of the protein. Guanidine hydrochloride and sodium dodecyl sulfate have been shown to cause dissociation of the active enzyme into inactive subunits. By several methods the subunit molecular weight was found to be approximately 34,000. This and other data suggest that the subunits are similar and perhaps identical.

A double mutant of Escherichia coli strain W which lacks arginine-repressible acetylornithine δ-transaminase was used as the source of aminotransferase. In the assay used, optimal enzymatic activity occurs at pH 7.8, and requires the addition of pyridoxal 5-phosphate. The activity was measured in the reverse of the biosynthetic reaction and, under this condition, only α-N-acetyl-l-ornithine and α-ketoglutarate were found to serve as substrates. A number of divalent cations tested do not affect the activity of the enzyme, with the exception of Cu++ and Hg++, which are inhibitory. From amino acid analysis, the enzyme contains 5 half-cystine residues per molecule, and a partial specific volume of 0.734 has been calculated. The average molecular weight of acetylornithine δ-transaminase, based upon sedimentation equilibrium data, is 61,000, and an s020,w of 4.6 has been determined."

https://openalex.org/W2020675958,The writer criticizes the acceptance of Demulen as an oral contraceptive on the evidence presented by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and the granting of a new drug application (NDA) to G. D. Searle Company. The cited British study included 987 women of whom only 112 were treated with Demulen for 24 or more cycles. A later American study involved only 82 patients treated for 4 cycles. FDA guidelines require a minimum of 200-300 patients for demonstrating the efficacy of an oral contraceptive and required clinical tests must be conducted by a U.S. company and by qualified U.S. investigators. The results of laboratory studies were not given in the British data. Demul en contains 1 mg ethynodiol diacetate and 50 mg ethinyl estradiol. Data from Ovulen containing mestranol were used to indicate presumed effectiveness of Demulen. Ethinyl estradiol a principal metabolite of mestranol is almost twice as effective; therefore half the dose was presumed to be adequate. The Searle advertising was criticised as misleading by suggesting that Demulen contains only half the estrogen content of other oral contraceptives. Therefore the reviewing medical specialists were unable to approve Demulen and the NDA was sent to the Director of the Bureau of Drugs.
