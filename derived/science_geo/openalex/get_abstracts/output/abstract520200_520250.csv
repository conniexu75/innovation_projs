https://openalex.org/W1975032719,"An increasingly powerful approach for studying brain circuits relies on targeting genetically encoded sensors and effectors to specific cell types. However, current approaches for this are still limited in functionality and specificity. Here we utilize several intersectional strategies to generate multiple transgenic mouse lines expressing high levels of novel genetic tools with high specificity. We developed driver and double reporter mouse lines and viral vectors using the Cre/Flp and Cre/Dre double recombinase systems and established a new, retargetable genomic locus, TIGRE, which allowed the generation of a large set of Cre/tTA-dependent reporter lines expressing fluorescent proteins, genetically encoded calcium, voltage, or glutamate indicators, and optogenetic effectors, all at substantially higher levels than before. High functionality was shown in example mouse lines for GCaMP6, YCX2.60, VSFP Butterfly 1.2, and Jaws. These novel transgenic lines greatly expand the ability to monitor and manipulate neuronal activities with increased specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2024024756,"Presenilins play essential roles in memory formation, synaptic function, and neuronal survival. Mutations in the Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene are the major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). How PSEN1 mutations cause FAD is unclear, and pathogenic mechanisms based on gain or loss of function have been proposed. Here, we generated Psen1 knockin (KI) mice carrying the FAD mutation L435F or C410Y. Remarkably, KI mice homozygous for either mutation recapitulate the phenotypes of Psen1(-/-) mice. Neither mutation altered Psen1 mRNA expression, but both abolished γ-secretase activity. Heterozygosity for the KI mutation decreased production of Aβ40 and Aβ42, increased the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, and exacerbated Aβ deposition. Furthermore, the L435F mutation impairs hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory and causes age-dependent neurodegeneration in the aging cerebral cortex. Collectively, our findings reveal that FAD mutations can cause complete loss of Presenilin-1 function in vivo, suggesting that clinical PSEN mutations produce FAD through a loss-of-function mechanism."

Here, we report that mice with a Bmal1 deletion specific to arginine vasopressin (AVP)-producing neurons showed marked lengthening in the free-running period and activity time of behavior rhythms. When exposed to an abrupt 8-hr advance of the light/dark cycle, these mice reentrained faster than control mice did. In these mice, the circadian expression of genes involved in intercellular communications, including Avp, Prokineticin 2, and Rgs16, was drastically reduced in the dorsal SCN, where AVP neurons predominate. In slices, dorsal SCN cells showed attenuated PER2::LUC oscillation with highly variable and lengthened periods. Thus, Bmal1-dependent oscillators of AVP neurons may modulate the coupling of the SCN network, eventually coupling morning and evening behavioral rhythms, by regulating expression of multiple factors important for the network property of these neurons.

Thus, Bmal1-dependent oscillators of AVP neurons may modulate the coupling of the SCN network, eventually coupling morning and evening behavioral rhythms, by regulating expression of multiple factors important for the network property of these neurons. The circadian oscillator in the SCN of the hypothalamus is the central pacemaker in mammals, orchestrating multiple circadian biological rhythms in the organism (Reppert and Weaver, 2002Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Coordination of circadian timing in mammals.Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). The SCN contains ∼20,000 neurons most of which have ability to generate autonomous circadian oscillations. Individual cellular oscillators are driven by autoregulatory transcriptional/post-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) of clock genes in cooperation with cytosolic signaling molecules, such as cAMP and Ca2+ (Welsh et al., 2010Welsh D.K. Takahashi J.S. Kay S.A. Suprachiasmatic nucleus: cell autonomy and network properties.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, these intracellular processes are not unique to SCN neurons and are common to peripheral cells (Balsalobre et al., 1998Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. A serum shock induces circadian gene expression in mammalian tissue culture cells.Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Rather, intercellular communications among SCN clock neurons through the neuronal and diffusible network differentiate the SCN from the peripheral tissues so that it generates highly robust and coherent oscillations at the population level, and these oscillations are strikingly resistant to genetic and environmental perturbations (Welsh et al., 2010Welsh D.K. Takahashi J.S. Kay S.A. Suprachiasmatic nucleus: cell autonomy and network properties.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The SCN is a heterogeneous structure consisting of multiple types of neurons (Antle and Silver, 2005Antle M.C. Silver R. Orchestrating time: arrangements of the brain circadian clock.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 145-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Most SCN neurons are GABAergic, and several populations of these GABAergic neurons also simultaneously contain neuropeptides. These include AVP-producing neurons located predominantly in the dorsomedial part or the shell of the SCN, as well as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-producing neurons and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-producing neurons in the ventrolateral part or the core of the SCN. VIP has been demonstrated to be especially important for the maintenance and synchronization of cellular clocks in individual SCN neurons (Aton et al., 2005Aton S.J. Colwell C.S. Harmar A.J.

However, other factors, such as GABA, GRP, and AVP, may also play additional roles in the coupling of SCN neurons (Aida et al., 2002Aida R. Moriya T. Araki M. Akiyama M. Wada K. Wada E. Shibata S.

Rhythmic Per expression in constant conditions is most prominent in the dorsal SCN, mostly overlapping with the area containing AVP neurons (Hamada et al., 2004Hamada T. Antle M.C. Silver R. Temporal and spatial expression patterns of canonical clock genes and clock-controlled genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 1741-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, the core region contains retinorecipient neurons responding immediately to the photic stimuli and communicating this information to the dorsal SCN (Shigeyoshi et al., 1997Shigeyoshi Y. Taguchi K. Yamamoto S. Takekida S. Yan L. Tei H. Moriya T. Shibata S. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Okamura H.

Romero M.T. Besmer H.R. Leak R. Nunez J.M. LeSauter J. Calbindin-D28K cells in the hamster SCN express light-induced Fos.Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1224-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The SCN core and shell regions send distinct efferent projections to their target areas, primarily in the medial areas of hypothalamus and thalamus (Leak and Moore, 2001Leak R.K. Moore R.Y. Topographic organization of suprachiasmatic nucleus projection neurons.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 433: 312-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We considered that neuron type-specific genetic manipulations within the SCN would provide crucial information for understanding the principles underlying the SCN network. In particular, it remains unknown whether a particular class of neurons functions as the pacemaker to entrain the entire SCN. A study using fully isolated SCN neurons found no evidence for a specialized or anatomically localized class of cell-autonomous pacemakers (Webb et al., 2009Webb A.B. Angelo N. Huettner J.E. Herzog E.D. Intrinsic, nondeterministic circadian rhythm generation in identified mammalian neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 16493-16498Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to take the alternative approach of disrupting cellular oscillators in a neuron type-specific manner and examine the effects on the circadian rhythms of behavior and Per expression in the SCN. In this study, we generated mice in which Bmal1 was deleted specifically in AVP neurons and analyzed circadian rhythms in behavior as well as in SCN cells and tissues. BMAL1 is one of the essential transcription factors of the TTFL, and its absence from all SCN neurons has been considered to be sufficient for the extinction of circadian behavioral rhythms in mice (Bunger et al., 2000Bunger M.K. Wilsbacher L.D. Moran S.M. Clendenin C. Radcliffe L.A. Hogenesch J.B. Simon M.C. Takahashi J.S. Bradfield C.A. Mop3 is an essential component of the master circadian pacemaker in mammals.Cell. 2000; 103: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Since AVP-deficient Brattleboro rats display attenuated circadian rhythms, but little abnormality in circadian pacemaking, AVP has been considered to serve as an SCN output (Kalsbeek et al., 2010Kalsbeek A. Fliers E. Hofman M.A. Swaab D.F. Buijs R.M. Vasopressin and the output of the hypothalamic biological clock.J. Neuroendocrinol. 2010; 22: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, cellular oscillators in AVP neurons may be required for high-amplitude circadian output of the SCN. In addition, recent studies have implicated AVP in the coupling of SCN neurons (Li et al., 2009Li J.D. Burton K.J. Zhang C. Hu S.B. Zhou Q.Y. Vasopressin receptor V1a regulates circadian rhythms of locomotor activity and expression of clock-controlled genes in the suprachiasmatic nuclei.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp.

Zhang J. et al.Mice genetically deficient in vasopressin V1a and V1b receptors are resistant to jet lag.Science. 2013; 342: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Moreover, AVP neurons contain not only AVP, but also other neurotransmitters, such as GABA and prokineticin 2 (Prok2) (Antle and Silver, 2005Antle M.C. Silver R. Orchestrating time: arrangements of the brain circadian clock.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 145-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, Masumoto et al., 2006Masumoto K.H.

J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 2959-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Multiple transmitters in one neuronal type play differential roles in the neuronal transmission, as exemplified by orexigenic AgRP neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Krashes et al., 2013Krashes M.J. Shah B.P. Koda S. Lowell B.B.

Therefore, we considered it to be important to examine the role of neurons marked by AVP expression in the function of the SCN network. To achieve genetic manipulations specifically in AVP neurons, we generated a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse that expressed codon-improved Cre recombinase (Shimshek et al., 2002Shimshek D.R. Kim J. Hübner M.R. Spergel D.J. Buchholz F. Casanova E. Stewart A.F. Seeburg P.H. Sprengel R. Codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre) expression in the mouse.Genesis. 2002; 32: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) under the transcriptional control of Avp promoter (Avp-Cre mice). To localize Cre activity, Avp-Cre mice were crossed with Rosa26-tdTomato reporter mice (Ai14 mice), which express tdTomato after Cre-mediated deletion of a loxP-flanked transcriptional blocker (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3846) Google Scholar). In these mice, tdTomato expression was mostly restricted in the SCN, supraoptic nucleus (SON), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVH) of the hypothalamus, where many AVP neurons are located (Figures 1 and S1) (Hallbeck et al., 1999Hallbeck M. Hermanson O. Blomqvist A. Distribution of preprovasopressin mRNA in the rat central nervous system.J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 411: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Prominent tdTomato expression was also observed in a significant number of thalamic reticular neurons, where a previous study reported weak Avp expression in adult mice, and another study suggested its expression in mouse embryos (Visel et al., 2007Visel A. Carson J. Oldekamp J. Warnecke M. Jakubcakova V. Zhou X. Shaw C.A. Alvarez-Bolado G. Eichele G. Regulatory pathway analysis by high-throughput in situ hybridization.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: 1867-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Yamaguchi et al., 2013Yamaguchi Y. Suzuki T. Mizoro Y. Kori H. Okada K. Chen Y. Fustin J.M. Yamazaki F. Mizuguchi N. Zhang J. et al.Mice genetically deficient in vasopressin V1a and V1b receptors are resistant to jet lag.Science. 2013; 342: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition to these sites, tdTomato expression was detected in some cells scattered in several brain areas, including granule cells of the dentate gyrus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the inferior colliculus (Figure S1, also see legend). Most of this scattered expression was likely to reflect weak expression of Avp in the adult and/or developmental expression (Hallbeck et al., 1999Hallbeck M. Hermanson O. Blomqvist A. Distribution of preprovasopressin mRNA in the rat central nervous system.J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 411: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Visel et al., 2007Visel A. Carson J. Oldekamp J. Warnecke M. Jakubcakova V. Zhou X. Shaw C.A. Alvarez-Bolado G. Eichele G. Regulatory pathway analysis by high-throughput in situ hybridization.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: 1867-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These data suggested that Cre expression in Avp-Cre mice mostly reflects endogenous Avp expression with possible ectopic expression in a limited number of cells. Within the SCN, tdTomato expression was almost completely colocalized with AVP immunoreactivity (99.3% of AVP+ cells were also tdTomato+, 100% of tdTomato+ cells were also AVP+; counts of two SCN slices each from two mice), and there was almost no overlap with VIP immunoreactivity (0.5% of VIP+ cells were also tdTomato+, 0.07% of tdTomato+ cells were also VIP+) (Figure 1A). Thus, Cre-mediated recombination occurred specifically in AVP neurons within the SCN, confirming that Avp-Cre mouse is a useful tool for AVP-neuron-specific genetic manipulations to reveal their roles in the central circadian pacemaker of the SCN. To understand the roles of cellular clocks intrinsic to AVP neurons of the SCN, we next generated mice lacking Bmal1 specifically in AVP neurons by crossing Avp-Cre mice with mice with floxed Bmal1 alleles (Bmal1fl/fl) (Storch et al., 2007Storch K.F. Paz C. Signorovitch J. Raviola E. Pawlyk B. Li T. Weitz C.J. Intrinsic circadian clock of the mammalian retina: importance for retinal processing of visual information.Cell. 2007; 130: 730-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), hereafter designated Avp-Bmal1−/− mice. To quantify the efficiency and specificity of Bmal1 deletion, Avp-Bmal1−/− mice were further crossed to Rosa26-tdTomato reporter mice to label AVP neurons with red fluorescent tdTomato. In the SCN of Avp-Bmal1−/−;Rosa26-tdTomato mice, the number of tdTomato+;BMAL1+ neurons labeled with anti-BMAL1 immunofluorescence was drastically reduced compared with that in control Avp-Cre;Bmal1wt/fl;Rosa26-tdTomato mice (23.0% ± 3.6% and 90.2% ± 2.6% of tdTomato+ cells, respectively, were also BMAL1+, n = 3, p < 0.001) (Figure 1B). In contrast, the number of tdTomato−;BMAL1+ cells was not significantly different between the two genotypes (478 ± 74 versus 602 ± 79 cells/slice, n = 3, p = 0.316). Thus, Bmal1 was deleted efficiently and specifically from AVP neurons in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice. Importantly, the number of tdTomato+ cells did not differ between the two genotypes (690 ± 19 versus 754 ± 22 cells/slice, n = 3, p = 0.090), suggesting that AVP neurons remained alive in the absence of BMAL1 expression. We next measured the circadian rhythm of spontaneous locomotor activity in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice. The behavior of these mice was significantly different from that of control mice (Bmal1fl/fl and Avp-Cre;Bmal1wt/fl mice; these two behaved similarly, suggesting that Cre expression per se did not cause overt abnormality) in 12 hr of light and 12 hr of darkness (LD12:12) (Figures 2A and 2B; Table S1). Nocturnal activities of both groups were bimodal, showing the onset and offset components of activity (or the evening [E] and morning [M] components). The daily activity profile showed that the activity onset was earlier and the activity time was longer in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice compared to control mice (Activity onset, ZT11.24 ± 0.12 versus ZT11.87 ± 0.05, p < 0.001; activity time, 14.16 hr ± 0.31 hr versus 12.94 hr ± 0.22 hr, p = 0.006), resulting in a more profound drop in the activity level at the middle of the dark phase (Figure 2B). The activity count in the dark phase was significantly reduced in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice compared to control mice (13,404 ± 1,292 versus 17,536 ± 1,352 counts, p = 0.044), while daily total activity counts did not differ significantly (18,778 ± 1,457 versus 21,410 ± 1,479 counts, p = 0.226). In constant darkness (DD), Avp-Bmal1−/− mice showed an activity pattern drastically different from that of control mice (Figures 2A and 2B; Table S1). When released into DD, the activity onset component typically free-ran with shorter periods than the offset component, resulting in a gradual increase of the activity band (Avp-Bmal1−/− mice: free-running period of the activity onset, 24.01 hr ± 0.02 hr; activity offset, 24.59 hr ± 0.08 hr; control mice: activity onset, 23.90 hr ± 0.04 hr; activity offset, 24.02 hr ± 0.03 hr; calculated for days 1–7 in DD). After ca. 2 weeks in DD, the activity onset and offset of the behavior rhythm developed into free-running in parallel, with an identical period approximately 50 min longer than that of control mice (24.80 hr ± 0.11 hr versus 23.94 hr ± 0.03 hr, p < 0.001, days 15–29 in DD). Meanwhile, the activity time reached a steady-state length approximately 5 hr longer than that in controls (19.52 hr ± 0.47 hr versus 14.29 hr ± 0.24 hr, p < 0.001, days 15–29 in DD). In some Avp-Bmal1−/− mice, the activity onset gradually became obscure (Figure 2A, middle panel). In addition, the free-running period and activity time fluctuated under prolonged DD in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice (Figures 2A and S2). Their phenotype was reminiscent of so-called splitting (Pittendrigh and Daan, 1976Pittendrigh C.S. Daan S.A. A functional analysis of circadian pacemakers in nocturnal rodents.J. Comp. Physiol. 1976; 106: 333-355Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Total daily activity and activity during the activity time were not significantly different between the two groups. In extreme cases, Avp-Bmal1−/− mice showed multiple free-running periods and apparent transient arrhythmicity, which was often followed by rhythmic behavior with a lengthened free-running period (observed in 3 out of 21 Avp-Bmal1−/− mice crossed to Per2::Luc reporter mice, see below) (Figure S2). These results indicate that the cellular circadian oscillation persists, but the mutual coupling between clock neurons regulating E and M components of activity may be severely impaired in the SCN of Avp-Bmal1−/− mice. Since Avp is expressed in several brain regions outside the SCN, as well as in a few peripheral organs during development (Hallbeck et al., 1999Hallbeck M. Hermanson O. Blomqvist A. Distribution of preprovasopressin mRNA in the rat central nervous system.J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 411: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Visel et al., 2007Visel A. Carson J. Oldekamp J. Warnecke M. Jakubcakova V. Zhou X. Shaw C.A. Alvarez-Bolado G. Eichele G. Regulatory pathway analysis by high-throughput in situ hybridization.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: 1867-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it is possible that Bmal1 deletion in the tissues other than the SCN was responsible for the circadian phenotype of Avp-Bmal1−/− mice. Furthermore, abnormal circadian rhythm of Avp-Bmal1−/− mice could stem secondarily from altered anatomical structure of the SCN network due to the absence of BMAL1 in AVP neurons during development. To address these, we performed restoration experiments. Elongations of the free-running period and the activity time in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice were reversed almost completely when Bmal1 expression was restored in AVP neurons of the SCN using a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, with some off-target restoration (free-running period, 23.84 hr ± 0.12 hr; activity time, 15.48 hr ± 0.43 hr) (Figure S2B). This result rules out the peripheral tissues and the developmental defects of the neuronal connectivity of the SCN network as the cause of altered circadian behavior in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice. It also suggests that the lack of BMAL1 in AVP neurons of the SCN accounts for the phenotype of Avp-Bmal1−/− mice, given the well-established role of the SCN as the circadian pacemaker. The sleep/wakefulness cycle of Avp-Bmal1−/− mice was almost parallel to their locomotor activity pattern (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2C). In LD12:12, Avp-Bmal1−/− mice showed a more profound drop of wakefulness at the middle of the dark phase compared with control mice. Time spent in wakefulness during the dark phase was significantly shorter in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice (6.79 hr ± 0.05 hr versus 7.89 hr ± 0.46 hr, p = 0.032), whereas total daily wakefulness time did not differ significantly compared with control mice (11.00 hr ± 0.11 hr versus 12.16 hr ± 0.71 hr, p = 0.105). As for sleep/wakefulness in DD, we analyzed EEG/EMG data on days 8–10 in DD, when the activity onset had not substantially deviated from the ZT12 of the preceding LD12:12 in most Avp-Bmal1−/− mice (Figure 2A), because it was difficult to precisely determine the onset of the activity time based on EEG/EMG data in mice free-running in DD. The activity time was 4–5 hr longer in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice. In addition, the onset of activity time was delayed for approximately an hour in these mice, likely reflecting the lengthening of the free-running period (Figure 2C, right panel). Total daily amounts of wakefulness were not significantly different between the two groups (11.78 hr ± 0.48 hr versus 11.78 hr ± 0.64 hr, p = 0.989). Hourly distributions of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were essentially mirrored by those of wakefulness and paralleled those of REM sleep (Figure S2C). These data suggest that circadian sleep/wakefulness rhythm is altered, while homeostatic regulation of sleep/wakefulness remains unchanged, in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice. The SCN is composed of thousands of clock neurons, and the phase distribution of these oscillating neurons has been considered to carry information on day length for adaption to seasonal changes (Hazlerigg et al., 2005Hazlerigg D.G.

Therefore, the lengthening of the activity time in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice may indicate an impairment of the internal synchronization among SCN neurons in these mice. Thus, we next examined whether these mice can entrain to a long-day, 18 hr light/6 hr dark condition (LD18:6), in which the activity time would be compressed. In LD18:6, Avp-Bmal1−/− mice readily shifted their activity onset to the onset of the dark phase, but the activity offset was significantly phase-delayed in these mice compared to control mice (Time of day, 11.71 hr ± 0.60 hr versus 10.28 hr ± 0.12 hr, p = 0.049), resulting in an elongation of the activity time (12.19 hr ± 0.54 hr versus 10.49 hr ± 0.19 hr, p = 0.019) (Figures 3A and 3B). Intriguingly, when subsequently released into DD from the LD18:6 condition, they exhibited transient arrhythmicity for approximately 1 week, then free-ran with a lengthened period (Figures 3A and 3C). Thus, without the cellular circadian oscillators in AVP neurons, coupling of SCN clock neurons might be unstable in the LD18:6 condition, and this manifested in the removal of zeitgeber when released into DD. To further elucidate the state of internal coupling among SCN neurons, we examined the behavior of Avp-Bmal1−/− mice during the sudden shifts of an LD cycle. Upon a 4 hr phase shift of the LD cycle, both Avp-Bmal1−/− mice and control mice demonstrated a gradual shift of locomotor activity rhythms to reentrain to the new LD cycle (Figure 4A). Nevertheless, the number of days required for full reentrainment was significantly shorter in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice compared to control mice when LD cycle was advanced by 4 hr (5.86 days ± 0.13 days versus 6.88 days ± 0.40 days, p = 0.031) (Figure 4B). In contrast, upon an 8 hr phase advance, Avp-Bmal1−/− mice did not show the gradual shift of locomotor activity during the reentrainment demonstrated by control mice; the onset and offset components of activity shifted in parallel (Figure 4C). Instead, these components did not show coordinated shifting during the reentrainment period and were segregated in multiple components with different periods. Indeed, periodogram analysis demonstrated that the peak of the periods within the circadian range was drastically attenuated to nearly non-significant levels during the reentrainment in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice (Figure 4E). Subsequently, these mice were entrained to the new LD cycle in about a week. The number of days required for reentrainment was significantly fewer in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice compared to control mice for 8-hr phase shifts of both advance and delay (phase advance: 8.50 days ± 0.73 days versus 13.71 days ± 1.36 days, p = 0.004; phase delay: 4.50 days ± 0.29 days versus 6.67 days ± 0.67 days, p = 0.021) (Figure 4D). These results are consistent with the idea that interneuronal coupling among SCN neurons is weakened in Avp-Bmal1−/− mice. We next examined the light-responsiveness of Avp-Bmal1−/− mice by measuring the phase shift of activity rhythms evoked by light pulses. Because Avp-Bmal1−/− mice often showed ambiguous onset of activity in DD (Figures 2A and S2), we applied the Aschoff Type II method to examine phase responses of behavior rhythms (Aschoff, 1965Aschoff, J. (1965). Response curves in circadian periodicity. In Circadian Clocks, J. Aschoff, ed. (Amsterdam), pp. 95–111.Google Scholar), by applying a 30-min"
https://openalex.org/W1975980016,"Peri-infarct depolarizations (PIDs) are seemingly spontaneous spreading depression-like waves that negatively impact tissue outcome in both experimental and human stroke. Factors triggering PIDs are unknown. Here, we show that somatosensory activation of peri-infarct cortex triggers PIDs when the activated cortex is within a critical range of ischemia. We show that the mechanism involves increased oxygen utilization within the activated cortex, worsening the supply-demand mismatch. We support the concept by clinical data showing that mismatch predisposes stroke patients to PIDs as well. Conversely, transient worsening of mismatch by episodic hypoxemia or hypotension also reproducibly triggers PIDs. Therefore, PIDs are triggered upon supply-demand mismatch transients in metastable peri-infarct hot zones due to increased demand or reduced supply. Based on the data, we propose that minimizing sensory stimulation and hypoxic or hypotensive transients in stroke and brain injury would reduce PID incidence and their adverse impact on outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1979662292,"Circadian behavior in mammals is orchestrated by neurons within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), yet the neuronal population necessary for the generation of timekeeping remains unknown. We show that a subset of SCN neurons expressing the neuropeptide neuromedin S (NMS) plays an essential role in the generation of daily rhythms in behavior. We demonstrate that lengthening period within Nms neurons is sufficient to lengthen period of the SCN and behavioral circadian rhythms. Conversely, mice without a functional molecular clock within Nms neurons lack synchronous molecular oscillations and coherent behavioral daily rhythms. Interestingly, we found that mice lacking Nms and its closely related paralog, Nmu, do not lose in vivo circadian rhythms. However, blocking vesicular transmission from Nms neurons with intact cell-autonomous clocks disrupts the timing mechanisms of the SCN, revealing that Nms neurons define a subpopulation of pacemakers that control SCN network synchrony and in vivo circadian rhythms through intercellular synaptic transmission."

These findings demonstrate that transplantation of mouse ESC-derived neurons of appropriate cortical areal identity can contribute to the reconstruction of an adult damaged cortical circuit. Many neurological diseases strike the cerebral cortex, including stroke, epilepsy, and neurodegeneration. Despite its well-known plasticity, the adult cortex displays a poor ability to self-repair, whether by generating new cells or long-range connections (Gates et al., 2000Gates M.A. Fricker-Gates R.A. Macklis J.D. Reconstruction of cortical circuitry.Prog. Brain Res. 2000; 127: 115-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two main strategies have been proposed to induce or facilitate neural repair following cortical lesions: cell transplantation and recruitment or reprogramming of endogenous neural precursors (Arlotta and Berninger, 2014Arlotta P.

Grafting in neonatal cortex has proved to be very efficient and has been widely used as a tool to study the mechanisms of specification of cortical neurons (Gaillard et al., 1998aGaillard A.

As for grafting in the adult brain, initial attempts only documented a very limited axon outgrowth ability of grafted neurons (Guitet et al., 1994Guitet J. Garnier C. Ebrahimi-Gaillard A. Roger M.

However, studies using more sensitive and specific tools to lesion the cortex and to trace the projections of the grafted cells have reported that grafted embryonic cortex neurons could display specific patterns of long-range projections, at least in some conditions (Fricker-Gates et al., 2002Fricker-Gates R.A.

Most strikingly, it was reported that grafted embryonic cortex neurons could effectively reestablish specific patterns of subcortical projections and synapses following cortical lesions (Gaillard et al., 2004Gaillard F.

While these studies open the possibility of cell transplantation for cortical repair, the very limited accessibility of human fetal cortical tissue constitutes a serious limitation to consider such approaches in a clinical setting. Given their greater accessibility and standard use, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold great promise as a reliable source for cell replacement therapies (Aboody et al., 2011Aboody K.

Most of these studies have stressed the importance of the use of differentiated cells of desired regional identity, such as midbrain dopaminergic neurons for Parkinson disease, for instance.

Using a chemically defined culture condition devoid of any added morphogen, we found that mouse ESCs spontaneously differentiate into cortical progenitors that further differentiate into pyramidal neuron subtypes corresponding to all six cortical layers. Notably, following grafting into mouse neonatal cortex, ESC-derived cortical neurons send projections that are strikingly similar to native cortical neurons, with a predominantly occipital (visual and limbic) areal identity (Gaspard et al., 2008Gaspard N.

Gaillard A. Vanderhaeghen P. Making cortex in a dish: in vitro corticopoiesis from embryonic stem cells.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 2491-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the capacity of mouse ESC-derived pyramidal neurons of specific areal identity to contribute to the repair of cortical lesions in adult mice. ESCs were differentiated into cortical neurons and progenitors of occipital identity and then grafted into lesioned adult mouse visual cortex. Grafted neurons established robust and specific long-range projections and synapses corresponding to visual circuits. Grafted neurons also received significant input from the visual thalamus and responded appropriately to visual stimuli in vivo, thus revealing their potential for functional restoration of cortex circuitry. Notably, grafting of the same neurons into the lesioned motor cortex, or of embryonic motor cortex neurons into the lesioned visual cortex, did not lead to similar reestablishment, indicating that it required a match in the areal identity of grafted neurons and lesioned cortex. These findings reveal areal specificity in the repair of the lesioned cerebral cortex following transplantation of ESC-derived pyramidal neurons and provide new insights for the future design of cell therapy enabling to rebuild cortical circuits in a highly specific way. In order to test the potential of ESC-derived cortical neurons for cortical repair, we used a well-established model of focal neurotoxic lesions of the cerebral cortex (Schwarcz et al., 1979Schwarcz R. Hökfelt T. Fuxe K. Jonsson G. Goldstein M. Terenius L. Ibotenic acid-induced neuronal degeneration: a morphological and neurochemical study.Exp. Brain Res. 1979; 37: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) in adult mice, resulting in major neuronal and innervation loss (Figures S1A–S1D), focusing on the visual cortex. Mouse ESCs were first differentiated in vitro for 14 days following an intrinsic pathway of corticogenesis using a chemically defined medium containing cyclopamine (Gaspard et al., 2008Gaspard N.

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In these conditions, ESCs differentiated robustly into pyramidal neurons of all layer identities, but with mostly visual and limbic areal identities corresponding to occipital cortex, both at the level of gene expression in vitro (Figures S1E and S1G), and patterns of axonal projections following grafting into neonatal cortex (Gaspard et al., 2008Gaspard N. Bouschet T. Hourez R. Dimidschstein J. Naeije G. van den Ameele J. Espuny-Camacho I. Herpoel A. Passante L. Schiffmann S.N. et al.An intrinsic mechanism of corticogenesis from embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2008; 455: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In order to track the identity and axonal projections of the grafted cells, we used a tau-GFP knockin ESC line where GFP is expressed under the control of the neuronal tau promoter (Gaspard et al., 2008Gaspard N. Bouschet T. Hourez R. Dimidschstein J. Naeije G. van den Ameele J. Espuny-Camacho I. Herpoel A. Passante L. Schiffmann S.N. et al.An intrinsic mechanism of corticogenesis from embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2008; 455: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The ESC-derived cortical cells were grafted 3 days after the lesion in the same cortical site, and the identity and projections of the grafts were then monitored up to 12 months following grafting. Analysis of the animals grafted with ESC-derived cortical neurons indicated that 67% of them (n = 47/70) contained a graft after 1 month; 70% (n = 21/30), after 3–4 months; and 61% (n = 8/13), after 12 months. The grafts were typically located in the cortex or in the underlying white matter and did not display any obvious cytoarchitecture (Figures 1A–1E). They consisted essentially of differentiated neurons (as assessed by expression of tau-GFP and microtubule-associated protein 2 [MAP2]), expressing markers of cortical pyramidal identity of distinct layers, and a minority of GABA-ergic neurons, similar to those observed following neonatal grafting (Gaspard et al., 2008Gaspard N. Bouschet T. Hourez R. Dimidschstein J. Naeije G. van den Ameele J. Espuny-Camacho I. Herpoel A. Passante L.

Notably, most ESC-derived neurons also expressed the occipital cortex marker COUP-TFI (Figure S1F). The transplant also contained glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes and IBA1-positive activated microglial cells, which were particularly abundant at the transplant-host border (Figures S1L–S1Q). Host-transplant cell fusion was previously reported between ESC-derived cells and host neurons (Cusulin et al., 2012Cusulin C. Monni E. Ahlenius H. Wood J. Brune J.C. Lindvall O. Kokaia Z. Embryonic stem cell-derived neural stem cells fuse with microglia and mature neurons.Stem Cells. 2012; 30: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Ying et al., 2002Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Evans E.P. Smith A.G. Changing potency by spontaneous fusion.Nature. 2002; 416: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar), while it was not observed with cells of embryonic cortex origin (Gaillard et al., 2007Gaillard A. Prestoz L. Dumartin B. Cantereau A. Morel F. Roger M. Jaber M. Reestablishment of damaged adult motor pathways by grafted embryonic cortical neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1294-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In order to test whether cell fusion occurred in our experimental setting, tau-GFP ESC-derived cortical cells were differentiated and transplanted similarly but in transgenic mice expressing the tdTOMATO reporter ubiquitously (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3877) Google Scholar) (n = 8). Systematic inspection of the transplant and its borders with the host failed to reveal any double-labeled cells (Figures S2A–S2I), indicating that cell fusion appears to be absent or negligible in our experimental setting. Notably, the majority of the MAP2-positive neurons were GFP positive and tdTOMATO negative (98.6%; 157.1 ± 53), while only 1.39% (2.1 ± 0.56) of MAP2-positive neurons were tdTOMATO positive and GFP negative (n = 2,119 neurons counted in four transplanted animals; 529.7 ± 176.3 is the average of neurons counted per animal ± SEM). In addition, this approach revealed host-derived cells within the transplant, corresponding mostly to blood vessels and microglia, while most of the astrocytes and neurons found in the transplant were of ESC origin (Figures S2J–S2U). In a few cases (6/47), the graft also contained a large amount of non-neural cells (negative for nestin or GFP, with morphology reminiscent of fibroblast-like cells), which might reflect teratoma formation from remaining undifferentiated ESCs (data not shown). In these cases, very few axonal projections were observed to subcortical targets. This clearly differs from what we observed following grafting in parallel of the same differentiated cells into neonatal brain, where the grafts showed signs of teratoma-like formation in much lower frequency (Gaspard et al., 2008Gaspard N. Bouschet T. Hourez R. Dimidschstein J. Naeije G. van den Ameele J. Espuny-Camacho I. Herpoel A. Passante L.

Inspection of the brains containing a graft 1 month after grafting revealed, in 40% of the cases (n = 17/47), far-reaching graft-derived GFP+ axonal growth, following specific paths (corpus callosum, internal and external capsule, cerebral peduncles) and reaching specific targets of endogenous cortical neurons that would correspond to all layer identities, including ipsi- and contralateral (CL) cortex (layers II/III/V) and subcortical structures such as the striatum (layer V), thalamus (layer VI), and midbrain/hindbrain nuclei (layer V). These data indicate that ESC-derived neurons can integrate successfully into the lesioned adult cortex and can send long-range axons in a pattern similar to that of endogenous cortical neurons. In order to gain insight into the developmental course of axonal projections, we performed a time-course analysis, from 4 to 90 days following transplantation (Figure 2; Figure 3). This revealed a progressive neuronal differentiation (Figures 2A–2C) and axonal outgrowth (Figures 2D–2P and 3) until 1 month post-transplantation. At 4 days following transplantation, only a few GFP+ axons could be detected, all in the close vicinity of the transplant (none further than 250 μm) (Figure 2D). At 8 days post-transplantation, GFP-positive axonal fibers extended further to the external and internal capsule, as well as the corpus callosum (Figure 2). Single fibers entered the thalamus through the reticular nucleus, while no fibers could be detected in the rest of the thalamus or other subcortical targets. At 16 days post-transplantation, axonal growth had become more profuse and reached thalamic and midbrain nuclei (Figure 2), but the level of axonal density was much lower than what was observed after 1 month (Figure 3). In addition, at early stages (before 1 month), GFP-positive axonal tips displayed the morphology of typical growth cones and expressed the DCX marker of immature neurons (Figures 2G, 2K, 2Q, and 2R). After 3–4 and 12 months, the distribution of fibers remained similar to that after 1 month (Figures 1 and 3). For most subsequent analyses, the brains were analyzed 1 and 3 months after grafting.Figure 3ESC-Derived Cortical Neurons Send Projections Preferentially to Targets of the Visual Cortex, 1 Month after GraftingShow full caption(A–I) Distribution of graft-derived GFP+ fibers in (A and B) CL cortex, (C and D) ipsilateral striatum, or (E–I) thalamic nuclei, following grafting in the visual cortex, detected by GFP immunofluorescence in (A)–(D) or immunohistochemistry in (E)–(H).

Next, we examined in more detail the specificity of the axonal projections from the grafted neurons 1 month after transplantation (Figure 3). Remarkably, we found that graft-derived projections preferentially reached cortical and subcortical structures which, in the intact brain, receive projections from the visual and, to a lesser extent, the limbic cortex. These included projections to the visual cortex (V1/V2) CL to the graft, while very few fibers were found in the CL motor (M1) or somatosensory (S1) areas (Figures 3A, 3B, and 3L). Similarly, GFP+ axons were found preferentially in the dorso-medial (DM) striatum, which receives mainly input from the visual cortex, while very few fibers were found in its dorso-lateral (DL) part, a main target of the motor cortex (Figures 3C, 3D, and 3M). In the thalamus, fibers were found throughout primarily visual and limbic thalamic nuclei, while almost none were detected in motor, S1, or auditory system nuclei (Figures 3E–3J). Finally,"
https://openalex.org/W2023126912,"Mammals rely upon three ocular photoreceptors to sense light: rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Rods and cones resolve details in the visual scene. Conversely, ipRGCs integrate over time and space, primarily to support ""non-image"" vision. The integrative mechanisms of ipRGCs are enigmatic, particularly since these cells use a phototransduction motif that allows invertebrates like Drosophila to parse light with exceptional temporal resolution. Here, we provide evidence for a single mechanism that allows ipRGCs to integrate over both time and wavelength. Light distributes the visual pigment, melanopsin, across three states, two silent and one signaling. Photoequilibration among states maintains pigment availability for sustained signaling, stability of the signaling state permits minutes-long temporal summation, and modest spectral separation of the silent states promotes uniform activation across wavelengths. By broadening the tuning of ipRGCs in both temporal and chromatic domains, melanopsin tristability produces signal integration for physiology and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2072002594,"Introduction Mean platelet volume (MPV) is suggested as an index of inflammation, disease activity, and anti-inflammatory treatment efficacy in chronic inflammatory disorders; however, the effect of MPV on sepsis mortality remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether the change in MPV between hospital admission and 72 hours (ΔMPV72h-adm) predicts 28-day mortality in severe sepsis and/or septic shock. Methods We prospectively enrolled 345 patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) who received standardized resuscitation (early goal-directed therapy) for severe sepsis and/or septic shock between November 2007 and December 2011. Changes in platelet indices, including ΔMPV72h-adm, were compared between survivors and non-survivors by linear mixed model analysis. The prognostic value of ΔMPV72h-adm for 28-day mortality was ascertained by Cox proportional hazards model analysis. Results Thirty-five (10.1%) patients died within 28 days after ED admission. MPV increased significantly during the first 72 hours in non-survivors (P = 0.001) and survivors (P < 0.001); however, the rate of MPV increase was significantly higher in non-survivors (P = 0.003). Nonetheless, the difference in the platelet decline rate over the first 72 hours did not differ significantly between groups (P = 0.360). In multivariate analysis, ΔMPV72h-adm was an independent predictor of 28-day mortality, after adjusting for plausible confounders (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–2.06; P = 0.044). Conclusions An increase in MPV during the first 72 hours of hospitalization is an independent risk factor for adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, continuous monitoring of MPV may be useful to stratify mortality risk in patients with severe sepsis and/or septic shock."
https://openalex.org/W2065382725,"Sexual dimorphism in the brain maturation during childhood and adolescence has been repeatedly documented, which may underlie the differences in behaviors and cognitive performance. However, our understanding of how gender modulates the development of structural connectome in healthy adults is still not entirely clear. Here we utilized graph theoretical analysis of longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging data over a five-year period to investigate the progressive gender differences of brain network topology. The brain networks of both genders showed prominent economical ""small-world"" architecture (high local clustering and short paths between nodes). Additional analysis revealed a more economical ""small-world"" architecture in females as well as a greater global efficiency in males regardless of scan time point. At the regional level, both increased and decreased efficiency were found across the cerebral cortex for both males and females, indicating a compensation mechanism of cortical network reorganization over time. Furthermore, we found that weighted clustering coefficient exhibited significant gender-time interactions, implying different development trends between males and females. Moreover, several specific brain regions (e.g., insula, superior temporal gyrus, cuneus, putamen, and parahippocampal gyrus) exhibited different development trajectories between males and females. Our findings further prove the presence of sexual dimorphism in brain structures that may underlie gender differences in behavioral and cognitive functioning. The sex-specific progress trajectories in brain connectome revealed in this work provide an important foundation to delineate the gender related pathophysiological mechanisms in various neuropsychiatric disorders, which may potentially guide the development of sex-specific treatments for these devastating brain disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2094458576,"Our understanding of the mechanisms that establish wiring specificity of complex neural circuits is far from complete. During Drosophila olfactory circuit assembly, axons of 50 olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) classes and dendrites of 50 projection neuron (PN) classes precisely target to 50 discrete glomeruli, forming parallel information-processing pathways. Here we show that Toll-6 and Toll-7, members of the Toll receptor family best known for functions in innate immunity and embryonic patterning, cell autonomously instruct the targeting of specific classes of PN dendrites and ORN axons, respectively. The canonical ligands and downstream partners of Toll receptors in embryonic patterning and innate immunity are not required for the function of Toll-6/Toll-7 in wiring specificity, nor are their cytoplasmic domains. Interestingly, both Toll-6 and Toll-7 participate in synaptic partner matching between ORN axons and PN dendrites. Our investigations reveal that olfactory circuit assembly involves dynamic and long-range interactions between PN dendrites and ORN axons."

Materials and Methods Clinical and laboratory data from 132 RHCC patients treated with TACE from January 2003 to December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Prognostic factors were assessed by multivariate analysis, and the predictive values of NLR and PLR for overall survival (OS) and extrahepatic metastases were compared. Results Pretreatment mean NLR and PLR were 3.1 and 137, respectively. The 0.5-, 1-, and 2-year OS rates were 93.7%, 67.1%, and 10.1% in the low NLR group and 81.1%, 18.9%, and 3.8% in the high NLR group, respectively (P = 0.017). The corresponding OS rates in the low and high PLR groups were 92.5%, 58.1%, and 9.7% and 84.6%, 23.1%, and 2.6%, respectively (P = 0.030). The discriminatory performance predicting 1-year survival probability was significantly poorer for NLR (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.685, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.598–0.763) than for PLR (AUC = 0.792, 95% CI 0.712–0.857; P = 0.0295), but was good for both ratios for predicting post-TACE extrahepatic metastasis. Multivariate analysis indicated that high PLR (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.373, 95% CI = 0.216-0.644, P < 0.001, vascular invasion (HR = 0.507, 95% CI = 0.310–0.832, P = 0.007), and multiple tumors (HR= 0.553, 95% CI = 0.333–0.919, P = 0.022) were independent prognostic factors for OS. Conclusions High NLR and PLR were both associated with poor prognosis and metastasis in RHCC patients treated with TACE, but high PLR was a better predictor of 1-year OS. High PLR, vascular invasion, and multiple tumors were independent, unfavorable prognostic factors."

The aim of this study was to evaluate FC concentrations in healthy children between 1 and 18 months of age. Methods Healthy children aged 1-18 months were enrolled in this study at the Department of Children's Health Care in Shanghai, China. Children’s stool samples were collected and analyzed, and FC concentration was determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The children's weights and lengths were measured. Parents were asked to complete a brief questionnaire regarding several clinical and sociodemographic factors. Results The FC concentrations were unevenly distributed; the median FC concentration was 174.3 μg/g (range: 6.0-1097.7 μg/g) or 2.241 log10 μg/g (range: 0.775-3.041 log10 μg/g) for all 288 children. The children were divided into several age groups: 1-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-9 months, 9-12 months and 12-18 months. The median FC concentrations for these age groups were 375.2 μg/g (2.574 log10 μg/g), 217.9 μg/g (2.338 log10 μg/g), 127.7 μg/g (2.106 log10 μg/g), 96.1 μg/g (1.983 log10 μg/g) and 104.2 μg/g (2.016 log10 μg/g), respectively. A significant correlation between age and FC concentration was found (r=-0.490, p<0.001). A simple correlation analysis of weight-for-length Z-scores or weight-for-age Z-scores vs. FC concentrations showed that these variables were negatively correlated (Spearman’s rho=-0.287, p<0.001; Spearman’s rho=-0.243, p<0.001, respectively). Conclusions The FC levels of children aged 1-18 months exhibit a downward trend with increasing age and are greater than the normal levels observed in healthy adults. In healthy children aged <6 months, FC levels are high. In children aged 6-18 months, FC concentrations are relatively low but are still higher than those of children aged >4 years."
https://openalex.org/W2086496688,"Sip1 is an important transcription factor that regulates several aspects of CNS development. Mutations in the human SIP1 gene have been implicated in Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), characterized by severe mental retardation and agenesis of the corpus callosum. In this study we have shown that Sip1 is essential for the formation of intracortical, intercortical, and cortico-subcortical connections in the murine forebrain. Sip1 deletion from all postmitotic neurons in the neocortex results in lack of corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and corticospinal tract formation. Mosaic deletion of Sip1 in the neocortex reveals defects in axonal growth and in ipsilateral intracortical-collateral formation. Sip1 mediates these effects through its direct downstream effector ninein, a microtubule binding protein. Ninein in turn influences the rate of axonal growth and branching by affecting microtubule stability and dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2043250889,"Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and vestibular cerebellar cortex receive glutamatergic mossy fiber input on an elaborate brush-like dendrite. Two subtypes of UBC have been established based on immunohistochemical markers and physiological profiles, but the relation of these subtypes to the response to mossy fiber input is not clear. We examined the synaptic physiology of auditory UBCs in mouse brain slices, identifying two response profiles, and correlated each with a specific UBC subtype. One subtype had a striking biphasic excitatory response mediated by AMPAR and mGluR1α. The second was mGluR1α negative and was dominated by a strongly inhibitory outward K+ current. These two subtypes upregulated or downregulated spontaneous firing, respectively. By analogy to the retina, we propose that UBCs comprise ON and OFF cells with respect to their response to glutamatergic input and may therefore provide distinct parallel processing of multisensory input to their targets."
https://openalex.org/W2109505394,"There is extensive variation in DNA methylation between individuals and ethnic groups. These differences arise from a combination of genetic and non-genetic influences and potential modifiers include nutritional cues, early life experience, and social and physical environments. Here we compare genome-wide DNA methylation in neonatal cord blood from African American (AA; N = 112) and European American (EA; N = 91) participants of the CANDLE Study (Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood). Our goal is to determine if there are replicable ancestry-specific methylation patterns that may implicate risk factors for diseases that have differential prevalence between populations. To identify the most robust ancestry-specific CpG sites, we replicate our results in lymphoblastoid cell lines from Yoruba African and CEPH European panels of HapMap. We also evaluate the influence of maternal nutrition—specifically, plasma levels of vitamin D and folate during pregnancy—on methylation in newborns. We define stable ancestry-dependent methylation of genes that include tumor suppressors and cell cycle regulators (e.g., APC, BRCA1, MCC). Overall, there is lower global methylation in African ancestral groups. Plasma levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D are also considerably lower among AA mothers and about 60% of AA and 40% of EA mothers have concentrations below 20 ng/ml. Using a weighted correlation analysis, we define a network of CpG sites that is jointly modulated by ancestry and maternal vitamin D. Our results show that differences in DNA methylation patterns are remarkably stable and maternal micronutrients can exert an influence on the child epigenome."

Effectively analyzing these data are essential for geoscience studies. However, the tasks are challenging for geoscientists because processing the massive amount of data is both computing and data intensive in that data analytics requires complex procedures and multiple tools. To tackle these challenges, a scientific workflow framework is proposed for big geoscience data analytics. In this framework techniques are proposed by leveraging cloud computing, MapReduce, and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Specifically, HBase is adopted for storing and managing big geoscience data across distributed computers. MapReduce-based algorithm framework is developed to support parallel processing of geoscience data. And service-oriented workflow architecture is built for supporting on-demand complex data analytics in the cloud environment. A proof-of-concept prototype tests the performance of the framework.

https://openalex.org/W1979113333,"Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of Chinese eye exercises on reducing accommodative lag in children by a randomized, double-blinded controlled trial. Methods A total of 190 children aged 10 to 14 years with emmetropia to moderate myopia were included. They were randomly allocated to three groups: standard Chinese eye exercises group (trained for eye exercises by doctors of traditional Chinese medicine); sham point eye exercises group (instructed to massage on non-acupoints); and eyes closed group (asked to close their eyes without massage). Primary outcome was change in accommodative lag immediately after intervention. Secondary outcomes included changes in corrected near and distant visual acuity, and visual discomfort score. Results Children in the standard Chinese eye exercises group had significantly greater alleviation of accommodative lag (-0.10D) than those in sham point eye exercises group (-0.03D) and eyes closed group (0.07D) (P = 0.04). The proportion of children with alleviation of accommodative lag was significantly higher in the standard Chinese eye exercises group (54.0%) than in the sham point eye exercises group (32.8%) and the eyes closed group (34.9%) (P = 0.03). No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes. Conclusion Chinese eye exercises as performed daily in primary and middle schools in China have statistically but probably clinically insignificant effect in reducing accommodative lag of school-aged children in the short-term. Considering the higher amounts of near work load of Chinese children, the efficacy of eye exercises may be insufficient in preventing myopia progression in the long-term.

Texture parameters derived from histogram, gradient, run-length matrix, co-occurrence matrix, autoregressive model and wavelet transform methods were estimated with imaging software. Fisher, probability of classification error and average correlation, and mutual information coefficients were used to extract subsets of optimized texture features. Linear discriminant analysis in combination with 1-nearest neighbor classifier (LDA/1-NN) was used for lesion classification. In compliance with the software requirement, classification was performed based on datasets from all patients, the patient group with necroinflammatory activity grade 1, and that with fibrosis stage 4, respectively.Based on all patient dataset, LDA/1-NN produced misclassification rates of 28.46%, 35.77% and 20.33% for fibrosis staging and 34.15%, 25.20% and 28.46% for necroinflammatory activity grading in T2W, T1W and EOB-HP images. In the patient group with necroinflammatory activity grade 1, LDA/1-NN yielded misclassification rates of 5.00%, 0% and 12.50% for fibrosis staging in T2W, T1W and EOB-HP images respectively. In the patient group with fibrosis stage 4, LDA/1-NN yielded misclassification rates of 5.88%, 12.94% and 11.76% for necroinflammatory activity grading in T2W, T1W and EOB-HP images respectively.Texture quantitative parameters of MR images facilitate classification of the fibrosis stage as well as necroinflammatory activity grade in chronic hepatitis C, especially after categorizing the input dataset according to the activity or fibrosis degree in order to remove the interference between the fibrosis stage and necroinflammatory activity grade on texture features."
https://openalex.org/W1964818141,"Merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2) of Plasmodium falciparum is an abundant, intrinsically disordered protein that is GPI-anchored to the surface of the invasive blood stage of the malaria parasite. Recombinant MSP2 has been trialled as a component of a malaria vaccine, and is one of several disordered proteins that are candidates for inclusion in vaccines for malaria and other diseases. Nonetheless, little is known about the implications of protein disorder for the development of an effective antibody response. We have therefore undertaken a detailed analysis of the conformational dynamics of the two allelic forms of MSP2 (3D7 and FC27) using NMR spectroscopy. Chemical shifts and NMR relaxation data indicate that conformational and dynamic properties of the N- and C-terminal conserved regions in the two forms of MSP2 are essentially identical, but significant variation exists between and within the central variable regions. We observe a strong relationship between the conformational dynamics and the antigenicity of MSP2, as assessed with antisera to recombinant MSP2. Regions of increased conformational order in MSP2, including those in the conserved regions, are more strongly antigenic, while the most flexible regions are minimally antigenic. This suggests that modifications that increase conformational order may offer a means to tune the antigenicity of MSP2 and other disordered antigens, with implications for vaccine design."

https://openalex.org/W2006203663,"Support vector machines are a popular machine learning method for many classification tasks in biology and chemistry. In addition, the support vector regression (SVR) variant is widely used for numerical property predictions. In chemoinformatics and pharmaceutical research, SVR has become the probably most popular approach for modeling of non-linear structure-activity relationships (SARs) and predicting compound potency values. Herein, we have systematically generated and analyzed SVR prediction models for a variety of compound data sets with different SAR characteristics. Although these SVR models were accurate on the basis of global prediction statistics and not prone to overfitting, they were found to consistently mispredict highly potent compounds. Hence, in regions of local SAR discontinuity, SVR prediction models displayed clear limitations. Compared to observed activity landscapes of compound data sets, landscapes generated on the basis of SVR potency predictions were partly flattened and activity cliff information was lost. Taken together, these findings have implications for practical SVR applications. In particular, prospective SVR-based potency predictions should be considered with caution because artificially low predictions are very likely for highly potent candidate compounds, the most important prediction targets."

Although a limited number of treatment options for melanoma currently exist, patients with a more aggressive form of this cancer frequently decline treatment. DM-1 is a sodium phenolate and curcumin analog with proven anticancer, anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic properties. In this paper, the DM-1 compound showed in vivo antitumor activity alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic DTIC in B16F10 melanoma-bearing mice. Beneficial effects such as melanoma tumor burden reduction with pyknotic nuclei, decreased nuclei/cytoplasmic ratio and nuclear degradation occurred after DM-1 treatment. No toxicological changes were observed in the liver, kidneys, spleen and lungs after DM-1 monotherapy or DTIC combined therapy. DTIC+DM-1 treatment induced the recovery of anemia arising from melanoma and immunomodulation. Both DM-1 treatment alone and in combination with DTIC induced apoptosis with the cleavage of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Furthermore, melanoma tumors treated with DM-1 showed a preferential apoptotic intrinsic pathway by decreasing Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Considering the chemoresistance exhibited by melanoma towards conventional chemotherapy drugs, DM-1 compound in monotherapy or in combination therapy provides a promising improvement in melanoma treatment with a reduction of side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2063976356,"Two main questions are important for understanding and treating affective disorders: why are certain individuals susceptible or resilient to stress, and what are the features of treatment response and resistance? To address these questions, we used a chronic mild stress (CMS) rat model of depression. When exposed to stress, a fraction of rats develops anhedonic-like behavior, a core symptom of major depression, while another subgroup of rats is resilient to CMS. Furthermore, the anhedonic-like state is reversed in about half the animals in response to chronic escitalopram treatment (responders), while the remaining animals are resistant (non-responder animals). Electrophysiology in hippocampal brain slices was used to identify a synaptic hallmark characterizing these groups of animals. Presynaptic properties were investigated at GABAergic synapses onto single dentate gyrus granule cells. Stress-susceptible rats displayed a reduced probability of GABA release judged by an altered paired-pulse ratio of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) (1.48 ± 0.25) compared with control (0.81 ± 0.05) and stress-resilient rats (0.78 ± 0.03). Spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) occurred less frequently in stress-susceptible rats compared with control and resilient rats. Finally, a subset of stress-susceptible rats responding to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment showed a normalization of the paired-pulse ratio (0.73 ± 0.06) whereas non-responder rats showed no normalization (1.2 ± 0.2). No changes in the number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons were observed. Thus, we provide evidence for a distinct GABAergic synaptopathy which associates closely with stress-susceptibility and treatment-resistance in an animal model of depression."

However, its effects on cancer cell adhesion, migration and invasion were unclear. In the present study, we found that the supernatant of water-soluble extract from SGR (SW) could promote adhesion, inhibit migration and invasion of HepG2, MDA-MB-231 and T24 cells in vitro, as well as suppress metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells in vivo. Results of F-actin and vinculin dual staining showed the enhanced focal adhesion in SW-treated cells. Microarray analysis indicated a repression of TGF-β1 signaling by SW treatment, which was verified by real-time RT-PCR of TGF-β1-related genes and immunoblotting of TGFBR1 protein. SW was also shown to antagonize TGF-β1-promoted cell migration. Collectively, our study revealed a new antitumor function of Sarsaparilla in counteracting invasiveness of a subset of cancer cells by inhibiting TGF-β1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1967577825,"Background Increasing proportions of men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK are presenting with non-metastatic disease. We investigated how treatment trends in this demographic have changed. Patient and Methods Non-metastatic cancers diagnosed from 2000–2010 in the UK Anglian Cancer network stratified by age and risk group were analysed [n = 10,365]. Radiotherapy [RT] and prostatectomy [RP] cancer specific survival [CSS] were further compared [n = 4755]. Results Over the decade we observed a fall in uptake of primary androgen deprivation therapy but a rise in conservative management [CM] and radical therapy [p<0.0001]. CM in particular has become the primary management for low-risk disease by the decade end [p<0.0001]. In high-risk disease however both RP and RT uptake increased significantly but in an age dependent manner [p<0.0001]. Principally, increased RP in younger men and increased RT in men ≥ 70y. In multivariate analysis of radically treated men both high-risk disease [HR 8.0 [2.9–22.2], p<0.0001] and use of RT [HR 1.9 [1.0–3.3], p = 0.024] were significant predictors of a poorer CSM. In age-stratified analysis however, the trend to benefit of RP over RT was seen only in younger men [≤ 60 years] with high-risk disease [p = 0.07]. The numbers needed to treat by RP instead of RT to save one cancer death was 19 for this group but 67 for the overall cohort. Conclusion This study has identified significant shifts in non-metastatic prostate cancer management over the last decade. Low-risk disease is now primarily managed by CM while high-risk disease is increasingly treated radically. Treatment of high-risk younger men by RP is supported by evidence of better CSM but this benefit is not evident in older men."
https://openalex.org/W2083685405,"The globus pallidus (GP) receives dopaminergic afferents from the pars compacta of substantia nigra and several studies suggested that dopamine exerts its action in the GP through presynaptic D2 receptors (D2Rs). However, the impact of dopamine in GP on the pallido-subthalamic and pallido-nigral neurotransmission is not known. Here, we investigated the role of dopamine, through activation of D2Rs, in the modulation of GP neuronal activity and its impact on the electrical activity of subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) neurons. Extracellular recordings combined with local intracerebral microinjection of drugs were done in male Sprague-Dawley rats under urethane anesthesia. We showed that dopamine, when injected locally, increased the firing rate of the majority of neurons in the GP. This increase of the firing rate was mimicked by quinpirole, a D2R agonist, and prevented by sulpiride, a D2R antagonist. In parallel, the injection of dopamine, as well as quinpirole, in the GP reduced the firing rate of majority of STN and SNr neurons. However, neither dopamine nor quinpirole changed the tonic discharge pattern of GP, STN and SNr neurons. Our results are the first to demonstrate that dopamine through activation of D2Rs located in the GP plays an important role in the modulation of GP-STN and GP-SNr neurotransmission and consequently controls STN and SNr neuronal firing. Moreover, we provide evidence that dopamine modulate the firing rate but not the pattern of GP neurons, which in turn control the firing rate, but not the pattern of STN and SNr neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2041871933,"Few studies in epidemiology have evaluated the effects of gene-environment interaction on oxidative stress, even though this interaction is an important etiologic factor in lung carcinogenesis. We investigated the effects of the genetic polymorphisms of paraoxonase 1 (PON1), smoking, and the interaction between the two on lung cancer risk and oxidative stress.This study's subjects consisted of 416 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients and an equal number of matched controls. The GoldenGate assay was used for genotypic analyses of the PON1 gene. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels were measured as indicators of oxidative stress.The PON1 rs662 AA genotype showed a significantly lower risk of lung cancer than the GG genotype (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.36-0.99). The protective effect of the PON1 rs662 AA genotype on lung cancer risk was limited to non-smokers. Lung cancer patients who had the rs662 A allele showed a dose-dependent association between smoking status and oxidative stress markers. Among non-smoking lung cancer patients, urinary 8-OHdG levels were significantly lower in individuals with the rs662 GA and AA genotypes than in those with the GG genotype. Furthermore, we found a significant interaction effect between PON1 rs662 and smoking status on urinary 8-OHdG levels in lung cancer patients.Our results suggest that the protective effect of PON1 rs662 SNP against lung carcinogenesis and the induction of oxidative stress might be modulated by the interaction between PON1 genetic polymorphisms and tobacco smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2075852715,"Background The clinical use of purified SOD enzymes has strong limitations due to their large molecular size, high production cost and immunogenicity. These limitations could be compensated by using instead synthetic SOD mimetic compounds of low molecular weight. Background/Methodology We have recently reported that two SOD mimetic compounds, the MnII complexes of the polyamines Pytren2Q and Pytren4Q, displayed high antioxidant activity in bacteria and yeast. Since frequently molecules with antioxidant properties or free-radical scavengers also have anti-inflammatory properties we have assessed the anti-inflammatory potential of Pytren2Q and Pytren4Q MnII complexes, in cultured macrophages and in a murine model of inflammation, by measuring the degree of protection they could provide against the cellular injury produced by lipopolisacharide, a bacterial endotoxin. Principal Findings In this report we show that the MnII complex of Pytren4Q but not that of Pytren2Q effectively protected human cultured THP-1 macrophages and whole mice from the inflammatory effects produced by LPS. These results obtained with two molecules that are isomers highlight the importance of gathering experimental data from animal models of disease in assessing the potential of candidate molecules. Conclusion/Significance The effective anti-inflammatory activity of the MnII complex of Pytren4Q in addition to its low toxicity, water solubility and ease of production would suggest it is worth taking into consideration for future pharmacological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2000571698,"Background One of the two copies of the X chromosome is randomly inactivated in females as a means of dosage compensation. Loss of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is observed in breast and ovarian cancers, and is frequent in basal-like subtype and BRCA1 mutation-associated breast cancers. We investigated the clinical implications of the loss of XCI in ovarian cancer and the association between the loss of XCI and BRCA1 dysfunction. Materials and Methods We used open source data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Genome Data Analysis Centers. Ward’s hierarchical clustering method was used to classify the methylation status of the X chromosome. Results We grouped 584 high grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas (HG-SOA) according to methylation status, loss of heterozygosity and deletion or gain of X chromosome into the following five groups: preserved inactivated X chromosome (Xi) group (n = 175), partial reactivation of Xi group (n = 100), p arm deletion of Xi group (n = 35), q arm deletion of Xi group (n = 44), and two copies of active X group (n = 230). We found four genes (XAGE3, ZNF711, MAGEA4, and ZDHHC15) that were up-regulated by loss of XCI. HG-SOA with loss of XCI showed aggressive behavior (overall survival of partial reactivation of Xi group: HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.5, two copies of active X group: HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0–1.9). Mutation and hypermethylation of BRCA1 were not frequent in HG-SOA with loss of XCI. Conclusions Loss of XCI is common in HG-SOA and is associated with poor clinical outcome. The role of BRCA1 in loss of XCI might be limited. XCI induced aberrant expression of cancer-testis antigens, which may have a role in tumor aggressiveness."

The aim of this study was to explore the genotypic diversity of HBV in Cuba. The S genomic region of Cuban HBV isolates was sequenced and for selected isolates the complete genome or precore-core sequence was analyzed. The most frequent genotype was A (167/250, 67%), mainly A2 (149, 60%) but also A1 and one A4. A total of 77 isolates were classified as genotype D (31%), with co-circulation of several subgenotypes (56 D4, 2 D1, 5 D2, 7 D3/6 and 7 D7). Three isolates belonged to genotype E, two to H and one to B3. Complete genome sequence analysis of selected isolates confirmed the phylogenetic analysis performed with the S region. Mutations or polymorphisms in precore region were more common among genotype D compared to genotype A isolates. The HBV genotypic distribution in this Caribbean island correlates with the Y lineage genetic background of the population, where a European and African origin prevails. HBV genotypes E, B3 and H isolates might represent more recent introductions."
https://openalex.org/W2027692773,"As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events researchers and public health officials must work towards understanding the causes and outcomes of heat-related morbidity and mortality. While there have been many studies on both heat-related illness (HRI), there are fewer on heat-related morbidity than on heat-related mortality.To identify individual and environmental risk factors for hospitalizations and document patterns of household cooling.We performed a pooled cross-sectional analysis of secondary U.S. data, the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Risk ratios were calculated from multivariable models to identify risk factors for hospitalizations. Hierarchical modeling was also employed to identify relationships between individual and hospital level predictors of hospitalizations. Patterns of air conditioning use were analyzed among the vulnerable populations identified.Hospitalizations due to HRI increased over the study period compared to all other hospitalizations. Populations at elevated risk for HRI hospitalization were blacks, males and all age groups above the age of 40. Those living in zip-codes in the lowest income quartile and the uninsured were also at an increased risk. Hospitalizations for HRI in rural and small urban clusters were elevated, compared to urban areas.Risk factors for HRI include age greater than 40, male gender and hospitalization in rural areas or small urban clusters. Our analysis also revealed an increasing pattern of HRI hospitalizations over time and decreased association between common comorbidities and heat illnesses which may be indicative of underreporting."
https://openalex.org/W2041172252,"Chlorination is the most popular method for disinfecting swimming pool water; however, although pathogens are being killed, many toxic compounds, called disinfection by-products (DBPs), are formed. Numerous epidemiological publications have associated the chlorination of pools with dysfunctions of the respiratory system and with some other diseases. However, the findings concerning these associations are not always consistent and have not been confirmed by toxicological studies. Therefore, the health effects from swimming in chlorinated pools and the corresponding stress reactions in organisms are unclear. In this study, we show that although the growth and behaviors of experimental rats were not affected, their health, training effects and metabolic profiles were significantly affected by a 12-week swimming training program in chlorinated water identical to that of public pools. Interestingly, the eyes and skin are the organs that are more directly affected than the lungs by the irritants in chlorinated water; instead of chlorination, training intensity, training frequency and choking on water may be the primary factors for lung damage induced by swimming. Among the five major organs (the heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys), the liver is the most likely target of DBPs. Through metabolomics analysis, the corresponding metabolic stress pathways and a defensive system focusing on taurine were presented, based on which the corresponding countermeasures can be developed for swimming athletes and for others who spend a lot of time in chlorinated swimming pools."
https://openalex.org/W2062151808,"Mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) specifically acts in ADP/ATP exchange through the mitochondrial inner membrane. This transporter protein thereby plays a significant role in energy metabolism in eukaryotic cells. Most mammals have four paralogous ANT genes (ANT1-4) and utilize these paralogues in different types of cells. The fourth paralogue of ANT (ANT4) is present only in mammals and reptiles and is exclusively expressed in testicular germ cells where it is required for meiotic progression in the spermatocytes. Here, we report that silkworms harbor two ANT paralogues, the homeostatic paralogue (BmANTI1) and the testis-specific paralogue (BmANTI2). The BmANTI2 protein has an N-terminal extension in which the positions of lysine residues in the amino acid sequence are distributed as in human ANT4. An expression analysis showed that BmANTI2 transcripts were restricted to the testis, suggesting the protein has a role in the progression of spermatogenesis. By contrast, BmANTI1 was expressed in all tissues tested, suggesting it has an important role in homeostasis. We also observed that cultured silkworm cells required BmANTI1 for proliferation. The ANTI1 protein of the lepidopteran Plutella xylostella (PxANTI1), but not those of other insect species (or PxANTI2), restored cell proliferation in BmANTI1-knockdown cells suggesting that ANTI1 has similar energy metabolism functions across the Lepidoptera. Our results suggest that BmANTI2 is evolutionarily divergent from BmANTI1 and has developed a specific role in spermatogenesis similar to that of mammalian ANT4."
https://openalex.org/W2080870722,"Background Recent studies have indicated that low UACR levels (<30 μg/mg) previously considered to be in the normal range (‘low-grade albuminuria’) are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general population. Methods We studied 9,736 participants with albuminuria in the normal range from the 2011–2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Results The weighted prevalences of metabolic syndrome (MS) and the 10-year risk for coronary heart disease measured using the Framingham risk score (FRS) ≥ 20% (high risk) were 22.5 ± 0.7% and 14.5 ± 0.7%, respectively, in males and 23.3 ± 0.8% and 8.5 ± 0.4%, respectively in females. Weighted comparisons among the tertiles of UACR revealed that the prevalences of MS and high-risk FRS increased with increasing UACR (MS: males, 15.9 ± 1.1, 20.2 ± 1.2, 32.4 ± 1.5%, respectively; P < 0.001; and females, 17.6 ± 1.0, 22.7 ± 1.0, 30.2 ± 1.4%, respectively; P < 0.001. High-risk FRS: males, 9.5 ± 0.7, 12.3 ± 0.9, 22.5 ± 1.2, respectively; P < 0.001; and females, 5.8 ± 0.6, 7.9 ± 0.7, 12.0 ± 0.9%, respectively; P < 0.001). The positive association persisted after adjusting for hypertension and diabetes. The weighted comparisons among the deciles of UACR revealed that the prevalences of MS and high-risk FRS began to increase at the ranges of 3.89–5.15 and 5.16–7.36 mg/g Cr, respectively. Conclusion Low-grade albuminuria was significantly associated with estimated cardiovascular risk and MS in a nationally representative sample of Koreans."
https://openalex.org/W2167264746,"Cyclic endometrial neoangiogenesis contributes to changes in local vascular patterns and is amenable to non-invasive assessment with Doppler sonography. We hypothesize that the uterine artery (UtA) impedance, measured by its pulsatility index (PI), exhibits a regular pattern during the normal menstrual cycle. Therefore, the main study objective was to derive normative new day-cycle-based reference ranges for the UtA-PI during the entire cycle from days 1 to 34 according to the isolated time effect and potential confounders such as age and parity.From January 2009 to December 2012, a cross-sectional study of 1,821 healthy women undergoing routine gynaecological ultrasound was performed. The Doppler flow of the right and left UtA-PI was studied transvaginally by colour and pulsed Doppler imaging. The mean right and left values and the presence or absence of a bilateral protodiastolic notch were recorded. Reference intervals for the PI according to the cycle day were generated by classical linear regression.The majority of patients (97.5%) presented unilateral or bilateral UtA notches. The crude 5th, 50th, and 95th reference percentile curves of the UtA-PI at 1-34 days of the normal menstrual cycle were derived. In all curves, a progressive significant decrease occurred during the first 13 days, followed by an increase and recovery in the UtA-PI. The adjusted 5th, 50th, and 95th reference percentile curves for the effects of age and parity were also obtained. These two conditions generated an approximately identical UtA-PI pattern during the cycle, except with small but significant reductions at the temporal extremes.The median, 5th, and the 95th percentiles of the UtA-PI decrease during the first third of the menstrual cycle and recover to their initial values during the last two thirds of the cycle. The rates of decrease and recovery depend significantly on age and parity."
https://openalex.org/W1978618119,"Riparian plants in arid regions face a highly variable water environment controlled by hydrological processes. To understand whether riparian plants adapt to such environments through plastic responses, we compared the root traits, biomass allocation and growth of Populus euphratica Oliv. Seedlings grown in lysimeters filled with clay or clay/river sand sediments under inundation and varying water table conditions. We hypothesized that adaptive phenotypic plasticity is likely to develop or be advantageous in seedlings of this species to allow them to adapt desert floodplain environments. Growth was significantly reduced by inundation. However, rather than following relatively fixed trait and allocation patterns, the seedlings displayed adaptive mechanisms involving the development of adventitious roots to enhance plant stability and obtain oxygen, together with a lower proportion of root biomass. At the whole-plant level, at deeper water table depths, seedlings allocated more biomass to the roots, and total root length increased with decreasing water table depths, regardless of the sediment, consistent with optimal partitioning theory. The sediment type had a significant effect on seedling root traits. P. euphratica displayed very different root traits in different sediment types under the same hydrological conditions, showing a greater first-order root number in clay sediment under shallower water table conditions, whereas rooting depth was greater in clay/river sand sediment under deep water table conditions. In clay sediment, seedlings responded to lower water availability via greater root elongation, while the root surface area was increased through increasing the total root length in clay/river sand sediment, suggesting that seedlings facing deeper water tables are not always likely to increase their root surface area to obtain more water. Our results indicate that P. euphratica seedlings are able to adapt to a range of water table conditions through plastic responses in root traits and biomass allocation."
https://openalex.org/W2026684185,"Vegetation clearing, land modification and agricultural intensification have impacted on many ecological communities around the world. Understanding how species respond to fragmentation and the scales over which functionality is retained, can be critical for managing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Allocasuarina verticillata (drooping sheoak, drooping she-oak) is a dioecious, wind-pollinated and -dispersed species with key conservation values across southeastern Australia. But vegetation clearing associated with agricultural expansion has reduced the abundance and spatial distribution of this species in many regions. Spatial genetic structure, relatedness among trees, pollen dispersal and mating patterns were examined in fragmented A. verticillata populations selected to represent the types of remnants that now characterise this species. Short scale spatial genetic structure (5–25 m) and relatedness among trees were observed in most populations. Unexpectedly, the two male trees closest to each female did not have a reproductive advantage accounting for only 4–15% of the seed produced in larger populations. Biparental inbreeding was also generally low (<4%) with limited evidence of seed crop domination by some male trees. More male trees contributed to seed crops in linear remnants (mean 17) compared to those from patch remnants (mean 11.3) which may reflect differences in pollen dispersal within the two remnant types. On average, pollen travels ~100 m irrespective of remnant type but was also detected to have dispersed as far as 1 km in open landscapes. Low biparental inbreeding, limited reproductive assurance for near-neighbour and probably related males and variability in the distances over which females sample pollen pools suggest that some mechanism to prevent matings between relatives exists in this species."
https://openalex.org/W1963743402,"The DUX4 gene, encoded within D4Z4 repeats on human chromosome 4q35, has recently emerged as a key factor in the pathogenic mechanisms underlying Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). This recognition prompted development of animal models expressing the DUX4 open reading frame (ORF) alone or embedded within D4Z4 repeats. In the first published model, we used adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) and strong viral control elements (CMV promoter, SV40 poly A) to demonstrate that the DUX4 cDNA caused dose-dependent toxicity in mouse muscles. As a follow-up, we designed a second generation of DUX4-expressing AAV vectors to more faithfully genocopy the FSHD-permissive D4Z4 repeat region located at 4q35. This new vector (called AAV.D4Z4.V5.pLAM) contained the D4Z4/DUX4 promoter region, a V5 epitope-tagged DUX4 ORF, and the natural 3’ untranslated region (pLAM) harboring two small introns, DUX4 exons 2 and 3, and the non-canonical poly A signal required for stabilizing DUX4 mRNA in FSHD. AAV.D4Z4.V5.pLAM failed to recapitulate the robust pathology of our first generation vectors following delivery to mouse muscle. We found that the DUX4.V5 junction sequence created an unexpected splice donor in the pre-mRNA that was preferentially utilized to remove the V5 coding sequence and DUX4 stop codon, yielding non-functional DUX4 protein with 55 additional residues on its carboxyl-terminus. Importantly, we further found that aberrant splicing could occur in any expression construct containing a functional splice acceptor and sequences resembling minimal splice donors. Our findings represent an interesting case study with respect to AAV.D4Z4.V5.pLAM, but more broadly serve as a note of caution for designing constructs containing V5 epitope tags and/or transgenes with downstream introns and exons."
https://openalex.org/W2086216821,"Leaf tissues of plants usually contain several types of idioblasts, defined as specialized cells whose shape and contents differ from the surrounding homogeneous cells. The spatial patterning of idioblasts, particularly of trichomes and guard cells, across the leaf epidermis has received considerable attention as it offers a useful biological model for studying the intercellular regulation of cell fate and patterning. Excretory idioblasts in the leaves of the aquatic monocotyledonous plant Egeria densa produced light blue autofluorescence when irradiated with ultraviolet light. The use of epifluorescence microscopy to detect this autofluorescence provided a simple and convenient method for detecting excretory idioblasts and allowed tracking of those cells across the leaf surfaces, enabling quantitative measurement of the clustering and spacing patterns of idioblasts at the whole leaf level. Occurrence of idioblasts was coordinated along the proximal–distal, medial–lateral, and adaxial–abaxial axes, producing a recognizable consensus spatial pattern of idioblast formation among fully expanded leaves. Idioblast clusters, which comprised up to nine cells aligned along the proximal–distal axis, showed no positional bias or regularity in idioblast-forming areas when compared with singlet idioblasts. Up to 75% of idioblasts existed as clusters on every leaf side examined. The idioblast-forming areas varied between leaves, implying phenotypic plasticity. Furthermore, in young expanding leaves, autofluorescence was occasionally detected in a single giant vesicle or else in one or more small vesicles, which eventually grew to occupy a large portion of the idioblast volume as a central vacuole. Differentiation of vacuoles by accumulating the fluorescence substance might be an integral part of idioblast differentiation. Red autofluorescence from chloroplasts was not detected in idioblasts of young expanding leaves, suggesting idioblast differentiation involves an arrest in chloroplast development at a very early stage, rather than transdifferentiation of chloroplast-containing epidermal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1975136699,"Objectives To examine the association of employment status and characteristics with prevalent and incident memory complaints (MC) in 55–64-year-olds. Methods Subjects were participants of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). Respondents with baseline data were selected to examine the association of employment status (n = 1525) and employment characteristics (n = 1071) with prevalent MC (i.e., MC at baseline). Respondents without MC at baseline were selected to examine the association of employment (n = 526) and employment characteristics (n = 379; working hours, job prestige, job level, psychological job demands, iso-strain) with incident MC (i.e., no MC at baseline and MC at three-year follow-up). Associations were adjusted for relevant covariates (demographics, memory performance, physical health, mental health, personality traits). Logistic regression was applied. Data were weighed according to gender and age of the Dutch population. Results At baseline 20.5% reported MC. At three-year follow-up, 15.4% had incident MC. No associations were found between employment status and MC. Adjusted analysis revealed that individuals with high occupational cognitive demands were more likely to have prevalent MC. Conclusions Middle-aged workers are equally as likely to experience MC as non-working age-peers. Among workers, those with cognitively demanding work were more likely to experience MC, independent of memory performance. Memory decline due to ageing may be noticed sooner in 55–64-year-olds performing cognitively demanding work."
https://openalex.org/W2052070884,"Human fertility is a complex trait determined by gene-environment interactions in which genetic factors represent a significant component. To better understand inter-individual variability in fertility, we performed one of the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common fertility phenotypes, lifetime number of pregnancies and number of children in a developing country population. The fertility phenotype data and DNA samples were obtained at baseline recruitment from individuals participating in a large prospective cohort study in Bangladesh. GWAS analyses of fertility phenotypes were conducted among 1,686 married women. One SNP on chromosome 4 was non-significantly associated with number of children at P <10-7 and number of pregnancies at P <10-6. This SNP is located in a region without a gene within 1 Mb. One SNP on chromosome 6 was non-significantly associated with extreme number of children at P <10-6. The closest gene to this SNP is HDGFL1, a hepatoma-derived growth factor. When we excluded hormonal contraceptive users, a SNP on chromosome 5 was non-significantly associated at P <10-5 for number of children and number of pregnancies. This SNP is located near C5orf64, an open reading frame, and ZSWIM6, a zinc ion binding gene. We also estimated the heritability of these phenotypes from our genotype data using GCTA (Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis) for number of children (hg2 = 0.149, SE = 0.24, p-value = 0.265) and number of pregnancies (hg2 = 0.007, SE = 0.22, p-value = 0.487). Our genome-wide association study and heritability estimates of number of pregnancies and number of children in Bangladesh did not confer strong evidence of common variants for parity variation. However, our results suggest that future studies may want to consider the role of 3 notable SNPs in their analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2077533584,"Nickel (Ni) ions easily elute from many alloys and elicit inflammation and allergies. Previous studies have shown that infections due to the implantation of medical devices cause inflammation and enhance the elution of Ni ions (Ni2+). However, cross-talk between infection- and Ni2+-induced signaling pathways has not yet been elucidated in detail. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Ni2+ on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of cytokines in a LPS-induced air pouch-type inflammation model in BALB/c mice and the murine macrophage cell line RAW264. We demonstrated that Ni2+ inhibited the LPS-induced production of interleukin (IL)-6, but not that of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α both in vivo and in vitro. This inhibitory effect was also observed with cobalt ion (Co2+), but not with chloride ion (Cl-), zinc ion (Zn2+), or palladium ion (Pd2+), and was highly selective to the production of IL-6. Ni2+ did not inhibit the activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, or JNK. Although Ni2+ decreased IL-6 mRNA levels, it failed to inhibit the LPS-induced activation of the IL-6 promoter. An experiment using actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor, revealed that Ni2+ decreased the stability of IL-6 mRNA. Moreover, Ni2+ inhibited the LPS-induced expression of Arid5a, but not regnase-1. These results demonstrated that Ni2+ may have selectively inhibited the LPS-induced production of IL-6 by decreasing the Arid5a-dependent stabilization of IL-6 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2013139162,"G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactor 1 (Git1) is involved in cell motility control by serving as an adaptor that links signaling proteins such as Pix and PAK to focal adhesion proteins. We previously demonstrated that Git1 was a multiply tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, its primary phosphorylation site was Tyr-554 in the vicinity of the focal adhesion targeting-homology (FAH) domain, and this site was selectively dephosphorylated by protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (Ptprz). In the present study, we showed that Tyr-554 phosphorylation reduced the association of Git1 with the FAH-domain-binding proteins, paxillin and Hic-5, based on immunoprecipitation experiments using the Tyr-554 mutants of Git1. The Tyr-554 phosphorylation of Git1 was higher, and its binding to paxillin was consistently lower in the brains of Ptprz-deficient mice than in those of wild-type mice. We then investigated the role of Tyr-554 phosphorylation in cell motility control using three different methods: random cell motility, wound healing, and Boyden chamber assays. The shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Git1 impaired cell motility in A7r5 smooth muscle cells. The motility defect was rescued by the exogenous expression of wild-type Git1 and a Git1 mutant, which only retained Tyr-554 among the multiple potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, but not by the Tyr-554 phosphorylation-defective or phosphorylation-state mimic Git1 mutant. Our results suggested that cyclic phosphorylation-dephosphorylation at Tyr-554 of Git1 was crucial for dynamic interactions between Git1 and paxillin/Hic-5 in order to ensure coordinated cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2038798785,"Bioinformatics tools have gained popularity in biology but little is known about their validity. We aimed to assess the early contribution of 415 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with eight cardio-metabolic traits at the genome-wide significance level in adults in the Family Atherosclerosis Monitoring In earLY Life (FAMILY) birth cohort. We used the popular web-based tool SNAP to assess the availability of the 415 SNPs in the Illumina Cardio-Metabochip genotyped in the FAMILY study participants. We then compared the SNAP output with the Cardio-Metabochip file provided by Illumina using chromosome and chromosomal positions of SNPs from NCBI Human Genome Browser (Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37). With the HapMap 3 release 2 reference, 201 out of 415 SNPs were reported as missing in the Cardio-Metabochip by the SNAP output. However, the Cardio-Metabochip file revealed that 152 of these 201 SNPs were in fact present in the Cardio-Metabochip array (false negative rate of 36.6%). With the more recent 1000 Genomes Project release, we found a false-negative rate of 17.6% by comparing the outputs of SNAP and the Illumina product file. We did not find any ‘false positive’ SNPs (SNPs specified as available in the Cardio-Metabochip by SNAP, but not by the Cardio-Metabochip Illumina file). The Cohen’s Kappa coefficient, which calculates the percentage of agreement between both methods, indicated that the validity of SNAP was fair to moderate depending on the reference used (the HapMap 3 or 1000 Genomes). In conclusion, we demonstrate that the SNAP outputs for the Cardio-Metabochip are invalid. This study illustrates the importance of systematically assessing the validity of bioinformatics tools in an independent manner. We propose a series of guidelines to improve practices in the fast-moving field of bioinformatics software implementation."

To combat emerging avian influenza virus, an inexpensive, heat-stable, and orally administered influenza vaccine would be useful to vaccinate large commercial poultry flocks and even migratory birds. Our hypothesized vaccine is a recombinant attenuated bacterial strain able to mediate production of attenuated influenza virus in vivo to induce protective immunity against influenza. Here we report the feasibility and technical limitations toward such an ideal vaccine based on our exploratory study. Five 8-unit plasmids carrying a chloramphenicol resistance gene or free of an antibiotic resistance marker were constructed. Influenza virus was successfully generated in avian cells transfected by each of the plasmids. The Salmonella carrier was engineered to allow stable maintenance and conditional release of the 8-unit plasmid into the avian cells for recovery of influenza virus. Influenza A virus up to 107 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml were recovered from 11 out of 26 co-cultures of chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells upon infection by the recombinant Salmonella carrying the 8-unit plasmid. Our data prove that a bacterial carrier can mediate generation of influenza virus by delivering its DNA cargoes into permissive host cells. Although we have made progress in developing this Salmonella influenza virus vaccine delivery system, further improvements are necessary to achieve efficient virus production, especially in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2151111626,"A major complication of peritoneal dialysis is the development of peritonitis, which is associated with reduced technique and patient survival. The inflammatory response elicited by infection results in a fibrin and debris-rich environment within the peritoneal cavity, which may reduce the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents and predispose to recurrence or relapse of infection. Strategies to enhance responses to antimicrobial agents therefore have the potential to improve patient outcomes. This study presents pre-clinical data describing the compatibility of tPA and DNase in combination with antimicrobial agents used for the treatment of PD peritonitis. tPA and DNase were stable in standard dialysate solution and in the presence of antimicrobial agents, and were safe when given intraperitoneally in a mouse model with no evidence of local or systemic toxicity. Adjunctive tPA and DNase may have a role in the management of patients presenting with PD peritonitis."
https://openalex.org/W2086622357,"Background To use combinatorial epitope mapping (“fingerprinting”) of the antibody response to identify targets of the humoral immune response in patients with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder. Methods A combinatorial random peptide library was screened on the circulating pool of immunoglobulins purified from an index patient with a high risk TCC (pTa high grade plus carcinoma in situ) to identify corresponding target antigens. A patient cohort was investigated for antibody titers against ubiquitin. Results We selected, isolated, and validated an immunogenic peptide motif from ubiquitin as a dominant epitope of the humoral response. Patients with TCC had significantly higher antibody titers against ubiquitin than healthy donors (p<0.007), prostate cancer patients (p<0.0007), and all patients without TCC taken together (p<0.0001). Titers from superficial tumors were not significantly different from muscle invasive tumors (p = 0.0929). For antibody response against ubiquitin, sensitivity for detection of TCC was 0.44, specificity 0.96, positive predictive value 0.96 and negative predictive value 0.41. No significant titer changes were observed during the standard BCG induction immunotherapy. Conclusions This is the first report to demonstrate an anti-ubiquitin antibody response in patients with TCC. Although sensitivity of antibody production was low, a high specificity and positive predictive value make ubiquitin an interesting candidate for further diagnostic and possibly immune modulating studies."
