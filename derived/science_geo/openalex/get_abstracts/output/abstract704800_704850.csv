https://openalex.org/W4310058387,"Programmable genome integration of large, diverse DNA cargo without DNA repair of exposed DNA double-strand breaks remains an unsolved challenge in genome editing. We present programmable addition via site-specific targeting elements (PASTE), which uses a CRISPR–Cas9 nickase fused to both a reverse transcriptase and serine integrase for targeted genomic recruitment and integration of desired payloads. We demonstrate integration of sequences as large as ~36 kilobases at multiple genomic loci across three human cell lines, primary T cells and non-dividing primary human hepatocytes. To augment PASTE, we discovered 25,614 serine integrases and cognate attachment sites from metagenomes and engineered orthologs with higher activity and shorter recognition sequences for efficient programmable integration. PASTE has editing efficiencies similar to or exceeding those of homology-directed repair and non-homologous end joining-based methods, with activity in non-dividing cells and in vivo with fewer detectable off-target events. PASTE expands the capabilities of genome editing by allowing large, multiplexed gene insertion without reliance on DNA repair pathways. Large sequences are integrated site specifically into the human genome without double-strand DNA cleavage."

It is difficult to create effective prepandemic vaccines because it is uncertain which influenza virus subtype will cause the next pandemic. In this work, we developed a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA)-lipid nanoparticle vaccine encoding hemagglutinin antigens from all 20 known influenza A virus subtypes and influenza B virus lineages. This multivalent vaccine elicited high levels of cross-reactive and subtype-specific antibodies in mice and ferrets that reacted to all 20 encoded antigens. Vaccination protected mice and ferrets challenged with matched and mismatched viral strains, and this protection was at least partially dependent on antibodies. Our studies indicate that mRNA vaccines can provide protection against antigenically variable viruses by simultaneously inducing antibodies against multiple antigens."
https://openalex.org/W4310251770,"Grazing represents the most extensive use of land worldwide. Yet its impacts on ecosystem services remain uncertain because pervasive interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil properties, and biodiversity may occur but have never been addressed simultaneously. Using a standardized survey at 98 sites across six continents, we show that interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil, and biodiversity are critical to explain the delivery of fundamental ecosystem services across drylands worldwide. Increasing grazing pressure reduced ecosystem service delivery in warmer and species-poor drylands, whereas positive effects of grazing were observed in colder and species-rich areas. Considering interactions between grazing and local abiotic and biotic factors is key for understanding the fate of dryland ecosystems under climate change and increasing human pressure."

https://openalex.org/W4310075481,"CRISPR-Cas systems are host-encoded pathways that protect microbes from viral infection using an adaptive RNA-guided mechanism. Using genome-resolved metagenomics, we find that CRISPR systems are also encoded in diverse bacteriophages, where they occur as divergent and hypercompact anti-viral systems. Bacteriophage-encoded CRISPR systems belong to all six known CRISPR-Cas types, though some lack crucial components, suggesting alternate functional roles or host complementation. We describe multiple new Cas9-like proteins and 44 families related to type V CRISPR-Cas systems, including the Casλ RNA-guided nuclease family. Among the most divergent of the new enzymes identified, Casλ recognizes double-stranded DNA using a uniquely structured CRISPR RNA (crRNA). The Casλ-RNA-DNA structure determined by cryoelectron microscopy reveals a compact bilobed architecture capable of inducing genome editing in mammalian, Arabidopsis, and hexaploid wheat cells. These findings reveal a new source of CRISPR-Cas enzymes in phages and highlight their value as genome editors in plant and human cells."
https://openalex.org/W4310251915,"Catalysts based on platinum group metals have been a major focus of the chemical industry for decades. We show that plasmonic photocatalysis can transform a thermally unreactive, earth-abundant transition metal into a catalytically active site under illumination. Fe active sites in a Cu-Fe antenna-reactor complex achieve efficiencies very similar to Ru for the photocatalytic decomposition of ammonia under ultrafast pulsed illumination. When illuminated with light-emitting diodes rather than lasers, the photocatalytic efficiencies remain comparable, even when the scale of reaction increases by nearly three orders of magnitude. This result demonstrates the potential for highly efficient, electrically driven production of hydrogen from an ammonia carrier with earth-abundant transition metals."

https://openalex.org/W4310075492,"CRISPR-Cas systems have been co-opted by Tn7-like transposable elements to direct RNA-guided transposition. Type V-K CRISPR-associated transposons rely on the concerted activities of the pseudonuclease Cas12k, the AAA+ ATPase TnsC, the Zn-finger protein TniQ, and the transposase TnsB. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopic structure of a target DNA-bound Cas12k-transposon recruitment complex comprised of RNA-guided Cas12k, TniQ, a polymeric TnsC filament and, unexpectedly, the ribosomal protein S15. Complex assembly, mediated by a network of interactions involving the guide RNA, TniQ, and S15, results in R-loop completion. TniQ contacts two TnsC protomers at the Cas12k-proximal filament end, likely nucleating its polymerization. Transposition activity assays corroborate our structural findings, implying that S15 is a bona fide component of the type V crRNA-guided transposon machinery. Altogether, our work uncovers key mechanistic aspects underpinning RNA-mediated assembly of CRISPR-associated transposons to guide their development as programmable tools for site-specific insertion of large DNA payloads."
https://openalex.org/W4309933528,"Despite recent advances in fluid biomarker research in Alzheimer's disease (AD), there are no fluid biomarkers or imaging tracers with utility for diagnosis and/or theragnosis available for other tauopathies. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we show that 4 repeat (4R) isoform-specific tau species from microtubule-binding region (MTBR-tau275 and MTBR-tau282) increase in the brains of corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-MAPT and AD but decrease inversely in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of CBD, FTLD-MAPT and AD compared to control and other FTLD-tau (for example, Pick's disease). CSF MTBR-tau measures are reproducible in repeated lumbar punctures and can be used to distinguish CBD from control (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) = 0.889) and other FTLD-tau, such as PSP (AUC = 0.886). CSF MTBR-tau275 and MTBR-tau282 may represent the first affirmative biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of primary tauopathies and facilitate clinical trial designs."

https://openalex.org/W4308430559,"In prokaryotes, CRISPR-Cas systems provide adaptive immune responses against foreign genetic elements through RNA-guided nuclease activity. Recently, additional genes with non-nuclease functions have been found in genetic association with CRISPR systems, suggesting that there may be other RNA-guided non-nucleolytic enzymes. One such gene from Desulfonema ishimotonii encodes the TPR-CHAT protease Csx29, which is associated with the CRISPR effector Cas7-11. Here, we demonstrate that this CRISPR-associated protease (CASP) exhibits programmable RNA-activated endopeptidase activity against a sigma factor inhibitor to regulate a transcriptional response. Cryo-electron microscopy of an active and substrate-bound CASP complex reveals an allosteric activation mechanism that reorganizes Csx29 catalytic residues upon target RNA binding. This work reveals an RNA-guided function in nature that can be leveraged for RNA-sensing applications in vitro and in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W4310071929,"Searches for the genetic underpinnings of uniquely human traits have focused on human-specific divergence in conserved genomic regions, which reflects adaptive modifications of existing functional elements. However, the study of conserved regions excludes functional elements that descended from previously neutral regions. Here, we demonstrate that the fastest-evolved regions of the human genome, which we term ""human ancestor quickly evolved regions"" (HAQERs), rapidly diverged in an episodic burst of directional positive selection prior to the human-Neanderthal split, before transitioning to constraint within hominins. HAQERs are enriched for bivalent chromatin states, particularly in gastrointestinal and neurodevelopmental tissues, and genetic variants linked to neurodevelopmental disease. We developed a multiplex, single-cell in vivo enhancer assay to discover that rapid sequence divergence in HAQERs generated hominin-unique enhancers in the developing cerebral cortex. We propose that a lack of pleiotropic constraints and elevated mutation rates poised HAQERs for rapid adaptation and subsequent susceptibility to disease."

https://openalex.org/W4308430750,"The type III-E CRISPR-Cas7-11 effector binds a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and the putative protease Csx29 and catalyzes crRNA-guided RNA cleavage. We report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Cas7-11-crRNA-Csx29 complex with and without target RNA (tgRNA), and demonstrate that tgRNA binding induces conformational changes in Csx29. Biochemical experiments revealed tgRNA-dependent cleavage of the accessory protein Csx30 by Csx29. Reconstitution of the system in bacteria showed that Csx30 cleavage yields toxic protein fragments that cause growth arrest, which is regulated by Csx31. Csx30 binds Csx31 and the associated sigma factor RpoE (RNA polymerase, extracytoplasmic E), suggesting that Csx30-mediated RpoE inhibition modulates the cellular response to infection. We engineered the Cas7-11-Csx29-Csx30 system for programmable RNA sensing in mammalian cells. Overall, the Cas7-11-Csx29 effector is an RNA-dependent nuclease-protease."
https://openalex.org/W4310251689,"Neurons use local protein synthesis to support their morphological complexity, which requires independent control across multiple subcellular compartments up to the level of individual synapses. We identify a signaling pathway that regulates the local synthesis of proteins required to form excitatory synapses on parvalbumin-expressing (PV + ) interneurons in the mouse cerebral cortex. This process involves regulation of the TSC subunit 2 (Tsc2) by the Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ErbB4), which enables local control of messenger RNA {mRNA} translation in a cell type–specific and synapse type–specific manner. Ribosome-associated mRNA profiling reveals a molecular program of synaptic proteins downstream of ErbB4 signaling required to form excitatory inputs on PV + interneurons. Thus, specific connections use local protein synthesis to control synapse formation in the nervous system."

Building on pediatric parainfluenza virus vaccines in clinical development, we generated a live-attenuated parainfluenza-virus-vectored vaccine candidate expressing SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike (S) protein (B/HPIV3/S-6P) and evaluated its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in rhesus macaques. A single intranasal/intratracheal dose of B/HPIV3/S-6P induced strong S-specific airway mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG responses. High levels of S-specific antibodies were also induced in serum, which efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern of alpha, beta, and delta lineages, while their ability to neutralize Omicron sub-lineages was lower. Furthermore, B/HPIV3/S-6P induced robust systemic and pulmonary S-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, including tissue-resident memory cells in the lungs. Following challenge, SARS-CoV-2 replication was undetectable in airways and lung tissues of immunized macaques. B/HPIV3/S-6P will be evaluated clinically as pediatric intranasal SARS-CoV-2/parainfluenza virus type 3 vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4310251692,"Water is essential for survival, but one in three individuals worldwide (2.2 billion people) lacks access to safe drinking water. Water intake requirements largely reflect water turnover (WT), the water used by the body each day. We investigated the determinants of human WT in 5604 people from the ages of 8 days to 96 years from 23 countries using isotope-tracking (2H) methods. Age, body size, and composition were significantly associated with WT, as were physical activity, athletic status, pregnancy, socioeconomic status, and environmental characteristics (latitude, altitude, air temperature, and humidity). People who lived in countries with a low human development index (HDI) had higher WT than people in high-HDI countries. On the basis of this extensive dataset, we provide equations to predict human WT in relation to anthropometric, economic, and environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W4310060314,"Abstract Somatic structural variants (SVs) are widespread in cancer, but their impact on disease evolution is understudied due to a lack of methods to directly characterize their functional consequences. We present a computational method, scNOVA, which uses Strand-seq to perform haplotype-aware integration of SV discovery and molecular phenotyping in single cells by using nucleosome occupancy to infer gene expression as a readout. Application to leukemias and cell lines identifies local effects of copy-balanced rearrangements on gene deregulation, and consequences of SVs on aberrant signaling pathways in subclones. We discovered distinct SV subclones with dysregulated Wnt signaling in a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient. We further uncovered the consequences of subclonal chromothripsis in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which revealed c-Myb activation, enrichment of a primitive cell state and informed successful targeting of the subclone in cell culture, using a Notch inhibitor. By directly linking SVs to their functional effects, scNOVA enables systematic single-cell multiomic studies of structural variation in heterogeneous cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W4310074701,"Natural and induced somatic mutations that accumulate in the genome during development record the phylogenetic relationships of cells; whether these lineage barcodes capture the complex dynamics of progenitor states remains unclear. We introduce quantitative fate mapping, an approach to reconstruct the hierarchy, commitment times, population sizes, and commitment biases of intermediate progenitor states during development based on a time-scaled phylogeny of their descendants. To reconstruct time-scaled phylogenies from lineage barcodes, we introduce Phylotime, a scalable maximum likelihood clustering approach based on a general barcoding mutagenesis model. We validate these approaches using realistic in silico and in vitro barcoding experiments. We further establish criteria for the number of cells that must be analyzed for robust quantitative fate mapping and a progenitor state coverage statistic to assess the robustness. This work demonstrates how lineage barcodes, natural or synthetic, enable analyzing progenitor fate and dynamics long after embryonic development in any organism."
https://openalex.org/W4309766511,"The cholesterol metabolites, oxysterols, play central roles in cholesterol feedback control. They modulate the activity of two master transcription factors that control cholesterol homeostatic responses, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) and liver X receptor (LXR). Although the role of exogenous oxysterols in regulating these transcription factors has been well established, whether endogenously synthesized oxysterols similarly control both SREBP-2 and LXR remains poorly explored. Here, we carefully validate the role of oxysterols enzymatically synthesized within cells in cholesterol homeostatic responses. We first show that SREBP-2 responds more sensitively to exogenous oxysterols than LXR in Chinese hamster ovary cells and rat primary hepatocytes. We then show that 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), 27-hydroxycholesterol, and 24S-hydroxycholesterol endogenously synthesized by CH25H, CYP27A1, and CYP46A1, respectively, suppress SREBP-2 activity at different degrees by stabilizing Insig (insulin-induced gene) proteins, whereas 7α-hydroxycholesterol has little impact on SREBP-2. These results demonstrate the role of site-specific hydroxylation of endogenous oxysterols. In contrast, the expression of CH25H, CYP46A1, CYP27A1, or CYP7A1 fails to induce LXR target gene expression. We also show the 25-HC production-dependent suppression of SREBP-2 using a tetracycline-inducible CH25H expression system. To induce 25-HC production physiologically, murine macrophages are stimulated with a Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, and its effect on SREBP-2 and LXR is examined. The results also suggest that de novo synthesis of 25-HC preferentially regulates SREBP-2 activity. Finally, we quantitatively determine the specificity of the four cholesterol hydroxylases in living cells. Based on our current findings, we conclude that endogenous side-chain oxysterols primarily regulate the activity of SREBP-2, not LXR."
https://openalex.org/W4309767527,"Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulates gene expression by promoting the formation of a β-catenin–T-cell factor (TCF) complex on target enhancers. In addition to TCFs, other transcription factors interact with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway at different levels to produce tissue-specific patterns of Wnt target gene expression. The transcription factor SOX9 potently represses many Wnt target genes by downregulating β-catenin protein levels. Here, we find using colony formation and cell growth assays that SOX9 surprisingly promotes the proliferation of Wnt-driven colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. In contrast to how it indirectly represses Wnt targets, SOX9 directly co-occupies and activates multiple Wnt-responsive enhancers in CRC cells. Our examination of the binding site grammar of these enhancers shows the presence of TCF and SOX9 binding sites that are necessary for transcriptional activation. In addition, we identify a physical interaction between the DNA-binding domains of TCFs and SOX9 and show that TCF-SOX9 interactions are important for target gene regulation and CRC cell growth. Our work demonstrates a highly context-dependent effect of SOX9 on Wnt targets, with the presence or absence of SOX9-binding sites on Wnt-regulated enhancers determining whether they are directly activated or indirectly repressed by SOX9.

Transcriptional regulation by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is essential for metazoan development and homeostasis (1Clevers H. Loh K.M. Nusse R. An integral program for tissue renewal and regeneration: Wnt signaling and stem cell control.Science. 2014; 3461248012Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), and the transcription factors (TFs) of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor family (TCF/LEF family or TCFs) are major effectors of this signaling cascade (2Ramakrishnan A.-B. Cadigan K.M. Wnt target genes and where to find them.F1000Res. 2017; 6: 746Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Clusters of TCF-binding sites are characteristic of many Wnt-regulated elements (WREs), the cis-regulatory DNA elements that drive Wnt-responsive transcription (3Archbold H.C. Yang Y.X. Chen L. Cadigan K.M. How do they do Wnt they do?: regulation of transcription by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.Acta Physiol. 2012; 204: 74-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). WRE activation is triggered by the Wnt-dependent stabilization and accumulation of the protein β-catenin, which is recruited to WREs by TCFs. β-catenin recruits coactivators to induce Wnt target gene transcription (2Ramakrishnan A.-B.

Signaling by Wnt proteins performs many essential developmental functions that do not involve transcriptional regulation through β-catenin (5Acebron S.P.

For brevity, we use the phrases “Wnt signaling” and “Wnt target gene” in this study to refer to Wnt signaling through β-catenin and genes regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. While TCFs mediate Wnt target gene activation across cell types, there is great spatiotemporal diversity in the identity of Wnt target genes, with different tissues expressing unique cell type–specific Wnt transcriptional programs. This specificity is thought to arise from interactions between TCFs and other TFs that help determine cell fate and identity. Many non-TCF TFs bind to WREs and affect Wnt target gene expression, but a comprehensive molecular understanding of how these TFs generate target gene specificity is still incomplete (7Nakamura Y.

One well-studied example is TFs of the CDX family, which bind to several WREs and recruit TCFs to them (9Lewis A. Freeman-Mills L. de la Calle-Mustienes E. Giráldez-Pérez R.M. Davis H.

SOX9 has essential functions in the development of cartilage and the skeletal system, and mutations in SOX9 are associated with sex reversal and severe skeletal deformities in humans (16Lefebvre V.

Sex determination involves synergistic action of SRY and SF1 on a specific Sox9 enhancer.Nature. 2008; 453: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that testis or ovary commitment in mammalian gonadal development involves a mutual opposition between the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which promotes ovarian development and inhibits testis fate, and SOX9, which inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to promote testes growth (19Nicol B.

Although primarily characterized as a repressor of Wnt/β-catenin target genes, correlative evidence hints at a more complex relationship between SOX9 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the intestinal epithelium and in colorectal cancer (CRC). The villi of the intestinal epithelium consist of short lived terminally differentiated cells that are continuously replenished from a population of intestinal epithelial stem cells. The proliferation of these stem cells and the differentiation of the Paneth cells, which surround and metabolically support them, are both dependent on Wnt/β-catenin signaling (24van Es J.H. Jay P.

Understanding the relationship between SOX9 and Wnt signaling in this context requires an understanding of the regulatory logic of target gene WREs regulated by both factors. Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in intestinal stem cells leads to uncontrolled proliferation, and consequently, activating mutations in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway are major drivers of CRC (4Clevers H.

Additionally, mutations that increase the activity of WREs that regulate oncogenes such as MYC are also associated with increased cancer risk (33Dave K. Sur I. Yan J. Zhang J. Kaasinen E.

The findings of SOX9 promoting Paneth cell fate and CRC cell survival are at odds with models of SOX9 as a Wnt/β-catenin pathway repressor. In this study, we interrogate the relationship between SOX9 and Wnt signaling in regulating gene expression. In contrast to its previously known role as a repressor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we show that SOX9 and Wnt signaling work together to promote the growth and survival of CRC cells. Among the target genes activated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling and SOX9 is the oncogene MYC. In CRC cells, SOX9 is associated with many WREs, including several cancer risk-associated enhancers of MYC. Our characterization of the cis-regulatory grammar that allows SOX9 to activate Wnt target genes reveals the presence of SOX9-binding sites in the c-myc-335 WRE, which regulate enhancer activity along with TCF sites. A similar regulatory logic is also seen in the promoters of Defa5 and Defa6, two markers of Paneth cells, that are synergistically upregulated under high Wnt, high SOX9 conditions. With reporter mutagenesis and synthetic reporters, we show that the combination of TCF- and SOX-binding sites is necessary and sufficient for synergistic activation by Wnt and SOX9. Mechanistically, we show that SOX9 directly binds to TCFs. Through a novel SOX9 separation-of-function mutant that is defective in TCF binding, we show that the activation of WREs and CRC cell growth both require not just the activities of TCFs and SOX9 but also the activity of a TCF-SOX9 complex. Our work demonstrates that in addition to its role as a repressor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, SOX9 works together with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to activate a subset of Wnt target genes. To explore the roles of SOX9 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC, we tested the consequences of depleting SOX9 and/or β-catenin in LS174T CRC cells. These cells contain an activating mutation in β-catenin (S45F) and are dependent on Wnt signaling for their growth and survival (41van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Fong M.T.P. Brantjes H.

We used LS174T cells containing a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible β-catenin shRNA expression cassette (41van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Fong M.T.P. Brantjes H. Leenen D. van et al.Specific inhibition of gene expression using a stably integrated, inducible small-interfering-RNA vector.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) (referred to as LS174T-pTER-β-cat cells) and transduced them with constructs expressing either nontargeting (Scrambled) or SOX9-targeting shRNAs (Table S1). Western blots showed reduced SOX9 expression in the two SOX9 shRNA lines (Fig. 1A, lanes 2,3). This reduction of SOX9 protein levels was not accompanied by an upregulation of β-catenin protein, as would be expected if SOX9 was promoting β-catenin turnover (Fig. 1A, lanes 2,3). This suggested that SOX9 does not repress β-catenin levels in these cells. SOX9 protein levels were not affected by β-catenin depletion, suggesting that SOX9 is not a target of Wnt signaling in these cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1,4). To understand whether SOX9 and Wnt signaling worked together to promote the survival of LS174T-pTER-β-cat cells, we tested for a SOX9 requirement in a colony formation assay with and without DOX-induced β-catenin depletion. Knocking down SOX9 alone resulted in fewer colonies, and the combined depletion of β-catenin and SOX9 reduced the clonogenicity of these cells even further (Fig. 1, B and C). We then tested the impact of Wnt signaling and SOX9 on the growth rate of these cells. We treated cells with or without DOX for 48 h and measured metabolic activity as a proxy for cell number using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The depletion of β-catenin or SOX9 led to slower growth, and combined depletion of β-catenin and SOX9 reduced growth 4- to 5-fold (Fig. 1D). To ensure that our findings were not specific to LS174T cells, we also tested the role of SOX9 in promoting the survival of DLD-1 cells. DLD-1 cells also have elevated levels of Wnt signaling, but unlike LS174T cells, express a WT β-catenin protein and a truncated form of the destruction complex component APC (43Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. et al.Axin, a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, directly interacts with adenomatous polyposis coli and regulates the stabilization of β-catenin∗.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10823-10826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In DLD-1 cells, SOX9 depletion caused a 3-fold reduction in colony formation (Fig. 1, E and F). Just like in LS174T cells, SOX9 depletion did not cause an upregulation of β-catenin protein levels, and the inhibition of Wnt signaling through a dominant negative TCF (dnTCF) construct (44van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. et al.The β-catenin/TCF-4 complex imposes a crypt progenitor phenotype on colorectal cancer cells.Cell. 2002; 111: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar) did not reduce SOX9 protein levels (Fig. S1A). We then examined the importance of Wnt signaling and SOX9 across a panel of CRC lines using data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (45Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N. Venkatesan K.

McDonald E.R. et al.Next-generation characterization of the cancer cell line Encyclopedia.Nature. 2019; 569: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). First, we examined gene expression data and correlated it with dependency scores calculated from CRISPR KO experiments using the Chronos algorithm (47Dempster J.M. Boyle I. Vazquez F. Root D.E. Boehm J.S. Hahn W.C. et al.Chronos: a cell population dynamics model of CRISPR experiments that improves inference of gene fitness effects.Genome Biol. 2021; 22: 343Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As expected in CRC, 49/53 lines examined showed high β-catenin (CTNNB1) expression and dependence based on our cutoffs (Fig. S1B). A similar analysis for SOX9 revealed that 38/53 lines showed high SOX9 expression and SOX9-dependent growth (Fig. S1C). Dependence on SOX9 was highly correlated with β-catenin-dependence, with 40/56 lines being highly dependent on both β-catenin and SOX9 (Fig. S1D). As a negative control, we looked at SOX17, which represses Wnt targets and inhibits the proliferation of CRC cells (13Sinner D. Kordich J.J. Spence J.R. Opoka R. Rankin S. Lin S.-C.J. et al.Sox17 and Sox4 differentially regulate β-catenin/T-cell factor Activity and proliferation of colon carcinoma cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7802-7815Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Just 2/56 lines showed a dependence on both genes (Fig. S1E). Across all cancers in the CCLE database (n = 1070), β-catenin was the seventh-most correlated gene with SOX9 in terms of essentiality (Fig. S1F). In conjunction with our experimental data, these analyses strongly indicated that Wnt signaling and SOX9 working together was a general feature of CRC. Since both Wnt signaling and SOX9 are major regulators of transcription, we wondered whether SOX9 could cooperate with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to activate a common transcriptional program in CRC. One of the best-characterized Wnt targets in the context of CRC is the MYC oncogene (48Van der Flier L.G. Sabates–Bellver J. Oving I. Haegebarth A. De Palo M. Anti M. et al.The intestinal Wnt/TCF signature.Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 628-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), which is regulated by several WREs associated with CRC risk (33Dave K.

Zhong F. et al.Mice deficient of Myc super-enhancer region reveal differential control mechanism between normal and pathological growth.eLife. 2017; 6e23382Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In DLD-1 cells, MYC transcripts were downregulated by the combination of SOX9 knockdown and Wnt inhibition by dnTCF (Fig. 1G). After finding that MYC transcript levels were upregulated by Wnt signaling and SOX9, we wanted to study the regulatory interactions that allowed SOX9 to activate this Wnt target. One of the best-characterized WREs regulating MYC is the c-myc-335 enhancer containing a SNP (rs6983267) that increases CRC risk in humans and is regulated by TCF activity (11Ramakrishnan A.-B.

Examination of a previously published SOX9 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) dataset (51Shi Z. Chiang C.-I. Labhart P. Zhao Y. Yang J. Mistretta T.-A. et al.Context-specific role of SOX9 in NF-Y mediated gene regulation in colorectal cancer cells.Nucl. Acids Res. 2015; 43: 6257-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that c-myc-335 was bound by SOX9 in HT-29 CRC cells (Fig. 2A). We verified this result in LS174T cells by performing ChIP using antibodies against β-catenin and SOX9. To detect ChIP enrichment, we compared quantitative PCR (qPCR) signals from primers located inside the enhancer to those from two primer sets flanking the enhancer (Fig. 2B) and found that β-catenin and SOX9 were both enriched at the enhancer (Fig. 2C). Previous work from our group had generated a luciferase reporter driven by c-myc-335, which showed Wnt-dependent activity (11Ramakrishnan A.-B. Chen L. Burby P.E. Cadigan K.M. Wnt target enhancer regulation by a CDX/TCF transcription factor collective and a novel DNA motif.Nucl. Acids Res. 2021; 49: 8625-8641Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In LS174T cells, we found that RNAi-mediated SOX9 depletion reduced c-myc-335 reporter activity (Fig. 2D). Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibition with dnTCF repressed, while SOX9 overexpression activated the c-myc-335 reporter (Fig. 2E). In combination with the ChIP data, these results were consistent with a model of SOX9 directly binding and activating this enhancer in conjunction with TCFs and β-catenin. To understand how SOX9 was recruited to this enhancer, we searched its sequence for potential SOX9-binding sites. Our previous work on the cis-regulatory logic of c-myc-335 had identified four TCF-binding sites, two sites bound by CDX proteins, and five repeated motifs, we named CAG sites, all of which contributed to enhancer activity (11Ramakrishnan A.-B. Chen L. Burby P.E. Cadigan K.M. Wnt target enhancer regulation by a CDX/TCF transcription factor collective and a novel DNA motif.Nucl.

Using SOX9-binding site data from the JASPAR database, we scanned the c-myc-335 sequence for putative clusters of SOX9-binding sites. This search identified a pair of putative SOX-binding sites located adjacently in an inverted repeat orientation (Figs. 2F and S1A). The ability of SOX9 to dimerize and bind DNA is an importan"

For nonplanar surfaces, incompatibility with conventional microlithography requires the transfer of originally planar micropatterns onto those surfaces; however, existing approaches accommodate only limited curvatures. A microtransfer approach was developed using reflowable materials that transform between solid and liquid on demand, freely stretching to yield transfers that naturally conform down to nanoscale radii of curvature and arbitrarily complex topographies. Such reflow transfer helps generalize microprinting, extending the reach of precision planar microlithography to highly nonplanar substrates and microstructures. With gentle water-based processing, reflow transfer can be applied to a range of materials, with microprinting demonstrated onto metal, plastic, paper, glass, polystyrene, semiconductor, elastomer, hydrogel, and multiple biological surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W4310061960,"Correlations are fundamental in describing many-body systems. However, in experiments, correlations are notoriously difficult to assess on a microscopic scale, especially for electron spins. Even though it is firmly established theoretically that the electrons in a Cooper pair1 of a superconductor form maximally spin-entangled singlet states with opposite spin projections2–4, no spin correlation experiments have been demonstrated so far. Here we report the direct measurement of the spin cross-correlations between the currents of a Cooper pair splitter5–13, an electronic device that emits electrons originating from Cooper pairs. We use ferromagnetic split-gates14,15, compatible with nearby superconducting structures, to individually spin polarize the transmissions of the quantum dots in the two electronic paths, which act as tunable spin filters. The signals are detected in standard transport and in highly sensitive transconductance experiments. We find that the spin cross-correlation is negative, consistent with spin singlet emission, and deviates from the ideal value mostly due to the overlap of the Zeeman split quantum dot states. Our results demonstrate a new route to perform spin correlation experiments in nano-electronic devices, especially suitable for those relying on magnetic field sensitive superconducting elements, like triplet or topologically non-trivial superconductors16–18, or to perform Bell tests with massive particles19,20. Spin correlation experiments are demonstrated in an electron entangler device based on the ‘splitting’ of Cooper pairs from a superconductor, which can potentially be used to investigate many fundamental phases and processes related to the electron spin."

Perhaps the most widely studied of these monosaccharide transporters is SLC2A1, encoding GLUT1, which is widely expressed in many cells and tissue types, but plays an especially critical role in blood–brain barrier D-glucose transport (6Tang M.

Unlike D-glucose, membrane transport of L-fucose in humans has not garnered interest despite several studies showing the clinical benefits of oral L-fucose in treating leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II [OMIM 266265], GFUS-CDG, and certain cancers (8Hullen A.

Cellular fucosylation in mammals can be achieved via two mechanisms, de novo synthesis or salvage/recycling of L-fucose. The de novo pathway utilizes glucose as a substrate to generate GDP-fucose and requires two enzymes, GMDS and GFUS, whereas the salvage/(recycled) incorporates fucose directly into GDP-fucose and requires FCSK and FPGT (10Schneider M. Al-Shareffi E. Haltiwanger R.S. Biological functions of fucose in mammals.Glycobiology. 2017; 27: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Since exogenous L-fucose is a therapeutic, we sought to identify an L-fucose transporter by developing a cell-based fluorescence assay using HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, which are deficient in the de novo GDP-fucose synthesis enzyme GMDS (11Moriwaki K. Noda K. Furukawa Y. Ohshima K. Uchiyama A.

These cells utilize an L-fucose salvage pathway that requires exogenous L-fucose to produce fucosylated N- and O-glycans (12Sosicka P. Ng B.G. Pepi L.E. Shajahan A. Wong M. Scott D.A. et al.Origin of cytoplasmic GDP-fucose determines its contribution to glycosylation reactions.J. Cell Biol. 2022; 221e202205038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). We screened an siRNA library of 140 SLC family members, including the Major Facilitator Superfamily of transporters known to transport other sugars, in order to identify candidates affecting the ability of L-fucose to enable fucosylation in HCT116 cells. Surprisingly, we found that GLUT1 significantly contributes to transport of L-fucose at low micromolar levels but mM levels of D-glucose do not compete. We show that loss of GLUT1 via chemical inhibitors, siRNA knockdown, and complete gene KO all result in similar loss of L-fucose uptake. In addition, we found that macropinocytosis and another, yet to be identified transporter, provide exogenous L-fucose, as well. Since HCT116 cells lack a functional de novo pathway, fucosylation is dependent on exogenous L-fucose. We used these cells to screen an siRNA library of approximately 140 genes (140 transporters and three positive controls) to identify a potential L-fucose transporter (Fig. 1B). We used the fucose-specific lectin, Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL), which recognizes α1,2, α1,3, α1,4 (antennae), and α1,6 (core) linked fucose to visualize fucosylation. After optimizing fucose concentration and time (20 μM for 16 h), we performed the screen at 24 and 48 h post siRNA transfection (Fig. 1C). Importantly, siRNA knockdown of three positive controls FCSK, FPGT, and SLC35C1 all showed a significant reduction in AAL reactivity (Fig. 1D). This reduction in these positive controls was used to establish our threshold for potential candidates. Only two candidates had comparable reduction in AAL reactivity; GLUT1 was prioritized since it is a well-established, verified monosaccharide transporter (Fig. 1D). The other candidate from our screen was SLCO4A1, which is annotated to encode for a Na+-independent transporter of organic anions (Fig. 1D). While it is unlikely to transport L-fucose, perhaps it transports molecules generated by fucose degradation such as fuconic acid (13Schachter H. Sarney J. McGuire E.J. Roseman S. Isolation of diphosphopyridine nucleotide-dependent L-fucose dehydrogenase from pork liver.J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4785-4792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BAY-876 is a potent, highly selective, cell-permeable GLUT1 inhibitor. At 20 nM, it reduced D-glucose uptake by 70%, while also reducing L-Fucose uptake by ∼50% (Fig. S1A) (Fig. 2A). Increasing the concentration of BAY-876 from 20 nM to 100 nM or 400 nM did not provide a significant reduction in L-fucose uptake but completely blocked D-glucose uptake (Fig. 2A) (Fig. S1A). This effect is comparable to the GLUT1 pooled siRNA used in the screen. We also tested the effects of another GLUT1 inhibitor, WZB117, which was not as potent as BAY-876 but showed a similar inhibitory trend (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of BAY-876 could be overcome by increasing the concentration of exogenous L-fucose above 25 μM, suggesting a GLUT1-independent mode of entry at higher L-fucose concentrations (Fig. 2A). We hypothesized that at higher L-fucose concentrations, macropinocytosis was a possible explanation for this affect, rather than being solely dependent on a transporter (14Koivusalo M. Welch C. Hayashi H. Scott C.C. Kim M. Alexander T. et al.Amiloride inhibits macropinocytosis by lowering submembranous pH and preventing Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 547-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). This mechanism had been convincingly shown for the uptake and incorporation of Neu5Gc, a form of sialic acid (15Bardor M. Nguyen D.H. Diaz S. Varki A. Mechanism of uptake and incorporation of the non-human sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid into human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4228-4237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Using our high-throughput AAL detection method in HCT116 cells, we show inhibition of macropinocytosis with a nontoxic concentration (≤500 μM) of amiloride was effective in reducing L-fucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner and the combination of BAY-876 with amiloride was additive (Fig. 2, C and D). The combined treatment still permitted some L-fucose uptake, which could suggest another mechanism of entry. However, it should also be noted that amiloride can also act to affect sodium transport and we cannot completely exclude off target effects of this compound. Neither dynasore, which inhibits clathrin-dependent endocytosis, nor methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which inhibits caveolin-dependent endocytosis, affected L-fucose uptake in either the lectin-based assay or 3H-L-fucose uptake (Fig. 2, E and F) (Fig. 3A). In HCT116 cells, increasing concentrations of D-glucose even to hyperphysiological levels had a negligible effect on 3H-L-fucose uptake (Fig. 3B upper panel), suggesting that GLUT1-dependent D-glucose transport does not compete with L-fucose uptake. However, in HepG2 cells, which have a functional de novo biosynthetic pathway, there was an affect at higher D-glucose concentrations, but this is likely due to nonphysiological glucose flux through the fucose de novo pathway diluting of 3H-L-fucose–GDP pools with unlabeled glucose-derived GDP-fucose (Fig. 3B lower panel). As expected, L-glucose, which is not utilized by mammalian cells, has no effect and serves as a control (Fig. 3C upper and lower panel). While complete KO of GLUT1 is not compatible with life, genetically engineered KO cell lines do exist (16Yun J. Rago C. Cheong I. Pagliarini R. Angenendt P. Rajagopalan H. et al.Glucose deprivation contributes to the development of KRAS pathway mutations in tumor cells.Science. 2009; 325: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), as shown by the Western blots of DLD-1 WT and DLD-1 GLUT1 KO colorectal cancer cells (Fig. 4A). DLD-1 WT and DLD-1 GLUT1 KO colorectal cancer cells were simultaneously labeled with 3 μM each of 3H-L-fucose and 14C-2-deoxy-D-glucose to determine the contribution of GLUT1 to their uptake. As expected, when compared to WT cells, GLUT1 KO cells had reduced (∼50%), but not completely absent uptake of 14C-2-deoxy-D-glucose (Fig. 4B Right panel), proving there are other transporters for D-glucose. These same KO cells also showed a ∼60% reduction in 3H-L-fucose uptake compared to WT cells (Fig. 4B Left panel). We phenocopied these reductions on both 14C-2-deoxy-D-glucose and 3H-L-fucose by treating WT cells with BAY-876 (Fig. 4B Right and left panel). Amiloride had no effect on 14C-2-deoxy-D-glucose, while inhibiting ∼50% of 3H-L-fucose (Fig. 4B Right and left panel). Not surprisingly, treating GLUT1 KO cells with BAY-876 alone had a marginal effect on either 14C-2-deoxy-D-glucose or 3H-L-fucose uptake (Fig. 4B Right and left panel). However, there was still 40% to 50% uptake of both, supporting the existence of other, likely transporter-mediated, pathways. To determine whether GLUT1 prefers D-glucose or L-fucose transport at low micromolar levels levels, we simultaneously measured 3H-L-fucose and 14C-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake (pmol/mg protein) in several cell lines. Under these conditions, GLUT1 shows 2- to 3-fold higher preference for glucose except in the hepatocellular carcinoma line HepG2, where the preference is reversed (Fig. 4C). It has been shown oral L-fucose treatment with 50 to 100 mg/kg body weight can raise serum L-fucose levels to 110 to 210 μmol/l (17Marquardt T. Luhn K. Srikrishna G. Freeze H.H. Harms E. Vestweber D. Correction of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II with oral fucose.Blood. 1999; 94: 3976-3985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior studies utilized coupled enzymatic assays to determine L-fucose concentrations in various conditions including cancer that in the healthy group ranged from 6 μM to over 500 μM (18Sharma M. Sharma E. Prabhu V. Pai V.R. D'Souza J M. Harish S. et al.Salivary L-fucose as a biomarker for oral potentially malignant disorders and oral cancer.J. Cancer Res. Ther. 2020; 16: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 19Manchil P.R. Joy E.T. Kiran M.S. Sherubin J.E. Khan M.F. Aravind B.S. Correlation of serum levo-fucose levels as a biomarker with tumor node metastasis staging in oral cancer patients.J. Pharm. Bioallied Sci. 2016; 8: S147-S150PubMed Google Scholar). Given the apparently low μM preference of GLUT1 for L-fucose, we next determined the serum concentrations for 23 unrelated individuals using a validated GC-MS method that allowed us to segregate L-fucose from other monosaccharides (12Sosicka P. Ng B.G. Pepi L.E. Shajahan A. Wong M. Scott D.A. et al.Origin of cytoplasmic GDP-fucose determines its contribution to glycosylation reactions.J. Cell Biol. 2022; 221e202205038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). We show that the average range is near 1.65 μM (Fig. 5) The transport of monosaccharides provides the cell with energy and metabolic precursors used for a diverse range of processes. Understanding how these sugars are transported and utilized becomes especially important since various diseases/disorders (LADII, GFUS-CDG, SLC35A2-CDG, PGM1-CDG, colitis, various cancers) are already using or exploring “monosaccharide therapy” (9Adhikari E. Liu Q. Burton C. Mockabee-Macias A. Lester D.K. Lau E. L-fucose, a sugary regulator of antitumor immunity and immunotherapies.Mol. Carcinog. 2022; 61: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 20Boyer S.W. Johnsen C. Morava E. Nutrition interventions in congenital disorders of glycosylation.Trends Mol.

Li D. et al.Mannose ameliorates experimental colitis by protecting intestinal barrier integrity.Nat. Commun. 2022; 13: 4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Previous work from the 1970s suggests exogenous L-fucose can only contribute ∼10% to total cellular fucosylation pools (22Yurchenco P.D. Atkinson P.H. Fucosyl-glycoprotein and precursor polls in HeLa cells.Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3107-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, this begs the question how such a small contribution could affect the phenotype of a specific disorder. More recent detailed dose-response experiments show this value is greatly underestimated and provides the first real clues to why L-fucose therapy is effective (12Sosicka P. Ng B.G. Pepi L.E. Shajahan A. Wong M. Scott D.A. et al.Origin of cytoplasmic GDP-fucose determines its contribution to glycosylation reactions.J. Cell Biol. 2022; 221e202205038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Using GC-MS, we have determined free serum L-fucose concentrations to be ∼1.65 μM. A putative L-fucose transporter of ∼57 kDa was purified from the mouse brain and was capable of transporting L-fucose in reconstituted liposomes with a Km of ∼3 μM (23Leck J.R. Wiese T.J. Purification and characterization of the L-fucose transporter.Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 37: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This is nearly identical to the size of human GLUT1, which carries a single N-glycan. No further studies have been reported. There are few sources of bioavailable L-fucose in the human diet. It is primarily used for glycoprotein synthesis, rather than energy production, although degradation pathways have been identified (24Chan J.Y. Nwokoro N.A. Schachter H. L-Fucose metabolism in mammals. The conversion of L-fucose to two moles of L-lactate, of L-galactose to L-lactate and glycerate, and of D-arabinose to L-lactate and glycollate.J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7060-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While increasing exogenous L-fucose from 100 μM to >5 mM in hepatocellular carcinoma line, Hep3b, can increase cytosolic GDP-fucose levels, it has no effect on total cellular fucosylation (25Moriwaki K. Noda K. Nakagawa T. Asahi M. Yoshihara H. Taniguchi N. et al.A high expression of GDP-fucose transporter in hepatocellular carcinoma is a key factor for increases in fucosylation.Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Varying exogenous L-fucose concentrations from 2 to 50 μM in multiple cell lines has no effect on the GDP-fucose concentration, showing that the total cytoplasmic pool is tightly regulated (12Sosicka P. Ng B.G. Pepi L.E. Shajahan A. Wong M. Scott D.A. et al.Origin of cytoplasmic GDP-fucose determines its contribution to glycosylation reactions.J. Cell Biol. 2022; 221e202205038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). However, increasing exogenous L-fucose increases its fractional contribution to glycosylation by suppressing the contribution of the de novo pathway (12Sosicka P. Ng B.G. Pepi L.E. Shajahan A. Wong M. Scott D.A. et al.Origin of cytoplasmic GDP-fucose determines its contribution to glycosylation reactions.J. Cell Biol. 2022; 221e202205038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This study provided evidence that the cell can distinguish the origin of L-fucose and segregate those sources into multiple nonhomogenous pools of GDP-fucose for glycosylation. The mode of L-fucose entry (transporter versus micropinocytosis) might also influence its initial catabolism to fuconic acid, further degradation or secretion from the cell. How GLUT1 transports L-fucose and D-glucose in a noncompetitive manner is both unknown and surprising. No previous GLUT1 studies examined L-fucose transport. Based on the measured rate of D-glucose uptake and its flux through GDP-mannose and eventually into glycoproteins, we estimate the maximal contribution of D-glucose for fucosylation is 1 in 50,000 molecules (26Ichikawa M. Scott D.A. Losfeld M.E. Freeze H.H. The metabolic origins of mannose in glycoproteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 6751-6761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). That means that only 2 in 105 transport events or GLUT1 molecules (or a combination of both) would provide enough fucose for full fucosylation, although this number is likely to be much lower. It is plausible that a minor population of GLUT1 molecules distributes into membrane clusters and/or submicrodomains, including lipid rafts that affect its transport activity for L-fucose (27Yan Q. Lu Y. Zhou L. Chen J. Xu H. Cai M. et al.Mechanistic insights into GLUT1 activation and clustering revealed by super-resolution imaging.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 7033-7038Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that an association of GLUT1 with other proteins or metabolism-dependent modification of GLUT1 itself could render it more suitable for transporting L-fucose. Compared to its D-glucose transport at physiological concentrations, only a tiny minority of GLUT1 molecules would be needed to deliver L-fucose for glycosylation. Alternatively, we considered the possibility that a very rare GLUT1 conformation (1/50,000) exists, which in some way prefers L-fucose. Initial molecular modeling (R. Woods, unpublished observations) did not provide any obvious insights. Although, when aligning the known structures for GLUT1 and FucP (fucose transporter in E.coli), there was some suggestion for a potential L-fucose-binding site adjacent to the one for glucose. Further molecular dynamics modeling is a major commitment and was beyond the scope of this study. Further speculation is unwarranted at this time. In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrate that GLUT1 is a highly efficient L-fucose transporter. HCT116, HepG2, and Neuro-2a cells (from ATCC) were grown in 1 g/l glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). DLD-1-WT and DLD-1-GLUT1-KO were maintained in 4.5 g/l glucose DMEM. All media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Lot 20J480) and cells grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2. Lectin staining was performed as described by Sosicka et al. (12Sosicka P. Ng B.G. Pepi L.E. Shajahan A. Wong M. Scott D.A. et al.Origin of cytoplasmic GDP-fucose determines its contribution to glycosylation reactions.J. Cell Biol. 2022; 221e202205038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Instead of biotinylated AAL, FITC-labeled AAL (Vector Laboratories), diluted 1:100, was used. HCT116 cells were used to screen a panel of 143 siRNA (140 transports, three positive controls) and their effect on AAL staining. The initial screens used a pool of four combined siRNA with each candidate subsequently confirmed using individual siRNA. The lectin staining was performed essentially as described by Sosicka et al, except a 384-well format was used instead of 96-well. GLUT1 was inhibited using 100 nM BAY-876 and 150 μM WZB117. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis was inhibited with 36 μM Dynasore. Caveolin-dependent endocytosis was inhibited with 4 mM methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Macropinocytosis was inhibited with 500 μM amiloride. All inhibitors were purchased from the Cayman Chemical. The toxicity of the inhibitors was assessed for each cell line. Prior to adding L-fucose, cells were preincubated with a respective inhibitor (or their combination) for 1 h. L-fucose uptake was measured using L-fucose [5,6-3H] (60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc) that was QAE purified. Experiments were performed in serum-free DMEM 1 g/l glucose medium in 6-well plates. About 10 μCi/ml of radioactive fucose was used in each experiment. About 0.5 ml of the labeling medium was added into each well. Cells were grown in a presence of 5 μM unlabeled L-fucose (Sigma–Aldrich). L-fucose uptake was measured for 1 h. Before collecting cells, they were washed five times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and lysed in 2% SDS. Fifty percent of collected material was counted using a scintillation counter. Samples were normalized based on the protein concentration that was assessed with bicinchoninic acid assay method. To measure an uptake of L-fucose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose at the same time, cells were grown in serum-free, glucose-free DMEM medium in 6-well plates. About 10 μCi/ml of QAE purified 3H-fucose and 0.8 μCi/ml of 2-deoxy-D-glucose [14C(U)] (274 mCi/mmol; Perkin Elemer) was used in each experiment. About 0.5 ml of the labeling medium was added into each well. Cells were grown in a presence of 3 μM unlabeled L-fucose, so the concentration of both fucose and 2-deoxyglucose was the same. Uptake was measured for 2 h. Before collecting cells, they were washed five times with DPBS, scraped, and lysed in 2% SDS. Fifty percent of collected material was counted using a scintillation counter. Samples were normalized based on the protein concentration that was assessed with bicinchoninic acid assay method. To measure L-fucose serum concentration we spiked in 500 pmol of L-[UL-13C6] fucose (Omicron Biochemicals, Inc) to 100 μl of serum. To remove glycoproteins, we first added 400 μl of ice-cold acetone to each sample and incubated them for 16 h at −20 °C. Next, samples were spun down for 30 min, 4 °C, 14,000 rpm and resulting supernatant was dried in SpeedVac. Samples were dissolved in 200 μl of water, loaded on 3 kDa cutoff filters, and spun down for 15 min, 14,000 rpm, room temperature. Next, additional 200 μl of water was loaded on the filter and samples were spun down again. The flow through the filter was collected and dried in SpeedVac. Finally, the samples were derivatized and analyzed with GC-MS as previously described (12Sosicka P. Ng B.G. Pepi L.E. Shajahan A. Wong M.

Binding to the multi-PDZ domain containing protein Par-3 couples the complex to cortical flows that construct the Par membrane domain. Once localized properly, the complex is thought to transition from Par-3 to the Rho GTPase Cdc42 to activate the complex. While this transition is a critical step in Par-mediated polarity, little is known about how it occurs. Here, we used a biochemical reconstitution approach with purified, intact Par complex and qualitative binding assays and found that Par-3 and Cdc42 exhibit strong negative cooperativity for the Par complex. The energetic coupling arises from interactions between the second and third PDZ protein interaction domains of Par-3 and the aPKC Kinase-PBM (PDZ binding motif) that mediate the displacement of Cdc42 from the Par complex. Our results indicate that Par-3, Cdc42, Par-6, and aPKC are the minimal components that are sufficient for this transition to occur and that no external factors are required.

The polarization of animal cells by the Par complex is a highly dynamic, multistep process that begins when actomyosin-generated cortical flows transport membrane-bound Par complex from cellular regions where it is catalytically inactive to a single cortical domain where it becomes activated (1Munro E.

Despite the critical importance of the transition from Par-3 to Cdc42 in the mechanism of Par-mediated polarity, very little is known about how it occurs. While in vivo evidence indicates the Par complex switches from Par-3 to Cdc42-bound states, biochemical evidence suggests that Par-3 and Cdc42 can bind the Par complex simultaneously to form a quaternary complex. A coimmunoprecipitation experiment using cell extracts found that Cdc42-bound Par complexes also contain Par-3 (9Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. The cell-polarity protein Par6 links Par3 and atypical protein kinase C to Cdc42.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Google Scholar). However, in vivo evidence indicate that there are two distinct cortical pools of Par complex, colocalizing with either Par-3 or Cdc42, and loss of Cdc42 increases the amount of Par-3-bound complex (3Aceto D.

Depletion of the co-chaperone CDC-37 reveals two modes of PAR-6 cortical association in C. elegans embryos.Development. 2006; 133: 3745-3754Google Scholar). The reported ability of Cdc42 and Par-3 to bind simultaneously to the Par complex has influenced models for how the transition between the regulators could occur in vivo. In one model, Cdc42 briefly docks onto Par-3-bound Par complex and activates aPKC, resulting in the phosphorylation and release of Par-3 from the complex (23Morais-de-Sá E. Mirouse V. St Johnston D. aPKC phosphorylation of Bazooka defines the apical/lateral border in Drosophila epithelial cells.Cell. 2010; 141: 509-523Google Scholar, 24Walther R.F. Pichaud F.

Knowles P.P. Barnouin K. et al.aPKC inhibition by Par3 CR3 flanking regions controls substrate access and underpins apical-junctional polarization.Dev. Cell. 2016; 38: 384-398Google Scholar). However, recent studies show that phosphorylation of Par-3 by aPKC does not dissociate Par-3 from the Par complex (18Holly R.W. Jones K. Prehoda K.E. A conserved PDZ-binding motif in aPKC interacts with Par-3 and mediates cortical polarity.Curr. Biol. 2020; 30: 893-898.e5Google Scholar, 26Holly R.W. Prehoda K.E. Phosphorylation of par-3 by atypical protein kinase C and competition between its substrates.Dev. Cell. 2019; 49: 678-679Google Scholar). In another proposed model, actomyosin contractility mechanically dissociates Par-3 clusters and facilitates the Par complex transition to Cdc42 (5Rodriguez J. Peglion F. Martin J. Hubatsch L. Reich J. Hirani N. et al.aPKC cycles between functionally distinct PAR protein assemblies to drive cell polarity.Dev. Cell. 2017; 42: 400-415.e9Google Scholar, 20Wang S.-C. Low T.Y.F. Nishimura Y.

A single-cell biochemistry approach reveals PAR complex dynamics during cell polarization.Dev. Cell. 2017; 42: 416-434.e11Google Scholar). Because the available biochemical data suggest that Par-3 and Cdc42 can bind simultaneously to the Par complex, models for the transition between the two regulators necessarily include other mechanisms (e.g., phosphorylation) or cellular components (e.g., actomyosin contractility). However, the limited in vitro evidence is based on results from cell extracts or experiments using truncated proteins. Additionally, the numerous reported interactions between Par-3 and the Par complex have made it challenging to understand how the Par-3-bound Par complex is regulated. Finally, very little structural information is known about the Par complex and whether the Par-3 and Cdc42 binding sites are in close proximity to one another to regulate the formation of these complexes. Here, we have used a biochemical reconstitution approach with purified components to determine the elements sufficient for Par complex switching between Par-3 and Cdc42. The results provide the mechanistic framework for understanding how the Par complex transitions from Par-3 to Cdc42 to form two distinct complexes. Although Par-3 and Cdc42 are thought to form mutually exclusive complexes with the Par complex in vivo, they have been shown to bind simultaneously in a coimmunoprecipitation experiment using cell extracts (9Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. The cell-polarity protein Par6 links Par3 and atypical protein kinase C to Cdc42.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Google Scholar). We examined whether Par-3 and Cdc42 influence one another’s binding to the Par complex using a reconstitution system. We performed a qualitative affinity chromatography (pull-down) assay with purified Par complex and Par-3 PDZ1-APM (a fragment containing all known interaction motifs between Par-3 and Par-6/aPKC) and GST-fused Cdc42Q61L (constitutively active). The binding buffer included ATP to ensure that the aPKC kinase domain did not form a stalled complex with its phosphorylation site on Par-3. We formed a complex of Cdc42-bound Par-6/aPKC by placing GST-Cdc42Q61L on the solid phase and incubating with soluble, purified Par complex. We assessed the effect of Par-3 on the Cdc42-bound Par complex by adding increasing concentrations of Par-3 PDZ1-APM. If Par-3 binding to the Par complex had no effect on Cdc42 binding or the proteins bound with positive cooperativity, we expected that Par-3 would become part of the solid phase complex and the amount of Par complex adhered to the solid phase would stay the same or increase. Alternately, if the Cdc42 and Par-3 binding sites exhibited negative cooperativity, either via direct steric occlusion or an allosteric mechanism, little or no Par-3 would be part of the Cdc42-bound solid phase complex, and the amount of Par complex on the solid phase would decrease (as the affinity of the Par complex for Cdc42 was reduced by binding to Par-3). We observed that addition of Par-3 significantly reduced the amount of Par complex associated with solid phase Cdc42Q61L (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, little or no additional Par-3 appeared in the solid phase relative to a GST control. Our results indicate that in the context of these four proteins, Cdc42 and Par-3 bind with negative cooperativity to Par-6/aPKC. In a system with two distinct binding sites coupled to one another via negative cooperativity, each protein should reduce the affinity of the Par complex for the other. However, the effect of Cdc42 on Par-3 binding to the Par complex is complicated by the many potential Par-3-binding sites on the Par complex (Fig. 1A). In principle, not all Par-3-binding sites could be coupled to Cdc42 binding, a scenario in which addition of Cdc42 to solid phase Par-3-bound Par complex might not significantly alter the amount of solid phase Par complex. To determine if Cdc42 influences Par-3-bound Par complex, we adsorbed Par complex bound to MBP-Par-3 PDZ1-APM to the solid phase and examined the effect of increasing concentrations of Cdc42Q61L. We observed that addition of Cdc42 reduced the amount of Par complex associated with solid phase Par-3 and Cdc42 was not significantly incorporated into the solid phase (Fig. 1C). Displacement of Par complex from Par-3 required a significantly higher concentration of Cdc42 than we observed for Par-3 displacement of Cdc42-bound complex. Our results indicate that Par-3 and Cdc42 compete for binding to the Par complex (i.e., negative cooperativity) and that a quaternary complex does not form at levels detectable in our assay. Our results may differ from previous studies using cell extracts because aPKC’s kinase domain is known to form stalled complexes with substrates like Par-3 when ATP is not available to complete the catalytic cycle (forming a persistent interaction rather than a transient interaction) (18Holly R.W. Jones K. Prehoda K.E. A conserved PDZ-binding motif in aPKC interacts with Par-3 and mediates cortical polarity.Curr. Biol. 2020; 30: 893-898.e5Google Scholar, 26Holly R.W. Prehoda K.E. Phosphorylation of par-3 by atypical protein kinase C and competition between its substrates.Dev. Cell. 2019; 49: 678-679Google Scholar). Additionally, other cellular factors could potentially allow Par-3 and Cdc42 to bind to the Par complex simultaneously. In terms of understanding how the Par complex might transition from Par-3 to Cdc42, our results demonstrate that no other proteins are required—Par-3 and Cdc42 alone are sufficient to form mutually exclusive complexes with the Par complex. Our results indicate that Par-3 is more effective at displacing Cdc42 from the Par complex than Par-3 is at displacing Cdc42. The asymmetry in Par complex displacement could be explained by a higher affinity of Par-3 for the Par complex compared to Cdc42. The affinity of Par-3 PDZ1-APM for the Par complex is known (19Penkert R.R. Vargas E. Prehoda K.E. Energetic determinants of animal cell polarity regulator Par-3 interaction with the Par complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298: 102223Google Scholar), but while Cdc42’s affinity for the Par-6 CRIB-PDZ fragment has been reported (13Garrard S.M. Capaldo C.T. Gao L. Rosen M.K. Macara I.G. Tomchick D.R. Structure of Cdc42 in a complex with the GTPase-binding domain of the cell polarity protein, Par6.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1125-1133Google Scholar), its affinity for the full Par complex has been unknown. To understand why Par-3 is more effective at displacing Cdc42 from the Par complex, we measured binding affinities for the Par complex using a supernatant depletion assay (27Pollard T.D. A guide to simple and informative binding assays.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 4061-4067Google Scholar). Similar to a previous report using the same assay (19Penkert R.R. Vargas E. Prehoda K.E. Energetic determinants of animal cell polarity regulator Par-3 interaction with the Par complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298: 102223Google Scholar), we found that Par-3 PDZ1-APM binds the Par complex with high affinity (Fig. 2; KD of 0.6 μM or ΔG° of 8.3 kcal/mol). We measured a substantially weaker affinity of Cdc42 (using the Q61L constitutively active variant) for the Par complex (Fig. 2; KD of 5.4 μM or ΔG° of 7.1 kcal/mol). This affinity is significantly lower than a previous report of 0.05 μM for Cdc42 binding to the Par-6 CRIB-PDZ fragment using a FRET-based assay (13Garrard S.M. Capaldo C.T. Gao L. Rosen M.K. Macara I.G. Tomchick D.R. Structure of Cdc42 in a complex with the GTPase-binding domain of the cell polarity protein, Par6.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1125-1133Google Scholar). To determine if the source of the difference is Cdc42 binding to a Par-6 fragment versus the full Par complex, we measured the Cdc42 interaction with Par-6 CRIB-PDZ with the supernatant depletion (Fig. S1). While the resulting affinity of 2.3 μM is slightly higher than that for the full Par complex, it remains substantially weaker than the FRET-based value (which is a higher affinity than the Par-3 interaction with the Par complex). We are unsure of the source of this discrepancy, and while our results suggest that Par-3 displaces Cdc42 from the Par complex more efficiently because of an intrinsic difference in affinity, it is possible that there is another source for this phenomenon. Given that Par-3 and Cdc42 bind with negative cooperativity to Par-6/aPKC, we sought to identify the binding sites on the Par complex that are coupled. While the interaction between Cdc42 and Par-6 semi-CRIB is well established, several interactions between Par-3 and the Par complex have been identified (Fig. 1A) (9Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L.

Chem. 2022; 298: 102223Google Scholar). We excluded the interaction of the aPKC kinase domain with its phosphorylation site on Par-3 (i.e., the Par-3 APM) because the interaction is transient in the presence of ATP, as expected for an enzyme–substrate interaction (18Holly R.W. Jones K. Prehoda K.E. A conserved PDZ-binding motif in aPKC interacts with Par-3 and mediates cortical polarity.Curr. Biol. 2020; 30: 893-898.e5Google Scholar, 26Holly R.W. Prehoda K.E. Phosphorylation of par-3 by atypical protein kinase C and competition between its substrates.Dev. Cell. 2019; 49: 678-679Google Scholar). Given that each Par-3 PDZ domain reportedly interacts with either Par-6 or aPKC, more than one interaction between Par-3 and the Par complex could be involved in displacement of Cdc42 from the Par complex. However, if only one of the interactions between Par-3 and the Par complex displaces Cdc42 from the Par complex, deletion of the required Par-3 element would eliminate Par-3’s negative cooperativity with Cdc42 for the Par complex. Alternately, removal of more than one Par-3 element might be necessary to eliminate displacement of Cdc42 from the Par complex by Par-3. To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated deletions of individual Par-3 PDZ domains in the context of the PDZ1-APM fragment and tested which Par-3 elements are involved in displacing Cdc42 from the Par complex. We examined the effect of Par-3 PDZ1-APM, ΔPDZ1, ΔPDZ2, or ΔPDZ3 on Cdc42-bound Par complex. We did not detect an effect of removing PDZ1 or PDZ3 on Par-3’s ability to displace Cdc42 from the Par complex (Fig. 3A). In contrast, deletion of Par-3 PDZ2 eliminated displacement of Cdc42 such that the amount of Par complex associated with solid phase Cdc42 did not change upon addition of Par-3 PDZ1-APM ΔPDZ2 (Fig. 3A). Our results indicate that neither Par-3 PDZ1 nor PDZ3 are required for negative cooperativity with Cdc42 for the Par complex and that displacement of Cdc42 from the Par complex by Par-3 is dependent on the PDZ2 domain. We recently discovered that Par-3 PDZ2 and PDZ3 interact with aPKC Kinase Domain-PBM (KD-PBM) module (19Penkert R.R. Vargas E. Prehoda K.E. Energetic determinants of animal cell polarity regulator Par-3 interaction with the Par complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298: 102223Google Scholar). Given that Par-3 PDZ2 is required to displace Cdc42 from the Par complex, we examined whether the aPKC PBM was also required for this activity. We found that removing the aPKC PBM (Par-6/aPKC ΔPBM) prevented Par-3 from displacing Cdc42 from the Par complex (Fig. 3B). Our results indicate that Par-3 PDZ2 and aPKC PBM are necessary for Par-3 to disrupt the Cdc42–Par complex interaction (Fig. 3C). Given the requirement of the aPKC KD-PBM for Par-3’s ability to displace Cdc42 from the Par complex, we examined whether the Par-3 domains that bind the KD-PBM (PDZ2 and PDZ3) were each sufficient for this activity. We recently discovered a conserved basic region (BR) at the N-terminal end of Par-3 PDZ2 that increases PDZ2’s affinity for the Par complex, so we also examined the effect of Par-3 BR-PDZ2 (19Penkert R.R. Vargas E. Prehoda K.E. Energetic determinants of animal cell polarity regulator Par-3 interaction with the Par complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298: 102223Google Scholar). We found that PDZ2 alone was sufficient to displace Cdc42 from the Par complex but was not as effective as PDZ1-APM such that some Par complex remained bound to solid phase Cdc42 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, BR-PDZ2 displaced Cdc42 to a similar extent as PDZ1-APM and resulted in little to no Par complex associated with solid phase Cdc42 (Fig. 4A). We conclude that Par-3 BR-PDZ2 can sufficiently displace Cdc42 from the Par complex. Like Par-3 PDZ2, Par-3 PDZ3 was found to interact with the Par complex utilizing a similar binding mode. Thus, we also tested the ability of Par-3 PDZ3 to displace Cdc42 from the Par complex. Given that Par-3 PDZ3 has a weak binding affinity for the Par complex (KD of 78.9 μM) (19Penkert R.R. Vargas E. Prehoda K.E. Energetic determinants of animal cell polarity regulator Par-3 interaction with the Par complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298: 102223Google Scholar), we were unable to detect any significant change in the amount of Par complex bound to solid phase Cdc42 (data not shown). Therefore, we instead formed a Par-3 PDZ3-bound Par complex utilizing GST-Par-3 PDZ3 on the solid phase and soluble Par complex and examined the effect of Cdc42Q61L. We observed that addition of Cdc42 resulted in a reduction in the amount of Par complex bound to solid phase Par-3 PDZ3, indicating that Cdc42 is sufficient to displace PDZ3 from the Par complex (Fig. 4B). Thus, our finding that Par-3 PDZ1-APM ΔPDZ2 cannot displace Cdc42 (Fig. 3A) likely arises from the low binding affinity of PDZ3 for the Par complex compared to BR-PDZ2. Altogether, our results indicate that the Par-3 BR-PDZ2 and PDZ3–aPKC kinase domain-PBM (predominantly through BR-PDZ2) interactions negatively cooperate with the Cdc42–Par-6 CRIB-PDZ interaction (Figs. 4C and 5A). We examined how the Par complex transitions from Par-3- to Cdc42-bound states, a step that is thought to be critical for forming the Par cortical domain. In this model, the large size of oligomerized Par-3 couples the Par complex to actomyosin-driven directional cortical flows that transport the complex to its active domain (5Rodriguez J. Peglion F.

A single-cell biochemistry approach reveals PAR complex dynamics during cell polarization.Dev. Cell. 2017; 42: 416-434.e11Google Scholar). Once in this membrane region, the complex dissociates from Par-3 and binds Cdc42, allowing it to remain on the cortex and become activated. While the transition from Par-3 to Cdc42 is central to this model, little has been known about how switching between binding of each regulator occurs. We used a biochemical reconstitution approach to understand the mechanism of regulator switching, with the goal of identifying the minimal set of components required for the transition. A previous study that used coimmunoprecipitation from cultured cell extracts concluded that Cdc42 and Par-3 can bind simultaneously to the Par complex, suggesting that other cellular components are required (9Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. The cell-polarity protein Par6 links Par3 and atypical protein kinase C to Cdc42.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Google Scholar). For example, mechanical separation of the complexes by actomyosin-generated contraction has been proposed as one possibility (5Rodriguez J. Peglion F. Martin J. Hubatsch L. Reich J.

The latter orchestrates a complex antiviral response that is initiated through the synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylates after recognition of foreign RNA3–5. Among the large set of proteins that are linked to type III systems and predicted to bind cyclic oligoadenylates6,7, a CRISPR-associated Lon protease (CalpL) stood out to us. CalpL contains a sensor domain of the SAVED family7 fused to a Lon protease effector domain. However, the mode of action of this effector is unknown. Here we report the structure and function of CalpL and show that this soluble protein forms a stable tripartite complex with two other proteins, CalpT and CalpS, that are encoded on the same operon. After activation by cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA4), CalpL oligomerizes and specifically cleaves the MazF homologue CalpT, which releases the extracytoplasmic function σ factor CalpS from the complex. Our data provide a direct connection between CRISPR-based detection of foreign nucleic acids and transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, the presence of a SAVED domain that binds cyclic tetra-adenylate in a CRISPR effector reveals a link to the cyclic-oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system. A CalpL–CalpT–CalpS cascade mediated by cyclic oligoadenylates is identified as a mechanism to detect viral RNA and activate subsequent antivirus responses in microorganisms."

Here, we report a significant stage-specific increase and compartmental redistribution in oocyte zinc content upon the initiation of early follicle growth. The increase in zinc correlates with the increased expression of specific zinc transporters, including two that are essential in oocyte maturation. While oocytes in follicles exhibit high tolerance to pronounced changes in zinc availability, somatic survival and proliferation are significantly more sensitive to zinc chelation or supplementation. Finally, transcriptomic, proteomic, and zinc loading analyses reveal enrichment of zinc targets in the ubiquitination pathway.

The ovarian follicle, consisting of the oocyte surrounded by supporting somatic cells, progresses through well-defined developmental stages in the ovary (1Wassarman P.M. Albertini D.F. The mammalian ovum.in: Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York, NY1994: 79-122Google Scholar). Follicle development, or folliculogenesis, begins with the activation of selective dormant primordial follicles. These primordial follicles are formed in the first few days of life in the mouse and are characterized by a nongrowing oocyte arrested at prophase of meiosis I, surrounded by one layer of mitotically arrested, squamous pre-granulosa cells (also known as primordial follicle granulosa cells; pfGCs). Through a process that is not fully understood, primordial follicle activation initiates oocyte growth, and squamous pfGCs re-enter the mitotic cycle and differentiate into cuboidal granulosa cells (GCs), forming a primary follicle with an oocyte surrounded by a single layer of GCs. As the follicle unit continues to mature, the GCs proliferate to form multiple layers and the oocyte produces an extracellular glycoprotein coat termed the zona pellucida (ZP). This is now known as a secondary follicle with specialized filopodia spanning the ZP and governing the communication between the oocyte and the GCs (2El-Hayek S. Yang Q. Abbassi L. FitzHarris G.

Biol. 2018; 28: 1124-1131.e3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This follicle eventually develops into a multilayer, then into a mature antral follicle with fluid filled cavity in preparation for ovulation. Upon the gonadotropin surge from the pituitary, the oocyte is released from the follicle in a process known as ovulation, and the oocyte resumes meiosis to extrude the first polar body (oocyte maturation) and again is arrested at the metaphase of meiosis II as a fertilizable mature egg (MII egg). Meiosis II is completed as a fertilized egg transitions to a zygote (3Tingen C. Kim A. Woodruff T.K. The primordial pool of follicles and nest breakdown in mammalian ovaries.Mol. Hum.

Folliculogenesis is a prerequisite for generating a high-quality gamete capable of giving rise to the next generation, yet the mechanisms governing the coordinated growth and development of the oocyte and its accompanying somatic cells during early follicle development has been elusive. This open question in development may be linked to recently uncovered roles for zinc in regulating oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early preimplantation embryo development (5Kim A.M. Vogt S.

Total zinc concentration corresponds to the sum of bound zinc, that is, zinc ions that are tightly bound in protein active sites, and free zinc, that is, pools of weakly bound, labile zinc complexes which are readily detected using fluorescent probes. The best understood pools of labile zinc have been described in secretory compartments (8Que E.L. Bleher R. Duncan F.E. Kong B.Y. Gleber S.C.

Like calcium, labile zinc is typically maintained at exceedingly low concentrations in the cytosol of most cells in a resting or unperturbed state, at pM to nM range (9Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V.

Zinc Signals in Cellular Functions and Disorders. Springer, Tokyo, NY2014Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This baseline feature allows temporal fluxes in ion release from an intracellular zinc store or from the extracellular space to diffuse and be loaded onto target proteins in signaling pathways, initiating “zinc signaling” (9Outten C.E.

We and others have demonstrated that such transient fluctuations in zinc regulate several important developmental transitions in vertebrate and invertebrate oocytes, eggs, and preimplantation embryos. The cyclic change in zinc content or availability differs between species, but a murine oocyte increases its total zinc content by 20 billion atoms (i.e., a 50% increase) as it completes meiosis I and then ejects ca 20% before it can complete meiosis II. Total zinc atom number peaks at metaphase II in mouse (5Kim A.M. Vogt S. O'Halloran T.V. Woodruff T.K. Zinc availability regulates exit from meiosis in maturing mammalian oocytes.Nat. Chem.

Upon fertilization, 10 billion zinc atoms are rapidly exocytosed from zinc-loaded vesicles into the extracellular space. These ‘zinc sparks’ expose the egg ZP to ca. 10−4 M zinc ions result in structural changes that likely contribute to the block to polyspermy (6Kim A.M. Bernhardt M.L. Kong B.Y. Ahn R.W. Vogt S.

The lowering of intracellular zinc initiates re-entry into the meiotic cell cycle and is a conserved hallmark of fertilization among different mammalian species including human (6Kim A.M.

Meanwhile, zinc homeostasis is also required for the first mitotic divisions of the preimplantation embryo (7Kong B.Y. Duncan F.E. Que E.L. Xu Y. Vogt S. O'Halloran T.V. et al.The inorganic anatomy of the mammalian preimplantation embryo and the requirement of zinc during the first mitotic divisions.Dev. Dyn. 2015; 244: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These discoveries demonstrate that zinc is a central developmental switch. However, it is unknown if zinc similarly plays a role in early ovarian follicle development, specifically when the follicle transitions from nongrowing to rapidly growing phases. To examine possible roles for zinc in early follicle development, we first determined zinc content and distribution in murine follicles of primordial to secondary stages. Changes in total and labile zinc pools were evaluated using quantitative single-cell imaging for intact follicles, isolated oocytes, and individual somatic cells. Single cell X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) provides quantitative maps for total populations of several essential elements, while a radioactive zinc tracer method and confocal imaging with a zinc-specific probe ZincBY-1 (8Que E.L. Bleher R. Duncan F.E. Kong B.Y. Gleber S.C. Vogt S. et al.Quantitative mapping of zinc fluxes in the mammalian egg reveals the origin of fertilization-induced zinc sparks.Nat. Chem. 2015; 7: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) allow interrogation of dynamic changes in labile zinc content. RNA in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate changes in zinc transporter expression in both germ and somatic cells across this developmental sequence. We established that zinc is the most abundant transition metal in early follicles, and it increases during follicle development via active accrual. On a single-cell basis, total zinc increases in the oocyte during follicle development in a follicle-stage but not cell size–dependent manner, and labile zinc redistributes in specific cellular compartments. Within the oocyte, the expression of several zinc transporters increases during follicle development, whereas total zinc levels and transporter expression remain constant in individual somatic cells. Limiting zinc during early follicle development resulted in somatic cell apoptosis, which in turn decreased secondary follicle number but had little direct effect on oocyte viability. Conversely, zinc supplementation activated growth pathways in the somatic cell and increased somatic proliferation. Potential zinc partner proteins in the oocyte, identified via a combination of in silico transcriptomic analysis and autoradiography and proteomic methods, include an enrichment of targets in the ubiquitination pathways. These results demonstrate that zinc undergoes dynamic changes during follicular activation and growth, the oocyte and somatic cells of the follicles exhibit distinct zinc regulatory mechanisms, and zinc homeostasis is required for normal folliculogenesis. To characterize potential roles of zinc during early ovarian folliculogenesis, we first evaluated total zinc content in individual primordial, primary, and secondary follicles (Fig. 1A) using synchrotron-based XFM at the Bionanoprobe (BNP) of Argonne National Laboratory (18Chen S. Deng J. Yuan Y. Flachenecker C. Mak R. Hornberger B. et al.The Bionanoprobe: hard X-ray fluorescence nanoprobe with cryogenic capabilities.J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2014; 21: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). XFM at the BNP provided the total elemental content and distribution in follicles through detection of the X-ray fluorescence spectra that were characteristic of each element, which were then calibrated and presented in 2D images with the concentration unit of μg/cm2 or converted to the number of atoms per region of interest (Fig. 1B). Using this technology, we determined that zinc, along with two other major trace elements iron and copper, were found in all follicle stages, with zinc and iron being more abundant than copper (Fig. 1B). Following quantification, we measured total atom number within the follicle throughout folliculogenesis, with highest metal content observed in secondary follicles (Table S1). Specifically, zinc was more abundant than iron and copper in follicles in each of the stages examined, and the total number of zinc atoms per follicle increased across the primordial, primary, and secondary stages (Fig. 1C). Because the follicle expands in size and cell number during follicle development, we normalized total atom number to whole follicle area (Fig. S1A) and calculated the elemental concentration in μg/cm2. This analysis demonstrated that the greatest magnitude of change among the transition metals occurred in zinc during folliculogenesis. The concentration of zinc increased significantly (3.4-fold) from the primordial to secondary stage; iron and copper concentrations increased to a lesser extent (1.6-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively) (Fig. 1D). To determine whether the increase in zinc content observed in growing follicles (primary and secondary follicles with one or two layers of GCs) was due to changes in active zinc uptake during follicular development, we compared uptake of the radiotracer Zn-65 in live follicles between primordial and growing follicles, as opposed to XFM measurement performed on ‘fixed’ samples. The total zinc uptake was 6.7 × 107 and 4.6 × 109 atoms/h normalized to a single primordial and a single growing follicle, respectively (Figs. 1E and S2). Thus, growing follicles rapidly acquired zinc at rates approximately 70 times greater than primordial follicles, suggesting a potentially important role of zinc during early follicle development. To characterize metal distribution in the oocytes and the somatic cells within a follicle separately, we dissociated individual oocytes and somatic cells for XFM analysis by enzyme digestion after follicle isolation (19Chen Y.Y. Russo D.D. Drake R.S. Duncan F.E. Shalek A.K. Goods B.A. et al.Single-cell transcriptomics of staged oocytes and somatic cells reveal novel regulators of follicle activation.Reproduction. 2022; 164: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The metal content of iron, copper, and zinc within the oocyte all increased significantly during follicle development (Fig. 2A and Table S2). At the primordial stage, the oocyte zinc atom number was higher than copper but was comparable to the iron level initially, and zinc did not become the most abundant transition metal until the primary follicle stage and beyond. Specifically, during the primordial to primary stage transition, zinc showed the greatest increase than other metals or stages, an increase of 14-fold (Fig. 2B). Upon analyzing metal concentrations, iron and copper remain at a similar level from primordial to secondary follicle stages, suggesting that the oocyte accrued these metals at a similar rate as it grew in size across stages (Fig. 2C). On the contrary, zinc concentration significantly increased in the oocyte throughout follicle development, with zinc levels 6- to 11-fold more concentrated than copper in the three stages (Fig. 2C). As the oocyte differs in size even within the same follicle stage, we further analyzed the relationship between zinc level and oocyte size based on diameter. Interestingly, the increase of zinc in the oocyte is not a simple linear function of oocyte size. Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.92, −0.29, and 0.60 for oocyte diameter versus zinc content in the primordial, primary, and secondary follicle stages, respectively. This shows that the increase in zinc in the oocyte seemed to track with developmental stage rather than a continuous increase with cell size (Fig. 2D). This can be seen clearly for oocytes in the 30 μm size range where oocytes within primary follicles have a 10-fold higher zinc content than those in primordial follicles. Furthermore, oocytes within secondary follicles in the 60 μm size range have 3-fold more zinc than those in primary follicles of the same size (Fig. 2D). In contrast to the oocyte, the elemental content in single somatic cells did not increase during follicle development (Fig. 3, A and B and Table S3). After being dissociated from the oocyte, the squamous pfGCs from primordial follicles rounded up and were similar in size to the GCs in primary and secondary follicles (Fig. S1C), and the elemental content did not change during differentiation from pfGCs to GCs (Fig. 3B). Moreover, upon analyzing metal concentrations, zinc concentration decreased in the somatic cells of secondary follicles, while iron and copper concentration remained at a similar level during follicle development (Fig. 3C). To better understand metal dynamics in the germ cell and the somatic cell directly, we compared iron, copper, and zinc concentrations in single oocytes versus single somatic cells across follicle development. While the metal concentrations in the somatic cells stayed constant, those in the oocyte increased significantly. Significant differences were observed between somatic cells and the oocytes in the primary follicle. By the secondary follicle stage, the iron concentration in the oocyte was twice the amount of a somatic cell, the copper concentration was 5-times higher despite being an order magnitude lower than zinc, and the zinc concentration was 7.6-times higher in the oocyte (Fig. 3D). Finally, we overlaid and compared the total zinc content of the oocyte in whole follicles. We observed that around 20% of zinc in a primordial follicle was in the oocyte compartment. This number increased to about 60% in the primary stage and decreased to 20% in a secondary follicle (Fig. S3A). In a secondary follicle, even though the zinc content did not change in individual GCs, there are many more somatic cells during this stage; therefore, the main zinc increase was observed in the somatic compartment as a whole (Fig. S3B). Overall, these results indicate that the changes in zinc content during follicle development are much more extensive in the oocyte relative to individual somatic cells. Moreover, the oocyte-specific increase in zinc appears to be follicle class–dependent and not just a simple consequence of the increase in oocyte size that occurs during oogenesis. Lastly, even though somatic zinc content did not change on an individual cell basis, most of the zinc was allocated to the somatic compartment as GC number increases in the secondary follicle. Intracellular zinc can be classified into two populations: protein-bound zinc and labile zinc which contributes to signaling events. Labile zinc can be readily visualized using intracellular zinc probes such as ZincBY-1, which is composed of a BODIPY core and a polypyridine zinc chelator (8Que E.L. Bleher R. Duncan F.E. Kong B.Y. Gleber S.C. Vogt S. et al.Quantitative mapping of zinc fluxes in the mammalian egg reveals the origin of fertilization-induced zinc sparks.Nat. Chem. 2015; 7: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To complement our XFM studies that examined the total zinc pool (both bound and labile portion), we analyzed labile zinc populations directly by ZincBY-1 staining and confocal imaging on live follicles from the primordial to secondary stages. Labile zinc was identified in all stages of follicle development (Fig. 4A). Within primordial follicles, highly localized cytoplasmic structures enriched in labile zinc were observed in the oocytes (Fig. 4A, ii, marked with magenta arrows). This localized pattern was more diffuse in the oocytes of primary and secondary follicles (Fig. 4A, vii, xii). In contrast, the pattern of labile zinc signals in the cytoplasm of the somatic cells was similar across all stages. The enrichment of labile zinc within perinuclear structures of the oocyte in the primordial follicle led us to examine compartmentalization possibilities. A distinguishing feature of the oocyte in a primordial follicle is the extensive colocalization of organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, mitochondria, and mRNAs, forming a condensed structure called the Balbiani body (B-body) (20Marlow F.L. Oocyte polarity and the embryonic axes: the Balbiani body, an ancient oocyte asymmetry.in: Maternal Control of Development in Vertebrates: My Mother Made Me Do it! Morgan & Claypool Life Sciences, San Rafael, CA2010Google Scholar). Following follicle activation, the B-body deforms, and the organelles become evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of an oocyte (21Pepling M.E. Wilhelm J.E. O'Hara A.L. Gephardt G.W. Spradling A.C. Mouse oocytes within germ cell cysts and primordial follicles contain a Balbiani body.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, labile zinc is reported to be stored in ER, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, or zinc vesicles. To determine whether the labile zinc pattern colocalizes with a subset of cellular organelles, we costained follicles with ZincBY-1 and ER-tracker, Golgi-tracker, and mitotracker. In primordial follicles, labile zinc colocalized with ER in both the oocyte and the somatic cells (Fig. 4B, iv), and with Golgi in the oocyte (Fig. 4C, iv), but not with mitochondria (Fig. S4, See Table S4 for Pearson correlation coefficient). The colocalization of labile zinc with ER continued in both the oocyte and the somatic cells in the primary follicle (Fig. 4B, viii), but the correlation decreased significantly in a germinal vesicle (GV) oocyte (oocytes collected from multilayer to antral follicle stage, Fig. 4B, xii), suggesting that labile zinc in the oocyte toward later stages distributed outside of ER. The observation was similar for labile zinc in the oocyte with Golgi-tracker staining (Fig. 4C, viii, xii). Overall, cell-type–specific distributions in both total and labile zinc pools are dynamic during follicle development. Specifically, we characterized ER and Golgi as potential primary labile zinc stores in early-stage oocytes but not in late-stage oocytes. To understand the cellular machinery involved in maintaining intracellular zinc level, we analyzed the expression pattern of zinc transporters and zinc-responsive metallothionein genes during follicle development. Over 24 solute-specific transporters involved in zinc compartmentalization are encoded in the mouse and human genome. Primary zinc transporter proteins in mammals such as the Zrt, Irt-like protein/solute carrier family 39 (ZIP/SLC39A) increases cytosolic zinc concentration by importing zinc from the extracellular space into the cell or from a zinc store to the cytosol. In contrast, zinc transporter/SLC30A family proteins transport zinc out from the cytosol, either to a zinc store or to the extracellular space. To establish which of these zinc transporters are present within oocytes and somatic cells during early folliculogenesis, we first collected pool of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles and performed qPCR to determine the zinc transporters that were expressed in higher amount (Fig. S5A). We then performed in situ hybridization on the most highly expressed of these target genes including zinc importer genes Slc39a6, Slc39a10 and exporter genes Slc30a3, Slc30a5, and Slc30a9 to determine transcript level and subcellular distribution in follicles. Transcript visualization combined with immunostaining of DDX4 (oocyte marker) and Laminin (basement membrane outlining the follicle) allowed definition of mRNA localization relative to oocyte and follicle boundaries (Fig. 5A). The puncta number was quantified as total counts in each oocyte and counts per area in the somatic cell region (Fig. 5, B and C). Among the selected targets, all genes were expressed in the oocyte in the primordial stage at a comparable level. Expression levels of target genes in the oocytes increased significantly at the primary or secondary follicle stages, except for Slc30a9, whose expression remained similar during follicle development. At primary and secondary follicle stages, all selected importer genes and the exporter Slc30a3 were expressed at higher levels than the exporters Slc30a5 and Slc30a9 (Fig. S5B). On the other hand, the somatic cells exhibited a different profile of zinc transporter expression compared to the oocyte. In pfGCs, transporter targets were expressed at comparable levels between follicle stages (Fig. 5C). After somatic differentiation, Slc39a6 and Slc30a3 decreased expression significantly in the GCs, while Slc30a5 and Slc30a9 increased expression in the primary or secondary follicle stages. In general, the zinc importer and exporter genes increased in expression in the oocytes during folliculogenesis, while in the somatic cells, their expression either decreased or remained at a similar level (Fig. 5, A–C). This is consistent with our observation that total zinc content changed to a small degree in somatic cells but increased significantly in the oocyte across these stages of follicle development. Furthermore, we examined the expression of two metallothionein genes, Mt1 and Mt2, which code for the cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins that respond to zinc and act as zinc buffer, by performing in situ hybridization on ovarian sections and detected very minimal expression in the oocytes across follicle stages (Fig. S6). We next examined the protein expression pattern of these selected transporters on ovarian sections using immunohistochemistry. While ZIP6 and ZIP10 were previously reported to be enriched at the plasma membrane of fully grown oocytes (22Kong B.Y. Duncan F.E. Que E.L. Kim A.M. O'Halloran T.V. Woodruff T.K.

Although marine teleosts (bony fish) live in seawater (SW; ∼450 mM NaCl, ∼50 mM Mg2+, ∼30 mM SO42−, 10 mM Ca2+, 10 mM K+, etc.), marine fish blood is hypoosmotic to SW. To avoid dehydration, marine fish drink large amounts of SW, absorb water and electrolytes in the intestine, and excrete excess electrolytes back into the SW via the gills (branchial chloride cells) (e.g., Na+, Cl−, and K+) or into the urine via the kidneys (e.g., Mg2+ and SO42−) (48Marshall W. Grosell M. Ion transport, osmoregulation, and acid-base balance.in: Evans D.H. Claiborne J.B. The Physiology of Fishes. CRC, NY2006: 177-230Google Scholar). In the kidney, the glomeruli of SW fish filter considerably less blood and produce much less primary urine than their fresh water (FW) counterparts, and tubular secretion largely contributes to urine production in SW fish (48Marshall W. Grosell M. Ion transport, osmoregulation, and acid-base balance.in: Evans D.H. Claiborne J.B. The Physiology of Fishes. CRC, NY2006: 177-230Google Scholar, 49Hickman Jr., C.P.

Membrane transport proteins expressed in the renal tubular epithelial cells of seawater and Freshwater teleost fishes.Front. Physiol. 2022; 13939114Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Their proximal tubules actively secrete fluids containing Mg2+, SO42−, and Cl− into the tubular lumen (51Beyenbach K.W. Kidneys sans glomeruli.Am. J. Physiol. Ren. Physiol. 2004; 286: F811-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 52Beyenbach K.W. Petzel D.H. Cliff W.H. Renal proximal tubule of flounder. I. Physiological properties.Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: R608-615PubMed Google Scholar). The collecting ducts may then actively reabsorb water along with Na+ and Cl− to reduce urine volume, producing a relatively small volume of isotonic urine with high concentrations of Mg2+ and SO42−. SW also contains ∼0.4 mM boric acid (∼4.5 mg boron/l). Thus, SW fish are exposed to a continuous influx of boric acid that must be excreted. To discover how SW fish excrete boric acid, we used two closely related pufferfish: river pufferfish (Takifugu obscurus, euryhaline) and tiger pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes, marine) (53Kato A. Doi H. Nakada T. Sakai H. Hirose S. Takifugu obscurus is a euryhaline fugu species very close to Takifugu rubripes and suitable for studying osmoregulation.BMC Physiol. 2005; 5: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), whose genome has been sequenced (54Aparicio S.

By comparing the gene expression between FW- and SW-acclimated pufferfish, renal and intestinal ion transporters that are involved in HCO3−, Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42− excretion for SW acclimation were identified (50Kato A.

Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R1402-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). By searching for ion transporters upregulated in SW, we found that an Slc4a11 paralog, Slc4a11A, had high renal expression and was upregulated during SW acclimation. Functional characterization (electrophysiology) and immunohistochemistry caused us to hypothesize that Slc4a11A is an electrogenic boric acid transporter that plays a central role in excess boric acid excretion at the apical membrane of marine teleost renal tubules. These observations suggest that SW fish excrete excessive boric acid (acquired from drinking SW) into the urine via Slc4a11A, thereby avoiding boric acid toxicity and simultaneously maintaining low plasma boric acid levels. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first characterization of a boric acid excretion mechanism in an animal as well as the first demonstration of the presence of an electrogenic boric acid transporter. Boric acid (B(OH)3, pKa = 9.24) is in equilibrium with borate (B(OH)4–) in aqueous solutions. Hereafter, the term “boric acid” refers to the combination of both forms, and the term “borate” refers specifically to molecular species B(OH)4–. When referring to B(OH)3, we specifically state “B(OH)3.” [Boron] was determined by analyzing trace elements derived from boric acid and all other compounds containing boron. The natural SW used in this study contained 0.45 ± 0.02 mM boric acid (n = 3). The SW-acclimated river and tiger pufferfish contained intestinal or rectal fluids derived from ingested SW. The boric acid concentrations of all intestinal and rectal fluids were 0.15 ± 0.12 mM (n = 4) and 0.04 ± 0.02 mM (n = 4) in the SW-acclimated river and tiger pufferfish, respectively, and were significantly lower than that of SW (p < 0.0002) (Fig. 1), suggesting the presence of intestinal boric acid absorption by these fish. Intestinal and rectal fluids were not present in the intestines of FW-acclimated river pufferfish and brackish water (BW)–acclimated tiger pufferfish. The serum [boron] of FW-acclimated river pufferfish was 6.0 ± 1.2 μM (n = 4, Fig. 1); [boron] refers to the total concentration of various boron forms expressed as boric acid equivalents. In SW, the serum [boron] increased to 57 ± 35 μM (n = 6), which was 9.5 times higher than that of river pufferfish in FW (p < 0.02). The serum [boron] of SW-acclimated tiger pufferfish was 24 ± 10 μM (n = 4), which was three times higher than that of tiger pufferfish in BW of 7.9 ± 1.7 μM (n = 4, p < 0.02). These results indicate that the [boric acid]blood of pufferfish in SW was slightly higher than those of pufferfish in FW and BW, and that SW pufferfish maintained their [boric acid]blood levels 7.9 to 19 times lower than that of marine [boric acid]. Bladder urine from river pufferfish in FW contained 20 ± 19 μM boric acid (n = 7). Interestingly, the bladder urine of river pufferfish in SW contained 19 ± 8.3 milli-M (n = 6) boric acid (i.e., three orders of magnitude difference). In other words, the [boric acid]urine of SW-acclimated river pufferfish was ∼950-fold greater than that of FW-acclimated fish (p < 0.0001), 330-fold greater than [boric acid]blood, and 41-fold greater than [boric acid]SW (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained with tiger pufferfish. Bladder urine of tiger pufferfish in SW contained 14 ± 4.5 mM boric acid (n = 5), which was ∼140-fold greater than that of BW-acclimated fish (p < 0.0001), 590-fold greater than [boric acid]blood, and 31-fold greater than [boric acid]SW. These results indicate that the SW pufferfish kidney has the ability to excrete and concentrate boric acid into the urine. We sought to investigate which transporter is involved in renal boric acid excretion into the urine. Two protein homologs of plant BORs were identified from the database of the Takifugu genome: Slc4a11A (820 amino acids) and Slc4a11B (844 amino acids). The phylogenetic relationships are shown in Figure 2A, and the multiple alignment of amino acid sequences is shown in Figure 3. Among the pufferfish tissues, Slc4a11A transcripts were notably high in the kidneys, whereas Slc4a11B transcripts were found at low levels in a broad range of tissues (Fig. 2B). Renal Slc4a11A expression in river pufferfish in SW was 1.6-fold higher than that of the fish in FW (Fig. 2C).Figure 3Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences of Slc4a11 family.

This indicated that the major paralog in the renal tubules was Slc4a11A. To determine the subcellular localization of the Slc4a11A protein, a polyclonal antiserum was raised against a synthetic polypeptide based on the cytoplasmic Slc4a11A COOH terminus (Fig. 3, red box). The antibody recognized both Slc4a11A and Slc4a11B expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (Fig. 4A). Incubation of the membrane fraction of HEK293 cells with glycosidases shifted the bands from ∼180 kDa to ∼120 kDa (Fig. 4A). When Slc4a11A or Slc4a11B were expressed in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK)–polarized epithelial cells, both were localized at the apical membrane (Fig. 4B). Immunoreactivity was not detected when preimmune serum or antigen-absorbed antiserum was used (Fig. 4C), showing that the antibody specifically recognized Slc4a11A or Slc4a11B expressed in MDCK cells. We next stained the kidney sections of SW-acclimated river pufferfish with anti-Slc4a11 antibody. The nephrons of river pufferfish consist of a renal corpuscle, proximal tubule, distal tubule, and collecting duct (58Kato A. Muro T. Kimura Y. Li S. Islam Z.

Previously, we identified these segments by the expression of molecular markers: the proximal tubule was identified by the presence of a brush border membrane and the absence of Na+–K+–2Cl−-cotransporter 2 (Nkcc2 or Slc12a1) and Na+–Cl−-cotransporter (Ncc or Slc12a3) expression; the distal tubule was identified by the absence of a brush border membrane and the presence of Nkcc2 expression; the collecting duct was identified by the absence of a brush border membrane and the presence of Ncc expression.

Human MX1 (HsMX1) is known to inhibit many viruses, including influenza A virus, by likely acting at various steps of their life cycles. Despite decades of studies, the mechanism(s) of action with which MX1 proteins manage to inhibit target viruses is not fully understood. MX1 proteins are mechano-enzymes and share a similar organization to dynamin, with a GTPase domain and a carboxy-terminal stalk domain, connected by a bundle signaling element. These three elements are known to be essential for antiviral activity. HsMX1 has two unstructured regions, the L4 loop, also essential for antiviral activity, and a short amino (N)-terminal region, which greatly varies between MX1 proteins of different species. The role of this N-terminal domain in antiviral activity is not known. Herein, using mutagenesis, imaging, and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of HsMX1 is essential for antiviral activity against influenza A virus, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, and La Crosse virus. Furthermore, we pinpoint a highly conserved leucine within this region, which is absolutely crucial for human, mouse, and bat MX1 protein antiviral activity. Importantly, mutation of this leucine does not compromise GTPase activity or oligomerization capabilities but does modify MX1 protein subcellular localization. The discovery of this essential and highly conserved residue defines this region as key for antiviral activity and may reveal insights as to the mechanism(s) of action of MX1 proteins.

Influenza A virus (IAV) is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family and the causative agent of the disease commonly known as the flu. Upon infection of target epithelial cells within the respiratory tract, IAV is sensed by pattern recognition receptors, including retinoic acid-inducible gene I, which induce a signaling cascade leading to the production and secretion of type 1 and type 3 interferons (IFNs). The IFNs act in a paracrine and autocrine manner and, through binding to their cognate receptors and activation of the Janus Kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway, leads to the regulation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. Among these IFN-stimulated genes, many antiviral restriction factors have been described (1Schoggins J.W. Interferon-stimulated genes: what do they all do?.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2019; 6: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). These factors establish a so-called antiviral state, powerfully limiting IAV replication (2McKellar J. Rebendenne A. Wencker M. Moncorgé O. Goujon C. Mammalian and avian host cell influenza A restriction factors.Viruses. 2021; 13: 522Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The study of the IFN response against IAV in mice led to the discovery of the Myxovirus resistance (MX) proteins, which were later identified in humans (3Lindenmann J.

Virol. 2018; 5: 33-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There are two homologous MX genes in humans, MX1 and MX2. Human MX1, also called MxA (and hereafter referred to as HsMX1), inhibits a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses, replicating either in the cytoplasm, such as bunyavirus La Crosse Virus (LACV) and rhabdovirus Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), or in the nucleus, such as IAV (7Haller O.

Mx GTPases: dynamin-like antiviral machines of innate immunity.Trends Microbiol. 2015; 23: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Human MX2 (HsMX2), or MxB, has notably been shown to potently inhibit HIV-1 and Herpes viruses (8Goujon C. Moncorgé O. Bauby H. Doyle T. Ward C.C.

Anderson F. et al.The interferon-inducible GTPase MxB promotes capsid disassembly and genome release of herpesviruses.Elife. 2022; 11e76804Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice also possess two Mx proteins: MmMx1 and MmMx2. The latter is more closely related to HsMX1 than the former, but interestingly, MmMx1 is a more potent inhibitor of IAV than HsMX1 (14Zimmermann P. Mänz B. Haller O. Schwemmle M. Kochs G. The viral nucleoprotein determines Mx sensitivity of influenza A viruses.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 8133-8140Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, MmMx1 only restricts orthomyxoviruses, whereas HsMX1 is broadly antiviral and MmMx2 inhibits VSV and Hantaan River Virus (HTNV) (7Haller O. Staeheli P. Schwemmle M. Kochs G. Mx GTPases: dynamin-like antiviral machines of innate immunity.Trends Microbiol. 2015; 23: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). This difference could be due partly to the fact that MmMx1 is mainly localized inside the nucleus (15Engelhardt O.G. Ullrich E. Kochs G. Haller O. Interferon-induced antiviral Mx1 GTPase is associated with components of the SUMO-1 system and promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies.Exp.

Virol. 2004; 85: 2315-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), contrary to HsMX1 which is cytosolic. Dynamin-like GTPases all share a very similar general organization and members of this family of proteins can present almost superimposable 3D crystal structures (17Cao Y.-L. Meng S. Chen Y.

Schmid S.L. The dynamin superfamily.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: R411-R416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The 3D structure of HsMX1 has been partially solved (19Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. et al.Structural basis of oligomerization in the stalk region of dynamin-like MxA.Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Dick A.

HsMX1 sports a globular head, which contains the GTPase module, and possesses a stalk domain, attached to the head by a tripartite bundle signaling element (BSE), composed of three separate alpha-helices (α-helices) that allow the fold-back of the stalk towards the GTPase domain, which is akin to dynamin (21Chen Y. Zhang L. Graf L. Yu B. Liu Y. Kochs G. et al.Conformational dynamics of dynamin-like MxA revealed by single-molecule FRET.Nat. Commun. 2017; 815744Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The major difference between HsMX1 and dynamin is the lack in the former of the Pleckstrin Homology domain, essential for the PI(4,5)P2 binding capacity of dynamin (22Zheng J. Cahill S.M. Lemmon M.A. Fushman D. Schlessinger J. Cowburn D. Identification of the binding site for acidic phospholipids on the pH domain of dynamin: implications for stimulation of GTPase activity.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In place of the Pleckstrin Homology domain, HsMX1 has a flexible loop, termed loop L4, of which the structure is unresolved (Fig. 1A). Another unstructured loop, the L2 loop, is also found at the extremity of the stalk and in the vicinity of the L4 loop (Fig. 1A). In addition to these domains, HsMX1 and all MX proteins possess an amino-terminal (N-terminal) extension of unknown structure, which highly varies in length and sequence (Figs. 1, A, B and S1). HsMX1 has been shown to homodimerize through the stalk domain and further oligomerizes through numerous other interfaces on the stalk and the GTPase domains (19Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. et al.Structural basis of oligomerization in the stalk region of dynamin-like MxA.Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Dick A.

Chem. 2015; 290: 12779-12792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This may suggest the possible cohabitation of different types of HsMX1 oligomers within the cell. Of note, MmMx1 possesses a nuclear localization signal localized in the third α-helix of the BSE (25Zürcher T. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. Nuclear localization of mouse Mx1 protein is necessary for inhibition of influenza virus.J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5059-5066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) allowing transport into the nucleus as opposed to HsMX1 and MmMx2, which are uniquely cytoplasmic. The detailed antiviral mechanism(s) of action of MX1 proteins remain largely misunderstood, although certain intrinsic antiviral determinants have been well characterized. Four essential determinants have been identified to this day, the first being the binding/hydrolysis of GTP by the GTPase domain (26Pitossi F. Blank A. Schröder A. Schwarz A. Hüssi P. Schwemmle M. et al.A functional GTP-binding motif is necessary for antiviral activity of Mx proteins.J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, HsMX2 does not require a functional GTPase domain for HIV-1 inhibition (8Goujon C. Moncorgé O. Bauby H. Doyle T. Ward C.C. Schaller T. et al.Human MX2 is an interferon-induced post-entry inhibitor of HIV-1 infection.Nature. 2013; 502: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 9Kane M. Yadav S.S. Bitzegeio J.

Virol. 2014; 88: 9017-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and in the case of HsMX1, this might also be true for Hepatitis B Virus inhibition (28Yu Z. Wang Z. Chen J. Li H. Lin Z. Zhang F. et al.GTPase activity is not essential for the interferon-inducible MxA protein to inhibit the replication of hepatitis B virus.Arch. Virol. 2008; 153: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The second determinant is the presence of an intact BSE (29Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. Dominant-negative mutants of human MxA protein: domains in the carboxy-terminal moiety are important for oligomerization and antiviral activity.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the third being the possibility to oligomerize via the stalk domain (19Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. et al.Structural basis of oligomerization in the stalk region of dynamin-like MxA.Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and the fourth requirement involves the extremity of the stalk, loops L2 (30Arnheiter H.

Virol. 2015; 89: 10879-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, deletions or point mutations of the L4 loop of HsMX1 and MmMx1 abrogated antiviral activity against IAV and Thogoto virus (33Garber E.A. Hreniuk D.L. Scheidel L.M. van der Ploeg L.H.

Virol. 2015; 89: 10879-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and this loop was elegantly shown to have been under positive selection during evolution (36Mitchell P.S. Patzina C. Emerman M. Haller O. Malik H.S. Kochs G. Evolution-guided identification of antiviral specificity determinants in the broadly acting interferon-induced innate immunity factor MxA.Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 12: 598-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies showed that a number of intrinsic elements are needed for MX1 protein antiviral activity; however, to our knowledge, no study has so far addressed in depth the importance of the N-terminal domain of MX1 proteins. The N-terminal domain of HsMX2, however, which is longer than that of HsMX1 (91 amino acids compared to 43 amino acids) has been shown to be a crucial determinant for HIV-1 restriction (27Goujon C. Moncorgé O. Bauby H. Doyle T. Barclay W.S. Malim M.H. Transfer of the amino-terminal nuclear envelope targeting domain of human MX2 converts MX1 into an HIV-1 resistance factor.J.

Blanco-Melo D. et al.Host and viral determinants of Mx2 antiretroviral activity.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 7738-7752Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Transferring the N-terminal domain of HsMX2 onto HsMX1 resulted in a chimeric protein able to inhibit HIV-1, without losing the anti-IAV activity (27Goujon C. Moncorgé O. Bauby H. Doyle T. Barclay W.S. Malim M.H. Transfer of the amino-terminal nuclear envelope targeting domain of human MX2 converts MX1 into an HIV-1 resistance factor.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 9017-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These data prompt that the N-terminal domain of MX proteins may generally be important for antiviral activity. In this study, we examined the role of the N-terminal domain of several MX1 proteins, showing that this domain is essential for antiviral activity. Indeed, deletion of the N-terminal region abrogates antiviral activity against IAV and this effect was mapped to a single essential residue, leucine 41 (L41) in HsMX1. This residue was also essential for the inhibition of rhabdoviruses and bunyaviruses. We further show that this residue is highly conserved between MX1 proteins of different origins, and we show that the corresponding leucines in MmMx1 (leucine 7, L7) and little yellow-shouldered bat, Sturnira lilium MX1 (SlMX1) (leucine 39, L39) are also essential for anti-IAV activity. Finally, we demonstrate that mutation of this highly conserved leucine did not seem to impact lower- or higher-order oligomerization status of HsMX1 or MmMx1 in cells, the propensity to hydrolyze GTP in vitro, or the natural structure of the first BSE α-helix in silico. However, we show that this residue is essential for correct subcellular localization of MX1 proteins. This study therefore confirms the complex multimodular nature of MX1 proteins and defines their N-terminal region as another important antiviral module governed by an essential and highly conserved leucine. The loop L4 and all 43 amino acids of the N-terminal domain are absent from the published crystal structures of HsMX1 (19Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. et al.Structural basis of oligomerization in the stalk region of dynamin-like MxA.Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Dick A.

While the L4 loop has been extensively studied in the past (34Patzina C. Haller O. Kochs G. Structural requirements for the antiviral activity of the human MxA protein against Thogoto and influenza A virus.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 6020-6027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 36Mitchell P.S. Patzina C. Emerman M. Haller O. Malik H.S. Kochs G. Evolution-guided identification of antiviral specificity determinants in the broadly acting interferon-induced innate immunity factor MxA.Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 12: 598-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), to date, the importance of the N-terminal region for the antiviral activity of HsMX1 has not been evaluated. Therefore, to address this, we generated a series of N-terminal truncation mutants for HsMX1, with mutants missing either the first 14 (HsMX115-662) or 28 (HsMX129-662) amino acids or the entire N-terminal region (HsMX144-662, named hereafter HsMX1ΔNter) (Fig. 1B). In parallel to two negative controls (E2-Crimson fluorescent protein, termed CTRL, and HsMX1 inactive GTPase mutant, HsMX1T103A), the WT protein and mutants were ectopically expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells and an IAV minigenome infection reporter assay was performed, as reported previously (8Goujon C. Moncorgé O. Bauby H. Doyle T. Ward C.C. Schaller T. et al.Human MX2 is an interferon-induced post-entry inhibitor of HIV-1 infection.Nature. 2013; 502: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In this assay, a negative sense minigenome coding for the Firefly luciferase is recognized, replicated, and transcribed by IAV polymerase in IAV-infected cells. Thus, Firefly activity is used to monitor replication efficiency. Cells were also cotransfected with a Renilla luciferase coding plasmid for normalization. We observed that the deletion of the first 14 or 28 amino acids had no effect on HsMX1 antiviral activity (Fig. 2A top panel). In contrast, the deletion of the entire N-terminal region totally abrogated antiviral activity in a comparable manner to the control-inactive GTPase mutant HsMX1T103A (Fig. 2A top panel). This suggested the presence of essential residues located between positions 29 and 43 of the N-terminal domain of HsMX1. Mus musculus Mx1 (MmMx1) is another well-studied IAV-inhibiting MX1 protein. Alignment of MmMx1 and HsMX1 proteins revealed a conserved motif of four amino acids located between positions 29 and 43 of HsMX1: 39-NNLC-42 (or 5-NNLC-8 in the case of MmMx1) (Fig. 1B). Upon replacement in HsMX1 of these four amino acids with four alanines (HsMX1NNLC39-42A), we saw a complete loss of antiviral activity comparable to that of HsMX1ΔNter and HsMX1T103A (Fig. 2A, top panel). Alanine point mutations of these four residues (HsMX1N39A, HsMX1N40A, HsMX1L41A, and HsMX1C42A) revealed that leucine 41 (L41) was responsible for the loss-of-function phenotype observed with the MX1NNLC39-42A mutant, whereas the other three mutants completely retained their anti-IAV activity (Fig. 2A, top panel). While the HsMX129-662 and HsMX1ΔNter truncation mutants showed decreased expression levels compared to the WT protein, as assessed by immunoblotting, the loss of antiviral activity of the HsMX1NNLC39-42A and HsMX1L41A mutants could not be attributed to a decrease in expression levels (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). The observed phenotypes were then confirmed using a Nanoluciferase reporter–expressing version of A/Victoria/3/75 (IAV-NLuc) (39Doyle T. Moncorgé O. Bonaventure B. Pollpeter D. Lussignol M. Tauziet M. et al.The interferon-inducible isoform of NCOA7 inhibits endosome-mediated viral entry.Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as a second infection readout, both in HEK293T (Fig. 2B) and in lung-derived A549 cells (Fig. 2C), which stably expressed the control and mutant proteins. Similarly to what was observed in the minigenome infection reporter assay (Fig. 2A), HsMX1ΔNter, HsMX1NNLC39-42A, and HsMX1L41A were completely inactive against IAV, comparable to the inactive HsMX1T103A mutant, whereas the other mutants retained antiviral activity (Fig. 2, B and C). Finally, to confirm that the HsMX1L41A mutant also showed a loss of antiviral activity in multiround infection experiments, we performed A/Victoria/3/75 WT virus growth curves in A549 cells stably expressing either HsMX1, the inactive HsMX1T103A mutant as a negative control, or HsMX1L41A. HsMX1 inhibited IAV replication by around two logs compared to the HsMX1T103A control at all time points (Fig. 2D). The HsMX1L41A mutant showed comparable virus yields to HsMX1T103A, confirming the inability of this mutant to inhibit IAV replication (Fig. 2D). Next, we investigated the subcellular localization of the N-terminal HsMX1 mutants using super-resolution Airyscan microscopy. As reported previously, HsMX1 showed a honeycomb-like, punctate cytoplasmic staining and HsMX1T103A presented a juxtanuclear accumulation (Fig. 2E) (24Dick A. Graf L. Olal D. von der Malsburg A. Gao S. Kochs G. et al.Role of nucleotide binding and GTPase domain dimerization in dynamin-like myxovirus resistance protein A for GTPase activation and antiviral activity.J. Biol.

Chem. 2015; 290: 29893-29906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, the HsMX1ΔNter mutant formed cytoplasmic aggregate-like structures that varied in size and were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2E). Unlike this mutant, HsMX1NNLC39-42A and HsMX1L41A accumulated at the perinuclear region into small spherical structures that were phenotypically different from those of HsMX1T103A or HsMX1ΔNter (Fig. 2E). This attests to a potential difference between the L41 point and N-terminal truncation mutants, which might be linked to differences in protein synthesis or stability as seen by immunoblot (Fig. 2, A–C). Taken together, these data showed that the N-terminal region, and more precisely, leucine 41, was essential for the anti-IAV activity and correct subcellular localization of HsMX1. To further understand the importance of this newly discovered essential residue for the antiviral activity of HsMX1, we tested the restriction abilities of aforementioned HsMX1 mutants against other RNA viruses known to be inhibited by HsMX1. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with either a control or HsMX1-WT or mutant expression constructs along with a Renilla luciferase–coding plasmid, and the infection levels of single-round rhabdovirus VSV firefly-expressing replicon particles (G-pseudotyped VSV∗ΔG-fLuc particles (41Berger Rentsch M. Zimmer G. A vesicular stomatitis virus replicon-based bioassay for the rapid and sensitive determination of multi-species type I interferon.PLoS One. 2011; 6e25858Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)) were measured (Fig. 3A). Reminiscent of what was observed for IAV (Fig. 2A), the HsMX1ΔNter, HsMX1NNLC39-42A, and HsMX1L41A mutants totally lost their ability to restrict the VSV∗ΔG-fLuc replicon (Fig. 3A). To confirm these results using WT VSV, BHK-21 cells stably expressing HsMX1, inactive HsMX1T103A, or HsMX1L41A were infected at low multiplicity of infection (MOI, 0.01) for 24 h and viral production was measured by plaque assays on Vero cells. HsMX1 inhibited VSV replication by over one log compared to HsMX1T103A, and HsMX1L41A did not impact viral replication, reaching similar titers as in the presence of HsMX1T103A (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W4309767304,"One of the first steps in ribosome biogenesis is transcription of the ribosomal DNA by RNA polymerase I (Pol I). Processing of the resultant rRNA begins cotranscriptionally, and perturbation of Pol I transcription elongation results in defective rRNA processing. Mechanistic insight regarding the link between transcription elongation and ribosome assembly is lacking because of limited in vivo methods to assay Pol I transcription. Here, we use native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-Seq) with a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing a point mutation in Pol I, rpa190-F1205H, which results in impaired rRNA processing and ribosome assembly. We previously demonstrated that this mutation caused a mild reduction in the transcription elongation rate of Pol I in vitro; however, transcription elongation by the mutant has not been characterized in vivo. Here, our findings demonstrate that the mutant Pol I has an increased pause propensity during processive transcription elongation both in vitro and in vivo. NET-Seq reveals that rpa190-F1205H Pol I displays alternative pause site preferences in vivo. Specifically, the mutant is sensitized to A/G residues in the RNA:DNA hybrid and at the last incorporated nucleotide position. Furthermore, both NET-Seq and EM analysis of Miller chromatin spreads reveal pileups of rpa190-F1205H Pol I throughout the ribosomal DNA, particularly at the 5' end of the 35S gene. This combination of in vitro and in vivo analyses of a Pol I mutant provides novel insights into Pol I elongation properties and indicates how these properties are crucial for efficient cotranscriptional rRNA processing and ribosome assembly."

Therefore, developing effective antiviral therapy against emerging SARS-CoV variants and other viruses in a short period becomes essential. Blocking SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells by disrupting the spike glycoprotein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction has already been exploited for vaccine development and monoclonal antibody therapy. Unlike the previous reports, our study used a nine-amino acid peptide from the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein as an epitope. We report the identification of an efficacious nanobody N1.2 that blocks the entry of pseudovirus-containing SARS-CoV-2 spike as the surface glycoprotein. Moreover, using mCherry fluorescence-based reporter assay, we observe a more potent neutralizing effect against both the hCoV19 (Wuhan/WIV04/2019) and the Omicron (BA.1) pseudotyped spike virus with a bivalent version of the N1.2 nanobody. In summary, our study presents a rapid and efficient methodology to use peptide sequences from a protein–receptor interaction interface as epitopes for screening nanobodies against potential pathogenic targets.

We propose that this approach can also be widely extended to target other viruses and pathogens in the future. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the betacoronavirus family and is the third member of the family after Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and SARS-CoV that has infected the human population, resulting in moderate to severe pathogenic symptoms (1Tang D. Comish P. Kang R. The hallmarks of COVID-19 disease.PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16e1008536Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). With the frequent outbreaks of new variants, these numbers are increasing every day (2Xu Z. Liu K. Gao G.F. Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 imposes a new challenge for the global public health.Biosaf. Health. 2022; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2022.01.002Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although several safe and effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies exist, which can prevent severe symptoms upon infection, none of them has been proven to be 100% effective. Partial vaccination, in turn, has put the SARS-CoV-2 virus under increased selection pressure resulting in a high mutation rate in the viral spike protein (3Cobey S. Larremore D.B. Grad Y.H. Lipsitch M. Concerns about SARS-CoV-2 evolution should not hold back efforts to expand vaccination.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). With the emergence of novel variants and escape mutants of SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need to develop effective antiviral therapy that can function as a panacea for both the current and emerging variants. The surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is decorated with homotrimer spike envelope glycoprotein, the major antigenic determinant of the host immune response and one of the main coronavirus drug targets (4He Y.

Immunol. Baltim. Md. 1950; 174: 4908-4915Google Scholar). The SARS-CoV-2 entry is orchestrated by the interaction of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell membrane (5Lan J.

Nanobodies, on the other hand, offer many advantages over conventional antibodies in terms of their size, high thermal stability, solubility, and ease of expression in bacteria, hence making them easily scalable and cost-effective therapies (24Muyldermans S. Nanobodies: natural single-domain antibodies.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 775-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Nanobodies, which are derived from the variable domain of the camelid heavy chain, retain specificity and affinity similar to conventional antibodies. Modularity in nanobodies allows oligomerization, hence increasing their avidity and serum shelf life (25Bannas P. Hambach J. Koch-Nolte F. Nanobodies and nanobody-based human heavy chain antibodies as antitumor therapeutics.Front. Immunol. 2017; 8: 1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Nanobodies can be easily humanized, which is critical for developing antiviral therapies for humans (26Vincke C. Loris R. Saerens D. Martinez-Rodriguez S. Muyldermans S. Conrath K.

A limitation of using the entire spike protein or RBD as an epitope is that the isolated antibodies may bind to different regions of spike protein other than the ACE2-interacting domain, thus rendering them unspecific and inefficient in fully neutralizing the viral infection. Here, we report the isolation of a nanobody (N1.2) from a yeast nanobody display library using a nine-amino acid peptide sequence as a target epitope. The peptide was designed from the specific residues present in the RBM of spike protein showing maximum interaction with the ACE2 receptor. This nanobody, both the monomer as well as the tandem dimer, interferes with ACE2 binding, thus showing a potent virus neutralization activity in cellular models. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the cellular ACE2 receptor in the host cell plasma membrane via its trimeric spike envelope protein to gain access to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). We designed two peptide sequences from the spike envelope protein; peptide-1 (residues 486–494) and peptide-2 (residues 496–505) from the RBM of hCoV19 (Wuhan/WIV04/2019) (5Lan J. Ge J. Yu J. Shan S. Zhou H. Fan S. et al.Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound to the ACE2 receptor.Nature. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2180-5Crossref Scopus (3405) Google Scholar). The choice of these two peptides was based on contact site and strength of interaction of RBD with ACE2. The 19-residue RBM stretch encompassing both the peptides has the maximum interaction sites with ACE2, which involves nine hydrogen bonds (5Lan J. Ge J. Yu J. Shan S. Zhou H. Fan S. et al.Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound to the ACE2 receptor.Nature. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2180-5Crossref Scopus (3405) Google Scholar). In addition, the RBM stretch is devoid of glycosylation sites reported so far in the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (27Ghorbani M. Brooks B.R. Klauda J.B. Exploring dynamics and network analysis of spike glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2.Biophys. J. 2021; 120: 2902-2913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), thus making the peptides an ideal candidate for nanobody screening. These peptides were used as bait (epitope) to enrich potential nanobody sequences from the combinatorial yeast display library (28McMahon C. Baier A.S. Pascolutti R. Wegrecki M. Zheng S. Ong J.X. et al.Yeast surface display platform for rapid discovery of conformationally selective nanobodies.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The screening methodology involves two rounds of magnetic screening followed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS)–based enrichment of the library (Fig. 1B). From the FACS analysis, only peptide-1 showed positive enrichment of the nanobody clones (Fig. 1B). Therefore, from here onward, we focused only on the nanobody population obtained from the peptide-1 screen. After FACS, the enriched yeast clones were individually analyzed using sequencing. Ten unique nanobody sequences were identified and purified, named N1.1 to N1.10, for further characterization (Fig. S1 and Table S1) (see the Experimental procedures section). These purified nanobodies were subjected to ELISA for characterizing the interaction with peptide-1 and peptide-2 (see the Experimental procedures section). All the nanobodies showed binding with the peptide-1 compared with the peptide-2, except N1.4 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the enriched nanobody clones N1.1 to N1.10 are specific toward the peptide-1 epitope. We then tested each of the purified nanobodies for their ability to block spike–ACE2 interaction using a pseudovirus-based neutralizing assay (Fig. 2A). Pseudoviruses displaying spike envelope glycoprotein with a mCherry reporter were generated (29Chen M. Zhang X.-E. Construction and applications of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses: a mini review.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2021; 17: 1574-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (see the Experimental procedures section). The viral infectivity was assessed using the mCherry expression, which was further quantified using fluorescence measurement (see the Experimental procedures section). Since the ACE2 expression in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells is lower compared with other cell lines (30Hoffmann M. Kleine-Weber H. Schroeder S. Krüger N. Herrler T. Erichsen S. et al.SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor.Cell. 2020; 181: 271-280.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11809) Google Scholar, 31Sherman E.J. Emmer B.T. ACE2 protein expression within isogenic cell lines is heterogeneous and associated with distinct transcriptomes.bioRxiv. 2021; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.26.437218Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar), we generated an ACE2-expressing stable HEK293T cell line, herein referred to as enhanced GFP (eGFP)-ACE2/HEK293T cells (see the Experimental procedures section). The eGFP-ACE2/HEK293T stable cell lines also coexpressed eGFP as a fluorescent marker to facilitate identifying the ACE2-expressing cells (Figs. 2B and S2) (see the Experimental procedures section). The eGFP-ACE2/HEK293T cells were transduced with varying dilutions of spike pseudoviruses (see the Experimental procedures section). Quantification using FACS analysis showed ∼75%, 55%, 16%, and 4% of cells transduced with mCherry fluorescence correlating with the varying dilution of pseudoviruses, respectively (Fig. S3, A and B). We characterized the transduction efficiency of the pseudovirus as a function of its multiplicity of infection (MOI). To test the efficacy of nanobodies in blocking viral entry, we choose to perform experiments with pseudovirus MOI that yield >70% transduction efficiency and low cellular cytotoxicity. About 25 μM of each nanobody, N1.1 to N1.10, was preincubated with the spike pseudovirus before infecting eGFP-ACE2/HEK293T cells (see the Experimental procedures section). Except for N1.2 and N1.3, all the nanobodies showed mCherry fluorescence (i.e., no effect on pseudovirus entry) upon transduction in the eGFP-ACE2/HEK293T cells (Figs. 2C and S4). Interestingly, the N1.2 nanobody showed maximum efficiency in neutralizing the spike pseudoviruses compared with the remainder of the nanobodies (Fig. 2C). Therefore, we decided to further characterize the N1.2 nanobody as a potential nanobody against SARS-CoV-2 virus entry. In our virus titration assays, we noticed that the FACS-based quantification does not scale according to the mCherry expression (Fig. S3, A and B). Therefore, we simultaneously correlated the mCherry fluorescence versus virus infection using confocal microscopy–based quantification (see the Experimental procedures section). In comparison to the FACS data, the confocal microscopy–based measurement showed a sharp decline in mCherry fluorescence, that is, >80% decrease in mCherry fluorescence when 1/10th of the virus dilution was used for infection (Fig. S3, C–E). Therefore, hereafter, we used confocal microscopy–based measurement to assess the neutralizing potential of N1.2 nanobody against spike pseudovirus. In the pseudovirus assay, we used different concentrations of N1.2 (5, 10, and 25 μM) and could observe a linear reduction in the infectivity of the spike pseudoviruses in the eGFP-ACE2/HEK293T stable cell lines (Figs. 3, B, C and S5). To achieve a more potent inhibitory effect with N1.2, we engineered and purified a bivalent nanobody, in which the N1.2 sequence was placed in tandem, separated by a glycine–serine linker (see the Experimental procedures section) (Fig. S1 and Table S1). The tandem N1.2, termed as (N1.2)2, showed a significant reduction in pseudoviral transduction at 5 and 10 μM concentrations (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting a cooperative effect in neutralizing the spike pseudovirus. To confirm if this inhibitory effect of N1.2 and (N1.2)2 is achieved by its direct binding to spike envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2, we performed control experiments using vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) pseudoviruses and bald pseudoviruses (no glycoprotein-envelope control) (Figs. 3A and S5). These control VSV-G pseudoviruses transduce the stable cells similar to the spike pseudoviruses in the presence and absence of nanobody N1.2 or (N1.2)2 (Fig. 3A). This indicates that the neutralizing effect of N1.2 and (N1.2)2 is obtained by direct binding of the nanobody to the spike protein. Therefore, the engineered nanobody N1.2 can be effectively applied for antiviral therapy against coronavirus disease 2019. We also tested the efficacy of the N1.2 against the newly emergent Omicron variant, using the Omicron BA.1 spike containing pseudoviruses expressing mCherry (see the Experimental procedures section). First, we confirmed the infectivity of varying concentrations of Omicron spike pseudovirus against eGFP-ACE2/HEK293T cells and determined an effective MOI (Fig. S3, A and B). Similar to the hCoV19 (Wuhan/WIV04/2019), the mCherry fluorescence was also scaled with the virus MOI for the Omicron variant spike pseudovirus in the confocal microscopy–based mCherry quantification (Fig. S3, C–E). We further tested the tandem nanobody (N1.2)2 neutralizing effect against the Omicron spike pseudovirus in GFP-HEK293T (Fig. S6) and eGFP-ACE2/HEK293T (Fig. 4) (see the Experimental procedures section). The hCoV19 (Wuhan/WIV04/2019) and Omicron spike pseudovirus were efficiently blocked by 5 μM of (N1.2)2 as observed from the confocal images in both cell lines (Figs. 4A and S6). Quantification of infectivity showed that in the presence of 5 μM of (N1.2)2 the infectivity dropped to <10% (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, it indicates the broad neutralizing ability of the N1.2 nanobody reported here against the current SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Since 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved into many subtypes and variants that are still prevalent across the globe (32Harvey W.T. Carabelli A.M. Jackson B. Gupta R.K. Thomson E.C. Harrison E.M. et al.SARS-CoV-2 variants, spike mutations and immune escape.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2021; 19: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is pivotal to identify the broad-spectrum therapeutics that can effectively work against all SARS-CoV-2 subtypes and variants. Equally important is to establish validated pipelines that can expedite identifying new therapeutics against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or new viruses. In this study, we have addressed both needs: first, we have identified a broad-spectrum nanobody that neutralizes the original Wuhan (WIV04) and Omicron BA.1 spike pseudovirus. Second, we have achieved the nanobody identification using a peptide as an antigen, unlike the whole spike or RBD protein of SARS-CoV-2 described earlier (13Wang C. Li W. Drabek D.

Ther. 2020; 5: 212Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), largely because these antibodies target the regions of the spike protein other than the ones involved in spike–ACE2 interaction. Peptides as antigens have been widely used for generating potent antibodies targeting the desired epitopes, for example, low-density lipoprotein receptor (36Schneider W.J. Slaughter C.J.

Structure-based epitope design: toward a greater antibody-SARS-CoV-2 RBD affinity.ACS Omega. 2021; 6: 31469-31476Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These and several other examples suggest that the unstructured peptides can be highly antigenic and potentially yield antibodies that recognize the peptide epitopes in whole protein both in ordered and disordered states. However, peptides and flexible loops from a target protein have seldom been used as antigenic baits for screening display libraries. We previously reported a nanobody against the tubulin post-translational modification using the flexible carboxy-terminal tail peptide (40Kesarwani S. Lama P. Chandra A. Reddy P.P. Jijumon A.S. Bodakuntla S. et al.Genetically encoded live-cell sensor for tyrosinated microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 2020; 219e201912107Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Applying a similar principle, here we show that a nine-amino acid peptide from the RBM of spike protein can also be employed as an epitope against a nanobody display library. The RBM adopts many conformations depending on the state of the apo spike protein and in complex with ACE2 (41Xu C. Wang Y. Liu C. Zhang C. Han W. Hong X. et al.Conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein in complex with receptor ACE2 revealed by cryo-EM.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7: eabe5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and in the absence of ACE2, the RBM appears to be unstructured (42Williams J.K. Wang B. Sam A. Hoop C.L. Case D.A. Baum J.

Bioinforma. 2022; 90: 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). From our experiments, the nanobody is able to block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus, suggesting that the nanobody N1.2 could potentially recognize the unstructured RBM sequence. This approach of using synthetic peptide as an epitope instead of purified whole protein molecules will certainly accelerate and fine-tune the entire screening process, which will yield nanobodies/antibodies that are efficacious in neutralizing potential targets of viruses in the future. The nanobody N1.2 described in this study is effective against both the spike proteins from the original hCoV19 (Wuhan/WIV04/2019) and the recent Omicron variant.

Moco is required for life; humans with inactivating mutations in the genes encoding Moco-biosynthetic enzymes display Moco deficiency, a rare and lethal inborn error of metabolism. Despite its importance to human health, little is known about how Moco moves among and between cells, tissues, and organisms. The prevailing view is that cells that require Moco must synthesize Moco de novo. Although, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans appears to be an exception to this rule and has emerged as a valuable system for understanding fundamental Moco biology. C. elegans has the seemingly unique capacity to both synthesize its own Moco as well as acquire Moco from its microbial diet. However, the relative contribution of Moco from the diet or endogenous synthesis has not been rigorously evaluated or quantified biochemically. We genetically removed dietary or endogenous Moco sources in C. elegans and biochemically determined their impact on animal Moco content and SUOX-1 activity. We demonstrate that dietary Moco deficiency dramatically reduces both animal Moco content and SUOX-1 activity. Furthermore, these biochemical deficiencies have physiological consequences; we show that dietary Moco deficiency alone causes sensitivity to sulfite, the toxic substrate of SUOX-1. Altogether, this work establishes the biochemical consequences of depleting dietary Moco or endogenous Moco synthesis in C. elegans and quantifies the surprising contribution of the diet to maintaining Moco homeostasis in C. elegans.

Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is a prosthetic group that was present in the last universal common ancestor and continues to be synthesized in all domains of life by a conserved biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1) (1Weiss M.C.

Biol. 2008; 379: 881-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moco supports the activity of four animal enzymes: sulfite oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (3Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Ribbe M.W. Molybdenum cofactors, enzymes and pathways.Nature. 2009; 460: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 4Mendel R.R. The molybdenum cofactor.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 13165-13172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, Moco is essential to support core metabolic pathways such as sulfur amino acid and purine metabolism. Moco was initially revealed in the 1960s through elegant genetic studies in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans (5Cove D.J. Pateman J.A. Independently segregating genetic loci concerned with nitrate reductase activity in Aspergillus nidulans.Nature. 1963; 198: 262-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. A common co-factor for nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase which also regulates the synthesis of nitrate reductase.Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Chemical mutagenesis screens were performed, leading to the isolation of mutants defective in both nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase activity. These mutants affected multiple genetic loci outlining the genes necessary for synthesizing CNX, a cofactor common to nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase (6Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. A common co-factor for nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase which also regulates the synthesis of nitrate reductase.Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). CNX is now known as Moco. Paralleling the genetic understanding of Moco deficiency in A. nidulans, human Moco deficiency was first documented in 1978 as a combined deficiency of xanthine dehydrogenase and sulfite oxidase, two Moco-requiring enzymes (7Duran M. Beemer F.A. van de Heiden C. Korteland J. de Bree P.K. Brink M. et al.Combined deficiency of xanthine oxidase and sulphite oxidase: a defect of molybdenum metabolism or transport?.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1978; 1: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Causative genetic lesions in human patients affected the orthologous biosynthetic pathway identified initially in A. nidulans. Patients presented with a severe range of symptoms as neonates, including difficulty feeding, neurological dysfunction, and eye lens dislocation. Symptoms typically appear within the first week of life and patients generally die within 3 years of birth (8Spiegel R. Schwahn B.C. Squires L. Confer N. Molybdenum cofactor deficiency: a natural history.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2022; 45: 456-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Excitingly, a therapy has been developed to treat a subset of patients suffering from Moco deficiency (9Veldman A. Santamaria-Araujo J.A. Sollazzo S. Pitt J. Gianello R. Yaplito-Lee J. et al.Successful treatment of molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A with cPMP.Pediatrics. 2010; 125: e1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Patients with defects in cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) synthesis can receive supplemental cPMP, which is converted to Moco by the healthy downstream Moco biosynthetic machinery. Unfortunately, cPMP therapy is only effective for patients with mutations in the first step in Moco synthesis. Supplementation with mature Moco seems a logical therapy to treat all forms of Moco deficiency. However, the instability and sensitivity of Moco to oxidation have proven experimentally limiting and precluded it from therapeutic consideration. Moco is a unique pterin and its chemical nature was ultimately resolved by studying its stable degradation products, one of which is known as “FormA” (10Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. The pterin component of the molybdenum cofactor. Structural characterization of two fluorescent derivatives.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kramer S.P. Johnson J.L. Ribeiro A.A. Millington D.S. Rajagopalan K.V. The structure of the molybdenum cofactor. Characterization of di-(carboxamidomethyl)molybdopterin from sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given its unstable nature, very little is known about how Moco moves within and between cells. Most Moco-requiring cells are believed to synthesize Moco de novo. However, recent advances in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have demonstrated that Moco can move not only between cells and tissues but between disparate organisms (12Snoozy J. Breen P.C. Ruvkun G. Warnhoff K. moc-6/MOCS2A is necessary for molybdenum cofactor synthesis in C. elegans.Micropubl. Biol. 2022; 2022https://doi.org/10.17912/micropub.biology.000531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Warnhoff K. Hercher T.W. Mendel R.R. Ruvkun G.

Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Unlike other animals studied, C. elegans with null mutations in genes encoding the Moco-biosynthetic enzymes are viable and fertile. These genes are termed moc in C. elegans for molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. moc mutant animals are viable because C. elegans stably acquires mature Moco from its bacterial diet. This dietary Moco is stabilized by Moco-binding/using proteins and is transported by unknown mechanisms throughout the C. elegans animal to support the activity of its Moco-requiring enzymes (13Warnhoff K. Hercher T.W. Mendel R.R. Ruvkun G. Protein-bound molybdenum cofactor is bioavailable and rescues molybdenum cofactor-deficient C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2021; 35: 212-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unsurprisingly, Moco is essential for C. elegans viability: animals lacking both endogenous Moco synthesis and dietary Moco arrest during larval development and die. This lethality is caused by the inactivity of sulfite oxidase (SUOX-1), a Moco-requiring enzyme that oxidizes the lethal toxin sulfite to sulfate (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sulfite oxidase is also essential in humans. Patients with inactivating mutations in sulfite oxidase develop clinical and biochemical features that mirror Moco deficiency, highlighting that SUOX-1 is likely the key Moco-requiring enzyme supporting animal life (7Duran M. Beemer F.A. van de Heiden C. Korteland J. de Bree P.K. Brink M. et al.Combined deficiency of xanthine oxidase and sulphite oxidase: a defect of molybdenum metabolism or transport?.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1978; 1: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Mudd S.H. Irreverre F. Laster L. Sulfite oxidase deficiency in man: demonstration of the enzymatic defect.Science. 1967; 156: 1599-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We reason that dietary Moco must enter the C. elegans animal through the intestine. However, the primary tissue responsible for Moco synthesis and use seems to be the hypodermis, a distal tissue. Tissue-specific expression of the moc-1 gene, encoding a Moco biosynthesis enzyme (Fig. 1), strongly rescues moc-1(-) null mutant phenotypes when transcribed from a hypodermal-specific promoter. moc-1 expression in muscle cells also rescues moc-1(-) mutant phenotypes, albeit to a lesser extent (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, only hypodermal expression of suox-1 was sufficient to rescue the lethality of a suox-1(-) null mutant animal (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results suggest Moco is both synthesized and acting primarily in the C. elegans hypodermis. Considering these findings, the functionality of dietary Moco is even more impressive: dietary Moco must travel from the environment, through the intestine, and be distributed to the hypodermis where it ultimately supports SUOX-1 activity. This journey likely involves the stable crossing of multiple cell membranes via an unknown mechanism. Here, we adapt biochemical protocols to quantify the contribution of dietary Moco versus endogenously synthesized Moco. We use genetic strategies to remove either source of Moco and evaluate the impact on (i) the activity of the Moco-requiring SUOX-1 enzyme and (ii) C. elegans Moco content found in crude C. elegans extracts. Furthermore, we evaluate the physiological impact of removing dietary Moco versus endogenously synthesized Moco by examining growth and development under pharmacological and genetic conditions where sulfite concentrations are toxic to animal growth. We demonstrate that dietary Moco and endogenously synthesized Moco are nonredundantly promoting Moco accumulation and SUOX-1 activity. Furthermore, removing either source of Moco causes sulfite sensitivity, indicating that both dietary Moco and endogenous Moco synthesis are required to promote optimal C. elegans fitness. To biochemically evaluate C. elegans Moco homeostasis, we generated crude extracts from large cultures of young adult animals. Animals were cultured on solid agar media seeded with a monoculture of Escherichia coli, the food source of C. elegans cultivated in the laboratory. Young adult animals were collected, extensively washed to remove E. coli cells, and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were subsequently lysed using a bead beater, and protein concentrations were determined via Bradford protein assay to allow for downstream normalization. These crude extracts were then used to determine SUOX-1 activity and Moco content. We first analyzed samples that we anticipated would have maximal and minimal SUOX-1 activity and Moco content to validate these approaches. We reasoned that WT C. elegans fed WT (Moco+) E. coli would have high levels of SUOX-1 activity and Moco as both endogenous Moco synthesis and dietary Moco uptake are functional in this context. In contrast, we used the moc-4; cdo-1 double mutant C. elegans fed ΔmoaA mutant (Moco-) E. coli as the sample where we anticipated little to no SUOX-1 activity or Moco content (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To validate that WT E. coli are Moco replete and ΔmoaA mutant E. coli are Moco deficient, we performed HPLC analyses and observed Moco content as detected by the fluorescent derivative dephospho-FormA (dpFormA) (10Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. The pterin component of the molybdenum cofactor. Structural characterization of two fluorescent derivatives.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we detected a strong dpFormA peak when analyzing WT E. coli and did not detect a peak in ΔmoaA mutant E. coli (Fig. S1). moc-4; cdo-1 double mutant C. elegans cannot synthesize their own Moco due to the null mutation in the moc-4 gene that encodes molybdopterin synthase (Fig. 1). moc-4 mutant animals typically display 100% penetrant larval arrest and death when cultured on Moco- E. coli. However, this lethality can be suppressed by mutations in cdo-1, which encodes cysteine dioxygenase (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). CDO-1 is a critical enzyme in the catabolism of sulfur amino acids and promotes the production of sulfites, the critical toxin when Moco is absent (Fig. 1) (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Gunnison A.F.

Studies on the reaction of sulfite with proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1733-1739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Würfel M. Häberlein I. Follmann H. Inactivation of thioredoxin by sulfite ions.FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). cdo-1 inactivation prevents the accumulation of sulfites and allows C. elegans animals to grow in the absence of endogenous and dietary Moco sources. Thus, we speculated that moc-4; cdo-1 double mutant animals cultured on Moco- E. coli would be completely Moco deficient and lack SUOX-1 activity. To determine SUOX-1 activity of these samples, we modified an assay based on a photometrically quantifiable reduction of cytochrome c (Fig. 2A) (19Cohen H.J. Betcher-Lange S. Kessler D.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Hepatic sulfite oxidase. Congruency in mitochondria of prosthetic groups and activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7759-7766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this reaction, sulfite is converted to sulfate, and cytochrome c acts as an electron donor. The resulting reduced form of cytochrome c has an increased absorption at A550, which we detect and quantify. Aligning with our expectations, we readily detected SUOX-1 activity from extracts of WT C. elegans fed Moco+ E. coli (0.33 U/mg), while we were unable to detect SUOX-1 activity from moc-4; cdo-1 double mutant animals fed Moco- E. coli (Fig. 2, B and C). moc-6 encodes another component of the Moco-biosynthetic machinery and is necessary for C. elegans Moco synthesis (Fig. 1) (12Snoozy J. Breen P.C. Ruvkun G. Warnhoff K. moc-6/MOCS2A is necessary for molybdenum cofactor synthesis in C. elegans.Micropubl. Biol. 2022; 2022https://doi.org/10.17912/micropub.biology.000531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supporting our findings with moc-4; cdo-1 animals, we were unable to detect SUOX-1 activity in crude extracts from moc-6; cdo-1 double mutant animals fed Moco- E. coli (Fig. 2C). These results align well with prior genetic data and validate this assay to quantify SUOX-1 activity from crude C. elegans extracts (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To determine Moco content of these same samples, crude extracts were oxidized and subsequently treated with alkaline phosphatase. Iodine-dependent oxidation and dephosphorylation convert highly unstable Moco and molybdopterin (MPT) to the stable and fluorescent derivative, dephospho-FormA (dpFormA) (Fig. 3A) (10Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. The pterin component of the molybdenum cofactor. Structural characterization of two fluorescent derivatives.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidized metabolites were then analyzed via HPLC (20Hercher T.W. Krausze J. Hoffmeister S. Zwerschke D. Lindel T. Blankenfeldt W. et al.Insights into the Cnx1E catalyzed MPT-AMP hydrolysis.Biosci. Rep. 2020; 40BSR20191806Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). dpFormA was detected with an average elution time of 5:40 min and quantified using established methods and standards (21Klewe A. Kruse T. Lindel T. Aminopyrazine pathway to the Moco metabolite dephospho form A.Chemistry. 2017; 23: 11230-11233Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Supporting our genetic hypotheses, we readily detected dpFormA in crude extracts of WT C. elegans fed Moco+ E. coli (1.3 pmol/mg) and were not able to detect Moco in moc-4; cdo-1 mutant animals fed Moco- E. coli (Fig. 3, B and C). We also analyzed crude extracts from moc-6; cdo-1 double mutant animals fed Moco- E. coli and were unable to detect Moco-derived dpFormA (Fig. 3C). To further validate that the peak highlighted in Figure 3B is dpFormA, the same samples were prepped and analyzed without alkaline phosphatase treatment. To be detected on a reversed-phase column, FormA must be dephosphorylated or it will not interact with the solid phase and elute in the void volume. Without alkaline phosphatase treatment, we did not see the highlighted peak in any of our samples, supporting our claim that this peak is dpFormA (Fig. S2). These results align well with expectations and validate this assay for quantifying Moco content from crude C. elegans extracts. Having established new methodology for quantifying SUOX-1 activity and Moco content in C. elegans, we sought to address some fundamental questions regarding Moco homeostasis. Principally, how much of the total Moco content of C. elegans is derived from the diet as compared to endogenous synthesis? To address this question, we generated C. elegans samples where we deprived the animals of either (i) dietary Moco (WT C. elegans fed Moco- E. coli) or (ii) endogenous Moco synthesis (moc-4 mutant C. elegans fed Moco+ E. coli). Extracts were generated from these samples, and SUOX-1 activity and Moco content were determined. WT C. elegans fed Moco- E. coli displayed only 11% SUOX-1 activity compared to WT C. elegans fed a Moco+ diet (Fig. 4A). This surprising result demonstrates that dietary Moco is necessary to promote SUOX-1 activity in WT C. elegans. Similar results were observed when we analyzed the same samples for Moco content. WT C. elegans fed Moco- E. coli displayed only 18% Moco content when compared to the same animals fed a Moco+ diet (Fig. 4B). These data demonstrate that dietary Moco is necessary to promote Moco accumulation in WT C. elegans. Given the critical role of dietary Moco in supporting SUOX-1 activity and animal Moco content, we wondered about the relative importance of endogenous Moco synthesis. To evaluate this, we cultured moc-4 mutant C. elegans on Moco+ E. coli, restricting the animal’s Moco source to the diet. We generated crude extracts from these samples and determined SUOX-1 activity and Moco content. moc-4 mutant animals had 28% of the SUOX-1 activity displayed by their WT counterparts and 64% of the Moco content (Fig. 5). We saw similar results when evaluating moc-6 mutant animals fed Moco+ E. coli, which displayed 39% of WT SUOX-1 activity and 65% of Moco content (Fig. 5). These data demonstrate that endogenous Moco synthesis is necessary to promote SUOX-1 activity and Moco accumulation in C. elegans. SUOX-1 is an essential enzyme in both C. elegans and humans (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Mudd S.H. Irreverre F. Laster L. Sulfite oxidase deficiency in man: demonstration of the enzymatic defect.Science. 1967; 156: 1599-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of suox-1 in C. elegans biology, we use the hypomorphic suox-1(gk738847) allele as a genetic tool as it reduces suox-1 function but does not cause overt developmental phenotypes (13Warnhoff K.

Adair R. et al.The million mutation project: a new approach to genetics in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 1749-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). gk738847 is a missense mutation resulting in the amino acid substitution D391N. Aspartic acid 391 is highly conserved from C. elegans to humans (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. Basic local alignment search tool.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). To characterize the impact of the D391N substitution to SUOX-1 activity, we prepared crude extracts from young adult WT and suox-1(gk738847) animals cultured on Moco+ E. coli. SUOX-1 activity of these extracts was then evaluated. Our data demonstrate that suox-1(gk738847) mutant animals displayed 4% SUOX-1 activity compared to their WT counterparts (Fig. 6A). Despite this dramatic reduction in SUOX-1 activity, suox-1(gk738847) mutant animals appear superficially WT when cultured under standard laboratory conditions. To probe for fitness defects caused by reduced SUOX-1 activity, we cultured WT and suox-1(gk738847) animals on Moco+ bacteria exposed to various concentrations of supplemental sulfite. WT C. elegans fed Moco+ bacteria tolerate high sulfite well, displaying a IC50 of 0.0077M supplemental sulfite. In contrast, suox-1(gk738847) mutant animals are sensitive to sulfite displaying an IC50 of 0.0024M supplemental sulfite (Fig. 6, B and D). These results align well with previous studies (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data biochemically demonstrate the effect of the suox-1(gk738847) D391N mutation on the activity of SUOX-1 in crude C. elegans extracts. Furthermore, we show that suox-1 is essential for tolerating high supplemental sulfite and establish a sulfite-sensitivity assay for detecting physiological outcomes of reduced SUOX-1 activity. Our biochemical analyses demonstrate that WT C. elegans fed a diet of Moco- E. coli show decreased SUOX-1 activity (Fig. 4A). Like suox-1(gk738847) mutant animals, WT C. elegans provided Moco- E. coli appear superficially healthy under standard culture conditions (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the reductions in SUOX-1 activity caused by a Moco- diet would cause sulfite sensitivity. To test this, we exposed WT C. elegans cultured on Moco+ or Moco- E. coli to various concentrations of supplemental sulfite and analyzed growth and development. WT C. elegans fed Moco+ E. coli tolerate sulfite well and display an IC50 of 0.0077 M supplemental sulfite. By contrast, WT animals fed Moco- E. coli were sensitive to supplemental sulfite, displaying an IC50 of 0.0024 M supplemental sulfite (Fig. 6, C and D). These data demonstrate that dietary Moco is necessary for sulfite tolerance in C. elegans. Given the requirement of dietary Moco to support sulfite tolerance, we wondered if endogenous Moco synthesis would also be essential for this process. To test the role of endogenously synthesized Moco in sulfite tolerance, we analyzed moc-4 null mutant C. elegans that cannot synthesize Moco (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We exposed moc-4 mutant C. elegans cultured on Moco+ E. coli to various concentrations of supplemental sulfite and analyzed their growth and development. When compared to WT animals fed Moco+ bacteria, we found that moc-4 mutant C. elegans grown on Moco+ E. coli were sensitive to supplemental sulfite, displaying an IC50 of 0.0044M supplemental sulfite (Fig. 6, C and D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that dietary Moco and endogenous Moco synthesis are nonredundantly required for C. elegans to tolerate high environmental sulfite. Our biochemical analyses of Moco content and SUOX-1 activity paired with our pharmacological experiments with supplemental sulfite suggest a model for Moco homeostasis whereby endogenous synthesis and dietary acquisition of Moco are acting nonredundantly to promote healthy Moco content in C. elegans, thus promoting SUOX-1 activity. To further test this model, we used the suox-1(gk738847) allele as a sensitized genetic background. We observed the development of these mutant animals when we altered (i) dietary Moco availability and (ii) endogenous Moco synthesis. To test the role dietary Moco plays in supporting the development of suox-1(gk738847) mutant C. elegans, we cultured suox-1(gk738847) mutant animals on Moco+, Moco-, and mixtures of Moco+/Moco- E. coli. suox-1(gk738847) mutant animals grew well on Moco+ E. coli and 50:50 mixtures of Moco+ and Moco- E. coli, reaching fertile adulthood within 72 h of development post first larval (L1) stage (Fig. 7). However, we observe dose-dependent developmental delay in suox-1(gk738847) mutant animals at reduced fractions of Moco+ E. coli (IC50 of 0.06 Moco+ E. coli in Moco- E. coli, Fig. S3A). Furthermore, suox-1(gk738847) animals displayed the most substantial reduction in growth and development when cultured on completely Moco- E. coli, failing to progress through larval development within the 72 h assay (Figs. 7 and S3A). Importantly, WT C. elegans reached fertile adulthood in our developmental assays on all mixtures of Moco+ and Moco- E. coli (Fig. S3B). These data align well with our previous studies and demonstrate that dietary Moco is required for the growth and development of suox-1(gk738847) mutant animals (14Warnhoff K. Ruvkun G. Molybdenum cofactor transfer from bacteria to nematode mediates sulfite detoxification.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W4309835699,"Recent discovery of the ribosomal protein (RP) RPL11 interacting with and inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of MDM2 established the RP-MDM2-p53 signaling pathway, which is linked to biological events, including ribosomal biogenesis, nutrient availability, and metabolic homeostasis. Mutations in RPs lead to a diverse array of phenotypes known as ribosomopathies in which the role of p53 is implicated. Here, we generated conditional RPL11-deletion mice to investigate in vivo effects of impaired RP expression and its functional connection with p53. While deletion of one Rpl11 allele in germ cells results in embryonic lethality, deletion of one Rpl11 allele in adult mice does not affect viability but leads to acute anemia. Mechanistically, we found RPL11 haploinsufficiency activates p53 in hematopoietic tissues and impedes erythroid precursor differentiation, resulting in insufficient red blood cell development. We demonstrated that reducing p53 dosage by deleting one p53 allele rescues RPL11 haploinsufficiency-induced inhibition of erythropoietic precursor differentiation and restores normal red blood cell levels in mice. Furthermore, blocking the RP-MDM2-p53 pathway by introducing an RP-binding mutation in MDM2 prevents RPL11 haploinsufficiency-caused p53 activation and rescues the anemia in mice. Together, these findings demonstrate that the RP-MDM2-p53 pathway is a critical checkpoint for RP homeostasis and that p53-dependent cell cycle arrest of erythroid precursors is the molecular basis for the anemia phenotype commonly associated with RP deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4309931023,"Nudix hydrolase 7 (NUDT7) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes CoA species, is highly expressed in the liver, and resides in the peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are organelles where the preferential oxidation of dicarboxylic fatty acids occurs and where the hepatic synthesis of the primary bile acids cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid is completed. We previously showed that liver-specific overexpression of NUDT7 affects peroxisomal lipid metabolism but does not prevent the increase in total liver CoA levels that occurs during fasting. We generated Nudt7-/- mice to further characterize the role that peroxisomal (acyl-)CoA degradation plays in the modulation of the size and composition of the acyl-CoA pool and in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism. Here, we show that deletion of Nudt7 alters the composition of the hepatic acyl-CoA pool in mice fed a low-fat diet, but only in males fed a Western diet does the lack of NUDT7 activity increase total liver CoA levels. This effect is driven by the male-specific accumulation of medium-chain dicarboxylic acyl-CoAs, which are produced from the β-oxidation of dicarboxylic fatty acids. We also show that, under conditions of elevated synthesis of chenodeoxycholic acid derivatives, Nudt7 deletion promotes the production of tauromuricholic acid, decreasing the hydrophobicity index of the intestinal bile acid pool and increasing fecal cholesterol excretion in male mice. These findings reveal that NUDT7-mediated hydrolysis of acyl-CoA pathway intermediates in liver peroxisomes contributes to the regulation of dicarboxylic fatty acid metabolism and the composition of the bile acid pool."

We further discuss how GATTACA’s prescient forewarnings are still relevant today in light of the current trajectory of genomic science and technology."
https://openalex.org/W4310059960,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer. Accumulating evidence indicates that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a key predisposing factor for HCC occurrence. However, the precise mechanisms driving NASH transition to HCC remain largely obscure. Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) is a sulfhydryl oxidase and cytochrome c reductase that functions as an important regulator of mitochondrial dynamics. In this study, we focused on ALR ubiquitination-mediated degradation and its potential contribution to NASH-driven HCC progression at the mitochondrial level. Hepatic ALR expression in HCC patients was determined using immunohistochemical analysis. Mice with liver-specific deletion of ALR (ALRCKO) and ALRWT mice were fed a western diet (WD) and high-sugar solution for induction of NASH. HCC in animals was induced via peritoneal administration of CCl4. ALR expression was markedly decreased in liver tissues of patients with NASH and HCC compared with non-NASH and non-tumor tissues. Similarly, in ALRWT mice, the ALR level in tumor tissue was reduced relative to that in para-tumor tissue. In the ALRCKO group, mice fed WD plus CCl4 developed HCC starting at week 12 while ALRWT mice fed WD plus CCl4 developed HCC at week 24. Analysis of protein posttranslational modifications revealed ubiquitylation (Ub) and deubiquitination (DUb) of ALR by murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and ubiquitin-specific protease 36 (USP36), respectively. Imbalance between Ub and DUb of ALR resulted in profound ALR degradation, which appeared to be reversibly associated with Edmondson-Steiner tumor grade. Rescue of ALR levels via gene transfection abolished tumor malignant features to a certain extent in vitro. Notably, ALR deletion substantially enhanced mitochondrial fission by activating Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser616, thus disrupting the balance of mitochondrial dynamics between fission and fusion and severely impairing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and ATP synthesis, instead enhancing anaerobic metabolism, which might be attributed to steatotic hepatocyte transition into the malignant HCC phenotype. Hepatic ALR depletion via dysregulation of ubiquitination is a critical aggravator of NASH-HCC progression and represents a promising therapeutic target for related liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4309769116,"USP14 deubiquitinates ERα to maintain its stability in ECEndometrial cancer (EC) is one of the common gynecological malignancies of which the incidence has been rising for decades. It is considered that continuously unopposed estrogen exposure is the main risk factor for EC initiation. Thus, exploring the modulation of estrogen/estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling pathway in EC would be helpful to well understand the mechanism of EC development and find the potential target for EC therapy. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14), a member of the proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme family, plays a crucial role in a series of tumors. However, the function of USP14 in EC is still elusive. Here, our results have demonstrated that USP14 is highly expressed in EC tissues compared with that in normal endometrial tissues, and higher expression of USP14 is positively correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover, USP14 maintains ERα stability through its deubiquitination activity. Our results further demonstrate that USP14 depletion decreases the expression of ERα-regulated genes in EC-derived cell lines. Moreover, knockdown of USP14 or USP14-specific inhibitor treatment significantly suppresses cell growth and migration in EC cell lines or in mice. We further provide the evidence to show that the effect of USP14 on EC cell growth, if not all, at least is partially related to ERα pathway. Our study provides new sights for USP14 to be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of EC, especially for EC patients with fertility preservation needs."

Metal-organic frameworks are a promising delivery system to reformulate previously approved drugs for enhanced chemotherapy, such as disulfiram (DSF). Herein, a tumor microenvironment-activated metal-organic framework-based nanoplatform DSF@MOF-199@FA has been fabricated to realize amplified oxidative stress-induced enhanced chemotherapy. Our results unveil that the copper ions and DSF released by DSF@MOF-199@FA in an acidic environment can be converted into toxic bis(N, N-diethyl dithiocarbamate) copper and then induce cell apoptosis. Simultaneously, we determined that the apoptosis outcome is further promoted by amplified oxidative stress through effective generation of reactive oxygen species and GSH elimination. In conclusion, this work provides a promising platform for effective anticancer treatment."
