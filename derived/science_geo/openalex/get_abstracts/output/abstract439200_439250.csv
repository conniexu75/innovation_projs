https://openalex.org/W2132576596,"Jane Worthington and colleagues use a high-density genotyping chip to identify new susceptibility loci for rheumatoid arthritis and examine genetic overlap with other autoimmune diseases. Their results increase the number of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci in individuals of European ancestry and refine the location of many previously identified association signals to single genes. Using the Immunochip custom SNP array, which was designed for dense genotyping of 186 loci identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we analyzed 11,475 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (cases) of European ancestry and 15,870 controls for 129,464 markers. We combined these data in a meta-analysis with GWAS data from additional independent cases (n = 2,363) and controls (n = 17,872). We identified 14 new susceptibility loci, 9 of which were associated with rheumatoid arthritis overall and five of which were specifically associated with disease that was positive for anticitrullinated peptide antibodies, bringing the number of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci in individuals of European ancestry to 46. We refined the peak of association to a single gene for 19 loci, identified secondary independent effects at 6 loci and identified association to low-frequency variants at 4 loci. Bioinformatic analyses generated strong hypotheses for the causal SNP at seven loci. This study illustrates the advantages of dense SNP mapping analysis to inform subsequent functional investigations."
https://openalex.org/W1995185151,"Protracted social isolation of adult mice induced behavioral, transcriptional and ultrastructural changes in oligodendrocytes of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and impaired adult myelination. Social re-integration was sufficient to normalize behavioral and transcriptional changes. Short periods of isolation affected chromatin and myelin, but did not induce behavioral changes. Thus, myelinating oligodendrocytes in the adult PFC respond to social interaction with chromatin changes, suggesting that myelination acts as a form of adult plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2018380248,"Silvère van der Maarel, Stephen Tapscott, Daniel Miller and colleagues show that digenic inheritance of a mutation in SMCHD1 and a chromosome 4 haplotype permissive for DUX4 mRNA polyadenylation causes fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy type 2. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is characterized by chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array on chromosome 4 and expression of the D4Z4-encoded DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. The more common form, autosomal dominant FSHD1, is caused by contraction of the D4Z4 array, whereas the genetic determinants and inheritance of D4Z4 array contraction–independent FSHD2 are unclear. Here, we show that mutations in SMCHD1 (encoding structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1) on chromosome 18 reduce SMCHD1 protein levels and segregate with genome-wide D4Z4 CpG hypomethylation in human kindreds. FSHD2 occurs in individuals who inherited both the SMCHD1 mutation and a normal-sized D4Z4 array on a chromosome 4 haplotype permissive for DUX4 expression. Reducing SMCHD1 levels in skeletal muscle results in D4Z4 contraction–independent DUX4 expression. Our study identifies SMCHD1 as an epigenetic modifier of the D4Z4 metastable epiallele and as a causal genetic determinant of FSHD2 and possibly other human diseases subject to epigenetic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2015782236,"Sandeep Dave and colleagues report exome sequencing of 59 Burkitt lymphomas. They report recurrent mutations in many genes, including ID3, MYC, GNA13, RET, PIK3R1, NOTCH1 and the SWI/SNF genes ARID1A and SMARCA4. Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by deregulation of MYC, but the contribution of other genetic mutations to the disease is largely unknown. Here, we describe the first completely sequenced genome from a Burkitt lymphoma tumor and germline DNA from the same affected individual. We further sequenced the exomes of 59 Burkitt lymphoma tumors and compared them to sequenced exomes from 94 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors. We identified 70 genes that were recurrently mutated in Burkitt lymphomas, including ID3, GNA13, RET, PIK3R1 and the SWI/SNF genes ARID1A and SMARCA4. Our data implicate a number of genes in cancer for the first time, including CCT6B, SALL3, FTCD and PC. ID3 mutations occurred in 34% of Burkitt lymphomas and not in DLBCLs. We show experimentally that ID3 mutations promote cell cycle progression and proliferation. Our work thus elucidates commonly occurring gene-coding mutations in Burkitt lymphoma and implicates ID3 as a new tumor suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2156108573,"In this study, the authors report that a focal cortical injury can induce changes in the excitability of thalamocortical neurons that contributes to the maintenance of cortical seizures. In addition, silencing these neurons via a closed-loop optogenetic approach is sufficient to interrupt these seizures. Cerebrocortical injuries such as stroke are a major source of disability. Maladaptive consequences can result from post-injury local reorganization of cortical circuits. For example, epilepsy is a common sequela of cortical stroke, but the mechanisms responsible for seizures following cortical injuries remain unknown. In addition to local reorganization, long-range, extra-cortical connections might be critical for seizure maintenance. In rats, we found that the thalamus, a structure that is remote from, but connected to, the injured cortex, was required to maintain cortical seizures. Thalamocortical neurons connected to the injured epileptic cortex underwent changes in HCN channel expression and became hyperexcitable. Targeting these neurons with a closed-loop optogenetic strategy revealed that reducing their activity in real-time was sufficient to immediately interrupt electrographic and behavioral seizures. This approach is of therapeutic interest for intractable epilepsy, as it spares cortical function between seizures, in contrast with existing treatments, such as surgical lesioning or drugs."

https://openalex.org/W1992845452,"Guan and colleagues report that the Hippo pathway effector YAP regulates PI(3)K–mTOR signalling. YAP induces expression of the microRNA miR-29 to block PTEN expression, activating the PI(3)K pathway. Hippo and PI(3)K pathways thus converge to regulate cell growth and proliferation. Organ development is a complex process governed by the interplay of several signalling pathways that have critical functions in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Over the past years, the Hippo pathway has emerged as a key regulator of organ size. Perturbation of this pathway has been shown to play important roles in tumorigenesis. YAP, the main downstream target of the mammalian Hippo pathway, promotes organ growth, yet the underlying molecular mechanism of this regulation remains unclear. Here we provide evidence that YAP activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a major regulator of cell growth. We have identified the tumour suppressor PTEN, an upstream negative regulator of mTOR, as a critical mediator of YAP in mTOR regulation. We demonstrate that YAP downregulates PTEN by inducing miR-29 to inhibit PTEN translation. Last, we show that PI(3)K–mTOR is a pathway modulated by YAP to regulate cell size, tissue growth and hyperplasia. Our studies reveal a functional link between Hippo and PI(3)K–mTOR, providing a molecular basis for the coordination of these two pathways in organ size regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2166170465,"Burkitt lymphoma is a mature aggressive B-cell lymphoma derived from germinal center B cells1. Its cytogenetic hallmark is the Burkitt translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32) and its variants, which juxtapose the MYC oncogene with one of the three immunoglobulin loci2. Consequently, MYC is deregulated, resulting in massive perturbation of gene expression3. Nevertheless, MYC deregulation alone seems not to be sufficient to drive Burkitt lymphomagenesis. By whole-genome, whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of four prototypical Burkitt lymphomas with immunoglobulin gene (IG)-MYC translocation, we identified seven recurrently mutated genes. One of these genes, ID3, mapped to a region of focal homozygous loss in Burkitt lymphoma4. In an extended cohort, 36 of 53 molecularly defined Burkitt lymphomas (68%) carried potentially damaging mutations of ID3. These were strongly enriched at somatic hypermutation motifs. Only 6 of 47 other B-cell lymphomas with the IG-MYC translocation (13%) carried ID3 mutations. These findings suggest that cooperation between ID3 inactivation and IG-MYC translocation is a hallmark of Burkitt lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2123263640,"Accumulating evidence suggests that global depletion of adult hippocampal neurogenesis influences its function and that the timing of the depletion affects the deficits. However, the behavioral roles of adult-born neurons during their establishment of projections to CA3 pyramidal neurons remain largely unknown. We used a combination of retroviral and optogenetic approaches to birth date and reversibly control a group of adult-born neurons in adult mice. Adult-born neurons formed functional synapses on CA3 pyramidal neurons as early as 2 weeks after birth, and this projection to the CA3 area became stable by 4 weeks in age. Newborn neurons at this age were more plastic than neurons at other stages. Notably, we found that reversibly silencing this cohort of ~4-week-old cells after training, but not cells of other ages, substantially disrupted retrieval of hippocampal memory. Our results identify a restricted time window for adult-born neurons essential in hippocampal memory retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W2165478810,"The authors assessed the contributions of early life stress (ELS) and childhood cortisol levels to adolescent resting-state functional connectivity. In females, ELS predicted increased cortisol levels in childhood, which predicted decreased amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) functional connectivity. Amygdala-vmPFC connectivity was inversely correlated with anxious sympotms and positively correlated with depressive symptoms. Early life stress (ELS) and function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis predict later psychopathology. Animal studies and cross-sectional human studies suggest that this process might operate through amygdala–ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) circuitry implicated in the regulation of emotion. Here we prospectively investigated the roles of ELS and childhood basal cortisol amounts in the development of adolescent resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC), assessed by functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI), in the amygdala-PFC circuit. In females only, greater ELS predicted increased childhood cortisol levels, which predicted decreased amygdala-vmPFC rs-FC 14 years later. For females, adolescent amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity was inversely correlated with concurrent anxiety symptoms but positively associated with depressive symptoms, suggesting differing pathways from childhood cortisol levels function through adolescent amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity to anxiety and depression. These data highlight that, for females, the effects of ELS and early HPA-axis function may be detected much later in the intrinsic processing of emotion-related brain circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2125385355,"Pancreatitis is a complex, progressively destructive inflammatory disorder. Alcohol was long thought to be the primary causative agent, but genetic contributions have been of interest since the discovery that rare PRSS1, CFTR and SPINK1 variants were associated with pancreatitis risk. We now report two associations at genome-wide significance identified and replicated at PRSS1-PRSS2 (P < 1 × 10(-12)) and X-linked CLDN2 (P < 1 × 10(-21)) through a two-stage genome-wide study (stage 1: 676 cases and 4,507 controls; stage 2: 910 cases and 4,170 controls). The PRSS1 variant likely affects disease susceptibility by altering expression of the primary trypsinogen gene. The CLDN2 risk allele is associated with atypical localization of claudin-2 in pancreatic acinar cells. The homozygous (or hemizygous in males) CLDN2 genotype confers the greatest risk, and its alleles interact with alcohol consumption to amplify risk. These results could partially explain the high frequency of alcohol-related pancreatitis in men (male hemizygote frequency is 0.26, whereas female homozygote frequency is 0.07)."
https://openalex.org/W2049330354,"Qing Lan and colleagues report the results of a genome-wide association study of lung cancer in never-smoking women from Asia. They identify three new susceptibility loci and confirm three other previously reported associations. To identify common genetic variants that contribute to lung cancer susceptibility, we conducted a multistage genome-wide association study of lung cancer in Asian women who never smoked. We scanned 5,510 never-smoking female lung cancer cases and 4,544 controls drawn from 14 studies from mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. We genotyped the most promising variants (associated at P < 5 × 10−6) in an additional 1,099 cases and 2,913 controls. We identified three new susceptibility loci at 10q25.2 (rs7086803, P = 3.54 × 10−18), 6q22.2 (rs9387478, P = 4.14 × 10−10) and 6p21.32 (rs2395185, P = 9.51 × 10−9). We also confirmed associations reported for loci at 5p15.33 and 3q28 and a recently reported finding at 17q24.3. We observed no evidence of association for lung cancer at 15q25 in never-smoking women in Asia, providing strong evidence that this locus is not associated with lung cancer independent of smoking."

https://openalex.org/W1974161033,"Voinnet and colleagues show that autophagy targets RNAi components DICER and AGO2 for degradation when they are not bound to miRNA. The autophagy receptor NDP52 is required for this homeostatic regulation of the RNAi machinery. The authors also found that autophagy influences the post-translational regulation of DICER mRNA. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) form a class of short RNAs (∼ 21 nucleotides) that post-transcriptionally regulate partially complementary messenger RNAs. Each miRNA may target tens to hundreds of transcripts to control key biological processes. Although the biochemical reactions underpinning miRNA biogenesis and activity are relatively well defined1,2 and the importance of their homeostasis is increasingly evident, the processes underlying regulation of the miRNA pathway in vivo are still largely elusive3. Autophagy, a degradative process in which cytoplasmic material is targeted into double-membrane vacuoles, is recognized to critically contribute to cellular homeostasis. Here, we show that the miRNA-processing enzyme, DICER (also known as DICER1), and the main miRNA effector, AGO2 (also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2C, 2 (EIF2C2)), are targeted for degradation as miRNA-free entities by the selective autophagy receptor NDP52 (also known as calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2 (CALCOCO2)). Autophagy establishes a checkpoint required for continued loading of miRNA into AGO2; accordingly, NDP52 and autophagy are required for homeostasis and activity of the tested miRNAs. Autophagy also engages post-transcriptional regulation of the DICER mRNA, underscoring the importance of fine-tuned regulation of the miRNA pathway. These findings have implications for human diseases linked to misregulated autophagy, DICER- and miRNA-levels, including cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2075564365,"Cystic kidney diseases are a global public health burden, affecting over 12 million people. Although much is known about the genetics of kidney development and disease, the cellular mechanisms driving normal kidney tubule elongation remain unclear. Here, we used in vivo imaging to show for the first time that mediolaterally oriented cell intercalation is fundamental to vertebrate kidney morphogenesis. Unexpectedly, we found that kidney tubule elongation is driven in large part by a myosin-dependent, multicellular rosette-based mechanism, previously only described in Drosophila melanogaster. In contrast to findings in Drosophila, however, non-canonical Wnt and planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling is required to control rosette topology and orientation during vertebrate kidney tubule elongation. These data resolve long-standing questions concerning the role of PCP signaling in the developing kidney and, moreover, establish rosette-based intercalation as a deeply conserved cellular engine for epithelial morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2138976678,"The authors use a computational approach (NETBAG+) to integrate and analyze diverse genetic data and apply this to study schizophrenia-associated genetic variations. They identify gene networks related to axon guidance, synaptic function, cell mobility and chromosomal remodeling. Despite the successful identification of several relevant genomic loci, the underlying molecular mechanisms of schizophrenia remain largely unclear. We developed a computational approach (NETBAG+) that allows an integrated analysis of diverse disease-related genetic data using a unified statistical framework. The application of this approach to schizophrenia-associated genetic variations, obtained using unbiased whole-genome methods, allowed us to identify several cohesive gene networks related to axon guidance, neuronal cell mobility, synaptic function and chromosomal remodeling. The genes forming the networks are highly expressed in the brain, with higher brain expression during prenatal development. The identified networks are functionally related to genes previously implicated in schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disability. A comparative analysis of copy number variants associated with autism and schizophrenia suggests that although the molecular networks implicated in these distinct disorders may be related, the mutations associated with each disease are likely to lead, at least on average, to different functional consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2132322753,"Congenital central hypothyroidism occurs either in isolation or in conjunction with other pituitary hormone deficits. Using exome and candidate gene sequencing, we identified 8 distinct mutations and 2 deletions in IGSF1 in males from 11 unrelated families with central hypothyroidism, testicular enlargement and variably low prolactin concentrations. IGSF1 is a membrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in the anterior pituitary gland, and the identified mutations impair its trafficking to the cell surface in heterologous cells. Igsf1-deficient male mice show diminished pituitary and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations, reduced pituitary thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor expression, decreased triiodothyronine concentrations and increased body mass. Collectively, our observations delineate a new X-linked disorder in which loss-of-function mutations in IGSF1 cause central hypothyroidism, likely secondary to an associated impairment in pituitary TRH signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2116081216,"The function of neuroligins in regulating synapse formation remains controversial. Here, the authors show that neuroligin-1 (NL1) regulates activity-dependent synaptogenesis and mature synapse number on cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in vivo. They find that relative differences in transcellular expression of NL1, rather than absolute expression levels, regulate synapse number. Members of the neuroligin family of cell-adhesion proteins are found at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and are mutated in some familial forms of autism spectrum disorders. Although they display synaptogenic properties in heterologous systems, the function of neuroligins in vivo in the regulation of synapse formation and synapse number has been difficult to establish. We found that neuroligin-1 (NL1), which is located at excitatory postsynaptic densities, regulates activity-dependent synaptogenesis and mature synapse number on cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in vivo. However, synapse number was not sensitive to absolute NL1 levels but instead depended on transcellular differences in the relative amounts of NL1. These effects were independent of the cell-autonomous regulation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors by absolute levels of NL1. Our data indicate that transcellular competitive processes govern synapse formation and number in developing cortex and that NL1 has a central function in these processes."
https://openalex.org/W1974959940,"Fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (FSMCs) are principal cell types of connective and adventitial tissues that participate in the development, physiology and pathology of internal organs, with incompletely defined cellular origins. Here, we identify and prospectively isolate from the mesothelium a mouse cell lineage that is committed to FSMCs. The mesothelium is an epithelial monolayer covering the vertebrate thoracic and abdominal cavities and internal organs. Time-lapse imaging and transplantation experiments reveal robust generation of FSMCs from the mesothelium. By targeting mesothelin (MSLN), a surface marker expressed on mesothelial cells, we identify and isolate precursors capable of clonally generating FSMCs. Using a genetic lineage tracing approach, we show that embryonic and adult mesothelium represents a common lineage to trunk FSMCs, and trunk vasculature, with minimal contributions from neural crest, or circulating cells. The isolation of FSMC precursors enables the examination of multiple aspects of smooth muscle and fibroblast biology as well as the prospective isolation of these precursors for potential regenerative medicine purposes."

The combined organization of these particular tuning properties in the cortical space will strongly shape the V1 population response to different visual inputs, yet it is poorly understood. In this study, we used two-photon imaging in macaque monkey V1 to demonstrate the three-dimensional cell-by-cell layout of both spatial frequency and orientation tuning. We first found that spatial frequency tuning was organized into highly structured maps that remained consistent across the depth of layer II/III, similarly to orientation tuning. Next, we found that orientation and spatial frequency maps were intimately related at the fine spatial scale observed with two-photon imaging. Not only did the map gradients tend notably toward orthogonality, but they also co-varied negatively from cell to cell at the spatial scale of cortical columns."
https://openalex.org/W1991345823,"The oxidation and nitration of unsaturated fatty acids by oxides of nitrogen yield electrophilic derivatives that can modulate protein function via post-translational protein modifications. The biological mechanisms accounting for fatty acid nitration and the specific structural characteristics of products remain to be defined. Herein, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is identified as the primary endogenous substrate for fatty acid nitration in vitro and in vivo, yielding up to 10(5) greater extent of nitration products as compared with bis-allylic linoleic acid. Multiple enzymatic and cellular mechanisms account for CLA nitration, including reactions catalyzed by mitochondria, activated macrophages, and gastric acidification. Nitroalkene derivatives of CLA and their metabolites are detected in the plasma of healthy humans and are increased in tissues undergoing episodes of ischemia reperfusion. Dietary CLA and nitrite supplementation in rodents elevates NO(2)-CLA levels in plasma, urine, and tissues, which in turn induces heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in the colonic epithelium. These results affirm that metabolic and inflammatory reactions yield electrophilic products that can modulate adaptive cell signaling mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2013779127,"The Wnt signaling pathways control many critical developmental and adult physiological processes. In vertebrates, one fundamentally important function of Wnts is to provide directional information by regulating the evolutionarily conserved planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway during embryonic morphogenesis. However, despite the critical roles of Wnts and PCP in vertebrate development and disease, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt regulation of PCP. Here, we have found that the receptor-like tyrosine kinase (Ryk), a Wnt5a-binding protein required in axon guidance, regulates PCP signaling. We show that Ryk interacts with Vangl2 genetically and biochemically, and such interaction is potentiated by Wnt5a. Loss of Ryk in a Vangl2+/− background results in classic PCP defects, including open neural tube, misalignment of sensory hair cells in the inner ear, and shortened long bones in the limbs. Complete loss of both Ryk and Vangl2 results in more severe phenotypes that resemble the Wnt5a−/− mutant in many aspects such as shortened anterior-posterior body axis, limb, and frontonasal process. Our data identify the Wnt5a-binding protein Ryk as a general regulator of the mammalian Wnt/PCP signaling pathway. We show that Ryk transduces Wnt5a signaling by forming a complex with Vangl2 and that Ryk regulates PCP by at least in part promoting Vangl2 stability. As human mutations in WNT5A and VANGL2 are found to cause Robinow syndrome and neural tube defects, respectively, our results further suggest that human mutations in RYK may also be involved in these diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2079052947,"How does chronic activity modulation lead to global remodeling of proteins at synapses and synaptic scaling? Here we report that guanylate kinase-associated protein (GKAP; also known as SAPAP), a scaffolding molecule linking NMDA receptor-PSD-95 to Shank-Homer complexes, acts in these processes. Overexcitation removes GKAP from synapses via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, whereas inactivity induces synaptic accumulation of GKAP in rat hippocampal neurons. Bidirectional changes in synaptic GKAP amounts are controlled by specific CaMKII isoforms coupled to different Ca(2+) channels. CaMKIIα activated by the NMDA receptor phosphorylates GKAP Ser54 to induce polyubiquitination of GKAP. In contrast, CaMKIIβ activation via L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels promotes GKAP recruitment by phosphorylating GKAP Ser340 and Ser384, which uncouples GKAP from myosin Va motor complex. Overexpressing GKAP turnover mutants not only hampers activity-dependent remodeling of PSD-95 and Shank but also blocks bidirectional synaptic scaling. Therefore, activity-dependent turnover of PSD proteins orchestrated by GKAP is critical for homeostatic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1968393860,"The actin cortex both facilitates and hinders the exocytosis of secretory granules. How cells consolidate these two opposing roles was not well understood. Here we show that antigen activation of mast cells induces oscillations in Ca2+ and PtdIns(4,5)P2 lipid levels that in turn drive cyclic recruitment of N-WASP and cortical actin level oscillations. Experimental and computational analysis argues that vesicle fusion correlates with the observed actin and Ca2+ level oscillations. A vesicle secretion cycle starts with the capture of vesicles by actin when cortical F-actin levels are high, followed by vesicle passage through the cortex when F-actin levels are low, and vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane when Ca2+ levels subsequently increase. Thus, cells employ oscillating levels of Ca2+, PtdIns(4,5)P2 and cortical F-actin to increase secretion efficiency, explaining how the actin cortex can function as a carrier as well as barrier for vesicle secretion. The peripheral actin cortex in cells is essential for secretory vesicle exocytosis, but also acts as a barrier for vesicle release. Wollman and Meyer report that antigen activation triggers cyclical waves of Ca2+ and PtdIns(4,5)P2 that promote N-WASP-mediated oscillations in F-actin polymerization. These permit secretion when F-actin levels are low, but impede exocytosis when F-actin levels are high."
https://openalex.org/W2063033506,"Variation in inflorescence architecture in plants affects reproductive success and agricultural yield. Zachary Lippman and colleagues report that the phenotype of the terminating flower (tmf) tomato mutant, the only known tomato mutant with single-flower inflorescence, is caused by a mutation affecting a nuclear protein that regulates known floral meristem identity complex members AN and FA to repress floral termination. The transition to flowering is a major determinant of plant architecture, and variation in the timing of flowering can have profound effects on inflorescence architecture, flower production and yield. Here, we show that the tomato mutant terminating flower (tmf) flowers early and converts the multiflowered inflorescence into a solitary flower as a result of precocious activation of a conserved floral specification complex encoded by ANANTHA (AN) and FALSIFLORA (FA). Without TMF, the coordinated flowering process is disrupted, causing floral identity genes, such as AN and members of the SEPALLATA (SEP) family, to activate precociously, while the expression of flowering transition genes, such as FRUITFULL (FUL), is delayed. Indeed, driving AN expression precociously is sufficient to cause early flowering, and this expression transforms multiflowered inflorescences into normal solitary flowers resembling those of the Solanaceae species petunia and tobacco. Thus, by timing AN activation, TMF synchronizes flower formation with the gradual reproductive transition, which, in turn, has a key role in determining simple versus complex inflorescences."
https://openalex.org/W2000190195,"An increasing body of evidence indicates that miR-149 can both suppress and promote tumor growth depending on the tumor type. However, the role of miR-149 in the progression of gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. Here we report that miR-149 is a tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer. miR-149 expression is decreased in GC cell lines and clinical specimens in comparison to normal gastric epithelial cell and tissues, respectively. The expression levels of miR-149 also correlate with the differentiation degree of GC cells and tissues. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-149 in gastric cancer cells inhibits proliferation and cell cycle progression by down-regulating ZBTB2, a potent repressor of the ARF-HDM2-p53-p21 pathway, with a potential binding site for miR-149 in its mRNA's 3'UTR. It is also found that ZBTB2 expression increases in GC cells and tissues compared to normal gastric epithelial cell and tissues, respectively. Silencing of ZBTB2 leads to suppression of cell growth and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, indicating that ZBTB2 may act as an oncogene in GC. Furthermore, transfection of miR-149 mimics into gastric cancer cells induces down-regulation of ZBTB2 and HDM2, and up-regulation of ARF, p53, and p21 compared to the controls. In summary, our data suggest that miR-149 functions as a tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer by, at least partially through, targeting ZBTB2."
https://openalex.org/W2011193952,"Appetitive behaviors require complex decision making that involves the integration of environmental stimuli and physiological needs. C. elegans mate searching is a male-specific exploratory behavior regulated by two competing needs: food and reproductive appetite. We found that the pigment dispersing factor receptor (PDFR-1) modulates the circuit that encodes the male reproductive drive that promotes male exploration following mate deprivation. PDFR-1 and its ligand, PDF-1, stimulated mate searching in the male, but not in the hermaphrodite. pdf-1 was required in the gender-shared interneuron AIM, and the receptor acted in internal and external environment-sensing neurons of the shared nervous system (URY, PQR and PHA) to produce mate-searching behavior. Thus, the pdf-1 and pdfr-1 pathway functions in non-sex-specific neurons to produce a male-specific, goal-oriented exploratory behavior. Our results indicate that secretin neuropeptidergic signaling is involved in regulating motivational internal states."
https://openalex.org/W2071256547,"Equilibrium isomerization of retinol is a new activity now attributable to DES1. 11-cis-retinol synthesized by DES1 in Müller cells of the retina can be converted to the visual chromophore for regenerating opsin pigment in cone photoreceptors. Absorption of a light particle by an opsin-pigment causes photoisomerization of its retinaldehyde chromophore. Restoration of light sensitivity to the resulting apo-opsin requires chemical re-isomerization of the photobleached chromophore. This is carried out by a multistep enzyme pathway called the visual cycle. Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of an alternative visual cycle for regenerating opsins in daylight. Here we identified dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (DES1) as a retinol isomerase and an excellent candidate for isomerase-2 in this alternative pathway. DES1 is expressed in retinal Müller cells, where it coimmunoprecipitates with cellular retinaldehyde binding protein (CRALBP). Adenoviral gene therapy with DES1 partially rescued the biochemical and physiological phenotypes in Rpe65−/− mice lacking isomerohydrolase (isomerase-1). Knockdown of DES1 expression by RNA interference concordantly reduced isomerase-2 activity in cultured Müller cells. Purified DES1 had very high isomerase-2 activity in the presence of appropriate cofactors, suggesting that DES1 by itself is sufficient for isomerase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2056053449,"The ability to predict the effect of mutations on protein stability is important for a wide range of tasks, from protein engineering to assessing the impact of SNPs to understanding basic protein biophysics. A number of methods have been developed that make these predictions, but assessing the accuracy of these tools is difficult given the limitations and inconsistencies of the experimental data. We evaluate four different methods based on the ability of these methods to generate consistent results for forward and back mutations, and examine how this ability varies with the nature and location of the mutation. We find that, while one method seems to outperform the others, the ability of these methods to make accurate predictions is limited."
https://openalex.org/W2015667795,"Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have typically focused on performing single-targeted movements. Here the authors report the presence of two subpopulations of neurons in the monkey premotor cortex that allow two planned targets to be simultaneously held in working memory without degradation. They use this finding to develop a BMI that concurrently decodes a full motor sequence in advance of movement and then accurately executes it. Although brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have focused largely on performing single-targeted movements, many natural tasks involve planning a complete sequence of such movements before execution. For these tasks, a BMI that can concurrently decode the full planned sequence before its execution may also consider the higher-level goal of the task to reformulate and perform it more effectively. Using population-wide modeling, we discovered two distinct subpopulations of neurons in the rhesus monkey premotor cortex that allow two planned targets of a sequential movement to be simultaneously held in working memory without degradation. Such marked stability occurred because each subpopulation encoded either only currently held or only newly added target information irrespective of the exact sequence. On the basis of these findings, we developed a BMI that concurrently decodes a full motor sequence in advance of movement and can then accurately execute it as desired."
https://openalex.org/W2005964931,"Intratumoral hypoxia is a major obstacle in the development of effective cancer chemotherapy, decreasing the efficacy of anti-neoplastic drugs in several solid tumours. The hypoxic environment, through its master regulator hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), is able to maintain an anti-apoptotic potential through activation of critical genes associated with drug resistance. Besides affecting metabolism and motility of tumour cells, hypoxia also paradoxically increases production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to stabilize HIF-1 through a redox-mediated inhibition of its proteolysis. Here we reported that 1% O2 hypoxia increases the resistance of human metastatic melanoma cells to conventional chemotherapy with etoposide, and that the increase in chemoresistance strongly depends on ROS delivery due to hypoxia. We reported a biphasic redox-dependent role of HIF-1, involving mitochondrial complex III and NADPH oxidase as oxidants sources, synergising in enhancing survival to chemotherapy. The feed-forward loop engaged by hypoxia involves first an HIF-1-dependent vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) autocrine production and, in the later phase, activation of NADPH oxidase from VEGF/VEGFR2 interaction, finally leading to a further redox-dependent long lasting stabilization of HIF-1. We therefore identified a redox-dependent circuitry linking hypoxia-driven ROS to VEGF-A secretion and to enhanced melanoma cell survival to etoposide chemotherapy."

However, hippocampal inputs were much weaker onto indirect MSNs, where they contacted small spines located in the distal dendrites. This selective targeting means that these inputs must be gated by subthreshold depolarization to trigger action potentials and influence NAc output."

Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), the proteases that degrade the ECM.

Infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II) using micro-osmotic (Alzet) pumps in Timp3−/− male mice, but not in wild type control mice, led to adverse remodeling of the abdominal aorta, reduced collagen and elastin proteins but not mRNA, and elevated proteolytic activities, suggesting excess protein degradation within 2 weeks that led to formation of AAA by 4 weeks. Intriguingly, despite early up-regulation of MMP2 in Timp3−/−Ang II aortas, additional deletion of Mmp2 in these mice (Timp3−/−/Mmp2−/−) resulted in exacerbated AAA, compromised survival due to aortic rupture, and inflammation in the abdominal aorta. Reconstitution of WT bone marrow in Timp3−/−/Mmp2−/− mice reduced inflammation and prevented AAA in these animals following Ang II infusion. Treatment with a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor (PD166793) prevented the Ang II-induced AAA in Timp3−/− and Timp3−/−/Mmp2−/− mice.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade the ECM structural proteins, whereas their inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), keep their activity in check. An imbalance in the interaction between MMPs and TIMPs has been reported in the aorta of patients with abdominal aneurysm (13.Knox J.B. Sukhova G.K. Whittemore A.D. Libby P.

BM was harvested from the femur, tibia, and humerus in EasySep medium (PBS, 2% FCS, 2 mm EDTA) and passed through 70-μm nylon cell strainers (Fisherbrand). Recipient WT and Timp3−/−/Mmp2−/− mice were sublethally irradiated (1,000 grays) and received 10 × 106 BM cells of the opposite genotype via tail vein injection. WT BM was reconstituted in Timp3−/−/Mmp2−/− mice (Timp3−/−/Mmp2−/−-chimera mice), and Timp3−/−/Mmp2−/− BM was reconstituted in WT mice (WT-chimera mice). Mice were provided with antibiotic water (40 mg of neomycin and 15 mg of polymyxin/1 liter) for 4 weeks postinjection, and 7 weeks were allowed for reconstitution before Alzet pumps were implanted for Ang II infusion.

https://openalex.org/W2097067993,"Halophilic archaea accumulate molar concentrations of KCl in their cytoplasm as an osmoprotectant and have evolved highly acidic proteomes that function only at high salinity. We examined osmoprotection in the photosynthetic Proteobacteria Halorhodospira halophila and Halorhodospira halochloris. Genome sequencing and isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis showed that the proteome of H. halophila is acidic. In line with this finding, H. halophila accumulated molar concentrations of KCl when grown in high salt medium as detected by x-ray microanalysis and plasma emission spectrometry. This result extends the taxonomic range of organisms using KCl as a main osmoprotectant to the Proteobacteria. The closely related organism H. halochloris does not exhibit an acidic proteome, matching its inability to accumulate K+. This observation indicates recent evolutionary changes in the osmoprotection strategy of these organisms. Upon growth of H. halophila in low salt medium, its cytoplasmic K+ content matches that of Escherichia coli, revealing an acidic proteome that can function in the absence of high cytoplasmic salt concentrations. These findings necessitate a reassessment of two central aspects of theories for understanding extreme halophiles. First, we conclude that proteome acidity is not driven by stabilizing interactions between K+ ions and acidic side chains but by the need for maintaining sufficient solvation and hydration of the protein surface at high salinity through strongly hydrated carboxylates. Second, we propose that obligate protein halophilicity is a non-adaptive property resulting from genetic drift in which constructive neutral evolution progressively incorporates weakly stabilizing K+-binding sites on an increasingly acidic protein surface.

Approximately 97% of all water on earth is present in saline oceans, saline lakes, inland seas, and saline groundwater (1Jackson R.B. Carpenter S.R. Dahm C.N. McKnight D.M. Naiman R.J. Postel S.L. Running S.W. Water in a changing world.Ecol. Appl. 2001; 11: 1027-1045Crossref Scopus (670) Google Scholar), and roughly one-quarter of the land on earth is underlain by salt deposits (2McGenity T.J. Gemmell R.T. Grant W.D. Stan-Lotter H. Origins of halophilic microorganisms in ancient salt deposits.Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, saline and hypersaline environments are highly abundant and of great ecological significance. In addition, salinity is a major determinant for microbial community composition (3Lozupone C.A. Knight R. Global patterns in bacterial diversity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11436-11440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Therefore, halophilic adaptations are of general biological interest. Most extreme halophiles are members of the Halobacteria (Archaea), and particularly Halobacterium salinarum has been studied extensively (4Kennedy S.P. Ng W.V. Salzberg S.L. Hood L. DasSarma S.

Extreme halophilicity in bacteria is less well studied but has been described for the chemotroph Salinibacter ruber and the photosynthetic purple bacterium Halorhodospira halophila (5Raymond J.C.

A key factor in the halophilic adaptations of H. salinarum and S. ruber is that they accumulate up to 5 m KCl in their cytoplasm (7Oren A. Bioenergetic aspects of halophilism.Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

This osmoprotection strategy results in unidentified protein-solvent interactions that drive a proteome-wide adaptation in which all proteins have an acidic isoelectric point due to an excess of Glu and Asp residues (4Kennedy S.P.

The taxonomic distribution of the reported use of KCl as a major osmoprotectant in extreme halophiles is quite limited: it has been reported only in Halobacteria, in S. ruber (Bacteroidetes), and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in the Halanaerobiales (Firmicutes) (8Oren A.

Intracellular ion and organic solute concentrations of the extremely halophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber.Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Many enzymes from extreme halophiles with acidic proteomes require the presence of at least 1 m salt to be stable and active (12Lanyi J.K.

Stabilizing interactions between K+ ions and the negatively charged protein surface are thought to cause the obligately halophilic nature of these enzymes (12Lanyi J.K.

Rep. 2011; 1: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the functioning of both of these organisms and the proteins that they contain requires the presence of salt. Enzyme halophilicity necessitates the organism to maintain a high cytoplasmic salt concentration and is likely to be a factor in the minimum requirement of ∼15% NaCl for growth of H. salinarum and S. ruber (4Kennedy S.P. Ng W.V. Salzberg S.L. Hood L. DasSarma S.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18147-18152Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Although the adaptive value and molecular basis for obligate protein halophilicity have attracted significant attention (12Lanyi J.K. Salt-dependent properties of proteins from extremely halophilic bacteria.Bacteriol. Rev. 1974; 38: 272-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Madern D. Ebel C. Zaccai G.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4846-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the molecular interactions involved remain elusive. The emerging view is that the use of KCl as an osmoprotectant, proteome acidity, and obligate proteome halophilicity are connected through a causal chain of events. In this interpretation, the use of KCl as an osmoprotectant requires stabilizing interactions between K+ ions and acidic side chains on the protein surface, and protein halophilicity is a consequence of the resulting acidic nature of proteomes in extreme halophiles. Obligate protein halophilicity would thus be an obligatory “price to pay” for retaining protein function in a cytoplasm that contains molar concentrations of KCl. Here, we present experimental results that challenge this view. H. halophila SL1 and H. halochloris were grown in DSMZ 253 medium without yeast extract containing different salt concentrations (3.5–35% NaCl). H. salinarum was grown in DSMZ 227 medium. Escherichia coli B (ATCC 11303) was grown in 5 g/liter nutrient broth. The cultures were grown until late exponential phase and harvested at A660 = 1–1.2. For the determination of growth curves, cell cultures were grown in triplicates in three independent experiments, for a total of nine measurements per data point. H. halophila, H. halochloris, H. salinarum, and E. coli cultures were pelleted, washed with isotonic NaCl or ammonium sulfate solutions, again pelleted, and spread on a carbon planchet. The planchet was immediately plunged into isopentane chilled in liquid nitrogen at −150 °C. The preparation was then transferred to a vacuum pump, and the sublimed water vapor was removed. The freeze-dried cells were exposed to anhydrous paraformaldehyde vapor. The samples were examined in an FEI Quanta 600 field emission gun environmental scanning electron microscope using Evex energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The scanning electron microscope was operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, and the gun current was 50–55 μA. The analysis was confined to a field of overlaying organisms at a magnification of ×5000 and covering an estimated area of 1–2 μm2. Counts were accumulated over 180 s. The measurements were performed in two independent experiments with measurements at five different sample areas, for a total of 10 measurements for each cell sample. For plasma emission spectrometry, 20 ml of cell culture was centrifuged. Cell pellets were suspended in isotonic ammonium sulfate solutions, pelleted, and dried for 48 h at 65 °C. Dried cell pellets were divided in two halves. The first half was used to measure potassium and sodium by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (Spectro Arcos). The second half was used for the colorimetric determination of chloride using a Lachat 8000 QuickChem flow injection analyzer. The measurements were performed in triplicates in two independent experiments, for a total of six measurements per data point. To calculate cytoplasmic K+ and Cl− concentrations for H. halophila, H. halochloris, and H. salinarum, measurements on E. coli samples were performed in parallel and were used as a standard to calibrate the measured amounts of K+ and Cl−. This approach uses the published cytoplasmic K+ and Cl− concentrations of E. coli of 211 and 188 mm, respectively (18Zimmermann U. Pilwat G. Günther T. Regulation of the intracellular potassium concentration in Escherichia coli B525.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 311: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). H. halophila and H. halochloris cells were harvested during exponential growth. Cultures with an A value at 660 nm near 1 were centrifuged, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 6.8), placed on ice, and sonicated (three times for 10 s). The supernatants were dialyzed in Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes. The volume of the samples was adjusted with lysis buffer to equal amounts of cell material based on their original A660. The samples were then TCA-precipitated using ice-cold acetic acid and trichloroacetic acid. The resulting pellet was resuspended in urea buffer, and the supernatant was used for isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis using a Mini-PROTEAN apparatus at 500 V and Bio-Rad IEF precast gels. Two different IEF markers (Bio-Rad IEF standard, broad range of pI 4.45–9.6; and Serva Liquid Mix, pI 3–10) were used at 5–10 μg/lane. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The genome of H. halophila was determined by shotgun sequencing in collaboration with the Joint Genome Institute. The pI values of all proteins encoded in the proteomes of H. halophila, S. ruber, H. salinarum, Haloarcula marismortui, Natronomonas pharaonis, Nitrosococcus oceani, E. coli, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides were calculated as reported previously (19Bjellqvist B. Hughes G.J. Pasquali C. Paquet N. Ravier F. Sanchez J.C. Frutiger S. Hochstrasser D. The focusing positions of polypeptides in immobilized pH gradients can be predicted from their amino acid sequences.Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Putative H. halophila K+ transporters identified in the Integrated Microbial Genomes System (20Markowitz V.M. Korzeniewski F. Palaniappan K. Szeto E. Werner G. Padki A. Zhao X. Dubchak I. Hugenholtz P. Anderson I. Lykidis A. Mavromatis K. Ivanova N. Kyrpides N.C. The integrated microbial genomes (IMG) system.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D344-D348Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) were used as query sequences in BLAST searches of the Transporter Classification Database (21Saier Jr., M.H. Tran C.V. Barabote R.D. TCDB: the Transporter Classification Database for membrane transport protein analyses and information.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D181-D186Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) and GenBankTM. To identify additional K+ transporters that may have been missed in the initial annotation, literature searches were performed to compile a list of possible K+ transporter system and associated genes. The protein sequences of these were obtained from GenBankTM and used as queries in BLAST searches of the H. halophila genome. All BLAST searches were performed using the default expect value (E-value) of 10. All H. halophila hits to each query were screened by manual inspection of bit score, E-value, and alignment length to determine sequence similarity to the query. An E-value below 10−5 and an alignment length of ∼75% or greater were used as threshold criteria to identify H. halophila candidate K+ transporter genes. The domains represented in the protein translations of the candidate gene sequences were examined using the NCBI Conserved Domain Search. Here, we examined the osmoprotection strategy of two closely related organisms, H. halophila and H. halochloris (5Raymond J.C. Sistrom W.R. Ectothiorhodospira halophila–a new species of genus Ectothiorhodospira.Arch. Mikrobiol. 1969; 69: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Imhoff J.F. Trüper H.G. Ectothiorhodospira halochloris sp. nov., a new extremely halophilic phototrophic bacterium containing bacteriochlorophyll b.Arch. Microbiol. 1977; 114: 115-121Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These obligately anaerobic and phototrophic organisms exhibit growth over an unusually wide range of medium NaCl concentrations and are capable of growth down to 3.5% NaCl (the salinity of sea water) (Fig. 1). Whereas H. halochloris exhibits a growth optimum from ∼15 to 25% NaCl, H. halophila grows optimally at all NaCl concentrations above 15%. To explore halophilic adaptations in H. halophila, we determined and analyzed the DNA sequence of its genome. The completed genome sequence of H. halophila SL1 (NCBI reference sequence NC_008789.1) was assembled into a single circular contig based on 36,035 reads, with an average of 12-fold sequence coverage per base and an error rate of <1 in 100,000. The H. halophila genome consists of a single circular chromosome that is 2.7 megabases in length and that encodes 2493 predicted genes. For 1905 of protein-coding genes, putative function could be assigned. Because halophiles that use KCl as a main osmoprotectant often exhibit proteome acidity, we compared the distribution of the predicted isoelectric points for all proteins in H. halophila to the pI distributions of extreme halophiles known to accumulate KCl and those of taxonomically related non-halophiles (Fig. 2a). Non-halophilic bacteria generally exhibit a bimodal pI distribution with peaks near pH 5.6 and 9.3, which is the case for the Proteobacteria E. coli, N. oceani, and R. sphaeroides. The extremely halophilic halobacteria H. marismortui and H. salinarum have the most extreme pI distribution, with the alkaline protein peak nearly absent and the maximum of the acidic peak shifted to pH 4.4. The pI distribution of S. ruber is not quite as acidic, with a somewhat larger fraction of alkaline proteins and a maximum of the acidic peak near pH 4.8. For H. halophila, we observed a strong predominance of acidic proteins, with a maximum of the acidic peak at pH 5.3 (Fig. 2a). This analysis therefore revealed that H. halophila has a highly acidic proteome. The calculated proteome pI distributions do not consider the different expression levels of proteins or possible post-translational modifications. To experimentally verify the pI distributions derived through bioinformatics, we examined total cell extracts from H. halophila by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoreses. The results were compared with total protein extracts from H. salinarum and E. coli. For these three proteomes, a good overall match was found between the genome-derived and experimentally observed pI distributions. Thus, the isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis results confirmed that the proteome of H. halophila is indeed highly acidic, although not quite acidic as that of H. salinarum (Fig. 2b). Because extreme halophiles with acidic proteomes generally utilize KCl as their major osmoprotectant, we predicted the same halophilic strategy in H. halophila. To test the expectation that H. halophila accumulates high concentrations of KCl, we examined its cytoplasmic ionic composition. Cells grown at 35% NaCl were investigated using x-ray microanalysis, together with E. coli and H. salinarum cells for comparison. A prominent K+ peak was observed in both the H. halophila and H. salinarum samples, whereas this peak was very small in the E. coli cell material (Fig. 3a), indicating a high degree of K+ accumulation in H. halophila. Similarly, prominent Cl− signals were detected in the two extremely halophilic microorganisms. To quantify these observations, we performed inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry measurements. These experiments confirmed that the cytoplasmic K+ content of H. halophila is high. Comparison with E. coli cell material indicated a cytoplasmic concentration of 2.1 ± 0.1 m in H. halophila under the growth conditions used (Fig. 3b). For comparison, a typical cytoplasmic K+ concentration in E. coli is 211 mm (18Zimmermann U. Pilwat G. Günther T. Regulation of the intracellular potassium concentration in Escherichia coli B525.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 311: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Cellular Cl− levels were determined colorimetrically, indicating the presence of 3.3 ± 0.4 m in H. halophila. These results show that K+ is a major osmoprotectant in H. halophila, with Cl− being the major counterion, extending the use of KCl as a major osmoprotectant from the select group of the Halobacteria, Bacteroidetes (S. ruber), and Halanaerobiales to the Gammaproteobacteria. The highest reported cytoplasmic salt concentrations in these organisms are 1.9 m for Halanaerobium praevalens (8Oren A. Heldal M. Norland S. X-ray microanalysis of intracellular ions in the anaerobic halophilic eubacterium Haloanaerobium praevalens.Can. J. Microbiol. 1997; 43: 588-592Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and near 5.0 m for H. salinarum and S. ruber (9Oren A. Heldal M. Norland S. Galinski E.A. Intracellular ion and organic solute concentrations of the extremely halophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber.Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Engel M.B. Catchpole H.R. A microprobe analysis of inorganic elements in Halobacterium salinarum.Cell Biol. Int. 2005; 29: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In these measurements, we assumed that the cytoplasmic volumes of E. coli, H. salinarum, H. halophila, and H. halochloris cells/g of dried cell material are comparable. In view of the known technical difficulties associated with the accurate experimental determination of the cytoplasmic volume of bacteria (23Ventosa A. Nieto J.J. Oren A. Biology of moderately halophilic aerobic bacteria.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 504-544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this approach would not be expected to significantly reduce the accuracy of the reported cytoplasmic solute concentrations. This assumption is validated by two experimental observations. First, this approach yields values for the cytoplasmic concentration of these ions in H. salinarum that are consistent with published values. Second, the values derived from this approach for both H. halophila and H. halochloris (see below) match the elemental composition as determined by electron microprobe analysis. In line with its capability to accumulate K+, the H. halophila genome encodes two specific K+ transport systems (Table 1 and supplemental Table 1): a K+/H+ antiporter and a TrkA-N domain potassium channel protein, which functions in K+ uptake. The H. halophila genome also harbors 10 genes encoding cation transporters likely to be involved in K+ or Na+ transport. Comparison with the genomes of the organisms listed in Fig. 2a (supplemental Table 2) revealed that most of the genes related to K+ and Na+ transport in H. halophila are also present in both the non-halophilic taxonomic relatives of H. halophila, in S. ruber, and in the haloarchaea. Further experimental work is needed to identify which of these genes are critical for osmoprotection in H. halophila.TABLE 1Proteins in the genome of H. halophila predicted to be related to potassium and sodium transportGenePredicted functionHhal_1863Kef-type K+/H+ antiporter, CPA2 familyHhal_2287TrkA-N domain potassium channel protein of the Trk K+ uptake systemHhal_0460Na+ or K+ P-type transport ATPase (HAD superfamily, subfamily IC)Hhal_1861Na+ or K+ P-type transport ATPase (HAD superfamily, subfamily IC)Hhal_1704Na+ or K+ transport protein ChaCHhal_2029Multisubunit monovalent cation/H+ antiporter, MnhG/PhaG subunitHhal_2030Multiple resistance and pH regulation protein FHhal_2031Multisubunit Na+/H+ antiporter, MnhE subunitHhal_2032NADH dehydrogenase (quinone)Hhal_2033Monovalent cation/H+ antiporter subunit CHhal_2034Monovalent cation/H+ antiporter subunit BHhal_2035Monovalent cation/H+ antiporter subunit A Open table in a new tab In contrast with the situation in H. halophila, both x-ray microanalysis and plasma emission spectrometry revealed that H. halochloris does not accumulate KCl beyond levels found in E. coli (Fig. 3). This result is matched by the broad distribution of pI values of its proteome as revealed by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, H. halochloris has been reported to use the organic osmolyte glycine betaine as its main osmoprotectant (24Galinski E.A. Trüper H.G. Betaine, a compatible solute in the extremely halophilic phototrophic bacterium Ectothiorhodospira halochloris.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1982; 13: 357-360Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The striking difference in the cytoplasmic KCl content and the matching proteome acidity of H. halophila and H. halochloris indicate a quite recent and strong divergence in osmoprotectant strategy. A similar recent change in osmoprotectant strategy is suggested by the absence of a strongly acidified proteome in Halothermothrix orenii (25Mavromatis K. Ivanova N. Anderson I. Lykidis A. Hooper S.D. Sun H. Kunin V. Lapidus A. Hugenholtz P. Patel B. Kyrpides N.C. Genome analysis of the anaerobic thermohalophilic bacterium Halothermothrix orenii.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4e4192 Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas closely related members of the Halanaerobiales have an acidic proteome and utilize K+ as an osmoprotectant (8Oren A.

Microbiol. 1997; 43: 588-592Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We next examined the dependence of the cellular KCl content of H. halophila on the NaCl concentration of the growth medium. This revealed that the cytoplasmic K+ concentration of H. halophila is strongly regulated by the salinity of the growth medium: an ∼5-fold reduction in cellular K+ content (from 2.1 to 0.4 m) was observed upon a decrease in medium NaCl concentration from 35 to 5% (Fig. 4a). Similarly, the cellular Cl− concentration was reduced by ∼6-fold (from 3.3 to 0.5 m). These observations were confirmed by x-ray microanalysis (Fig. 4b). Thus, upon growth in medium cont"

Protein kinases, key regulators of intracellular signal transduction, have emerged as an important class of drug targets. Chemical proteomic tools that facilitate the functional interrogation of protein kinase active sites are powerful reagents for studying the regulation of this large enzyme family and performing inhibitor selectivity screens. Here we describe a new crosslinking strategy that enables rapid and quantitative profiling of protein kinase active sites in lysates and live cells. Applying this methodology to the SRC-family kinases (SFKs) SRC and HCK led to the identification of a series of conformation-specific, ATP-competitive inhibitors that have a distinct preference for the autoinhibited forms of these kinases. Furthermore, we show that ligands that have this selectivity are able to modulate the ability of the regulatory domains of SRC and HCK to engage in intermolecular binding interactions. These studies provide insight into the regulation of this important family of tyrosine kinases."

Here we identified a novel regulatory role of PINK1 in the maintenance of complex IV activity and characterized a novel mechanism by which NO signaling restored complex IV deficiency in PINK1 null dopaminergic neuronal cells. In PINK1 null cells, levels of specific chaperones, including Hsp60, leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing (LRPPRC), and Hsp90, were severely decreased. LRPPRC and Hsp90 were found to act upstream of Hsp60 to regulate complex IV activity. Specifically, knockdown of Hsp60 resulted in a decrease in complex IV activity, whereas antagonistic inhibition of Hsp90 by 17-(allylamino) geldanamycin decreased both Hsp60 and complex IV activity. In contrast, overexpression of the PINK1-interacting factor LRPPRC augmented complex IV activity by up-regulating Hsp60. A similar recovery of complex IV activity was also induced by coexpression of Hsp90 and Hsp60. Drug screening identified ginsenoside Re as a compound capable of reversing the deficit in complex IV activity in PINK1 null cells through specific increases of LRPPRC, Hsp90, and Hsp60 levels. The pharmacological effects of ginsenoside Re could be reversed by treatment of the pan-NOS inhibitor l-NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester (l-NAME) and could also be reproduced by low-level NO treatment. These results suggest that PINK1 regulates complex IV activity via interactions with upstream regulators of Hsp60, such as LRPPRC and Hsp90. Furthermore, they demonstrate that treatment with ginsenoside Re enhances functioning of the defective PINK1-Hsp90/LRPPRC-Hsp60-complex IV signaling axis in PINK1 null neurons by restoring NO levels, providing potential for new therapeutics targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.

Functional analyses have revealed that PINK1 plays regulatory roles in various mitochondrial functions, including mitophagy and fusion-fission dynamics (4.Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J.

We previously reported a dramatic decrease in the activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex IV in PINK1 null dopaminergic neuronal cells in contrast to the normal levels of activity found in DJ-1 null dopaminergic neuronal cells (6.Shim J.H.

Other studies have also suggested that complex IV activity is affected by PINK1 gene knockdown or PINK1 null mutations (7.Gegg M.E. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H. Taanman J.W.

Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase (COX), EC1.9.3.1) is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Complex IV is comprised of 13 subunits of dual genetic origin in mammals. The COX1, COX2, and COX3 subunits, encoded by the mitochondrial DNA, form the catalytic core of the enzyme, whereas the remaining 10 subunits are encoded by the nuclear DNA (9.Barrientos A. Gouget K.

Acta. 2010; 1802: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In yeast, complex IV biosynthesis requires the specific, sequential action of ∼20 nuclear-encoded assembly or accessory factors (11.Stiburek L. Zeman J. Assembly factors and ATP-dependent proteases in cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). More than half of these assembly factors are known to have human orthologs (9.Barrientos A. Gouget K. Horn D. Soto I.C. Fontanesi F. Suppression mechanisms of COX assembly defects in yeast and human. Insights into the COX assembly process.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mutations in several of these factors are associated with autosomal recessive complex IV deficiency syndrome. For instance, complex IV-defective French-Canadian Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in the leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing (LRPPRC), a complex IV assembly factor that regulates stabilization of the mitochondrial mRNAs MTCO1 and MTCO3 (12.Mootha V.K.

However, little is known about regulation of the expression of these assembly factors and consequent effects on complex IV activity. NO can mediate both physiological and pathological effects, depending on the physiological concentrations. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and endothelial NOS generate low amounts (0.2–2.0 nm) of NO persisting only for a few minutes, whereas inducible NOS produces high amounts (20–200 nm) of NO that can persist up to days (18.Brown G.C.

In neurodegenerative diseases, high concentrations of NO trigger apoptosis through the induction of O2− formation and subsequent generation of ONOO−, which inhibits and/or damages the mitochondrial ETC complexes, particularly complexes I and II, which possess iron-sulfur centers (21.Drapier J.C.

Notably, NO reversibly inhibits complex IV activity by competing with O2 (24.Brown G.C. Bolaños J.P. Heales S.J. Clark J.B.

In contrast, long-term treatment of cell cultures with low concentrations of NO is known to induce mitochondrial biogenesis, which is mediated by a cGMP-dependent signaling pathway (26.Nisoli E.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 16507-16512Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). However, the pharmacological effects of low physiological concentrations of NO on dysfunctional mitochondria and the relevance of this signaling to dopaminergic neuronal survival remain to be elucidated in familial PD. Development of disease-modifying drugs capable of restoring mitochondrial function remains a formidable challenge in PD and other mitochondria-associated diseases. Compounds with neuroprotective potential, including a few ordinary mitochondrial modulators such as coenzyme Q10 and creatine, are under investigation in clinical trials of PD to determine whether they can prevent continuous loss of dopaminergic neurons (28.Meissner W.G. Frasier M. Gasser T. Goetz C.G. Lozano A. Piccini P. Obeso J.A. Rascol O. Schapira A. Voon V. Weiner D.M. Tison F. Bezard E. Priorities in Parkinson's disease research.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011; 10: 377-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Other compounds with potential for modulating mitochondria include natural products, such as the ginsenosides, that comprise the primary biologically active components of ginseng. These compounds have been shown to exert complex physiological functions, including preservation of mitochondrial integrity (29.Leung K.W. Yung K.K. Mak N.K. Chan Y.S. Fan T.P. Wong R.N.

Ginsenoside Rd attenuates mitochondrial dysfunction and sequential apoptosis after transient focal ischemia.Neuroscience. 2011; 178: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the precise effects of ginsenosides on defective mitochondria under conditions of PD are not well understood. This work is the first to identify the molecular basis underlying PINK1 null mutation-induced complex IV deficit. We found that significant loss of complex IV activity in PINK1 null dopaminergic neurons results from down-regulation of the Hsp60 and its upstream regulators, LRPPRC and Hsp90. PINK1 appears to regulate complex IV activity via specific interactions with LRPPRC and Hsp90. Importantly, complex IV deficiency in PINK1 null neuronal cells could be overcome by optimal treatment with ginsenoside Re. Treatment with ginsenoside Re specifically increased the expression levels of LRPPRC, Hsp90, and Hsp60 through activation of NO signaling in PINK1 null cells but not in the wild type cells. PINK1 null dopaminergic cell lines were established by breeding the previously described immortalizer transgenic mouse (33.Son J.H. Chun H.S. Joh T.H. Cho S. Conti B. Lee J.W. Neuroprotection and neuronal differentiation studies using substantia nigra dopaminergic cells derived from transgenic mouse embryos.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the PINK1 null mouse as reported previously (6.Shim J.H. Yoon S.H. Kim K.H. Han J.Y. Ha J.Y. Hyun D.H. Paek S.H. Kang U.J. Zhuang X. Son J.H.

Briefly, at embryonic day 13.5, immortalized PINK1-null dopaminergic neuronal cells were established from the substantia nigra region of the double transgenic mouse embryos harboring both a TH9.0kb-SV40Tag-tsA58 transgene and the PINK1 null mutation. Dopaminergic neuronal cells were cultured in RF medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glucose, Penicillin-streptomycin and l-glutamine) at 33 °C with 5% CO2, as described previously (33.Son J.H. Chun H.S. Joh T.H. Cho S. Conti B. Lee J.W. Neuroprotection and neuronal differentiation studies using substantia nigra dopaminergic cells derived from transgenic mouse embryos.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PINK1 null dopaminergic neuronal cells were further characterized at the permissive temperature (33 °C) for the expression of general neuronal markers TuJ1 and NeuN and a dopaminergic neuron-specific marker, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), by immunoblot and RT-PCR analysis. To generate stable Hsp60 KD cells, wild-type SN4741 dopaminergic neuronal cells were transfected with a pSUPER.retro.puro vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) containing Hsp60 shRNA (5′-CCG AAG ACG TTG ACG GAG A-3′) and pSUPER.retro.puro vector alone (for control cells). Stably transfected cell lines were selected by supplementing the culture medium with puromycin (1 μg/ml). The pCMVTnT-PINK1-myc, pCDNA3-PINK1-FLAG, and pCDNA3.1-Hsp60-MycHis plasmids were provided by Dr. M. R. Cookson, Dr. Takahashi, and Dr. T. J. Corydon, respectively. Hsp90 and LRPPRC in pCDNA3 vector were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. To construct pFLAG-LRPPRC, the mouse LRPPRC cDNA was digested with EcoRI (5′) and KpnI (3′) and inserted into the pFLAG-CMV plasmid. For gene knockdown, the siRNA duplex was delivered using the TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI), as described previously (6.Shim J.H. Yoon S.H. Kim K.H. Han J.Y. Ha J.Y. Hyun D.H. Paek S.H. Kang U.J. Zhuang X. Son J.H.

(Daejeon, Korea) and had the following sequences: siHsp60 sense, 5-r(CACUGUUCUGGCACGAUCU)d(TT)-3 and siHsp60 antisense, 5-r(AGAUCGUGCCAGAACAGUG)d(TT)-3. Transient transfection analyses were carried out as described previously (6.Shim J.H. Yoon S.H. Kim K.H. Han J.Y. Ha J.Y. Hyun D.H. Paek S.H. Kang U.J. Zhuang X. Son J.H. The antioxidant Trolox helps recovery from the familial Parkinson's disease-specific mitochondrial deficits caused by PINK1- and DJ-1-deficiency in dopaminergic neuronal cells.Mitochondrion. 2011; 11: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Dopaminergic cells were used for total RNA isolation. cDNA was synthesized using 5 μg total RNA and RT-PCR kit (MP Biomedicals Inc.). Endogenous PINK1 mRNA levels were measured relative to β-actin by the standard curve method. Quantitative PCR was performed by AB7300 real-time PCR systems and DyNAmo HS SYBR Green quantitative PCR kit (Applied Biosystems and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The β-actin primer set (forward, 5′-TTC TTT GCA GCT CCT TCG TTG CCG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGG ATG GCT ACG TAC ATG GCT GGG-3′) and the PINK1 primer set (forward, 5′-TGA TCT CAG ACT TTG GCT GCT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCT TGG CCA TAG AAG GGA TT-3′) were used. 17-AAG was purchased from Selleck Chemicals LLC (Houston, TX). Puromycin was purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). Ginsenoside Re was purified as described below. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Eight ginsenosides, including Re, were separated and purified from P. ginseng by high-speed counter-current chromatography coupled with an evaporative light-scattering detector (HSCCC-ELSD), as reported previously (34.Shehzad O. Ha I.J. Park Y. Ha Y.W. Kim Y.S. Development of a rapid and convenient method to separate eight ginsenosides from Panax ginseng by high-speed counter-current chromatography coupled with evaporative light scattering detection.J. Sep. Sci. 2011; 34: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude samples for HSCCC-ELSD separation were first purified from ginseng extract using a macroporous resin. Specifically, the extract was loaded onto a Diaion-HP20 column and fractionated using a methanol and water gradient elution. The ginsenosides-protopanaxadiol and protopanaxatriol fractions were subsequently eluted with 65 and 80% methanol and water gradient elution, respectively. These two fractions were then subjected to HSCCC-ELSD. The two-phase solvent system used for separation was composed of chloroform/methanol/water/isopropanol at a volume ratio of 4:3:2:1. Each fraction was collected and dried. Eight ginsenosides, including ginsenoside Re, were resolved, and the purity of each ginsenoside was greater than 98% as assessed by HPLC-ELSD. Transfected cells were incubated in lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing protease inhibitors for 1 h on ice. Protein extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) or protein G plus agarose overnight at 4 °C. The precipitated beads were washed three times with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 14.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Eluted proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by LC/MS at the MS Core Facility (Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea) and immunoblot analysis. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) containing 1 mm PMSF. Protein lysates were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking in 5% milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-prohibitin, anti-GAPDH, anti-LRPPRC, anti-Hsp90, anti-Hsp60, anti-GRP78, and anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA), anti-COX I (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-COX IV and anti-GRP75 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-Myc (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., CA), anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-NDUFB6 (Invitrogen). After washing, the blots were probed with anti-goat, anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibodies and visualized by ECL (GE Healthcare), as described previously (6.Shim J.H. Yoon S.H. Kim K.H. Han J.Y. Ha J.Y. Hyun D.H. Paek S.H. Kang U.J. Zhuang X. Son J.H.

Densitometric quantification of bands was performed using an image analyzer system and Multi Gauge version 2.3. Cell cultures were prepared for immunocytochemistry by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and three washes with PBS. Mitochondria were stained using MitoTracker (Invitrogen), and morphological changes were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Mitochondria were prepared as described previously (6.Shim J.H. Yoon S.H. Kim K.H. Han J.Y. Ha J.Y. Hyun D.H. Paek S.H. Kang U.J. Zhuang X. Son J.H.

Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and suspended in 10 mm ice-cold Tris buffer (pH 7.6) containing protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were mechanically disrupted using a 1-ml syringe, and, following the addition of ice-cold 1.5 m sucrose, centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 2 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 2 °C, and the resulting pellet was washed and resuspended in 10 mm ice-cold Tris (pH 7.6) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Some pellets were lysed for quantification, and the remainder was stored on ice until analysis. Complex IV and citrate synthase were analyzed as described previously (7.Gegg M.E. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H. Taanman J.W. Silencing of PINK1 expression affects mitochondrial DNA and oxidative phosphorylation in dopaminergic cells.PloS ONE. 2009; 4: e4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, complex IV activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 550 nm in a 240-μl reaction containing 30 mm potassium phosphate, 2.5 mm dodecylmaltoside, and 34 μm ferrocytochrome c (pH 7.4). Mitochondrial samples (1 μg/10 μl) were added to the buffer, and the absorbance was immediately measured at 30-s intervals for 5 min at 30 °C. Negative controls contained 1 mm potassium cyanide. Citrate synthase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm in a 240-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.1 mm acetyl-CoA, and 0.5 mm oxaloacetate. Mitochondrial samples (1 μg/10 μl) were preincubated in buffer without oxaloacetate for 5 min at 30 °C. Then, 2.5 μl of 50 mm oxaloacetate was added to start the reaction. The absorbance was measured at 30-s intervals for 5 min at 37 °C. For controls, an equivalent volume of water was added in place of oxaloacetate. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. on the basis of data derived from three to eight independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using Sigmaplot, and significant differences were assessed using Student's t test. When necessary, multiple comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance. To investigate the molecular basis of loss of mitochondrial complex IV activity, we utilized wild-type SN4741 and PINK1 null dopaminergic neuronal cells that were generated in identical fashion, as established and characterized previously (6.Shim J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2070479425,"The EphB family of receptor tyrosine kinases can signal bidirectionally and functions in a kinase-dependent and kinase-independent manner. To determine the importance of the kinase activity of EphBs for axonal guidance and synaptogenesis, the authors used a chemical genetic method and generated knock-in mice that allow the kinase activity of EphBs to be inhibited without altering kinase-independent functions of EphBs. They find that specific inhibition of EphB kinase activity had no effect on synaptogenesis, but impaired axonal guidance, thereby implicating the kinase function of EphB in one neuronal process, but not other processes that are nevertheless dependent on EphBs. EphB receptor tyrosine kinases control multiple steps in nervous system development. However, it remains unclear whether EphBs regulate these different developmental processes directly or indirectly. In addition, given that EphBs signal through multiple mechanisms, it has been challenging to define which signaling functions of EphBs regulate particular developmental events. To address these issues, we engineered triple knock-in mice in which the kinase activity of three neuronally expressed EphBs can be rapidly, reversibly and specifically blocked. We found that the tyrosine kinase activity of EphBs was required for axon guidance in vivo. In contrast, EphB-mediated synaptogenesis occurred normally when the kinase activity of EphBs was inhibited, suggesting that EphBs mediate synapse development by an EphB tyrosine kinase–independent mechanism. Taken together, our data indicate that EphBs control axon guidance and synaptogenesis by distinct mechanisms and provide a new mouse model for dissecting EphB function in development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2093262265,"Individual-based epidemiology models are increasingly used in the study of influenza epidemics. Several studies on influenza dynamics and evaluation of intervention measures have used the same incubation and infectious period distribution parameters based on the natural history of influenza. A sensitivity analysis evaluating the influence of slight changes to these parameters (in addition to the transmissibility) would be useful for future studies and real-time modeling during an influenza pandemic.In this study, we examined individual and joint effects of parameters and ranked parameters based on their influence on the dynamics of simulated epidemics. We also compared the sensitivity of the model across synthetic social networks for Montgomery County in Virginia and New York City (and surrounding metropolitan regions) with demographic and rural-urban differences. In addition, we studied the effects of changing the mean infectious period on age-specific epidemics. The research was performed from a public health standpoint using three relevant measures: time to peak, peak infected proportion and total attack rate. We also used statistical methods in the design and analysis of the experiments. The results showed that: (i) minute changes in the transmissibility and mean infectious period significantly influenced the attack rate; (ii) the mean of the incubation period distribution appeared to be sufficient for determining its effects on the dynamics of epidemics; (iii) the infectious period distribution had the strongest influence on the structure of the epidemic curves; (iv) the sensitivity of the individual-based model was consistent across social networks investigated in this study and (v) age-specific epidemics were sensitive to changes in the mean infectious period irrespective of the susceptibility of the other age groups. These findings suggest that small changes in some of the disease model parameters can significantly influence the uncertainty observed in real-time forecasting and predicting of the characteristics of an epidemic."

We report here that neuritogenesis-promoting ligand-dependent cell surface clustering of CHL1 induces palmitoylation and lipid raft-dependent endocytosis of CHL1. We identify βII spectrin as a binding partner of CHL1, and we show that partial disruption of the complex between CHL1 and βII spectrin accompanies CHL1 endocytosis. Inhibition of the association of CHL1 with lipid rafts by pharmacological disruption of lipid rafts or by mutation of cysteine 1102 within the intracellular domain of CHL1 reduces endocytosis of CHL1. Endocytosis of CHL1 is also reduced by nifedipine, an inhibitor of the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.

All experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales. To clone CHL1, double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperScriptTM II RT (Invitrogen) from total RNA isolated from mouse brain by the High Pure RNA tissue kit (Roche Diagnostics). Mouse CHL1 was amplified from cDNA and cloned into pcDNATM3.1/V5-His vector using corresponding TOPO expression kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA containing full-length CHL1 in pcDNA3.1 was taken as template for subcloning and site-directed mutagenesis. pEF/FRT/V5-D-TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen) was used to generate the expression construct encoding full-length CHL1, which was used for transfection. Single amino acid change was made using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following primers were used to generate the C1102S mutation within the CHL1 intracellular domain: forward primer, 5′-ACACTGATATTGTTAACTATTTCCTTTGTGAAGAGGAACAGAGGT-3′, and reverse primer 5′-ACCTCTGTTCCTCTTCACAAAGGAAATAGTTAACAATATCAGTGT-3′. Control nonsilencing and βII spectrin siRNA were from Qiagen. Transfection with βII spectrin siRNA (target sequence AAGGTGCTTGATAATGCTATA) reduced by ∼50% the expression of βII spectrin at 24 h after transfection as verified by Western blot analysis (data not shown) and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 9B), allowing it to be used as functional βII spectrin siRNA. The βII spectrin siRNA (target sequence AACCATCATCATCCTAAACAA) did not affect βII spectrin expression as verified by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry and was used as nonfunctional siRNA control. Flp-In-NIH 3T3 cells (Invitrogen) were grown in DMEM/F-12 with 10% donor calf serum and 2% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 90% relative humidity. Cells were passaged as they reached confluence. To generate stably transfected cell lines, cells were co-transfected with CHL1 pEF5/FRT/V5-D-TOPO and pOG44 plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pOG44 plasmid expresses Flp recombinase, which helps the CHL1 cDNA to integrate into the genome of the 3T3 cells at the FRT site. Cells were selected in culture medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) for 3–4 weeks. Single clones were isolated and verified by Western blot analysis. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, samples containing 1 mg of total protein were lysed for 20 min at 25 °C with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na2P2O7, 1 mm NaF) containing an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). When indicated, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2, or 2 mm CaCl2 was added to the lysis buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were precleared for 3 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads per 1.5 ml of lysate under constant rotation. Beads were pelleted down by spinning at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was carefully pipetted out into another tube. The supernatants were incubated with polyclonal CHL1 antibodies or nonspecific rabbit immunoglobulins overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation, followed by incubation with protein A-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer and boiled at 100 °C for 10 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blot. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against βII spectrin were used to immobilize βII spectrin. The antibodies (1 μg/ml in PBS) were adsorbed overnight to the plastic surface of 96-well MICROLON 600 plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) at 4 °C. All steps were then performed at room temperature. Wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h and incubated with purified mouse brain spectrin (6 μm) (17.Bennett V. Baines A.J. Davis J. Purification of brain analogs of red blood cell membrane skeletal proteins: ankyrin, protein 4.1 (synapsin), spectrin, and spectrin subunits.Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) for 1 h. Wells were washed and incubated for 1 h with increasing concentrations of CHL1-ID and L1-ID (15.Andreyeva A. Leshchyns'ka I. Knepper M. Betzel C. Redecke L. Sytnyk V. Schachner M. CHL1 is a selective organizer of the presynaptic machinery chaperoning the SNARE complex.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) diluted in PBS with 1% BSA. Plates were washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and incubated for 1 h with the monoclonal antibody 2C2 reacting with the cytoplasmic domains of L1 and CHL1 (15.Andreyeva A. Leshchyns'ka I. Knepper M. Betzel C. Redecke L. Sytnyk V. Schachner M. CHL1 is a selective organizer of the presynaptic machinery chaperoning the SNARE complex.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) diluted 1:5,000 in PBST containing 1% BSA. After washing with PBST, wells were incubated for 1 h with HRP-coupled secondary antibodies in PBST containing 1% BSA, washed five times with PBST, and developed with 1 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (PerbioScience, Bonn, Germany). The absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Brain homogenates were prepared using a Dounce homogenizer in a homogenization buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)) and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei. The supernatants were centrifuged at 17,500 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were used as fractions enriched in soluble proteins, whereas pellets were used as total membrane fractions. Lipid rafts were isolated from the total membrane fraction as described (18.Leshchyns'ka I. Sytnyk V. Morrow J.S. Schachner M. Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) association with PKCβ2 via βI spectrin is implicated in NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Membrane fraction (500 μl) was mixed with 4× volumes of ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 in TBS and incubated for 20 min on ice. Extracted membranes were mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in 0.2 m Na2CO3 to a final sucrose concentration of 40%. To create a discontinuous gradient, this 40% sucrose solution was overlaid with 2 ml of 30% sucrose in TBS and 1 ml of 10% sucrose in TBS. Tubes were filled to capacity with TBS and centrifuged at 230,000 × g for 17 h. Lipid rafts were collected at the top of the gradient at 10% sucrose, resuspended in TBS, and pelleted down by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellets were resuspended in TBS containing protease inhibitor mixture. To estimate the fraction of CHL1, ankyrin-B, and βII spectrin in lipid rafts, enrichment of these proteins in lipid rafts versus brain homogenate was compared with the enrichment of contactin-1, which localizes exclusively to lipid rafts as shown in Equation 1, LR Fraction (protein of interest)=ILR(protein of interest)/IBH(protein of interest)×IBH(contactin−1)/ILR(contactin−1)×100%(Eq. 1) where ILR and IBH are levels in lipid rafts and brain homogenates as estimated by Western blot analysis. Similar estimations were obtained using Fyn as a lipid raft reference protein (data not shown). Isolation of 0.1% Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble proteins was performed as described (19.Molitoris B.A. Dahl R. Hosford M. Cellular ATP depletion induces disruption of the spectrin cytoskeletal network.Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F790-F798PubMed Google Scholar). Brain homogenates were extracted for 5 min at 4 °C with PHEM buffer (60 mm Pipes, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 48,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants containing nonpolymerized proteins and pellets containing polymerized spectrin meshwork were analyzed by Western blot. CHL1 constructs were transiently transfected into 3T3 cells grown in 6-well dishes using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty four hours after transfection, polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of CHL1 (1:200) were applied to cells for 10 min at 37 °C. To block VDCC, 10 μm nifedipine and 5 μm pimozide were applied for 10 min at 37 °C before antibody application. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Surface proteins were then biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml of EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) applied for 30 min at 4 °C (20.Devanathan V. Jakovcevski I. Santuccione A. Li S. Lee H.J. Peles E.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 9292-9305Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by adding 50 mm glycine for 10 min at 4 °C. After washing twice with ice-cold PBS, the cells were scraped into 166 μl per well of warm precipitation buffer (PBS, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA) with the complete protease inhibitor mixture and phosphostop (Roche Diagnostics). This solution was then diluted with 833 μl per well of cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. To precipitate biotinylated proteins, supernatants containing equal amounts of the total protein were mixed with 100 μl of neutravidin-agarose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. After washing three times with PBST, the precipitates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Hippocampal and cortical neurons were prepared from 1- to 3- day-old C57BL/6J mice and maintained for 24 h in Neurobasal A medium supplemented with 2% B-27 and GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) and FGF-2 (2 ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml) (21.Chernyshova Y.

Briefly, for nontransfected neurons, polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of CHL1 or nonspecific immunoglobulins were applied to the culture medium immediately after plating together with or without the lipid biosynthesis inhibitors mevinolin (4 μm), NB-DNJ (100 μm), or fumonisin B (50 μm) (24.Nakai Y. Kamiguchi H. Migration of nerve growth cones requires detergent-resistant membranes in a spatially defined and substrate-dependent manner.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). When indicated, neurons were co-transfected with cherry (a kind gift of Dr. Tsien) and CHL1 cDNA constructs 6 h after plating using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) combined with CombiMag (OzBiosciences, Marseille, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transfected neurons, CHL1 antibodies and nonspecific immunoglobulins were applied 6 h after transfection. Neurons were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS at 24 h after CHL1 antibody and nonspecific immunoglobulin application. The cells were imaged using an Axiophot 2 microscope equipped with a Plan-NeoFluar ×40 objective (numerical aperture 0.75), AxioCam HRc digital camera, and AxioVision software version 3.1 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Lengths of neurites were measured using ImageJ software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda). For each experimental value, at least 100 neurons with neurites longer than the cell body diameter were measured. Results were statistically evaluated using ANOVA. Indirect immunofluorescence labeling was performed as described previously (25.Sytnyk V. Leshchyns'ka I. Delling M. Dityateva G. Dityatev A. Schachner M. Neural cell adhesion molecule promotes accumulation of TGN organelles at sites of neuron-to-neuron contacts.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). When indicated, live neurons were preincubated with goat polyclonal antibodies against CHL1 for 15 min in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C to induce clustering of CHL1. Control neurons were treated with nonimmune immunoglobulins. Neurons were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 20 min. Antibodies against CHL1 and βII spectrin were applied in 0.1% BSA in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were detected with fluorochrome-coupled secondary antibodies applied for 60 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescence images were acquired at room temperature using a confocal laser scanning microscope LSM510, LSM510 software (version 3), and an oil Plan-NeoFluar ×63 objective (numerical aperture 1.3; all from Carl Zeiss) at ×3 digital zoom. Immunofluorescence intensity profiles were plotted in ImageJ. Neurons were incubated with goat polyclonal antibodies against CHL1 or nonimmune immunoglobulins for 15 min in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C either in the presence or absence of nifedipine (10 μm), then incubated for 1 min in cold microtubule stabilizing buffer (MSB: 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 60 mm PIPES, pH 7.0), and extracted for 8 min on ice with 1% Triton X-100 in MSB as described (18.Leshchyns'ka I.

Mean intensities of CHL1 and βII spectrin immunofluorescence were measured in ImageJ by automatically outlining GM1 clusters using a threshold function of ImageJ and measuring immunofluorescence intensities within the respective outlines. Cultured neurons were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 20 min. Antibodies against βII spectrin and the intracellular domain of CHL1 were applied to the cells in 0.1% BSA in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Further steps were performed using secondary antibodies conjugated with oligonucleotides (PLA probes, Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) and Duolink II fluorescence kit (Olink Bioscience) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence images were acquired at room temperature using a confocal laser scanning microscope Nikon C1si, NIS Elements software and oil Plan Apo VC ×60 objective (numerical aperture 1.4) all from Nikon Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). One-day-old cultured cortical neurons maintained in wells of a 6-well culture plate were incubated with Click-iT® myristic acid or Click-iT® palmitic acid azide (Invitrogen) applied in the culture medium for 4.5 h. Neurons were then incubated for 15 min either with control nonimmune rabbit immunoglobulins or antibodies against the extracellular domain of CHL1 applied in the culture medium, washed two times with ice-cold PBS, lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and stored at −80"
https://openalex.org/W2042746439,"K(V)10.1 is a voltage-gated potassium channel aberrantly expressed in many cases of cancer, and participates in cancer initiation and tumor progression. Its action as an oncoprotein can be inhibited by a functional monoclonal antibody, indicating a role for channels located at the plasma membrane, accessible to the antibody. Cortactin is an actin-interacting protein implicated in cytoskeletal architecture and often amplified in several types of cancer. In this study, we describe a physical and functional interaction between cortactin and K(V)10.1. Binding of these two proteins occurs between the C terminus of K(V)10.1 and the proline-rich domain of cortactin, regions targeted by many post-translational modifications. This interaction is specific for K(V)10.1 and does not occur with K(V)10.2. Cortactin controls the abundance of K(V)10.1 at the plasma membrane and is required for functional expression of K(V)10.1 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2059101690,"The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is regulated by a variety of external factors that alter channel activity by inducing conformational changes within its large extracellular region that are transmitted to the gate. The wrist domain consists of small linkers connecting the extracellular region to the transmembrane domains, where the channel pore and gate reside. We employed site-directed mutagenesis combined with two-electrode voltage clamp to investigate the role of the wrist domain in channel gating in response to extracellular factors. Channel inhibition by external Na+ was reduced by selected mutations within the wrist domain of the α subunit, likely reflecting an increase in channel open probability. The most robust changes were observed when Cys was introduced at αPro-138 and αSer-568, sites immediately adjacent to the palm domain. In addition, one of these Cys mutants exhibited an enhanced response to shear stress. In the context of channels that have a low open probability due to retention of an inhibitory tract, the response to external Na+ was reduced by Cys substitutions at both αPro-138 and αSer-568. We observed a significant correlation between changes in channel inhibition by external Na+ and the relative response to shear stress for the α subunit mutants that were examined. Mutants that exhibited reduced inhibition by external Na+ also showed an enhanced response to shear stress. Together, our data suggest that the wrist domain has a role in modulating the channel's response to external stimuli.

https://openalex.org/W1982299287,"Mammalian non-selective transient receptor potential cation channels (TRPCs) are important in the regulation of cellular calcium homeostasis. In thyroid cells, including rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells, calcium regulates a multitude of processes. RT-PCR screening of FRTL-5 cells revealed the presence of TRPC2 channels only. Knockdown of TRPC2 using shRNA (shTRPC2) resulted in decreased ATP-evoked calcium peak amplitude and inward current. In calcium-free buffer, there was no difference in the ATP-evoked calcium peak amplitude between control cells and shTRPC2 cells. Store-operated calcium entry was indistinguishable between the two cell lines. Basal calcium entry was enhanced in shTRPC2 cells, whereas the level of PKCβ1 and PKCδ, the activity of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and the calcium content in the endoplasmic reticulum were decreased. Stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 2, but not STIM1, was arranged in puncta in resting shTRPC2 cells but not in control cells. Phosphorylation site Orai1 S27A/S30A mutant and non-functional Orai1 R91W attenuated basal calcium entry in shTRPC2 cells. Knockdown of PKCδ with siRNA increased STIM2 punctum formation and enhanced basal calcium entry but decreased sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity in wild-type cells. Transfection of a truncated, non-conducting mutant of TRPC2 evoked similar results. Thus, TRPC2 functions as a major regulator of calcium homeostasis in rat thyroid cells."

In order to understand its role in retinal transport in rod out segment discs, we have investigated the interactions of the soluble domains of ABCA4 with both 11-cis- and all-trans-retinal. Using fluorescence anisotropy-based binding analysis and recombinant polypeptides derived from the amino acid sequences of the four soluble domains of ABCA4, we demonstrated that the nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) specifically bound 11-cis-retinal. Its affinity for all-trans-retinal was markedly reduced. Stargardt disease-associated mutations in this domain resulted in attenuation of 11-cis-retinal binding. Significant differences in 11-cis-retinal binding affinities were observed between NBD1 and other cytoplasmic and lumenal domains of ABCA4. The results suggest a possible role of ABCA4 and, in particular, the NBD1 domain in 11-cis-retinal binding. These results also correlate well with a recent report on the in vivo role of ABCA4 in 11-cis-retinal transport.

Stargardt disease and its adult onset variant, fundus flavimaculatus, are autosomal recessive disorders affecting ∼1 in 10,000 in the population. These diseases are characterized by a progressive loss of central vision and atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, ultimately leading to blindness. Disease-associated ABCA4 alleles show an extraordinary genetic heterogeneity, now numbering over 700 variants, and are found throughout the entire open reading frame of ABCA4 (20.Zernant J. Schubert C. Im K.M. Burke T. Brown C.M. Fishman G.A. Tsang S.H. Gouras P. Dean M. Allikmets R. Analysis of the ABCA4 gene by next-generation sequencing.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2011; 52: 8479-8487Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Currently, there are no therapeutics (small molecules or biologics) that target the ABCA4 transporter, although gene therapy holds great promise for afflicted individuals (21.Bennett J. Chung D.C. Maguire A. Gene delivery to the retina. From mouse to man.Methods Enzymol. 2012; 507: 255-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Immunohistological studies demonstrate that the ABCA4 protein is localized primarily to the rod and cone outer segment discs (22.Azarian S.M. Travis G.H.

ATP binding cassette rod outer segment extracellular domain nucleotide binding domain amino acid(s) 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate anisotropy. The historically accepted model of ABCA4 function has been simply its role in exporting all-trans-retinal from the ROS to the cytoplasm. In the context of the visual transduction, this is important because in order to maintain the retinoid cycle, all-trans-retinal released from light-activated rhodopsin must be recycled from the ROS disc back to the retinal pigment epithelium, where it is enzymatically converted to the 11-cis isomer, to again serve as the chromophore of rhodopsin. Defective ABCA4 function is believed to contribute to the accumulation of cytotoxic lipofuscin that underlies the pathology of the macular diseases leading to photoreceptor cell death. Excess all-trans-retinal can lead to the formation of all-trans-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine, a component of lipofuscin (24.Kiser P.D. Golczak M. Maeda A. Palczewski K. Key enzymes of the retinoid (visual) cycle in vertebrate retina.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This reasoning has helped to support the hypothesis that ABCA4 functions as an exporter of all-trans-retinal. However, using ABCA4(−/−) mice, Boyer et al. (25.Boyer N.P. Higbee D. Currin M.B. Blakeley L.R. Chen C. Ablonczy Z. Crouch R.K. Koutalos Y. Lipofuscin and N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E) accumulate in retinal pigment epithelium in absence of light exposure. Their origin is 11-cis-retinal.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 22276-22286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) recently showed that 11-cis-retinal can also support the formation of lipofuscin and proposed that 11-cis-retinal may be imported into the ROS discs by ABCA4. Currently, a mechanism of 11-cis-retinal import into the ROS discs is not known except through membrane diffusion. A transporter for 11-cis-retinal has not yet been identified. ABCA4 possesses a characteristic ABC protein family structure consisting of two membrane-spanning domains (transmembrane domains), with each containing six α-helices, and two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (Fig. 1). The primary sequences of ABC transporter transmembrane domains are highly variable, whereas the NBDs contain the conserved Walker A and Walker B consensus motifs. In addition, the NBDs harbor the LSGGQ signature sequence of ABC proteins, albeit diminished to SGG in the NBD2 domain of ABCA4 (26.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. Distantly related sequences in the α and β subunits of ATP synthase, myosin, kinases, and other ATP requiring enzymes and a common nucleotide binding fold.EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar). Unique to the ABCA subfamily is the presence of large extracellular loops, characteristic of this subfamily (Fig. 1). In ABCA4, these loops are thought to project into the lumen of the rod outer segment discs. Tysbovsky et al. identified the presence of the EAA motif in the transmembrane region of the N-terminal half of ABCA4 (27.Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. Subunit interactions in ABC transporters.

Biol. 2010; 703: 105-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This motif is characteristic of ABC proteins that are known to be importers (29.Rees D.C. Johnson E. Lewinson O. ABC transporters. The power to change.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The presence of the EAA motif in ABCA4 is unusual, because in general, eukaryotic ABC transporters are exporters. The EAA motif is absent in the corresponding C-terminal half of ABCA4. The significance of the EAA motif in ABCA4 remains unknown; however, it may point to a 11-cis-retinal import function of the protein. The biochemical and kinetic properties of the nucleotide binding domains have been studied in individual recombinant polypeptides as well as in native and recombinant full-length ABCA4 protein (30.Sun H.

Through a variety of independent experimental approaches, the NBD1 and NBD2 domains have been shown to have distinct enzymatic and kinetic properties. NBD1 possesses a low general ribonucleotidase activity, whereas NBD2 has a higher rate of hydrolysis and is specific for adenine nucleotides (36.Biswas E.E. Nucleotide binding domain 1 of the human retinal ABC transporter functions as a general ribonucleotidase.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8181-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, NBD1 and NBD2, although both important, probably play distinct mechanistic roles, consistent with that found for other ABC transporters, such as ABCB1 and ABCG2 (37.Vasiliou V. Vasiliou K. Nebert D.W. Human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family.Hum. Genomics. 2009; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Although half the size of NBD1, based on its kinetic properties, NBD2 appears to provide the energy required for translocation, whereas NBD1 serves a yet undefined cellular function. Several studies demonstrate that many disease-associated mutations mapping to the NBD1 of ABCA4 do not affect its function as an ATPase (15.Klevering B.J. Blankenagel A. Maugeri A. Cremers F.P.

Using fluorescence anisotropy, we have shown that the ECD2 domain of ABCA4 interacts specifically and with high affinity to all-trans-retinal (39.Biswas-Fiss E.E. Kurpad D.S. Joshi K. Biswas S.B. Interaction of extracellular domain 2 of the human retina-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA4) with all-trans-retinal.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19372-19383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Analysis of the interaction of the other soluble domains of ABCA4 (ECD1, NBD1, and NBD2) showed that these domains do not bind all-trans-retinal with appreciable affinity. The ability of all-trans- and 11-cis-retinal to stimulate the ATPase of ABCA4 indicates that the protein engages in a physical interaction with both geometric isomers. However, it is not known which domain of ABCA4 mediates interaction with the 11-cis isomer of retinal. Based on recent studies proposing a physiological role of ABCA4 that may include translocation of 11-cis-retinal across the ROS disc membrane (25.Boyer N.P. Higbee D. Currin M.B. Blakeley L.R. Chen C. Ablonczy Z. Crouch R.K. Koutalos Y. Lipofuscin and N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E) accumulate in retinal pigment epithelium in absence of light exposure. Their origin is 11-cis-retinal.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 22276-22286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) as well as preliminary studies pointing to a specific interaction of NBD1 with 11-cis-retinal (40.Biswas-Fiss E.E. Ha M. Kurpad D Biswas S.B. Retinoid binding properties of the nucleotide binding domains of human ABCA4 protein.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2011; 52 (E-Abstract 51)Google Scholar), we posed the following question. Do the nucleotide binding domains of ABCA4 interact with retinal, and if so, how is this interaction influenced by disease-associated mutations in these domains? In this report, we have investigated the retinal binding properties of the first nucleotide binding domain of ABCA4 and examined the effects of disease-associated mutations on retinal binding. The pRK5 plasmid containing the full-length, wild-type cDNA of the human ABCA4 gene was obtained as a generous gift from Drs. J. Nathans and Michael Dean of Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD) and NCBI (Frederick, MD), respectively. The T7 expression system vector pET30b, Bug Buster protein extraction reagent, Benzonase nuclease, and the S-protein-agarose affinity resin were from Novagen (EMD Sciences, Briggstown, NJ). All-trans-retinal was from Sigma-Aldrich, whereas 11-cis-retinal was received through Dr. R. Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina) under the auspices of the NEI, National Institutes of Health, resource program for vision researchers. Buffer A was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% (v/v) glycerol. Buffer B contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Buffer C was 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 2 mm EDTA. Buffer D contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m l-arginine, and 2 mm EDTA. Buffer E contained 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The NBD1 construct was amplified from full-length ABCA4 cDNA and cloned into pET30b T7 expression vector (EMD Sciences) using standard recombinant DNA technology (41.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). This domain corresponds to a 57.8-kDa (522-amino acid (aa)) polypeptide. The cloning was designed such that the polypeptide was produced as an S-tagged fusion protein, leading to a predicted mass of 62 kDa for the recombinant NBD1. For subsequent recombinant protein expression, the plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RILP competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a PCR-based mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (35.Suárez T. Biswas S.B. Biswas E.E. Biochemical defects in retina-specific human ATP binding cassette transporter nucleotide binding domain 1 mutants associated with macular degeneration.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21759-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), pET30-NBD1 plasmid as template, and allele-specific primers as described previously (35.Suárez T. Biswas S.B. Biswas E.E. Biochemical defects in retina-specific human ATP binding cassette transporter nucleotide binding domain 1 mutants associated with macular degeneration.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21759-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The authenticity of the mutations and the absence of other fortuitous mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing carried out by Eurofins MWG/Operon (Huntsville, AL). E. coli cells (strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL, Stratagene (La Jolla, CA)) harboring pET30b-NBD1 plasmid were used to produce the recombinant NBD1 polypeptide following the manufacturer's instructions. The expressed recombinant polypeptide appeared to be of the anticipated size (62 kDa), as determined by SDS-PAGE. Extraction and purification of wild-type NBD1 protein carrying the S-tag was performed using immobilized S-protein-agarose affinity resin (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) following the manufacturer's recommendations as described previously (36.Biswas E.E. Nucleotide binding domain 1 of the human retinal ABC transporter functions as a general ribonucleotidase.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8181-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Introduction of mutations into wild-type NBD1 polypeptide appeared to decrease the solubility of the expressed proteins as determined by SDS-PAGE and a Western blot procedure (data not shown). Consequently, we explored the extraction of recombinant proteins (wild type and mutants) from the inclusion bodies followed by refolding (42.Winterfeld S. Imhof N. Roos T. Bär G. Kuhn A. Gerken U. Substrate-induced conformational change of the Escherichia coli membrane insertase YidC.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6684-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).

Cutfield S.M. Bacterial expression and purification of the ovine type II bone morphogenetic protein receptor ectodomain.Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 52: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). After harvesting the expressed proteins, the cell pellets were resuspended in room temperature BugBuster reagent, and protease inhibitors were added. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cell suspension was centrifuged to collect purified inclusion bodies. Following cell lysis, the pellet of inclusion bodies was resuspended in buffer B and centrifuged once more. The inclusion body proteins were solubilized in Buffer C. Protein refolding was achieved by rapid dilution in Buffer D. The renatured protein was sequentially dialyzed in Buffer E. After overnight dialysis, proteins were concentrated to ∼0.5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon/Millipore). Overall, the inclusion body protein purification methodology described here yielded highly concentrated, purified, and homogeneous preparations of protein (Fig. 2). The yield of NBD1 protein was >10 mg from 4 liters of induced cell culture. Purified proteins were stored at −80 °C until use. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured to investigate retinal binding by NBD1 protein in solution. Anisotropy measurements were carried out as described using a steady-state photon-counting spectrofluorometer, PC1, with Vinci software, from ISS Instruments (Champaign, IL) and Fluorolog 3 from Horiba Instruments Inc. (Edison, NJ) (39.Biswas-Fiss E.E. Kurpad D.S. Joshi K. Biswas S.B.

The excitation wavelength was set at 310 nm, and fluorescence anisotropy was recorded at an emission wavelength of 430 nm. Excitation and emission slits were adjusted to 8 nm to maximize intensity counts. The given retinal isomer was diluted to a concentration of 100 nm and titrated with NBD1 protein within a concentration range of 0.1 nm to 2 μm. The sample was incubated for 2 min after each addition. The S.D. for the anisotropy values was ≤±0.005 A. Anisotropy at each titration point was measured three times for 10 s and averaged. The total fluorescence intensity did not change significantly (≤10%) with increase in NBD1 concentration. Therefore, fluorescence lifetime changes or the scattered excitation light did not affect the anisotropy measurements. Anisotropy (A) is defined as follows, A=(Ivv−GIvh)/(Ivv−2GIvh)(Eq. 1) where G is the instrumental correction factor for the fluorometer, and it is defined by Equation 2, G=Ihv/Ihh(Eq. 2) where Ivv, Ivh, Ihv, and Ihh represent the fluorescence signal for excitation and emission with the polarizers set at (0°, 0°), (0°, 90°), (90°, 0°), and (90°, 90°), respectively. The interaction of NBD1 with ligand (all-trans-retinal or 11-cis-retinal) (L) can be represented as follows. At equilibrium, Ka, the equilibrium association constant, can be given as follows."

The aim of this study was to explore the deformation of the Durom cup after implantation and to clarify the impact of deformation on wear and ion release of the Durom large head metal-on-metal (MOM) total hips in simulators.Six Durom cups impacted into reamed acetabula of fresh cadavers were used as the experimental group and another 6 size-paired intact Durom cups constituted the control group. All 12 Durom MOM total hips were put through a 3 million cycle (MC) wear test in simulators.The 6 cups in the experimental group were all deformed, with a mean deformation of 41.78 ± 8.86 µm. The average volumetric wear rate in the experimental group and in the control group in the first million cycle was 6.65 ± 0.29 mm(3)/MC and 0.89 ± 0.04 mm(3)/MC (t = 48.43, p = 0.000). The ion levels of Cr and Co in the experimental group were also higher than those in the control group before 2.0 MC. However there was no difference in the ion levels between 2.0 and 3.0 MC.This finding implies that the non-modular acetabular component of Durom total hip prosthesis is likely to become deformed during press-fit insertion, and that the deformation will result in increased volumetric wear and increased ion release.This study was determined to explore the deformation of the Durom cup after implantation and to clarify the impact of deformation on wear and ion release of the prosthesis. Deformation of the cup after implantation increases the wear of MOM bearings and the resulting ion levels. The clinical use of the Durom large head prosthesis should be with great care."
https://openalex.org/W2054905555,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogens by interacting with pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as the phosphatidylinositol-based lipoglycans, lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM). Such structures are present in several pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, being important for the initiation of immune responses. It is well established that the interaction of LM and LAM with TLR2 is a process dependent on the structure of the ligands. However, the implications of structural variations on TLR2 ligands for the development of T helper (Th) cell responses or in the context of in vivo responses are less studied. Herein, we used Corynebacterium glutamicum as a source of lipoglycan intermediates for host interaction studies. In this study, we have deleted a putative glycosyltransferase, NCgl2096, from C. glutamicum and found that it encodes for a novel α(1→2)arabinofuranosyltransferase, AftE. Biochemical analysis of the lipoglycans obtained in the presence (wild type) or absence of NCgl2096 showed that AftE is involved in the biosynthesis of singular arabinans of LAM. In its absence, the resulting molecule is a hypermannosylated (hLM) form of LAM. Both LAM and hLM were recognized by dendritic cells, mainly via TLR2, and triggered the production of several cytokines. hLM was a stronger stimulus for in vitro cytokine production and, as a result, a more potent inducer of Th17 responses. In vivo data confirmed hLM as a stronger inducer of cytokine responses and suggested the involvement of pattern recognition receptors other than TLR2 as sensors for lipoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1981614171,"The protease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeat) cleaves multimers of von Willebrand factor, thus regulating platelet aggregation. ADAMTS13 deficiency leads to the fatal disorder thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). It has been observed that cyclosporin A (CsA) treatment, particularly in transplant patients, may sometimes be linked to the development of TTP. Until now, the reason for such a link was unclear. Here we provide evidence demonstrating that cyclophilin B (CypB) activity plays an important role in the secretion of active ADAMTS13. We found that CsA, an inhibitor of CypB, reduces the secretion of ADAMTS13 and leads to conformational changes in the protein resulting in diminished ADAMTS13 proteolytic activity. A direct, functional interaction between CypB (which possesses peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) and chaperone functions) and ADAMTS13 is demonstrated using immunoprecipitation and siRNA knockdown of CypB. Finally, CypB knock-out mice were found to have reduced ADAMTS13 levels. Taken together, our findings indicate that cyclophilin-mediated activity is an important factor affecting secretion and activity of ADAMTS13. The large number of proline residues in ADAMTS13 is consistent with the important role of cis-trans isomerization in the proper folding of this protein. These results altogether provide a novel mechanistic explanation for CsA-induced TTP in transplant patients."
