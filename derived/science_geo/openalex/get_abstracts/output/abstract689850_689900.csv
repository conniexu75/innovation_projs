https://openalex.org/W4220661922,"A key aspect of nearly all single-cell sequencing experiments is dissociation of intact tissues into single-cell suspensions. While many protocols have been optimized for optimal cell yield, they have often overlooked the effects that dissociation can have on ex vivo gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that use of enzymatic dissociation on brain tissue induces an aberrant ex vivo gene expression signature, most prominently in microglia, which is prevalent in published literature and can substantially confound downstream analyses. To address this issue, we present a rigorously validated protocol that preserves both in vivo transcriptional profiles and cell-type diversity and yield across tissue types and species. We also identify a similar signature in postmortem human brain single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets, and show that this signature is induced in freshly isolated human tissue by exposure to elevated temperatures ex vivo. Together, our results provide a methodological solution for preventing artifactual gene expression changes during fresh tissue digestion and a reference for future deeper analysis of the potential confounding states present in postmortem human samples."
https://openalex.org/W4220949944,"Departing from traditional linguistic models, advances in deep learning have resulted in a new type of predictive (autoregressive) deep language models (DLMs). Using a self-supervised next-word prediction task, these models generate appropriate linguistic responses in a given context. In the current study, nine participants listened to a 30-min podcast while their brain responses were recorded using electrocorticography (ECoG). We provide empirical evidence that the human brain and autoregressive DLMs share three fundamental computational principles as they process the same natural narrative: (1) both are engaged in continuous next-word prediction before word onset; (2) both match their pre-onset predictions to the incoming word to calculate post-onset surprise; (3) both rely on contextual embeddings to represent words in natural contexts. Together, our findings suggest that autoregressive DLMs provide a new and biologically feasible computational framework for studying the neural basis of language."
https://openalex.org/W4220986183,"As novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with different patterns of spike protein mutations have emerged, the susceptibility of these variants to neutralization by antibodies has been rapidly assessed. However, neutralization data are generated using different approaches and are scattered across different publications making it difficult for these data to be located and synthesized. The Stanford Coronavirus Resistance Database (CoV-RDB; https://covdb.stanford.edu) is designed to house comprehensively curated published data on the neutralizing susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants and spike mutations to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), convalescent plasma (CP), and vaccinee plasma (VP). As of December 31, 2021, CoV-RDB encompassed 257 publications including 91 (35%) containing 9,070 neutralizing mAb susceptibility results, 131 (51%) containing 16,773 neutralizing CP susceptibility results, and 178 (69%) containing 33,540 neutralizing VP results. The database also records which spike mutations are selected during in vitro passage of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of mAbs and which emerge in persons receiving mAbs as treatment. The CoV-RDB interface interactively displays neutralizing susceptibility data at different levels of granularity by filtering and/or aggregating query results according to one or more experimental conditions. The CoV-RDB website provides a companion sequence analysis program that outputs information about mutations present in a submitted sequence and that also assists users in determining the appropriate mutation-detection thresholds for identifying non-consensus amino acids. The most recent data underlying the CoV-RDB can be downloaded in its entirety from a GitHub repository in a documented machine-readable format."
https://openalex.org/W4220798402,"While experience is continuous, memories are organized as discrete events. Cognitive boundaries are thought to segment experience and structure memory, but how this process is implemented remains unclear. We recorded the activity of single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) during the formation and retrieval of memories with complex narratives. Here, we show that neurons responded to abstract cognitive boundaries between different episodes. Boundary-induced neural state changes during encoding predicted subsequent recognition accuracy but impaired event order memory, mirroring a fundamental behavioral tradeoff between content and time memory. Furthermore, the neural state following boundaries was reinstated during both successful retrieval and false memories. These findings reveal a neuronal substrate for detecting cognitive boundaries that transform experience into mnemonic episodes and structure mental time travel during retrieval. Continuous experience is segmented into discrete mnemonic episodes. The authors identify neurons in the human brain whose responses to cognitive boundaries predict memory encoding success and mark timepoints that are reinstated during retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W4220727776,"This study attempted to address the limited knowledge regarding the impact of screen time (ST) on lifestyle behaviors in Indian adolescents during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to 1) evaluate frequency and duration of using screens, and screen addiction behaviors in 10-15 years old adolescents in Mumbai during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2) examine the association of ST with lifestyle behaviors- eating habits, snacking patterns, physical activity (PA) levels, sleep quality and depression symptoms.An online survey was completed between January and March 2021. Eating habits, snacking patterns, time spent in different screen-based activities, and screen addiction behaviors were reported. The PA levels, sleep quality, and depression symptoms were evaluated using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children/Adolescents (PAQ C/A), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of ST on lifestyle behaviors.Adolescents (n = 1298, Mage 13.2(1.1), 53.3% boys) reported the mean weekday and weekend ST as 442.3 (201.5) minutes/d and 379.9 (178.2) minutes/d respectively. Overall, 33.4% spent > 6hours/d for studying or doing homework, 65.4% used social networking sites for at least 2-3 hours/d, and 70.7% agreed that ST had taken up the majority of their leisure time. Only 12% engaged in moderate to vigorous PA (PAQ C/A scores <2). More than half (52.5%) reported PSQI >5 indicating poor sleep quality and 8.6% scored ≥ 3 on PHQ-2 to suggest a risk of depression. A higher ST was associated with lower PA and increased sleep problems and a greater screen addiction was inversely associated with the eating habit, PA, and sleep-related variables.The study draws attention to a high prevalence of excess ST and its impact on eating habits, PA levels, and sleep quality in Indian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted health promotion interventions that encourage judicious use of screens for education and entertainment and emphasize the adverse health effects of excess ST are required."
https://openalex.org/W4220723648,"A classic view of the striatum holds that activity in direct and indirect pathways oppositely modulates motor output. Whether this involves direct control of movement, or reflects a cognitive process underlying movement, remains unresolved. Here we find that strong, opponent control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum depends on the cognitive requirements of a task. Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden Markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that—even within a single task—the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices. Thus, both the demands imposed by a task, as well as the internal state of mice when performing a task, determine whether dorsomedial striatum pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior. The authors use virtual reality tasks and a latent state modeling approach to demonstrate that the opposing control of behavior by striatal pathways is dependent on both task demands and changes in internal state."
https://openalex.org/W4220991498,"Recent genetic studies have identified variants associated with bipolar disorder (BD), but it remains unclear how brain gene expression is altered in BD and how genetic risk for BD may contribute to these alterations. Here, we obtained transcriptomes from subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala samples from post-mortem brains of individuals with BD and neurotypical controls, including 511 total samples from 295 unique donors. We examined differential gene expression between cases and controls and the transcriptional effects of BD-associated genetic variants. We found two coexpressed modules that were associated with transcriptional changes in BD: one enriched for immune and inflammatory genes and the other with genes related to the postsynaptic membrane. Over 50% of BD genome-wide significant loci contained significant expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) (eQTL), and these data converged on several individual genes, including SCN2A and GRIN2A. Thus, these data implicate specific genes and pathways that may contribute to the pathology of BP."
https://openalex.org/W4220996704,"Background Vaccine uptake rates have been historically low in correctional settings. To better understand vaccine hesitancy in these high-risk settings, we explored reasons for COVID-19 vaccine refusal among people in federal prisons. Methods Three maximum security all-male federal prisons in British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario (Canada) were chosen, representing prisons with the highest proportions of COVID-19 vaccine refusal. Using a qualitative descriptive design and purposive sampling, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with incarcerated people who had previously refused at least one COVID-19 vaccine until data saturation was achieved. An inductive–deductive thematic analysis of audio-recorded interview transcripts was conducted using the Conceptual Model of Vaccine Hesitancy. Results Between May 19-July 8, 2021, 14 participants were interviewed (median age: 30 years; n = 7 Indigenous, n = 4 visible minority, n = 3 White). Individual-, interpersonal-, and system-level factors were identified. Three were particularly relevant to the correctional setting: 1) Risk perception : participants perceived that they were at lower risk of COVID-19 due to restricted visits and interactions; 2) Health care services in prison : participants reported feeling “punished” and stigmatized due to strict COVID-19 restrictions, and failed to identify personal benefits of vaccination due to the lack of incentives; 3) Universal distrust : participants expressed distrust in prison employees, including health care providers. Interpretation Reasons for vaccine refusal among people in prison are multifaceted. Educational interventions could seek to address COVID-19 risk misconceptions in prison settings. However, impact may be limited if trust is not fostered and if incentives are not considered in vaccine promotion."
https://openalex.org/W4221012848,"Background Community Health Workers are globally recognised as crucial members of healthcare systems in low and middle-income countries, but their role and experience during COVID-19 is not well-understood. This study aimed to explore factors that influence CHWs’ ability and willingness to work in the COVID-19 pandemic in Lagos. Design A generic qualitative study exploring Community Health Workers experiences and perceptions of working during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lagos, Nigeria. Methods 15 semi-structured, in-depth, video interviews were conducted with Community Health Workers purposively sampled across seven of Lagos’ Local Government Areas with the highest COVID-19 burden. Interviews explored Community Health Workers’ attitudes towards COVID-19, its management, and their experiences working in Lagos. Data was analysed thematically using the framework method. Results Three main themes were identified. 1 . Influences on ability to undertake COVID-19 Role : Trust and COVID-19 knowledge were found to aid Community Health Workers in their work. However, challenges included exhaustion due to an increased workload, public misconceptions about COVID-19, stigmatisation of COVID-19 patients, delayed access to care and lack of transportation. 2 . Influences on willingness to work in COVID-19 Role : Community Health Workers’ perceptions of COVID-19, attitudes towards responsibility for COVID-19 risk at work, commitment and faith appeared to increase willingness to work. 3 . Suggested Improvements : Financial incentives, provision of adequate personal protective equipment, transportation, and increasing staff numbers were seen as potential strategies to address many of the challenges faced. Conclusion Despite Community Health Workers being committed to their role, they have faced many challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Changes to their working environment may make their role during disease outbreaks more fulfilling and sustainable. International input is required to enhance Nigeria’s policies and infrastructure to better support Community Health Workers during both current and future outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W4221078486,"Enterococci are a part of human microbiota and a leading cause of multidrug resistant infections. Here, we identify a family of Enterococcus pore-forming toxins (Epxs) in E. faecalis, E. faecium, and E. hirae strains isolated across the globe. Structural studies reveal that Epxs form a branch of β-barrel pore-forming toxins with a β-barrel protrusion (designated the top domain) sitting atop the cap domain. Through a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identify human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) complex as a receptor for two members (Epx2 and Epx3), which preferentially recognize human HLA-I and homologous MHC-I of equine, bovine, and porcine, but not murine, origin. Interferon exposure, which stimulates MHC-I expression, sensitizes human cells and intestinal organoids to Epx2 and Epx3 toxicity. Co-culture with Epx2-harboring E. faecium damages human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal organoids, and this toxicity is neutralized by an Epx2 antibody, demonstrating the toxin-mediated virulence of Epx-carrying Enterococcus."
https://openalex.org/W4220930380,"Approximately 10% of infants infected with SARS-CoV-2 will experience COVID-19 illness requiring advanced care. A potential mechanism to protect this population is passive immunization via the milk of a previously infected person. We and others have reported on the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human milk. We now report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in the milk of 74 COVID-19-recovered participants, and find that 89% of samples are positive for Spike-specific IgA. In a subset of these samples, 95% exhibited robust IgA activity as determined by endpoint binding titer, with 50% considered high-titer. These IgA-positive samples were also positive for Spike-specific secretory antibody. Levels of IgA antibodies and secretory antibodies were shown to be strongly positively correlated. The secretory IgA response was dominant among the milk samples tested compared to the IgG response, which was present in 75% of samples and found to be of high-titer in only 13% of cases. Our IgA durability analysis using 28 paired samples, obtained 4–6 weeks and 4–10 months after infection, found that all samples exhibited persistently significant Spike-specific IgA, with 43% of donors exhibiting increasing IgA titers over time. Finally, COVID-19 and pre-pandemic control milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies; 6 of 8 COVID-19 samples exhibited neutralization of Spike-pseudotyped VSV (IC 50 range, 2.39–89.4ug/mL) compared to 1 of 8 controls. IgA binding and neutralization capacities were found to be strongly positively correlated. These data are highly relevant to public health, not only in terms of the protective capacity of these antibodies for breastfed infants, but also for the potential use of such antibodies as a COVID-19 therapeutic, given that secretory IgA is highly in all mucosal compartments."
https://openalex.org/W4220907522,"Anxiety disorders affect approximately one third of people during their lifetimes and are the ninth leading cause of global disability. Current treatments focus on therapy and pharmacological interventions. However, therapy is costly and pharmacological interventions often have undesirable side-effects. Healthy people also regularly suffer periods of anxiety. Therefore, a non-pharmacological, intuitive, home intervention would be complementary to other treatments and beneficial for non-clinical groups. Existing at-home anxiety aids, such as guided meditations, typically employ visual and/or audio stimuli to guide the user into a calmer state. However, the tactile sense has the potential to be a more natural modality to target in an anxiety-calming device. The tactile domain is relatively under-explored, but we suggest that there are manifold physiological and affective qualities of touch that lend it to the task. In this study we demonstrate that haptic technology can offer an enjoyable, effective and widely accessible alternative for easing state anxiety. We describe a novel huggable haptic interface that pneumatically simulates slow breathing. We discuss the development of this interface through a focus group evaluating five prototypes with embedded behaviours ('breathing', 'purring', 'heartbeat' and 'illumination'). Ratings indicated that the 'breathing' prototype was most pleasant to interact with and participants described this prototype as 'calming' and 'soothing', reminding them of a person breathing. This prototype was developed into an ergonomic huggable cushion containing a pneumatic chamber powered by an external pump allowing the cushion to 'breathe'. A mixed-design experiment (n = 129) inducing anxiety through a group mathematics test found that the device was effective at reducing pre-test anxiety compared to a control (no intervention) condition and that this reduction in anxiety was indistinguishable from that of a guided meditation. Our findings highlight the efficacy of this interface, demonstrating that haptic technologies can be effective at easing anxiety. We suggest that the field should be explored in more depth to capture the nuances of different modalities in relation to specific situations and trait characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W4221094293,"Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), the major scaffolding protein of tight junctions (TJs), recruits the cytoskeleton-associated proteins cingulin (CGN) and paracingulin (CGNL1) to TJs by binding to their N-terminal ZO-1 interaction motif. The conformation of ZO-1 can be either folded or extended, depending on cytoskeletal tension and intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, and only ZO-1 in the extended conformation recruits the transcription factor DbpA to TJs. However, the sequences of ZO-1 that interact with CGN and CGNL1 and the role of TJ proteins in ZO-1 TJ assembly are not known. Here, we used glutathione-S-transferase pulldowns and immunofluorescence microscopy to show that CGN and CGNL1 bind to the C-terminal ZU5 domain of ZO-1 and that this domain is required for CGN and CGNL1 recruitment to TJs and to phase-separated ZO-1 condensates in cells. We show that KO of CGN, but not CGNL1, results in decreased accumulation of ZO-1 at TJs. Furthermore, ZO-1 lacking the ZU5 domain showed decreased accumulation at TJs, was detectable along lateral contacts, had a higher mobile fraction than full-length ZO-1 by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, and had a folded conformation, as determined by structured illumination microscopy of its N-terminal and C-terminal ends. The CGN-ZU5 interaction promotes the extended conformation of ZO-1, since binding of the CGN-ZO-1 interaction motif region to ZO-1 resulted in its interaction with DbpA in cells and in vitro. Together, these results show that binding of CGN to the ZU5 domain of ZO-1 promotes ZO-1 stabilization and accumulation at TJs by promoting its extended conformation."
https://openalex.org/W4220780020,"Peru is the country with the world's highest COVID-19 death rate per capita. Characteristics associated with increased mortality among adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in this setting are not well described.Retrospective, single-center cohort study including 1537 adult patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia between May 2020 and August 2020 at a national hospital in Lima, Peru. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality.In-hospital mortality was 49.71%. The mean age was 60 ± 14.25 years, and 68.38% were males. We found an association between mortality and inflammatory markers, mainly leukocytes, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein and ferritin. A multivariate model adjusted for age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and corticosteroid use demonstrated that in-hospital mortality was associated with greater age (RR: 2.01, 95%CI: 1.59-2.52) and a higher level of oxygen requirement (RR: 2.77, 95%CI: 2.13-3.62). Conclusions: In-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients in Peru is high and is associated with greater age and higher oxygen requirements."
https://openalex.org/W4221111437,"Echocardiographic findings vary with shock severity, as defined by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) shock stage. Left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can predict mortality in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). We sought to determine whether LVSWI could refine mortality risk stratification by the SCAI shock classification in the CICU.We included consecutive CICU patients from 2007 to 2015 with TTE data available to calculate the LVSWI, specifically the mean arterial pressure, stroke volume index and medial mitral E/e' ratio. In-hospital mortality as a function of LVSWI was evaluated across the SCAI shock stages using logistic regression, before and after multivariable adjustment.We included 3635 unique CICU patients, with a mean age of 68.1 ± 14.5 years (36.5% females); 61.1% of patients had an acute coronary syndrome. The LVSWI progressively decreased with increasing shock severity, as defined by increasing SCAI shock stage. A total of 203 (5.6%) patients died during hospitalization, with higher in-hospital mortality among patients with lower LVSWI (adjusted OR 0.66 per 10 J/m2 higher) or higher SCAI shock stage (adjusted OR 1.24 per each higher stage). A LVSWI <33 J/m2 was associated with higher adjusted in-hospital mortality, particularly among patients with shock (SCAI stages C, D and E).The LVSWI by TTE noninvasively characterizes the severity of shock, including both systolic and diastolic parameters, and can identify low-risk and high-risk patients at each level of clinical shock severity."
https://openalex.org/W4220702936,"Recent studies suggest an association between ambient air pollution and mental well-being, though evidence is mostly fragmented and inconclusive. Research also suffers from methodological limitations related to study design and moderating effect of key demographics (e.g., ethnicity). This study examines the effect of air pollution on reported mental well-being in United Kingdom (UK) using spatial-temporal (between-within) longitudinal design and assesses the moderating effect of ethnicity.Data for 60,146 adult individuals (age:16+) with 349,748 repeated responses across 10-data collection waves (2009-2019) from ""Understanding-Society: The-UK-Household-Longitudinal-Study"" were linked to annual concentrations of NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 pollutants using the individuals' place of residence, given at the local-authority and at the finer Lower-Super-Output-Areas (LSOAs) levels; allowing for analysis at two geographical scales across time. The association between air pollution and mental well-being (assessed through general-health-questionnaire-GHQ12) and its modification by ethnicity and being non-UK born was assessed using multilevel mixed-effect logit models.Higher odds of poor mental well-being was observed with every 10μg/m3 increase in NO2, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 pollutants at both LSOAs and local-authority levels. Decomposing air pollution into spatial-temporal (between-within) effects showed significant between, but not within effects; thus, residing in more polluted local-authorities/LSOAs have higher impact on poor mental well-being than the air pollution variation across time within each geographical area. Analysis by ethnicity revealed higher odds of poor mental well-being with increasing concentrations of SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 only for Pakistani/Bangladeshi, other-ethnicities and non-UK born individuals compared to British-white and natives, but not for other ethnic groups.Using longitudinal individual-level and contextual-linked data, this study highlights the negative effect of air pollution on individuals' mental well-being. Environmental policies to reduce air pollution emissions can eventually improve the mental well-being of people in UK. However, there is inconclusive evidence on the moderating effect of ethnicity."
https://openalex.org/W4220722964,"The Covid-19 pandemic and its accompanying public-health orders (PHOs) have led to (potentially countervailing) changes in various risk factors for overdose. To assess whether the net effects of these factors varied geographically, we examined regional variation in the impact of the PHOs on counts of nonfatal overdoses, which have received less attention than fatal overdoses, despite their public health significance.Data were collected from the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program (ODMAP), which recorded suspected overdoses between July 1, 2018 and October 25, 2020. We used segmented regression models to assess the impact of PHOs on nonfatal-overdose trends in Washington DC and the five geographical regions of Maryland, using a historical control time series to adjust for normative changes in overdoses that occurred around mid-March (when the PHOs were issued).The mean level change in nonfatal opioid overdoses immediately after mid-March was not reliably different in the Covid-19 year versus the preceding control time series for any region. However, the rate of increase in nonfatal overdose was steeper after mid-March in the Covid-19 year versus the preceding year for Maryland as a whole (B = 2.36; 95% CI, 0.65 to 4.06; p = .007) and for certain subregions. No differences were observed for Washington DC.The pandemic and its accompanying PHOs were associated with steeper increases in nonfatal opioid overdoses in most but not all of the regions we assessed, with a net effect that was deleterious for the Maryland region as a whole."

The study adopted a quantitative approach with a total of 340 respondents from various banks in Tanzania. The data was analyzed using Covariance Based Structural Equation Modelling (CB-SEM). The results of the finding indicate that high-performance work practices have a significant effect on employee career competencies. Similarly, employee career competencies significantly impact service quality, creative performance, and extra-role performance in banks. Also, employee career competency does not mediate the relationship between high-performance work systems and service quality in the banking industry."
https://openalex.org/W4220984387,"Context Pain is a primary reason individuals attend an Emergency Department (ED), and its management is a concern. Objectives Change in symptoms and physiologic variables at 3 time points pre-post a ten-minute St. John Ambulance therapy dog team visit compared to no visit in ED patients who experienced pain. Design, setting and participants Using a controlled clinical trial design, pain, anxiety, depression and well-being were measured with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (revised version) (ESAS-r) 11-point rating scales before, immediately after, and 20 minutes post- therapy dog team visit with Royal University Hospital ED patients participating in the study (n = 97). Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at the time points. Control data was gathered twice (30 minutes apart) for comparison (n = 101). There were no group differences in age, gender or ethnicity among the control and intervention groups (respectively mean age 59.5/57.2, ethnicity 77.2% Caucasian/87.6%, female 43.6% /39.2%, male 56.4%/60.8%,). Intervention 10 minute therapy dog team visit in addition to usual care. Main outcome measures Change in reported pain from pre and post therapy dog team visit and comparison with a control group. Results A two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare group effects. Significant pre- post-intervention differences were noted in pain for the intervention (mean change int. = -0.9, SD = 2.05, p = .004, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.42, 1.32], η p 2 = 04) but not the control group. Anxiety (mean change int. = -1.13, SD = 2.80, p = .005, 95% CI = [0.56, 1.64], η p 2 = .04), depression (mean change int. = -0.72, SD = 1.71, p = .002, 95% CI = [0.39, 1.11], ηp 2 = .047), and well-being ratings (mean change int. = -0.87, SD = 1.84, p &lt; .001, 95% CI = [0.49, 1.25], ηp 2 = .07) similarly improved for the intervention group only. There were no pre-post intervention differences in blood pressure or heart rate for either group. Strong responders to the intervention (i.e. &gt;50% reduction) were observed for pain (43%), anxiety (48%), depression (46%), and well-being (41%). Conclusions Clinically significant changes in pain as well as significant changes in anxiety, depression and well-being were observed in the therapy dog intervention compared to control. The findings of this novel study contribute important knowledge towards the potential value of ED therapy dogs to affect patients’ experience of pain, and related measures of anxiety, depression and well-being.

https://openalex.org/W4220668181,"Music and auditory beat stimulation (ABS) in the theta frequency range (4-7 Hz) are sound-based anxiety treatments that have been independently investigated in prior studies. Here, the anxiety-reducing potential of calm music combined with theta ABS was examined in a large sample of participants.An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted with participants taking anxiolytics (n = 163). Participants were randomly assigned using the Qualtrics randomizer algorithm, to a single session of sound-based treatment in one of four parallel arms: combined (music & ABS; n = 39), music-alone (n = 36), ABS-alone (n = 41), or pink noise (control; n = 47). Pre- and post-intervention somatic and cognitive state anxiety measures were collected along with trait anxiety, personality measures and musical preferences. The study was completed online using a custom application.Based on trait anxiety scores participants were separated into moderate and high trait anxiety sub-groups. Among participants with moderate trait anxiety, we observed reductions in somatic anxiety that were greater in combined and music-alone conditions than in the pink noise condition; and reductions in cognitive state anxiety that were greater in the combined condition than in the music-alone, ABS-alone, and pink noise conditions. While we also observed reductions in somatic and cognitive state anxiety in participants with high trait anxiety, the conditions were not well differentiated.Sound-based treatments are effective in reducing somatic and cognitive state anxiety. For participants with moderate trait anxiety, combined conditions were most efficacious."
https://openalex.org/W4220959290,"The ability to accurately determine when to perform an action is a fundamental brain function and vital to adaptive behavior. The behavioral mechanism and neural circuit for action timing, however, remain largely unknown. Using a new, self-paced action timing task in mice, we found that deprivation of auditory, but not somatosensory or visual input, disrupts learned action timing. The hearing effect was dependent on the auditory feedback derived from the animal's own actions, rather than passive environmental cues. Neuronal activity in the secondary auditory cortex was found to be both correlated with and necessary for the proper execution of learned action timing. Closed-loop, action-dependent optogenetic stimulation of the specific task-related neuronal population within the secondary auditory cortex rescued the key features of learned action timing under auditory deprivation. These results unveil a previously underappreciated sensorimotor mechanism in which the secondary auditory cortex transduces self-generated audiomotor feedback to control action timing."
https://openalex.org/W4226243735,"Antenatal synthetic glucocorticoids (sGCs) are a life-saving treatment in managing pre-term birth. However, off-target effects of sGCs can impact blood-brain barrier (BBB) drug transporters essential for fetal brain protection, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp/Abcb1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/Abcg2). We hypothesized that maternal antenatal sGC treatment modifies BBB function in juvenile offspring in a sex-dependent manner. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the long-term impact of a single or multiple courses of betamethasone on P-gp/Abcb1 and BCRP/Abcg2 expression and function at the BBB. Pregnant guinea pigs (N = 42) received 3 courses (gestation days (GDs) 40, 50, and 60) or a single course (GD50) of betamethasone (1 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline). Cerebral microvessels and brain endothelial cells (BEC) were collected from the post-natal day (PND) 14 offspring to measure protein, gene expression, and function of the drug transporters P-gp/Abcb1 and BCRP/Abcg2. P-gp protein expression was decreased (p < .05) in microvessels from male offspring that had been exposed to multiple courses and a single course of sGC, in utero. Multiple courses of sGC resulted in a significant decrease in P-gp function in BECs from males (p < .05), but not females. There was a very strong trend for increased P-gp function in males compared to females (p = .055). Reduced P-gp expression and function at the BBB of young male offspring following multiple prenatal sGC exposures, is clinically relevant as many drugs administered postnatally are P-gp substrates.

To avoid the use of chemical agents and to find alternative methods to manage these pests, research studies have mainly focused on plant resistance genes and biocontrol methods involving host plants or natural enemies. A specific alternative method may consist in supporting non-damaging indigenous species that could compete with damaging introduced species to decrease and keep their abundance at low level. For this purpose, knowledge about the biodiversity, structure and functioning of these indigenous communities is needed in order to carry out better risk assessments and to develop possible future management strategies. Here, we investigated 35 root crop fields in eight regions over two consecutive years. The aims were to describe plant parasitic nematode diversity and to assess the potential effects of cultivation practices and environmental variables on communities. Community biodiversity included 10 taxa of plant parasitic nematodes. Despite no significant abundance variations between the two sampling years, structures of communities varied among the different regions. Metadata collected for the past six years, characterizing the cultural practices and soils properties, made it possible to evaluate the impact of these variables both on the whole community and on each taxon separately. Our results suggest that, at a large scale, many variables drive the structuration of the communities. Soil variables, but also rainfall, explain the population density variations among the geographical areas. The effect of the variables differed among the taxa, but fields with few herbicide applications and being pH neutral with low heavy metal and nitrogen concentrations had the highest plant parasitic nematode densities. We discuss how these variables can affect nematode communities either directly or indirectly. These types of studies can help to better understand the variables driving the nematode communities structuration in order to support the abundance of indigenous non-damaging communities that could compete with the invasive species."
https://openalex.org/W4220665640,"Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is a useful method to monitor therapy assessment in malignancies but must be reliable and comparable for successful clinical use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inter- and intrarater reproducibility of DCE-MRI in lung cancer. At this IRB approved single centre study 40 patients with lung cancer underwent up to 5 sequential DCE-MRI examinations. DCE-MRI were performed using a 3.0T system. The volume transfer constant K trans was assessed by three readers using the two-compartment Tofts model. Inter- and intrarater reliability and agreement was calculated by wCV, ICC and their 95% confident intervals. DCE-MRI allowed a quantitative measurement of K trans in 107 tumors where 91 were primary carcinomas or intrapulmonary metastases and 16 were extrapulmonary metastases. K trans showed moderate to good interrater reliability in overall measurements (ICC 0.716–0.841; wCV 30.3–38.4%). K trans in pulmonary lesions ≥ 3 cm showed a good to excellent reliability (ICC 0.773–0.907; wCV 23.0–29.4%) compared to pulmonary lesions &lt; 3 cm showing a moderate to good reliability (ICC 0.710–0.889; wCV 31.6–48.7%). K trans in intrapulmonary lesions showed a good reliability (ICC 0.761–0.873; wCV 28.9–37.5%) compared to extrapulmonary lesions with a poor to moderate reliability (ICC 0.018–0.680; wCV 28.1–51.8%). The overall intrarater agreement was moderate to good (ICC 0.607–0.795; wCV 24.6–30.4%). With K trans , DCE MRI offers a reliable quantitative biomarker for early non-invasive therapy assessment in lung cancer patients, but with a coefficient of variation of up to 48.7% in smaller lung lesions."
https://openalex.org/W4220689175,"To study the value of combining individual- and neighborhood-level sociodemographic data to predict study participation and assess the effects of baseline selection on the distribution of metabolic risk factors and lifestyle factors in the Swedish CardioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS).We linked sociodemographic register data to SCAPIS participants (n = 30,154, ages: 50-64 years) and a random sample of the study's target population (n = 59,909). We assessed the classification ability of participation models based on individual-level data, neighborhood-level data, and combinations of both. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were used to examine how reweighting the sample to match the population affected the averages of 32 cardiopulmonary risk factors at baseline. Absolute SMDs >0.10 were considered meaningful.Combining both individual-level and neighborhood-level data gave rise to a model with better classification ability (AUC: 71.3%) than models with only individual-level (AUC: 66.9%) or neighborhood-level data (AUC: 65.5%). We observed a greater change in the distribution of risk factors when we reweighted the participants using both individual and area data. The only meaningful change was related to the (self-reported) frequency of alcohol consumption, which appears to be higher in the SCAPIS sample than in the population. The remaining risk factors did not change meaningfully.Both individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics are informative in assessing study selection effects. Future analyses of cardiopulmonary outcomes in the SCAPIS cohort can benefit from our study, though the average impact of selection on risk factor distributions at baseline appears small."
https://openalex.org/W4220795070,"While fatty acid metabolism is altered under physiological conditions, alterations can also be maladaptive in diseases such as diabetes and heart failure. Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor α (PPARα) is a transcription factor that regulates fat metabolism but its role in regulating lipid storage in the heart is unclear. The aim of this study is to improve our understanding of how cardiac PPARα regulates cardiac health and lipid accumulation. To study the role of cardiac PPARα, tamoxifen inducible cardiac-specific PPARα knockout mouse (cPPAR -/- ) were treated for 5 days with tamoxifen and then studied after 1–2 months. Under baseline conditions, cPPAR -/- mice appear healthy with normal body weight and mortality is not altered. Importantly, cardiac hypertrophy or reduced cardiac function was also not observed at baseline. Mice were fasted to elevate circulating fatty acids and induce cardiac lipid accumulation. After fasting, cPPAR -/- mice had dramatically lower cardiac triglyceride levels than control mice. Interestingly, cPPAR -/- hearts also had reduced Plin2, a key protein involved in lipid accumulation and lipid droplet regulation, which may contribute to the reduction in cardiac lipid accumulation. Overall, this suggests that a decline in cardiac PPARα may blunt cardiac lipid accumulation by decreasing Plin2 and that independent of differences in systemic metabolism a decline in cardiac PPARα does not seem to drive pathological changes in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W4220960291,"Equine piroplasmosis is a disease of horses, mules and donkeys, caused by the hemoprotozoans Babesia caballi and Theileria equi and transmitted by ticks of tropical and subtropical regions. Because the clinical signs are not specific, the diagnosis of equine piroplasmosis is difficult. In Mexico, where the environmental factors are conducive to the persistence of these pathogens, there is a lack of molecular studies to evaluate the occurrence of both parasites in horses. In the present study, matching serum and whole blood samples were obtained from 269 horses residing in 24 locations with tropical or subtropical climate and the presence of ticks. Testing of serum samples by ELISA demonstrated 55.7% seroprevalence of B. caballi and 68.4% prevalence of antibodies to T. equi. Blood samples analyzed with nPCR test were 7.8% positive to B. caballi and 78.8% positive to T. equi, while a duplex qPCR showed 15.24% positive samples to B. caballi and 59.11% to T. equi. From these results, 27 samples were sequenced for T. equi and 13 for B. caballi, confirming the presence of both horse parasites that cause equine piroplasmosis and suggesting that they are widespread in Mexico. This is the first study confirming the presence of B. caballi and T. equi in Mexico using both serological and molecular diagnostic methods. This study shows a high incidence of exposure to the etiological agents of equine piroplasmosis in horses in the studied areas."

As a traditional agricultural country, Brazil has followed this trend and has increased the production of certified organic products in recent years. In addition, the country is one of the largest consumer markets in Latin America. This study aims to measure the effects of organic production on the economic development of municipalities through spatial analysis and econometric methodologies. Thus, it estimates the impact of organic production hotspots on the 2017 gross domestic product of Brazilian municipalities and the agriculture gross value added. The results indicate that the organic hotspots had a positive effect on both variables.

https://openalex.org/W4224257163,"Cancer immunotherapy has achieved impressive therapeutic effects in many cancers, while only a small subset of patients benefit from it and some patients even have experienced severe toxicity. It is urgent to develop a feasible large-cohort humanized mouse model to evaluate the pre-clinical efficacy and safety of cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, developing potentially effective combination therapy between cancer immunotherapy and other therapies also needs humanized mouse model to adequately mimic clinical actual setting. Herein, we established a humanized mouse model engrafted with less human CD34+ HSCs than ever before and then evaluated reconstitution efficiency and the profiles of human immune cells in this humanized mouse model. Also, this humanized mouse model was used to evaluate the preclinical efficacy and safety of cancer immunotherapy. For each batch of CD34+ HSCs humanized mouse model, a relatively-large cohort with over 25% human CD45+ cells in peripheral blood was established. This humanized mouse model could efficiently reconstitute human innate and adaptive immune cells. This humanized mouse model supported patient-derived xenograft tumor growth and tumor infiltration of PD-1+ human T cells. Furthermore, therapeutic efficacy, re-activation of tumor-infiltrated T cells, and side effects of checkpoint blockade therapy could be monitored in this humanized mouse model. Human T cells from this humanized mouse model were successfully engineered with CD19-CAR. CD19 CAR-T cells could effectively deplete B cells and suppress tumor growth of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in vivo in this humanized mouse model. This humanized mouse model also could be used to demonstrate the efficacy of bispecific antibodies, such as anti-CD19/CD3. Overall, our work provides a feasible large-cohort humanized mouse model for evaluating a variety of cancer immunotherapy approaches including checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapy, and bispecific antibody therapy, and demonstrates that human T cells from this humanized mouse model possess anti-tumor activities in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4220692048,"The effects of muscle weakness on speech are currently not fully known. We investigated the relationships between maximum tongue pressure and second formant transition in adults with different types of dysarthria. It focused on the slope in the second formant transition because it reflects the tongue velocity during articulation. Sixty-three Japanese speakers with dysarthria (median age, 68 years; interquartile range, 58-77 years; 44 men and 19 women) admitted to acute and convalescent hospitals were included. Thirty neurologically normal speakers aged 19-85 years (median age, 22 years; interquartile range, 21.0-23.8 years; 14 men and 16 women) were also included. The relationship between the maximum tongue pressure and speech function was evaluated using correlation analysis in the dysarthria group. Speech intelligibility, the oral diadochokinesis rate, and the second formant slope were based on the impaired speech index. More than half of the speakers had mild to moderate dysarthria. Speakers with dysarthria showed significantly lower maximum tongue pressure, speech intelligibility, oral diadochokinesis rate, and second formant slope than neurologically normal speakers. Only the second formant slope was significantly correlated with the maximum tongue pressure (r = 0.368, p = 0.003). The relationship between the second formant slope and maximum tongue pressure showed a similar correlation in the analysis of subgroups divided by sex. The oral diadochokinesis rate, which is related to the speed of articulation, is affected by voice on/off, mandibular opening/closing, and range of motion. In contrast, the second formant slope was less affected by these factors. These results suggest that the maximum isometric tongue strength is associated with tongue movement speed during articulation."
https://openalex.org/W4220707448,"The influence of compaction methods such as the Marshall compaction method (MCM), vibration compaction method (VCM) and gyration compaction method (GCM), on the performance of stone mastic asphalt (SMA-13) mixture has yet to be explored. Therefore, to compare the influences of compaction methods and work on the physical and mechanical properties of SMA-13 mixture, the volume parameters, mechanical properties, and gradation changes of SMA-13 mixture specimens prepared under different vibration compaction times, Marshall double-compaction numbers, and gyration compaction numbers were studied. The compaction method for SMA-13 mixture design was also proposed under the principle of optimum properties. Results demonstrate that the asphalt aggregate ratio and compaction work directly affect the volumetric properties (VV, VFA, and VMA) of asphalt mixture specimens while the raw material and mineral aggregate gradation were fixed. The influence of compaction work on physical properties is greater than that of asphalt aggregate ratio. The mechanical strength of VCM and GCM specimens is higher than that of MCM specimens under the same compaction work and the optimum asphalt aggregate ratio. With the increase in compaction work, the mechanical properties of SMA-13 mixture are improved at the same compaction method and the optimum asphalt aggregate ratio. The aggregate gradation of the SMA-13 mixture before and after compacted using VCM and GCM changes minimally compared with that of the SMA-13 mixture compacted by MCM. Thus, the compaction methods of VCM65 and GCM130 were recommended for SMA-13 mixture design."
https://openalex.org/W4220767464,"We analyzed data from a cohort of Black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) in order to identify correlates of prevalent and incident incarceration, including potential predictors related to their status as sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). Baseline and follow-up self-administered survey data were examined from Los Angeles County participants’ ages 18–45 years at enrollment who were either HIV negative or living with HIV, but recruited to over represent men who used drugs and men with unsuppressed HIV infection. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to identify predictors of baseline incarceration history and of incident incarceration over study follow-up among 440 and 338 participants, respectively. Older age, Black race, low socioeconomic status, homelessness, stimulant use, and depression symptoms were associated with baseline incarceration history. The only SGM-related factor associated with baseline incarceration history was having experienced violence based on sexual orientation identity. Just one statistically significant, independent positive predictor of incident incarceration was identified: prior incarceration, whereas having four or more friends that could lend money was a statistically significant protective factor against incident incarceration. Fundamental Cause Theory provides a useful framework to explain identified predictors of incarceration. Addressing poverty, housing instability, inadequate access to health care, and their root causes is critical to reducing incarceration rates in this population, as is expanded access to both diversion and anti-recidivism programs and to evidence-based treatment for stimulant use disorders."

Understanding tourists' perceptions of their environmental knowledge can help plan actions to prevent natural capital loss necessary for local economies. Tourists' perceptions of a touristic hotspot, Holbox Island, were documented. Surveys demonstrated that tourists are aware of their environmental impacts and are interested in minimizing these. Results were compared with results on Bocas del Toro, Panama. Tourists' perceptions had similarities among sites driven by similarities in tourists' populations with a common geographic origin. Tourists lack site-specific knowledge to steer them towards environmentally conscious decisions in both regions. Findings suggest the need to promote local actions to gain tourists' understanding about their destination and support education programs on island conservation. Addressing these needs can help build resilience to overcome the adverse socio-environmental effects of tourism, environmental disasters, and health crises as COVID-19 on small islands."

Development included multi-informant-reported externalizing behavior, internalizing problems, prosocial behavior, delinquency, and substance use. Growth curve models revealed that, dependent on the informant, time in a daycare center was related to increased externalizing and internalizing problems until at least age 11. It was not related to delinquency. Roughly three days per week at a daycare mother or playgroup was related to increased externalizing behavior. External family care was associated with increased prosocial behavior. Finally, time in a daycare center was associated with fewer externalizing but more internalizing problems and substance use for children from vulnerable backgrounds. This relation with substance use lasted to age 20."

https://openalex.org/W4220895057,"The probe technology described in this paper facilitates detection and discrimination of multiple targets in a single fluorescent channel during PCR. This provides a strategy for doubling the number of targets that can be analysed simultaneously on existing PCR instruments. These probes are referred to as PlexProbes and produce fluorescence that can be switched 'on' or 'off' in the presence of target by manipulating the temperature. During PCR, fluorescence can be measured at multiple temperatures allowing discrimination of specific targets at defined temperatures. In a single fluorescent channel, a model duplex assay allowed either real-time or endpoint detection of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) at 52°C and end-point detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) at 74°C. Using this model system, as few as 40 copies of each specific target could be detected as single infection or co-infection, regardless of the presence or absence of the other target. A PlexProbe prototype assay for sexually transmitted infections (PP-STI) which simultaneously enables detection and differentiation of six targets using only three fluorescent channels was then constructed and evaluated. The PP-STI assay detects GC (2 gene targets), CT, Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and an internal control (IC). To evaluate assay performance, a panel of archived clinical samples (n = 337) were analysed using PP-STI and results compared to those obtained with a commercially available diagnostic assay. The overall agreement between results obtained with the PP-STI assay and the reference test was greater than 99.5%. PlexProbes offer a method of detecting more targets from a single diagnostic test, empowering physicians to make evidence-based treatment decisions while conserving time, labour, sample volume and reagent costs."
https://openalex.org/W4220914698,"Queen conch are among the most economically, socially, and culturally important fishery resources in the Caribbean. Despite a multitude of fisheries management measures enacted across the region, populations are depleted and failing to recover. It is believed that queen conch are highly susceptible to depensatory processes, impacting reproductive success and contributing to the lack of recovery. We developed a model of reproductive dynamics to evaluate how variations in biological factors such as population density, movement speeds, rest periods between mating events, scent tracking, visual perception of conspecifics, sexual facilitation, and barriers to movement affect reproductive success and overall reproductive output. We compared simulation results to empirical observations of mating and spawning frequencies from conch populations in the central Bahamas and Florida Keys. Our results confirm that low probability of mate finding associated with decreased population density is the primary driver behind observed breeding behavior in the field, but is insufficient to explain observed trends. Specifically, sexual facilitation coupled with differences in movement speeds and ability to perceive conspecifics may explain the observed lack of mating at low densities and differences between mating frequencies in the central Bahamas and Florida Keys, respectively. Our simulations suggest that effective management strategies for queen conch should aim to protect high-density reproductive aggregations and critical breeding habitats."

https://openalex.org/W4221127683,"Glucocorticoids exert their pleiotropic effects by activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is expressed throughout the body. GR-mediated transcription is regulated by a multitude of tissue- and cell type-specific mechanisms, including interactions with other transcription factors such as the androgen receptor (AR). We previously showed that the transcription of canonical glucocorticoid-responsive genes is dependent on active androgen signaling, but the extent of this glucocorticoid-androgen crosstalk warrants further investigation. In this study, we investigated the overall glucocorticoid-androgen crosstalk in the hepatic transcriptome. Male mice were exposed to GR agonist corticosterone and AR antagonist enzalutamide in order to determine the extent of androgen-dependency after acute and chronic exposure. We found that a substantial proportion of the hepatic transcriptome is androgen-dependent after chronic exposure, while after acute exposure the transcriptomic effects of glucocorticoids are largely androgen-independent. We propose that prolonged glucocorticoid exposure triggers a gradual upregulation of AR expression, instating a situation of androgen dependence which is likely not driven by direct AR-GR interactions. This indirect mode of glucocorticoid-androgen interaction is in accordance with the absence of enriched AR DNA-binding near AR-dependent corticosterone-regulated genes after chronic exposure. In conclusion, we demonstrate that glucocorticoid effects and their interaction with androgen signaling are dependent on the duration of exposure and believe that our findings contribute to a better understanding of hepatic glucocorticoid biology in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4220657185,"Background During the COVID-19 surge in Taiwan, the Far East Memorial Hospital established a system including a centralized quarantine unit and triage admission protocol to facilitate acute care surgical inpatient services, prevent nosocomial COVID-19 infection and maintain the efficiency and quality of health care service during the pandemics. Materials and methods This retrospective cohort study included patients undergoing acute care surgery. The triage admission protocol was based on rapid antigen tests, Liat ® PCR and RT-PCT tests. Type of surgical procedure, patient characteristics, and efficacy indices of the centralized quarantine unit and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed before (Phase I: May 11 to July 2, 2021) and after (Phase II: July 3 to July 31, 2021) the system started. Results A total of 287 patients (105 in Phase I and 182 in Phase II) were enrolled. Nosocomial COVID-19 infection occur in 27 patients in phase I but zero in phase II. More patients received traumatological, orthopedic, and neurologic surgeries in phase II than in phase I. The patients’ surgical risk classification, median total hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, intraoperative blood loss, operation time, and the number of patients requiring postoperative ICU care were similar in both groups. The duration of ED stay and waiting time for acute care surgery were longer in Phase II (397 vs. 532 minutes, p &lt; 0.0001). The duration of ED stay was positively correlated with the number of surgical patients visiting the ED (median = 66 patients, Spearman’s ρ = 0.207) and the occupancy ratio in the centralized quarantine unit on that day (median = 90.63%, Spearman’s ρ = 0.191). Conclusions The triage admission protocol provided resilient quarantine needs and sustainable acute care surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The efficiency was related to the number of medical staff dedicated to the centralized quarantine unit and number of surgical patients visited in ED."
https://openalex.org/W4220710467,"HIV-1 encodes accessory proteins that neutralize antiviral restriction factors to ensure its successful replication. One accessory protein, the HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif), is known to promote ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the antiviral restriction factor apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G), a cytosine deaminase that leads to hypermutations in the viral DNA and subsequent aberrant viral replication. We have previously demonstrated that the HIV-1 viral transcription mediator Tat activates the host progrowth PI-3-AKT pathway, which in turn promotes HIV-1 replication. Because the HIV-1 Vif protein contains the putative AKT phosphorylation motif RMRINT, here we investigated whether AKT directly phosphorylates HIV-1 Vif to regulate its function. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that AKT and Vif interact with each other, supporting this hypothesis. Using in vitro kinase assays, we further showed that AKT phosphorylates Vif at threonine 20, which promotes its stability, as Vif becomes destabilized after this residue is mutated to alanine. Moreover, expression of dominant-negative kinase-deficient AKT as well as treatment with a chemical inhibitor of AKT increased K48-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIV-1 Vif. In contrast, constitutively active AKT (Myr-AKT) reduced K48-ubiquitination of Vif to promote its stability. Finally, inhibition of AKT function restored APOBEC3G levels, which subsequently reduced HIV-1 infectivity. Thus, our results establish a novel mechanism of HIV-1 Vif stabilization through AKT-mediated phosphorylation at threonine 20, which reduces APOBEC3G levels and potentiates HIV-1 infectivity."

In Study 1 nationally representative cross-sectional data (N = 4249) reveals that right-leaning news consumption is associated with more right-leaning attitudes, and left-leaning news consumption is associated with more left-leaning attitudes. Additional three-wave longitudinal data (N = 484) in Study 2 reveals that right-leaning news is positively (and left-leaning news is negatively) associated with right-leaning issue stances three months later, even after controlling for prior issue stances. In a third (supplemental) study (N = 305), random assignment to right-leaning (but not left-leaning) news ( vs . control) experimentally fostered more right-leaning stances, regardless of participants’ previously held political ideology. These findings suggest that partisan news, and particularly right-leaning news, can polarize consumers in their sociopolitical positions, sharpen political divides, and shape public policy."

Our previous studies have demonstrated that prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) suppresses BLV-specific Th1 responses and contributes to the disease progression during BLV infection. Although PGE 2 reportedly plays important roles in the induction of parturition, PGE 2 involvement in immune suppression during parturition is unknown. To investigate its involvement, we analyzed PGE 2 kinetics and Th1 responses in BLV-infected pregnant cattle. PGE 2 concentrations in sera were increased, whereas IFN-γ responses were decreased before delivery. PGE 2 is known to suppress Th1 immune responses in cattle. Thus, these data suggest that PGE 2 upregulation inhibits Th1 responses during parturition. We also found that estradiol was important for PGE 2 induction in pregnant cattle. In vitro analyses indicated that estradiol suppressed IFN-γ production, at least in part, via PGE 2 /EP4 signaling. In vivo analyses showed that estradiol administration significantly influenced the induction of PGE 2 production and impaired Th1 responses. Our data suggest that estradiol-induced PGE 2 is involved in the suppression of Th1 responses during pregnancy and parturition in cattle, which could contribute to the progression of BLV infection."

Their dysfunction in early pregnancy is closely related to pregnancy-related diseases, including recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Epigenetic modifications dynamically change during pregnancy; however, the role of the epigenetic modifier UHRF1 in trophoblast regulation remains unknown. This is the first study to show that UHRF1 expression was localized in the cytoplasm of cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, and villi columns, and decreased in the villi of patients with RPL. The invasion and cell viability in a UHRF1 knockdown trophoblast cell line were significantly decreased. In addition, the mRNA expression profiles of Swan71 cells were partially altered by UHRF1 knockdown. The altered immune-related genes were screened out and the pro-inflammatory TH1-type chemokine/cytokines CXCL2 and IL-1β were identified as the most promising targets of UHRF1 in the trophoblasts, which were significantly increased in the UHRF1 knockdown Swan71 cells, villi, and serum from patients with RPL. The macrophages treated with the supernatants of UHRF1 knockdown Swan71 cells were polarized to the M1 phenotype and secreted high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which might be driven by the activated MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway and mediated by the increased expression of CXCR2 and IL-1R1 (CXCL2 and IL-1β receptors, respectively). In addition, the supernatants of UHRF1 knockdown Swan71 cells showed stronger chemotaxis to macrophages than those from the controls. Our findings highlight the previously unknown roles of UHRF1 as one of the key regulators on the trophoblasts and their cross-talk with local immune cells, and demonstrate a potential approach for RPL intervention."
