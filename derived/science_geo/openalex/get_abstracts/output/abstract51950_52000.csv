https://openalex.org/W1537777030,"Abstract An enzyme that hydrolyzes di-N-acetylchitobiose linkages in oligosaccharides and glycoproteins was purified to homogeneity from cultural filtrates of Streptomyces griseus. The molecular weight of the enzyme, determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis, is 27,200 ± 200, and it appears to consist of a single polypeptide chain. This apparent endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase was completely stable at 37° for at least 48 hours and resistant to inactivation by several proteolytic enzymes. Treatment of Asn-(GlcNAc)2(Man)6, Asn-(GlcNAc)2(Man)6(GlcNAc)2, and (GlcNAc)2(Man)6(Glc-NAc)2 with the enzyme yielded Asn-GlcNAc + (GlcNAc)1-(Man)6, Asn-GlcNAc + (GlcNAc)1(Man)6(GlcNAc)2, and GlcNAc + (GlcNAc)1(Man)6(GlcNAc)2, respectively. The [3H]dansyl-Asn derivatives, which were rapidly hydrolyzed also, were used as substrates to assay the enzyme. Similar findings obtained with specific glycoproteins are described in the accompanying paper (Tarentino, A. L., Plummer, T. H., Jr., and Maley, F. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 818–824). Asn-(GlcNAc)2(Man)1 was not hydrolyzed by this enzyme but was hydrolyzed by another apparent endo-β-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase. The latter could be separated from the Asn-(GlcNAc)2(Man)6 hydrolyzing endoglycosidase by Sephadex G-100 chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1554237512,"The autoxidation of dithiothreitol, 2-mercaptoethanol, reduced glutathione, and ethyl mercaptan has been seen to involve the univalent reduction of oxygen. The superoxide radicals, so generated, were detected by their ability to reduce p-nitroblue tetrazolium to a formazan and by the inhibition of this reaction by superoxide dismutase. The rate of autoxidation of these thiols and the sensitivity of the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium to inhibition by superoxide dismutase were both augmented, as the pH was raised from 7.8 to 10.2. These results, lead to the proposal that thiols reduce nitroblue tetrazolium by at least two different pathways, one of which involves O2- and is therefore inhibitable by superoxide dismutase."

Chem. 249, 811–817) was tested for its capacity to hydrolyze oligosaccharides from various glycoproteins. A complete and rapid release of oligosaccharide was effected from sulfitolyzed ovalbumin, bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease A, and ribonuclease B, and an invertase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These glycoproteins all contain a neutral oligosaccharide that is attached to the protein by a glycosyl asparagine bond and has the following composition: Asn-(GlcNAc)2(Man)x(GlcNAc)y. Analysis of the hydrolysis products revealed that the N-acetylglucosamine residue of di-N-acetylchitobiose distal to the asparagine is on the reducing end of the oligosaccharide, whereas the proximal N-acetylglucosamine remains with the protein. Neither the enzymatic properties nor the circular dichroic patterns of ribonuclease B and deoxyribonuclease A were altered significantly by the removal of their respective oligosaccharides. However, the elution of ribonuclease B from IRC-50 was changed, as was the electrophoretic mobility of deoxyribonuclease. Treatment of proteins that contain both neutral and acidic oligosaccharides, such as thyroglobulin, immunoglobulin M, and porcine ribonuclease, resulted in the release of the neutral chains only. A marked increase in the release of oligosaccharides from immunoglobulin M was effected by 2-mercaptoethanol. Removal of the neutral oligosaccharides did not appear to affect the immunological properties of this immunoglobulin."
https://openalex.org/W1602641723,"Abstract An α-d-galactosyl binding lectin was purified from Bandeiraea simplicifolia seeds by affinity chromatography. Melibiose was oxidized to the corresponding aldonic acid, and condensed with aminoethyl-Bio-Gel P-300 in the presence of a water-soluble carbodiimide to afford a specific adsorbent which retained B erythrocyte hemagglutinating activity from the seed extract. Elution with galactose-containing buffer displaced the bound lectin which appeared homogeneous by disc gel electrophoresis, pH 4.3, immunoelectrophoresis, gel filtration, and sedimentation analysis. Multiple bands were obtained upon electrophoresis at pH 9.5 and isoelectric focusing. The lectin (mol wt 114,000) is composed of four apparently identical subunits and contains 6.7% by weight carbohydrate (mannose, glucosamine, fucose, and xylose). A metalloprotein, the lectin requires Ca2+ for hemagglutinating activity. Amino acid analysis revealed a high content of acidic and hydroxylic amino acids, only trace amounts of methionine, and one cysteine per subunit. Modification of cysteine with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) resulted in complete loss of hemagglutinating activity. Inactivation was partially reversible upon reduction with dithiothreitol. The lectin agglutinates B and AB erythrocytes very strongly, A1 cells weakly, and does not agglutinate A2 or O cells. Polysaccharides and glycoproteins with terminal, nonreducing α-d-galactosyl residues reacted with the lectin to form precipitin bands by Ouchterlony double diffusion, whereas those with terminal β-d-galactosyl residues did not (the galactomannan of Torulopsis gropengiesseri excepted). Polysaccharide precipitating activity of the lectin exhibited an unusually broad pH optimum (6.0 to 11.0), was inhibited by EDTA, destroyed by dialysis of the lectin against acetic acid to remove bound metal, and restored by addition of a divalent metal cation. Glycosides of α-d-galactopyranose were the best inhibitors examined by the hapten inhibition technique. Interestingly, UDP-galactose was shown to inhibit polysaccharide precipitation. Lactose, l-arabinose, d-fucose, d-glucose, and d-mannose were noninhibitory. We suggest that Bandeirae simplicifolia lectin, the first α-d-galactopyranosyl binding lectin (anti-B lectin) to be purified and characterized, will be valuable not only as a serological reagent, but in studies of polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and cell membrane structure."

The resin is sequestered by the larva upon feeding, and stored in two compressible diverticular pouches of the foregut. The fluid is effectively deterrent to predators. The defensive use by an insect of a plant resin provides an instance of secondary utilization by a herbivore of the protective chemical weaponry of its host."
https://openalex.org/W1808949860,"Abstract The application of carbon 13 nuclear magnetic resonance to analysis of some phosphorylated acetamidohexose-containing meningococcal polysaccharides is described. A complete assignment of the spectra of both the serogroup A and X polysaccharides has been made. In addition the spectrum of a structurally related 1 →6-α-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose phosphate polysaccharide from Staphylococcus lactis NCTC 2102 has also been completely assigned. This has resulted in the structural elucidation of the serogroup X polysaccharide as a homopolymer of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose, linked by 1→4-α-phosphodiester bonds. In addition, the O-acetyl substituents of the serogroup A polysaccharide have been located at C-3 of approximately 70% of the repeating units (1→6-α-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-mannopyranose phosphate) of the homopolymer. Preliminary conformational information was also obtained from the large three-bond couplings between 31P and 13C (3J3131p-1313c), indicative of highly extended backbone formations."
https://openalex.org/W1602387907,"Abstract Physical, chemical, and enzymatic properties of the protein which binds epidermal growth factor (EGF) have been examined. A molecular weight of 29,300 was determined from sedimentation equilibrium studies, in agreement with a value of 30,000 calculated from the s020, w (2.83 S) and D020, w (8.73 x 10-7 cm2 s-1). It has an E1%1 cm at 280 nm of 15.6 and the isoelectric point is 5.6. The circular dichroic spectrum indicates a major nonhelical character with a minor amount of α helical structure. The amino acid composition was determined. No free sulfhydryl groups were detected. Hexosamine analysis revealed the presence of glucosamine and galactosamine. EGF-binding protein was found to be an arginine esterase with a restricted substrate specificity. Kinetic studies of the catalytic hydrolysis of Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester revealed a Km of 130 µm and a pH optimum in the range of pH 7.8 to 8.5, where the specific activity is approximately 390 µmoles per min per mg. This arginine esterase is not identical, but is related antigenically, to the arginine esterases associated with the nerve growth factor complex. The EGF-binding protein is postulated to function in the enzymatic liberation of active EGF from an inactive precursor."

https://openalex.org/W1545094817,"Abstract An endonuclease that attacks double stranded DNA, into which apurinic sites have been introduced previously, has been purified 830-fold from calf thymus cell extracts. The nuclease has a pH optimum at 8.5, is strongly stimulated by the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, and has a molecular weight of 32,000 ± 3,000. In double stranded circular DNA molecules containing a small number of apurinic sites, 0.9 to 1.0 chain scission per site is introduced by the enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of single strand breaks in DNA, adjacent to the apurinic sites. It does not attack native DNA, alkali-denatured DNA, single-stranded DNA containing apurinic sites, or RNA. Enzymatic incisions are apparently introduced at the 3' side of apurinic residues in DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1581581849,"Abstract Hepatocytes prepared from the livers of 18- or 19-day-old chick embryos and maintained in culture medium containing serum for 3 days exhibited marked induction of the lipogenic pathway. Incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into fatty acids and the total activities of malic enzyme, fatty acid synthetase, and ATP-citrate lyase increased by 1000-, 47-, 21-, and 4.5-fold, respectively. When l-triiodothyronine was added to the culture medium, the activities increased a total of 2500-, 140-, 40-, and 8-fold, respectively. The increases in the rate of fatty acid synthesis and total activity of malic enzyme were inhibited by bovine serum albumin, human thyroxin-binding prealbumin, and rabbit anti-thyroxin serum. Inhibition was reversed by adding a large amount of l-triiodothyronine. Thus, thyroid hormone was a major serum factor causing induction of the lipogenic pathway. Oxidation of [1-14C]acetate to CO2 and the total activity of NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase were not affected by incubating the cells with or without l-triiodothyronine. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase decreased during the culture period. This induction of the lipogenesis pathway quantitatively mimics changes in the pathway which occur when newly hatched chicks are fed a high carbohydrate mash diet. Glucagon, cAMP, and free stearate also inhibited the induction of lipogenesis and its associated enzymes. These compounds also inhibit fatty acid synthesis and elevate fatty acyl-CoA levels in freshly prepared hepatocytes. Hence, glucagon and free fatty acids exert both long and short term regulation over fatty acid synthesis, possibly via changes in the intracellular concentration of fatty acyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1501346314,"Abstract Optimal conditions for biosynthesis of cystathionine with crude extracts of green plants were determined. The specific activities observed under these conditions are considerably higher than those initially detected (Giovanelli, J., and Mudd, S. H. (1966) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 25, 366), and compare favorably with those of bacterial extracts. At near saturating concentrations of homoserine esters, crude extracts of tissues representing most of the major phylogenetic divisions of green plants generally catalyze the highest rates of cystathionine synthesis in the presence of O-malonylhomoserine, intermediate rates in the presence of O-oxalyl-, O-succinyl-, and O-phosphorylhomoserine, and very low rates with O-acetylhomoserine. Green plants are unique among the organisms studied by us or other workers in their capacity to use O-phosphorylhomoserine in cystathionine synthesis. Enzymic assay systems permitting the detection of compounds capable of serving as α-aminobutyryl donors in the synthesis of cystathionine were developed, taking advantage of the fact that crude preparations of plant cystathionine γ-synthase are active with a wide range of compounds. An analogous system designed to detect O-acetylhomoserine with greater sensitivity was developed through the use of an enzyme preparation from Bacillus subtilis. An α-amino-butyryl donor was purified by ion exchange chromatography and paper electrophoresis from tissues of green plants ranging from the green alga Chlorella to the higher flowering plants. Only a single α-aminobutyryl donor was detected among these green plants. This compound was characterized as O-phosphorylhomoserine on the basis of its base stability, its behavior during ion exchange chromatography and paper electrophoresis, and a rate of hydrolysis by highly purified alkaline phosphatase that was indistinguishable from that of authentic O-phosphorylhomoserine. It is proposed that O-phosphorylhomoserine is the dominant physiological precursor of cystathionine in green plants. Some of the implications of this finding are discussed. During the course of this work, studies on the relative activity of cystathionine γ-synthase with various substrates were extended to a number of lower organisms. The patterns of substrate activity with crude extracts of a blue-green alga and Escherichia coli are very similar, and resemble the pattern for cystathionine γ-synthase of Salmonella typhimurium (Kaplan, M. M., and Flavin, M. (1966) J. Biol. Chem. 241, 4463). O-Succinylhomoserine is the most active substrate for all three organisms. Extracts of B. subtilis are most active with O-acetylhomoserine, a pattern not previously observed with bacterial cystathionine γ-synthases."
https://openalex.org/W1641486081,"Abstract Tay-Sachs disease is an inherited disorder in which β-d-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity is absent. Sandhoff's disease is a clinically identical disorder in which both hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B activity is missing. Antibodies to purified hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B have been produced in rabbits. Each antiserum was reactive against both isozymes on immunodiffusion. No hexosaminidase A antigen was present in the livers of the two Tay-Sachs disease patients and only a possible trace of antigen was found in the third case. The liver from one patient with Sandoff's disease contained both hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B antigens, even though no enzymatic activity was present, whereas the liver from the other patient with Sandhoff's disease contained only hexosaminidase A antigen. We suggest that hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B share a common subunit and the other subunit in the two hexosaminidases may be different."

Folate compounds in L. casei were identified as reduced derivatives of PteGlu9 (∼19%), of PteGlu8 (∼42%), of PteGlu7 (∼14%), and PteGlu6 (∼8%); in S. faecalis as reduced derivatives of PteGlu5 (∼24%), of PteGlu4 (∼61%), and PteGlu3 (∼4%). After treatment of cell extracts with hog kidney conjugase ∼39% of folate compounds in L. casei were converted to tetrahydrofolic acid (H4PteGlu), ∼26% to 5-methyl-H4PteGlu and ∼10% to 5- and 10-formyl-H4PteGlu; in the case of S. faecalis ∼25% were converted to H4PteGlu and ∼45% to 5- and 10-formyl-H4PteGlu. No 5-methyl-H4PteGlu derivatives could be found in S. faecalis. Simple methods for the preparation and separation of the biologically active forms of 5-methyl-[3H]H4PteGlu and 5-formyl-[3H]H4PteGlun (n = 1 to 9 glutamic acid residues) with a high specific radioactivity are described.

https://openalex.org/W1574440719,"Abstract In the sarcoplasmic reticulum of individual rabbits, calsequestrin usually is observed as a single peptide in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (Form 1). In some rabbits calsequestrin (Form 2) is found with a molecular weight 6% less than that of Form 1. In still other rabbits the two forms coexist in equal amounts. Form 2 is not a degradation product of Form 1 since mixing of muscle types before homogenization does not lead to breakdown of Form 1. Sarcoplasmic reticulum containing Form 2 calsequestrin is increased in its capacity for binding and transport of Ca2+. Form 2 calsequestrin has been highly purified and has Ca2+-binding capacity equal to Form 1. Amino acid analyses of Forms 1 and 2 indicate close similarity with differences in the content of tyrosine, cysteine, and methionine. Peptide maps of chymotryptic digests also show similarity but indicate two differences in peptide classes. Chicken antibodies against rabbit calsequestrin Form 1 also precipitate calsequestrin Form 2 and precipitin lines in Ouchterlony plates are confluent. Initial genetic studies indicate that inheritance of Form 2 calsequestrin is complex."
https://openalex.org/W1511282561,"Abstract The synthesis of polyribitol phosphate by polyribitol phosphate polymerase from Staphylococcus aureus H proceeds by a single chain mechanism so that the enzyme completes a chain of approximately 30 units linked to lipoteichoic acid carrier, before starting a new chain. The lipoteichoic acid carrier of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis are interchangeable and can be used both for the synthesis of polyglycerolphosphate or polyribitol phosphate. Both of these polymers appear to be attached to the same site on the lipoteichoic acid carrier. Lipoteichoic acid carrier, active with the S. aureus polyribitolphosphate polymerase can be extracted from Bacillus licheniformis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus faecalis, and Mycobacterium phlei but not from a variety of other microorganisms. No evidence has been found for the involvement of an additional carrier such as undecaprenol phosphate in polyribitol phosphate synthesis."

Kinetic, chemical, and immunochemical studies of the highly purified enzymes from two trzA mutants prove that both strains bear mutant alleles for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A. A third trzA mutant contains a heat-labile enzyme. Little or no material cross-reacting with antibody to wild type O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A could be detected in three trzB mutants or in the trzA deletion examined. Since trzA is clearly the structural gene for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A, we suggest that the designation, cysK, seems more appropriate for this locus. The lack of any demonstrable growth requirement for cysteine in trz mutants, which completely lack O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A, indicates that the synthesis of cysteine from O-acetyl-l-serine and sulfide can be catalyzed by another enzyme in S. typhimurium."
https://openalex.org/W1566877270,Abstract The extent and rate of cross-linking of diaminopimelic acid in the peptidoglycan of Bacillus megaterium have been determined by a new procedure. The method is based on the reaction of nitrous acid with the unprotected amino groups of non-cross-linked diaminopimelic acid. Pulse label experiments in a mutant where diaminopimelic acid is incorporated specifically into peptidoglycan demonstrated that the cross-linking reaction continued for many minutes after incorporation of precursor subunits into peptidoglycan. The method has been used to demonstrate the sensitivity of the cross-linking reaction to penicillin in vivo. Models for assembly of peptidoglyan are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W2125487072,"SUMMARY Carboxypeptidase A treated with diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP) present at catalytic levels causes the complete inactivation of thymidylate synthetase. The rate of this inactivation is shown to be proportional to the concentration of carboxypeptidase A-DFP. Carboxypeptidase B-DFP also inactivates thymidylate synthetase, but at a much slower rate than carboxypeptidase A-DFP. That the inactivation of thymidylate synthetase observed was due solely to carboxypeptidase activity was illustrated as follows: (a) carboxypeptidase A-DFP and carboxypeptidase B-DFP samples were found to exhibit no chymotryptic or tryptic activity; (b) when present in equal molar ratios (2: 1) with respect to thymidylate synthetase, carboxypeptidase A-DFP caused total inactivation of thymidylate synthetase after 2’7 min of incubation, while less than 10% inactivation of the enzyme was found after 2 hours of incubation with either chymotrypsin or trypsin; (c) the presence of 5 x lop5 M L-benzylsuccinic acid, a potent competitive inhibitor of carboxypeptidase A, was sufficient to prevent both the carboxypeptidase A and the carboxypeptidase B-dependent inactivation of thymidylate synthetase. Native thymidylate synthetase and carboxypeptidase-inactivated enzyme behave in an identical fashion upon electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence and absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Results of the Stark method suggested that the COOHterminal residue of thymidylate synthetase is either valine or phenylalanine. High voltage electrophoresis performed on incubation mixtures of thymidylate synthetase and carboxypeptidase A-DFP indicated that valine was rapidly released, followed by alanine. Analysis of the amino acids released by the carboxypeptidase A-DFP treatment of thymidylate synthetase in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate gave 1.76 moles of valine and 2.00 moles of alanine per mole of enzyme. Analysis of the amino acids released by the carboxypeptidase A-DFP treatment of native thymidylate synthetase as a function of the extent of inactivation showed that only valine was released under these conditions and that total inactivation corresponded closely to the release of 1 mole of valine per mole of thymidylate synthetase. These results are considered in light of the fact that thymidylate synthetase is thought to be composed of"

The fractions were analyzed for amino acid composition by standard methods and also by enzymatic digestion with a protease followed by carboxypeptidase C and aminopeptidase M. The three minor fractions differ in composition from each other and from the main fraction. The differences from the main fraction are least for Fraction IIIB and greatest for Fraction IIIA, following the terminology of Nakhleh ((1972) Ph.D. thesis, American University of Beirut). Analyses of peptide fragments from Fraction IIIB confirm the distinction from the main component (Fraction IV) based on over-all analysis. In addition to the long suspected differences in amide content these results reveal other compositional differences and establish the genetic multiplicity of the myoglobin in an individual sperm whale specimen. The observed variations are comparable in degree to those seen among the main components represented in distinct animal species."

https://openalex.org/W1532911648,"Abstract DNA-RNA hybridization-competition studies indicate that there are six temporal classes of RNA produced during the infection of Bacillus subtilis by bacteriophage SP82. Class 1 RNA is produced between approximately 3 and 7 min after infection. The synthesis of Classes 2 and 3 begins between 4 and 5 min and ceases approximately 13 and 17 min after infection, respectively. Class 4 RNA is produced from 4 to 5 min after infection to the time of lysis (36 min at 37°). Synthesis of Classes 5 and 6 begins at approximately 7 and 13 min, respect vely, and continues to lysis. Class 1 and one or more of the other early classes are produced when bacteria are infected in the presence of chloramphenicol; late RNA classes are not synthesized. Competition-hybridization has also been used to analyze the RNA synthesized in vitro from SP82 DNA by RNA polymerase isolated from uninfected cells and by polymerase extracted from SP82-infected cells. The products made by uninfected cell polymerase are completely competed by RNA isolated from cells infected in the presence of chloramphenicol. RNA synthesized in vitro by polymerase from infected cells is only partially competed by chloramphenicol RNA. Experiments with competitor RNAs isolated at various times after phage infection indicate that uninfected cell polymerase transcribes in vitro those DNA sequences which are expressed in vivo early in infection; polymerase from infected cells transcribes other sequences as well."
https://openalex.org/W1581797726,"Abstract l-Lysine monooxygenase has been isolated in nearly pure form from a lysine adapted strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens. The enzyme, which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of l-lysine to form δ-aminovaleramide, has a molecular weight of approximately 246,000, and contains four subunits of equal size and four FAD prosthetic groups. Enzymic activity is greatly inhibited by a variety of buffers at low lysine concentrations, while at saturating l-lysine levels, this sensitivity is lost, and buffers have very little effect on the activity. The absorption spectrum is typical of a simple flavoprotein, with absorption maxima at 276, 385, and 462 nm. Two electron equivalents per mole are required to completely reduce the enzyme-bound flavin by dithionite, indicating that FAD is the only electron acceptor associated with the enzyme. During the course of reduction by dithionite, the semiquinone form of the flavin is produced. The ionization state of this species is a function of pH, with red or anionic semiquinone seen at pH values above 8 and the blue or neutral form at pH 5.5. l-Lysine monooxygenase, then, is one of the few flavoproteins exhibiting a pK near neutrality for the semiquinone oxidation state. The fluorescence properties of this enzyme are also unusual in that while the oxidized state is practically devoid of visible fluorescence, the reduced state exhibits flavin fluorescence, with an emission maximum at 505 nm and an excitation maximum at 360 nm. This reduced enzyme fluorescence is quenched by the addition of the substrates l-lysine or l-ornithine."

The reaction rates were determined at varying concentrations of either substrate at constant amounts of the other substrate. The inhibition patterns of UDP as well as the activation patterns of the activator glucose 6-phosphate toward either substrate were determined. UDP was found to act competitively when the substrate UDP-glucose was varied, and noncompetitively when glycogen was the varied substrate, while glucose 6-phosphate showed an intersecting pattern toward glycogen and an equilibrium ordered pattern toward UDP-glucose. The reciprocal plots were found to be linear in all cases. On the basis of the results, it is concluded that glycogen synthase D from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes has a rapid equilibrium random bi-bi mechanism, in which the attachment of the activator glucose 6-phosphate is a necessary prerequisite for the addition of the substrate UDP-glucose (and UDP in the reverse reaction)."
https://openalex.org/W1576062866,"Abstract In Pseudomonas putida, two induced catabolic pathways, from hydroxyproline and from d-glucarate, converge at a common step, dehydrogenation of α-ketoglutaric semialdehyde to α-ketoglutarate. The dehydrogenases respectively induced by hydroxyproline or glucarate were both purified to homogeneity and compared. In contrast to an earlier, more limited comparison, which revealed no reliable difference between them, detailed electrophoretic, structural, immunological, and genetic studies now show them to be distinct proteins, although closely similar in most kinetic properties studied, as well as in molecular weight, subunit status, and amino acid composition. An unexpected finding was the presence of enzymatic activity for the preceding step in the hydroxyproline pathway (Δ1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate deaminase) associated with both the glucarate-induced and hydroxyproline-induced dehydrogenases. In each enzyme, the finding of a 4- to 5-fold lower number of separable tryptic peptides compared with the number expected from subunit size and amino acid composition suggests possible sequence redundancy but needs further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W1580169255,"Abstract The steady state kinetic properties of l-lysine monooxygenase from Pseudomonas fluorescens have been investigated. The enzyme has been shown to exhibit both oxygenase and oxidase activity with different substrates, the oxidase activity being much less efficient. Lysine is an oxygenase-type substrate while ornithine is an oxidase-type substrate (Nakazawa, T., Hori, K. and Hayaishi, O. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 3439–3444). During steady state analysis, both substrates exhibit sigmoidal saturation curves. Hill plots for lysine and ornithine are biphasic, with the Hill coefficient n = 2.9 at low substrate concentrations and n = 1 at higher concentrations. With lysine as substrate, the reaction does not go to completion, and the per cent completion of the reaction is a function of the initial lysine concentration. e-Aminocaproic acid has been found to act as a nonsubstrate effector by permitting the reaction to reach completion. Furthermore, e-aminocaproate reduces the cooperative effect of lysine, converting the biphasic Hill plot to a monophasic one, with a Hill coefficient of 1 obtaining over most of the concentration range of lysine studied. e-Aminocaproate is also a competitive inhibitor toward lysine with a Ki of 2.6 x 10-4 m. e-N,N-Dimethyl-l-lysine is a poor substrate except in the presence of lysine, in which case the reaction proceeds with both substrates, but stops short of completion, as seen with lysine alone as substrate. These results indicate that lysine itself is an effector, and that at least two sites per flavin are important to catalysis, i.e. one catalytic site and one or more effector sites."
