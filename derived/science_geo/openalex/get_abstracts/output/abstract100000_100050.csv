https://openalex.org/W2109465247,"A strong candidate for the 17q-linked BRCA1 gene, which influences susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer, has been identified by positional cloning methods. Probable predisposing mutations have been detected in five of eight kindreds presumed to segregate BRCA1 susceptibility alleles. The mutations include an 11-base pair deletion, a 1-base pair insertion, a stop codon, a missense substitution, and an inferred regulatory mutation. The BRCA1 gene is expressed in numerous tissues, including breast and ovary, and encodes a predicted protein of 1863 amino acids. This protein contains a zinc finger domain in its amino-terminal region, but is otherwise unrelated to previously described proteins. Identification of BRCA1 should facilitate early diagnosis of breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility in some individuals as well as a better understanding of breast cancer biology."

https://openalex.org/W2078310394,"Flux of substrate and charge mediated by three cloned excitatory amino acid transporters widely expressed in human brain were studied in voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes. Superfusion of L-glutamate or D-aspartate resulted in currents due in part to electrogenic Na+ cotransport, which contributed 1 net positive charge per transport cycle. A significant additional component of the currents was due to activation of a reversible anion flux that was not thermodynamically coupled to amino acid transport. The selectivity sequence of this ligand-activated conductance was NO3- > 1- > Br- > Cl- > F-. The results suggest that these proteins mediate both transporter- and channel-like modes of permeation, providing a potential mechanism for dampening cell excitability, in addition to removal of transmitter."
https://openalex.org/W2057012057,"The manner in which presynaptic Ca2+ influx controls the release of neurotransmitter was investigated at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapse in rat cerebellar slices. Excitatory postsynaptic currents were measured using whole-cell voltage clamp, and changes in presynaptic Ca2+ influx were determined with the Ca(2+)-sensitive dye furaptra. We manipulated presynaptic Ca2+ entry by altering external Ca2+ levels and by blocking Ca2+ channels with Cd2+ or with the toxins omega-conotoxin GVIA and omega-Aga-IVA. For all of the manipulations, other than the application of omega-Aga-IVA, the relationship between Ca2+ influx and release was well approximated by a power law, n approximately 2.5. When omega-Aga-IVA was applied, release appeared to be more steeply dependent on Ca2+ (n approximately 4), suggesting that omega-Aga-IVA-sensitive channels are more effective at triggering release. Based on interactive effects of toxins on synaptic currents, we conclude that multiple types of Ca2+ channels synergistically control individual release sites."
https://openalex.org/W1987175626,"The glial cells missing (gcm) gene in Drosophila encodes a novel nuclear protein that is transiently expressed early in the development of nearly all glia. In loss-of-function gcm mutant alleles, nearly all glia fail to differentiate, and, where we can follow them in the PNS, are transformed into neurons. In gain-if-function gcm conditions using transgenic constructs that drive ectopic gcm expression, many presumptive neurons are transformed into glia. Thus, gcm appears to function as a binary genetic switch for glia versus neurons. In the presence of gcm protein, presumptive neurons become glia, while in its absence, presumptive glia become neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2115940913,"We show that beta forms of Neu differentiation factor (NDF), homologous to acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity, glial growth factor, and heregulin, prevent apoptotic death and stimulate DNA synthesis of the E14 Schwann cell precursor, an early cell in the rat Schwann cell lineage. When precursors are exposed to NDF in defined medium, they generate Schwann cells without the requirement for DNA synthesis and with a time course that is similar to that with which Schwann cells appear in embryonic nerves in vivo. Furthermore, a neuronal signal that also mediates precursor survival and maturation is blocked by the extracellular domain of the ErbB4 NDF receptor, a protein that specifically blocks the action of NDFs. These observations provide important evidence that NDF is one of the hitherto elusive neuron-glia signaling molecules long proposed to regulate development in the Schwann cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2009598941,"In the Drosophila CNS, both neurons and glial are derived from neuroblasts. We have identified a gene, glial cells missing (gcm), that encodes a novel nuclear protein expressed transiently in early glial cells. Its mutation causes presumptive glial cells to differentiate into neurons, whereas its ectopic expression forces virtually all CNS cells to become glial cells. Thus, gcm functions as a binary switch that turns on glial fate while inhibiting default neuronal fate of the neuroblasts and their progeny. Similar results are also obtained in the PNS. Analyses of the mutant revealed that ""pioneer neurons"" can find correct pathways without glial cells and that neurons and glia have a common molecular basis for individual identity."
https://openalex.org/W2057313033,"While a number of growth factors have been described that are highly specific for particular cell lineages, neither a factor nor a receptor uniquely specific to the skeletal muscle lineage has previously been described. Here we identify a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) specific to skeletal muscle, which we term ""MuSK"" for muscle-specific kinase. MuSK is expressed at low levels in proliferating myoblasts and is induced upon differentiation and fusion. In the embryo, it is specifically expressed in early myotomes and developing muscle. MuSK is then dramatically down-regulated in mature muscle, where it remains prominent only at the neuromuscular junction; MuSK is thus the only known RTK that localizes to the neuromuscular junction. Strikingly, MuSK expression is dramatically induced throughout the adult myofiber after denervation, block of electrical activity, or physical immobilization. In humans, MuSK maps to chromosome 9q31.3-32, which overlaps with the region reported to contain the Fukuyama muscular dystrophy mutation. Identification of MuSK introduces a novel receptor-factor system that seems sure to play an important and selective role in many aspects of skeletal muscle development and function."
https://openalex.org/W2013829677,"The fusion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes in yeast is an essential process required for normal progression of the nuclear cell cycle, karyogamy, and the maintenance of an intact organellar compartment. We showed previously that this process requires a novel fusion machinery distinct from the classic membrane docking/fusion machinery containing Sec17p (alpha-SNAP) and Sec18p (NSF). Here we show that Cdc48p, a cell-cycle protein with homology to Sec18p, is required in ER fusion. A temperature-sensitive cdc48 mutant is conditionally defective in ER fusion in vitro. Addition of purified Cdc48p restores the fusion of isolated cdc48 mutant ER membranes. We propose that Cdc48p is part of an evolutionarily conserved fusion/docking machinery involved in multiple homotypic fusion events."

https://openalex.org/W2104801664,"In synaptic transmission, vesicles are proposed to dock at presynaptic active zones by the association of synaptobrevin (v-SNARE) with syntaxin (t-SNARE). We test this hypothesis in Drosophila strains lacking neural synaptobrevin (n-synaptobrevin) or syntaxin. We showed previously that loss of either protein completely blocks synaptic transmission. Here, we attempt to establish the level of this blockade. Ultrastructurally, vesicles are still targeted to the presynaptic membrane and dock normally at specialized release sites. These vesicles are mature and functional since spontaneous vesicle fusion persists in the absence of n-synaptobrevin and since vesicle fusion is triggered by hyperosmotic saline in the absence of syntaxin. We conclude that the SNARE hypothesis cannot fully explain the role of these proteins in synaptic transmission. Instead, both proteins play distinct roles downstream of docking."
https://openalex.org/W2069553229,"Golgi cisternae regrew in a cell-free system from mitotic Golgi fragments incubated with buffer alone. Pretreatment with NEM or salt washing inhibited regrowth, but this could be restored either by p97, an NSF-like ATPase, or by NSF together with SNAPs and p115, a vesicle docking protein. The morphology of cisternae regrown with p97 and NSF-SNAPs-p115 differed, suggesting that they play distinct roles in rebuilding Golgi cisternae after mitosis."

https://openalex.org/W2158764000,"The seqA gene negatively modulates replication initiation at the E. coli origin, oriC. seqA is also essential for sequestration, which acts at oriC and the dnaA promoter to ensure that replication initiation occurs exactly once per chromosome per cell cycle. Initiation is promoted by full methylation of GATC sites clustered in oriC; sequestration is specific to the hemimethylated forms generated by replication. SeqA protein purification and DNA binding are described. SeqA interacts with fully methylated oriC strongly and specifically. This reaction requires multiple molecules of SeqA and determinants throughout oriC, including segments involved in open complex formation. SeqA interacts more strongly with hemimethylated DNA; in this case, oriC and non-oriC sequences are bound similarly. Also, binding of hemimethylated oriC by membrane fractions is due to SeqA. Direct interaction of SeqA protein with the replication origin is likely to be involved in both replication initiation and sequestration."

https://openalex.org/W2090581299,Combined optical imaging and electrophysiological techniques were used to assess directly the functional nature of long-range excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions between orientation columns in area 17 of ferret visual cortex. A significant correlation was found between the layout of iso-orientation columns and the pattern of evoked synaptic inputs between cortical sites: the largest-amplitude inhibitory and excitatory synaptic responses were evoked in single neurons when stimulation and recording electrodes were located in orientation columns sharing the same angle preference. Both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses decreased in amplitude when stimulation and recording electrodes were located in orientation columns with orthogonal angle preferences. Changing the stimulus intensity altered the balance of evoked excitation and inhibition without changing the columnar specificity of inputs. These results directly demonstrate that horizontal connections modulate both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions between iso-orientation columns.
https://openalex.org/W2059572695,"When nutrients become limiting, many bacteria differentiate and become resistant to environmental stresses. For Escherichia coli, this process is mediated by the sigma s subunit of RNA polymerase. Expression of sigma s was induced by homoserine lactone, a metabolite synthesized from intermediates in threonine biosynthesis. Homoserine lactone-dependent synthesis of sigma s was prevented by overexpression of a newly identified protein, RspA. The function of homoserine lactone derivatives in many cell density-dependent phenomena and the similarity of RspA to a Streptomyces ambofaciens protein suggest that synthesis of homoserine lactone may be a general signal of starvation."
https://openalex.org/W1968233932,"We have reconstituted the fusion and assembly of vesiculated Golgi membranes (VGMs) into functionally active stacks of cisternae. A kinetic analysis of this assembly process revealed that highly dispersed VGMs of 60-90 nm diameter first fuse to form larger vesicles of 200-300 nm diameter that are clustered together. These vesicles then fuse to form tubular elements and short cisternae, which finally assemble into stacks of cisternae. We now provide evidence that the sequential stack formation from VGMs reflects two distinct fusion processes: the first event is N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM)-sensitive factor (NSF) dependent, and the second fusion event requires an NSF-like NEM-sensitive ATPase called p97. Interestingly, while the earliest steps in stack formation share some similarities with events catalyzing fusion of transport vesicles to its target membrane, neither GTP gamma S nor Rab-GDI, inhibitors of vesicular protein traffic, inhibit stack formation."
https://openalex.org/W2015664193,"Voltage-dependent sodium channels are involved in the initiation and propagation of action potentials in many excitable cells. Here we report that tipE, a gene defined by a temperature-sensitive paralytic mutation in Drosophila, encodes a novel integral membrane protein that dramatically stimulates functional expression in Xenopus oocytes of the Drosophila sodium channel alpha subunit encoded by the paralytic (para) locus. Using a heat shock promoter to control tipE+ gene expression in transgenic flies, we demonstrate that tipE+ gene expression is required during pupal development to rescue adult paralysis. In addition, we demonstrate a role for the tipE gene product in adults."

https://openalex.org/W1985683891,"Sympathetic neurons, when placed in culture during the period of naturally occurring cell death, will die by apoptosis when deprived of nerve growth factor (NGF). In this system, the mRNA levels of the BCL-2 family members decrease after NGF deprivation and during apoptosis. Sympathetic neurons from BCL-2-deficient mice died more rapidly after NGF deprivation than neurons from wild-type littermates. Sympathetic neurons of adult animals are relatively independent of NGF for survival. If sympathetic neurons are maintained in vitro for several weeks, loss of acute trophic factor dependence develops with a time course similar to that seen in the intact animal. Examination of neurons from BCL-2-deficient mice showed that BCL-2 expression is not required for the development of trophic factor independence. Therefore, BCL-2 is an important regulator of the survival of sympathetic neurons after NGF deprivation during the period of naturally occurring programmed neuronal death, but BCL-2 is not involved in the development of trophic factor independence in mature sympathetic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1993461423,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels of retinal photoreceptors and olfactory neurons are differentially activated by ligands that vary only in their purine ring structure. The nucleotide selectivity of the bovine rod cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (cGMP > cIMP >> cAMP) was significantly altered by neutralization of a single aspartic acid residue in the binding domain (cGMP > or = cAMP > cIMP). Substitution by a nonpolar residue at this position inverted agonist selectivity (cAMP >> cIMP > or = cGMP). These effects resulted from an alteration in the relative ability of the agonists to promote the allosteric conformational change associated with channel activation, not from a modification in their initial binding affinity. We propose a general mechanism for guanine nucleotide discrimination, in common with that observed in high affinity GTP-binding proteins, involving the formation of a pair of hydrogen bonds between the aspartic acid side chain and N1 and N2 of the guanine ring."
https://openalex.org/W2060895075,"c-RET is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase essential for enteric neurogenesis in mice and is involved in several human genetic disorders. RET is also one of the earliest surface markers expressed by postmigratory neural crest cells in the gut. We generated anti-RET monoclonal antibodies to isolate such cells. We find that RET+ cells are antigenically and functionally distinct from neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) characterized previously. Unlike NCSCs, which are RET- and MASH1-, most RET+ cells express MASH1. Moreover, unlike NCSCs, which are multipotent and have high proliferative capacity, many RET+ cells generate only neurons following a limited number of divisions. This behavior is observed even in the presence of glial growth factor, a polypeptide that suppresses neuronal and promotes glial differentiation by NCSCs. These data provide direct evidence for the existence of committed neuronal progenitor cells and support a model of neural crest lineage diversification by progressive restriction of developmental potential."
https://openalex.org/W2049215950,"Pax3 RNA is expressed in neural crest when Schwann cell (SC) precursors migrate to the PNS. Pax3 RNA and SC markers were monitored in sciatic nerves of mice during development and nerve repair. An inverse correlation was observed between expression of Pax3 RNA and myelin basic protein (MBP). Inverse correlation was also observed in SC primary cultures. Treating cultures with forskolin, an adenylate cyclase agonist, repressed Pax3 RNA, GFAP, NGFR, N-CAM, and L1 and elevated MBP. Subsequent microinjection with Pax3 expression vector elevated Pax3 RNA, GFAP, NGFR, N-CAM, and L1 and repressed MBP. Thus, Pax3 is likely involved in the differentiation pathway to myelinating SCs. Pax3 repressed a 1.3 kb MBP promoter fragment in cotransfection assays, suggesting that it represses MBP transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2037133878,"Sacral agenesis is a rare disorder of uncertain incidence1 that has been reported in diverse populations. Although usually sporadic and most commonly associated with maternal diabetes, there is a hereditary form which may occur in isolation or with a presacral mass (anterior meningocele and/or presacral teratoma) and anorectal abnormalities, which constitute the Currarino triad2 (MIM 176450). The radiological hallmark of hereditary sacral agenesis is a hemi-sacrum (sickle-shaped sacrum) with intact first sacral vertebra. Bowel obstruction is the usual neonatal presentation, but, unlike other neural tube defects, adult presentation is not uncommon. The major pathology is confined to the pelvic cavity and may present as a space-occupying lesion or meningitis due to ascending infection. All recurrences in families have been compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance except for those associated with the isomerism gene at Xq24–q27.1 (ref. 3). Several associated cytogenetic defects have been reported, including 7q deletions4. Previous studies failed to detect linkage to HLA markers5,6, but we now present evidence for a location on 7q36. The same region also contains a gene for holoprosencephaly, an early malformation of the extreme rostral end of the neural tube7."
https://openalex.org/W1527230752,"The murine gene encoding the GluR-B subunit of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors was characterized with respect to exon-intron organization, transcriptional start site, alternatively spliced transcripts, and adenosine to guanosine substitutions between gene and complementary DNA sequence. The GluR-B gene spans > 90 kilobase pairs and harbors 17 exons. Transcription appears to initiate approximately 430 nucleotides upstream of the translational start codon, with no intron in the 5'-untranslated region of the gene. Four alternatively spliced mRNAs are generated from the primary GluR-B transcript, two containing the modules Flip and Flop, and another two with alternate C-terminal coding sequence. The major GluR-B mRNAs in murine brain, 4 and 6 kilobase differ in the length of their 3'-untranslated region."

https://openalex.org/W2006826163,"We generated a polyclonal antibody, 12P3, specifically recognizing rat AMPA-type glutamate receptor (GluR) subunits phosphorylated at Ser-696 of GluR2 or at the homologous sites in GluR1, GluR3, and GluR4. Using 12P3, we demonstrate that a brief exposure of a rat cerebellar slice to AMPA leads to transient phosphorylation of the GluR subunits in Purkinje cell dendrites. Persistent phosphorylation over 30 min was obtained when exposure to AMPA was preceded by a 15 min perfusion of the slice with 8-bromo-cGMP, dibutyryl-cGMP, or calyculin A but not phorbol 12,13-diacetate. These results indicate that Ser-696 of GluR2, or the corresponding sites in other AMPA receptor subunits, is a specific site at which phosphorylation takes place when AMPA-type GluRs are activated by agonists, especially under the influence of certain second messenger activities."

https://openalex.org/W1552039250,"We have cloned and characterized the rat GLUT4 gene in order to identify the cis-DNA elements responsible for tissue-specific GLUT4 expression. In this study, a variety of luciferase reporter gene constructs were transiently transfected into C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes as a model for skeletal muscle differentiation. These data identified a 103-base pair fragment, located from -522 to -420 relative to the transcription initiation site, that was sufficient to account for GLUT4 C2C12 myotube-specific expression. This fragment was operationally defined as an enhancer since it conferred myotube-specific expression in the context of both the minimal native GLUT4 or the heterologous thymidine kinase promoters in an orientation-independent manner. Further, mutagenesis of this fragment demonstrated that a sequence analogous to the muscle creatine kinase myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) binding site (-466 and -457) was required for transcriptional activation. Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays demonstrated specific binding activity to the GLUT4 MEF2 sequences which directly correlated with functional expression. Although this element was capable of directing myotube-specific expression when cloned as multiple copies into luciferase reporter gene constructs, the MEF2 sequence alone was insufficient to enhance GLUT4 expression. These data demonstrated that GLUT4 muscle-specific expression is conferred by a 103-base pair DNA sequence located between -522 and -420 of rat GLUT4 gene. This region encompasses a MEF2 binding site which was necessary, but not sufficient, for transcriptional activation."

https://openalex.org/W1501329139,"Endothelial-monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP II) is a novel mediator isolated from conditioned medium of methylcholanthrene A-induced tumor cells which modulates properties of endothelial cells, mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in vitro and induces an acute inflammatory response in vivo. A synthetic peptide comprising 15 residues from the N-terminal region (residues 6-20) was shown to induce directional migration of MPs and PMNs, with half-maximal effect at approximately 200-250 pM, whereas a peptide from the C terminus of EMAP II, as well as other irrelevant peptides, were without effect. Modulation of cellular phenotype by EMAP II-derived peptide was suggested by peptide-induced elevation of cytosolic free calcium concentration in fura-2-loaded MPs and PMNs and by stimulation of peroxidase release in PMNs. Consistent with these in vitro data, EMAP II-derived N-terminal peptide-albumin conjugates injected into the mouse footpad elicited inflammatory cell tissue infiltration, whereas albumin alone or EMAP II-derived C-terminal peptide conjugated to albumin incited little response. Binding of 125I-labeled EMAP II-derived peptide (residues 12-20) to MPs was saturable (Kd approximately 200 pM) and was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of intact EMAP II and unlabeled EMAP II-derived peptides (residues 6-20 and 12-20), whereas interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor, formyl-methionyl-leucinyl-phenylalanine, or irrelevant peptides were without effect. Cross-linking of 125I-EMAP II-derived peptide (residues 12-20) by disuccinimidyl suberate to human MPs demonstrated a band, approximately 73 kDa, on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 125I-EMAP II-derived peptide also demonstrated specific binding to human PMNs and murine RAW cells. These data indicate that the N-terminal region of EMAP II defines a biologically active locus of the molecule which interacts with target cells via a potentially novel cellular receptor."

CHO fibroblasts transfected with synaptotagmin I, an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles, showed a reduced spontaneous quantal ACh release and an enhanced Ca(2+)-evoked ACh release, as compared with control cells. Biochemical and ultrastructural studies of endocytic activity using horseradish peroxidase as a marker further confirmed the inhibitory action of synaptotagmin I on spontaneous vesicular exocytosis and on elevated exocytosis induced by Ca2+. Through inhibition of exocytosis at the resting intracellular concentration of Ca2+ and removal of the inhibition upon depolarization-induced Ca2+ entry, synaptotagmin I could enhance the efficiency of excitation-secretion coupling."

https://openalex.org/W1987150096,"The activation of light-dependent K+ channels in ciliary photoreceptors from Pecten was investigated using intracellular dialysis of putative messengers and modulators. Neither elevated [Ca2+] nor BAPTA changed the membrane current in the dark or the light response. IP3 and the antagonists heparin and decavanadate were similarly ineffective, indicating that in these cells the IP3/Ca2+ signaling pathway is not crucial for phototransduction. By contrast, 8-Br-cGMP and cGMP induced an outward current accompanied by an increase in membrane conductance; 8-Br-cAMP was ineffective. The identity between the cGMP-induced and the light-induced currents is suggested by the following: both are carried by K+ and blocked by 4-AP, and both show outward rectification. In addition, guanine cyclic nucleotides depressed the photoresponse and induced single-channel currents in excised patches of light-sensitive membrane. These light-dependent channels therefore appear to represent a link between the families of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and voltage-dependent K+ channels."

This Cl- current is induced by the synergistic action of Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG) and is blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C. As a result, the current can be induced by acetylcholine through the conjoint activation of nicotinic receptors (to produce a rise in [Ca2+]i) and muscarinic receptors (to generate DAG). This demonstrates an unusual form of synergism between the two effects of a single transmitter mediated via separate receptors operating within a time scale that could be of physiological significance."
