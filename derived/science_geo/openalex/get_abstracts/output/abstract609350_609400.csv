https://openalex.org/W2800852522,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype that frequently develops resistance to chemotherapy. An unresolved question is whether resistance is caused by the selection of rare pre-existing clones or alternatively through the acquisition of new genomic aberrations. To investigate this question, we applied single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing in addition to bulk exome sequencing to profile longitudinal samples from 20 TNBC patients during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Deep-exome sequencing identified 10 patients in which NAC led to clonal extinction and 10 patients in which clones persisted after treatment. In 8 patients, we performed a more detailed study using single-cell DNA sequencing to analyze 900 cells and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze 6,862 cells. Our data showed that resistant genotypes were pre-existing and adaptively selected by NAC, while transcriptional profiles were acquired by reprogramming in response to chemotherapy in TNBC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2800311957,"A core goal of auditory neuroscience is to build quantitative models that predict cortical responses to natural sounds. Reasoning that a complete model of auditory cortex must solve ecologically relevant tasks, we optimized hierarchical neural networks for speech and music recognition. The best-performing network contained separate music and speech pathways following early shared processing, potentially replicating human cortical organization. The network performed both tasks as well as humans and exhibited human-like errors despite not being optimized to do so, suggesting common constraints on network and human performance. The network predicted fMRI voxel responses substantially better than traditional spectrotemporal filter models throughout auditory cortex. It also provided a quantitative signature of cortical representational hierarchy-primary and non-primary responses were best predicted by intermediate and late network layers, respectively. The results suggest that task optimization provides a powerful set of tools for modeling sensory systems."
https://openalex.org/W2950828985,"A vast number of different neuronal activity patterns could each induce a different set of activity-regulated genes. Mapping this coupling between activity pattern and gene induction would allow inference of a neuron’s activity-pattern history from its gene expression and improve our understanding of activity-pattern-dependent synaptic plasticity. In genome-scale experiments comparing brief and sustained activity patterns, we reveal that activity-duration history can be inferred from gene expression profiles. Brief activity selectively induces a small subset of the activity-regulated gene program that corresponds to the first of three temporal waves of genes induced by sustained activity. Induction of these first-wave genes is mechanistically distinct from that of the later waves because it requires MAPK/ERK signaling but does not require de novo translation. Thus, the same mechanisms that establish the multi-wave temporal structure of gene induction also enable different gene sets to be induced by different activity durations."

Receptor-interacting protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and RIPK3) are key arbitrators in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cell-fate regulation (Moquin and Chan, 2010Moquin D. Chan F.K. The molecular regulation of programmed necrotic cell injury.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 434-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). RIPK1 can activate the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors leading to cell proliferation and differentiation (Walczak, 2011Walczak H. TNF and ubiquitin at the crossroads of gene activation, cell death, inflammation, and cancer.Immunol. Rev. 2011; 244: 9-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it can form a cytosolic complex engaging the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8 to initiate apoptosis (Wang et al., 2008Wang L. Du F. Wang X. TNF-alpha induces two distinct caspase-8 activation pathways.Cell. 2008; 133: 693-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). In other circumstances, RIPK1 can associate with RIPK3 through RIP homotypic interaction motifs (RHIM) to form a necrosome and trigger necroptosis. Numerous features distinguish the two cell-death pathways, apoptosis versus necroptosis, including the involvement of kinase activities of RIPK1 and RIPK3 in necrosome formation (Cho et al., 2009Cho Y.S. Challa S. Moquin D. Genga R. Ray T.D. Guildford M. Chan F.K.

The discovery of small-molecule compounds (necrostatins) that block necroptotic cell death in vitro and in vivo (Degterev et al., 2005Degterev A. Huang Z. Boyce M. Li Y. Jagtap P. Mizushima N. Cuny G.D. Mitchison T.J. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. Chemical inhibitor of nonapoptotic cell death with therapeutic potential for ischemic brain injury.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar) opened new avenues to target necroptosis in pathological scenarios, such as viral infection or neurodegenerative diseases (Vandenabeele et al., 2010Vandenabeele P. Galluzzi L. Vanden Berghe T. Kroemer G. Molecular mechanisms of necroptosis: an ordered cellular explosion.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 700-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). A recent example of particular interest is axonal degeneration by necroptosis, and the link to death of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Ito et al., 2016Ito Y. Ofengeim D. Najafov A. Das S. Saberi S. Li Y. Hitomi J. Zhu H. Chen H. Mayo L. et al.RIPK1 mediates axonal degeneration by promoting inflammation and necroptosis in ALS.Science. 2016; 353: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition, necroptosis can suppress immune response against cancer and promote tumor growth (Seifert et al., 2016Seifert L. Werba G. Tiwari S. Giao Ly N.N. Alothman S. Alqunaibit D. Avanzi A. Barilla R. Daley D. Greco S.H. et al.The necrosome promotes pancreatic oncogenesis via CXCL1 and Mincle-induced immune suppression.Nature. 2016; 532: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). All these findings highlight the importance of the structure and energetics of the necrosome. We discovered previously that the RIPK1-RIPK3 necrosome is a functional amyloid required for necroptotic signaling and activation, and RIPK1 or RIPK3 RHIM mutants that were defective for amyloid formation in vitro did not undergo necroptosis upon stimulation with appropriate signals in cells (Li et al., 2012Li J. McQuade T. Siemer A.B. Napetschnig J. Moriwaki K. Hsiao Y.S. Damko E. Moquin D. Walz T. McDermott A. et al.The RIP1/RIP3 necrosome forms a functional amyloid signaling complex required for programmed necrosis.Cell. 2012; 150: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the observation that the murine cytomegalovirus protein M45 suppresses necroptosis through RIPK3-M45 RHIM-mediated interactions (Upton et al., 2010Upton J.W. Kaiser W.J. Mocarski E.S. Virus inhibition of RIP3-dependent necrosis.Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 302-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Similarly, Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 unleash their inhibition of necroptosis by disrupting RHIM-dependent RIPK1 and RIPK3 association (Guo et al., 2015Guo H. Omoto S. Harris P.A. Finger J.N. Bertin J. Gough P.J. Kaiser W.J. Mocarski E.S. Herpes simplex virus suppresses necroptosis in human cells.Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 17: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and the enteropathogenic E. coli protease EspL prevents necroptosis signaling by cleavage of the RHIMs of monomeric RIPK1 and RIPK3, but not within the hetero-amyloid structure (Pearson et al., 2017Pearson J.S. Giogha C. Mühlen S. Nachbur U. Pham C.L. Zhang Y. Hildebrand J.M. Oates C.V. Lung T.W. Ingle D. et al.EspL is a bacterial cysteine protease effector that cleaves RHIM proteins to block necroptosis and inflammation.Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2: 16258Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A number of studies suggest the existence of multiple amyloidal signalosomes as prominent mediators in signal transduction, since RHIM-containing proteins, such as the Toll-like receptor signaling adaptors TRIF and DAI, the cytoplasmic DNA sensor involved in interferon response, both interact with RIPK1 and/or RIPK3 to induce programmed cell death or NF-κB activation (Kaiser and Offermann, 2005Kaiser W.J. Offermann M.K. Apoptosis induced by the toll-like receptor adaptor TRIF is dependent on its receptor interacting protein homotypic interaction motif.J.

RIP1 is an essential mediator of Toll-like receptor 3-induced NF-kappa B activation.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). We also previously observed the formation of DAI-RIPK1 fibrillar complexes (Li et al., 2012Li J. McQuade T. Siemer A.B. Napetschnig J. Moriwaki K. Hsiao Y.S. Damko E. Moquin D. Walz T. McDermott A. et al.The RIP1/RIP3 necrosome forms a functional amyloid signaling complex required for programmed necrosis.Cell. 2012; 150: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Other support for this hypothesis comes from the discovery of a RHIM-like regulatory amyloid motif in the fungal protein HELLP that signals to a programmed cell death related to necroptosis (Daskalov et al., 2016Daskalov A. Habenstein B. Sabaté R. Berbon M. Martinez D. Chaignepain S. Coulary-Salin B. Hofmann K. Loquet A. Saupe S.J. Identification of a novel cell death-inducing domain reveals that fungal amyloid-controlled programmed cell death is related to necroptosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Elucidating the association of RIPK1 and RIPK3 could provide insight to the signaling biology mediated by these varied amyloids. Here, we present the high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) structure of the RIPK1-RIPK3 amyloidal signaling complex, featuring sequential and specific stacking to form a hetero-amyloid serpentine fold, stabilized by hydrophobic packing and enriched with interactions along the fibrillar axis, such as Asn and Gln ladders, Tyr stacking, and an unusual Cys-Ser ladder. We found that RIPK1 and RIPK3 homo-amyloids possess an analogous fold as supported by the crystal structure of the tetrapeptide VQVG (RIPK3) motif and biochemical validations. These homo-amyloids are, however, less preferred energetically in comparison with the RIPK1-RIPK3 hetero-amyloid. Clearly hetero-amyloids can form highly specific structures with defined folds, analogous to globular proteins and prior homo-amyloids. These results offer insights into how RHIM-mediated interactions provide nuanced control of biological pathways. We previously observed that the core of the RIPK1-RIPK3 amyloid comprises the RHIMs of both proteins and flanking segments, and only amino acid residues within these regions were detected in SSNMR spectra collected near room temperature. This observation was consistent for hydrated samples made from a variety of constructs of different lengths (Li et al., 2012Li J. McQuade T. Siemer A.B. Napetschnig J. Moriwaki K. Hsiao Y.S. Damko E. Moquin D. Walz T. McDermott A. et al.The RIP1/RIP3 necrosome forms a functional amyloid signaling complex required for programmed necrosis.Cell. 2012; 150: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Extensive portions of the proteins are missing from CPMAS-based spectra, which we interpret in terms of the presence of a rigid amyloid core centered on the critical RHIM motifs, flanked by flexible regions. This is analogous to prior reports regarding the CPEB functional amyloid from Aplysia californica (Raveendra et al., 2013Raveendra B.L. Siemer A.B. Puthanveettil S.V. Hendrickson W.A. Kandel E.R. McDermott A.E. Characterization of prion-like conformational changes of the neuronal isoform of Aplysia CPEB.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or the HET-s fungal prion (Wasmer et al., 2008Wasmer C. Lange A. Van Melckebeke H. Siemer A.B. Riek R. Meier B.H. Amyloid fibrils of the HET-s(218-289) prion form a beta solenoid with a triangular hydrophobic core.Science. 2008; 319: 1523-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Although NMR chemical shifts are very sensitive to structural changes, this fibrillar core exhibited remarkably consistent shifts, including shifts previously reported and confirmed in this work, as well as a handful of additional assignments reported here for the first time (Figures 1 and S1A). This consistent observation of a single set of resonances (Figure S1B) can be contrasted with other amyloids, where polymorphism is evident.Figure S1Chemical Shift Consistency in RIPK1-RIPK3 Samples, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Comparison of DARR spectra from our previous work (black) with the one acquired on new samples used for obtaining the structure of the RIPK1-RIPK3 hetero-amyloid (blue, this color scheme is used for figures with assignments in this work).

Specifically we utilized: (1) dipolar assisted rotational resonance (DARR) (Takegoshi et al., 2001Takegoshi K. Nakamura S. Terao T. 13C–1H dipolar-assisted rotational resonance in magic-angle spinning NMR.Chem. Phys. Lett. 2001; 344: 631-637Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar); (2) 13C-13C proton-assisted recoupling (PAR) (De Paëpe et al., 2008De Paëpe G. Lewandowski J.R. Loquet A. Böckmann A. Griffin R.G. Proton assisted recoupling and protein structure determination.J. Chem. Phys. 2008; 129: 245101Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); (3) 15N-13C proton-assisted insensitive nuclei (PAIN) (Lewandowski et al., 2007Lewandowski J.R. De Paëpe G. Griffin R.G.

Soc. 2007; 129: 728-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); and (4) 2D transferred-echo double resonance (TEDOR) (Jaroniec et al., 2002Jaroniec C.P. Filip C. Griffin R.G. 3D TEDOR NMR experiments for the simultaneous measurement of multiple carbon-nitrogen distances in uniformly (13)C,(15)N-labeled solids.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 10728-10742Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We refer the reader to the STAR Methods for more details. From these experiments, we assigned a number medium-range (< 4 residues apart) and long-range (separated by > 5 residues) cross-peaks, which are highlighted in expansions of a homonuclear DARR spectrum (with mixing time of 250 ms) (Figure 1). A parameter ni can be used to characterize the number of possible interpretations for a cross-peak. For example, unambiguous cross-peaks are characterized as those with number of interpretations (ni) = 1 (one unique interpretation for each chemical shift in the two dimensions); for other cross-peaks, one of the atoms is unambiguously identified but two possible assignments are compatible with the chemical shift of the other atom, and we designate them as ni = 2. Following this convention, 21 unambiguous (ni = 1) medium- and long-range cross-peaks were detected in the DARR, PAR, PAIN, and TEDOR experiments in total (Figure S2; Table S1), in addition to another 21 medium and long-range low-ambiguity contacts (ni = 2–4) contacts (Figure S2; Table S2). All of the cross-peaks involve amino acid residues located in the RHIM regions and directly flanking stretches (Figure 2A).Figure 2Assignment, Secondary Chemical Shifts, and Considerations for Calculating the RIPK1-RIPK3 Hetero-Amyloid StructureShow full caption(A) Sequence alignment of RIPK1 (520–560) and RIPK3 (439–479) centered on the I(V)QI(V)G RHIM consensus residues.

A key feature of amyloid structures (and their determination by NMR) is the “registration” or patterns in the backbone hydrogen bonds between neighboring β strands, for example whether they are parallel or antiparallel. Once the registration is identified, backbone atom “hypothesis-based restraints” are often used to enforce canonical intra- and inter-β-sheet separations consistent with fibril diffraction patterns (Tuttle et al., 2016Tuttle M.D. Comellas G. Nieuwkoop A.J. Covell D.J. Berthold D.A. Kloepper K.D. Courtney J.M. Kim J.K. Barclay A.M. Kendall A. et al.Solid-state NMR structure of a pathogenic fibril of full-length human α-synuclein.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Other protocols include restraints on the inter-strand H-bonds within the β sheet (Schütz et al., 2015Schütz A.K. Vagt T. Huber M. Ovchinnikova O.Y. Cadalbert R. Wall J. Güntert P. Böckmann A. Glockshuber R. Meier B.H.

USA. 2016; 113: E4976-E4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), or a combination of both kinds of restraints (Colvin et al., 2016Colvin M.T. Silvers R. Ni Q.Z. Can T.V. Sergeyev I. Rosay M. Donovan K.J. Michael B. Wall J. Linse S. et al.Atomic resolution structure of monomorphic Abeta42 amyloid fibrils.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 9663-9674Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Only if the correct registration is hypothesized will the resultant structure lack conflicts with the data. Although our work broadly reflects the logic and the final validation procedures in this prior work, we utilized a couple of slightly original approaches to identify the registration. In one approach, secondary chemical shifts Δ(δCα–δCβ), were used to locate the β strand segments (Figures 2B and 2C). The pattern in the backbone conformations of RIPK1 and RIPK3 based on these chemical shifts suggested a parallel registration (Figure 2B), in that the breaks in the β sheet are well aligned (in-register) if the two peptides are parallel rather than antiparallel. This registration is supported by a number of intermolecular cross-peaks (Figures 2D and 2E). We then show that only this in-register model was compatible with our data, by comparing it to other topologies, as elaborated on below. In an independent effort, the H-bond restraints were entirely left out, and only experimental tertiary contacts drove the same pairings to appear in an unbiased computation. Our calculations (unless otherwise specified) were performed using a building block comprising 4 RIPK1 molecules and 4 RIPK3 molecules, with amino acid sequences: T532IYNSTGIQIGAYNYMEI549 (RIPK1) and P448LVNIYNCSGVQVGD462 (RIPK3) (Figures 2A–2C). We consider this to be a minimal relevant complex, and smaller systems were deemed to be incomplete in terms of the distinct interaction surfaces present. The reason is that RIPK1 (RIPK3) interacts with two RIPK3 (RIPK1) molecules, corresponding to the strands above and below in a hetero-amyloid with alternating proteins. A given cross-peak between the two proteins (e.g., S536 [RIPK1] and I452 [RIPK3]) (Table S2) could correspond to either the RIPK1–RIPK3 (above) or the RIPK1-RIPK3 (below) interface. Since there is only one resolved NMR peak per atom, we have no a priori way to know which interface a specific contact arises from. The calculation protocol therefore treats the intermolecular interactions as ambiguous restraints with respect to which interface the contact resides in (even if they are unambiguous in terms of the assigned atoms). In the final structure of the octameric building block, discussed below, typically only one of the two distances is within the upper bounds of the cross-peak. This is consistent with the observation of a single set of spectral resonances, indicating that all monomers have similar conformations within the fibrils and any hypothetical differences are not resolved by our methods (Figure S1B). No symmetry was imposed within the hetero-amyloid in our calculations. Nevertheless, in the final structure the various copies of each peptide were very consistent, as elaborated below, with the observation that only one peak is observed per residue. The 21 unambiguous cross-peaks (Table S1) were converted into upper distance limits of 7.5 Å for restraints obtained from 13C-13C DARR and PAR experiments, and 6.5 Å from those detected in the 15N-13C PAIN and TEDOR spectra, analogous to literature precedents (Colvin et al., 2016Colvin M.T. Silvers R. Ni Q.Z. Can T.V. Sergeyev I. Rosay M. Donovan K.J. Michael B. Wall J. Linse S. et al.Atomic resolution structure of monomorphic Abeta42 amyloid fibrils.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138: 9663-9674Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). This dataset was complemented with 28 dihedral angle restraints obtained using TALOS+ (Shen et al., 2009Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. TALOS+: a hybrid method for predicting protein backbone torsion angles from NMR chemical shifts.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar), and “knowledge-based” information, namely intermolecular H-bond restraints for residues in β sheet conformation (Figures 2B and 2C, highlighted in yellow) introduced as upper and lower distance limits of 2.0 or 1.8 Å for the H···O distance and 3.0 or 2.7 Å for the N···O distance, respectively. The combination of H-bond hypothesis driven restraints and experimentally derived restraints was used as an input for our initial CYANA (Güntert, 2004Güntert P. Automated NMR structure calculation with CYANA.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar) calculation, and yielded a structure without violations (Figure 3A), with a clear and unique H-bonding strand pairing arrangement. This arrangement explains the presence of both parallel (Figures 2D and 2E) and antiparallel (Figure 3B) contacts between RIPK1 and RIPK3. Evidence supporting this fold comes from the analysis of an additional set of restraints including 21 cross-peaks with low ambiguity or ni = 2–4 (Table S2); for each of these peaks it is possible to identify an interpretation that is compatible with the proposed structure (Figure S3). A second, independent calculation that included this set of resolved ambiguous restraints combined with all the information from the previous step resulted in the same fold without any restraint violations (Figure 3C), therefore confirming the compatibility of the two datasets with respect to the predicted fold. A list of the experiments from which all these distance restraints were derived is tabulated (Table S3). To obtain a more refined ensemble of conformers and confirm the validity of the previous structure, peaks in the 250 ms DARR spectrum recorded on the U-[13C-15N] sample were manually picked and included for a full CYANA (Güntert, 2004Güntert P.

Knowing the genetic kinship of historic and prehistoric individuals would give important insights into social structures of ancient and historic cultures. Most archaeogenetic research concerning kinship has been restricted to uniparental markers, while studies using genome-wide information were mainly focused on comparisons between populations. Applications which infer the degree of relationship based on modern-day DNA information typically require diploid genotype data. Low concentration of endogenous DNA, fragmentation and other post-mortem damage to ancient DNA (aDNA) makes the application of such tools unfeasible for most archaeological samples. To infer family relationships for degraded samples, we developed the software READ (Relationship Estimation from Ancient DNA). We show that our heuristic approach can successfully infer up to second degree relationships with as little as 0.1x shotgun coverage per genome for pairs of individuals. We uncover previously unknown relationships among prehistoric individuals by applying READ to published aDNA data from several human remains excavated from different cultural contexts. In particular, we find a group of five closely related males from the same Corded Ware culture site in modern-day Germany, suggesting patrilocality, which highlights the possibility to uncover social structures of ancient populations by applying READ to genome-wide aDNA data. READ is publicly available from https://bitbucket.org/tguenther/read."
https://openalex.org/W2801312275,"The majority of newly diagnosed prostate cancers are slow growing, with a long natural life history. Yet a subset can metastasize with lethal consequences. We reconstructed the phylogenies of 293 localized prostate tumors linked to clinical outcome data. Multiple subclones were detected in 59% of patients, and specific subclonal architectures associate with adverse clinicopathological features. Early tumor development is characterized by point mutations and deletions followed by later subclonal amplifications and changes in trinucleotide mutational signatures. Specific genes are selectively mutated prior to or following subclonal diversification, including MTOR, NKX3-1, and RB1. Patients with low-risk monoclonal tumors rarely relapse after primary therapy (7%), while those with high-risk polyclonal tumors frequently do (61%). The presence of multiple subclones in an index biopsy may be necessary, but not sufficient, for relapse of localized prostate cancer, suggesting that evolution-aware biomarkers should be studied in prospective studies of low-risk tumors suitable for active surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2801511742,"Binding of sweet, umami, and bitter tastants to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in apical membranes of type II taste bud cells (TBCs) triggers action potentials that activate a voltage-gated nonselective ion channel to release ATP to gustatory nerves mediating taste perception. Although calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) is necessary for ATP release, the molecular identification of the channel complex that provides the conductive ATP-release mechanism suitable for action potential-dependent neurotransmission remains to be determined. Here we show that CALHM3 interacts with CALHM1 as a pore-forming subunit in a CALHM1/CALHM3 hexameric channel, endowing it with fast voltage-activated gating identical to that of the ATP-release channel in vivo. Calhm3 is co-expressed with Calhm1 exclusively in type II TBCs, and its genetic deletion abolishes taste-evoked ATP release from taste buds and GPCR-mediated taste perception. Thus, CALHM3, together with CALHM1, is essential to form the fast voltage-gated ATP-release channel in type II TBCs required for GPCR-mediated tastes."
https://openalex.org/W2801384315,"Diversity in the genetic lesions that cause cancer is extreme. In consequence, a pressing challenge is the development of drugs that target patient-specific disease mechanisms. To address this challenge, we employed a chemistry-first discovery paradigm for de novo identification of druggable targets linked to robust patient selection hypotheses. In particular, a 200,000 compound diversity-oriented chemical library was profiled across a heavily annotated test-bed of >100 cellular models representative of the diverse and characteristic somatic lesions for lung cancer. This approach led to the delineation of 171 chemical-genetic associations, shedding light on the targetability of mechanistic vulnerabilities corresponding to a range of oncogenotypes present in patient populations lacking effective therapy. Chemically addressable addictions to ciliogenesis in TTC21B mutants and GLUT8-dependent serine biosynthesis in KRAS/KEAP1 double mutants are prominent examples. These observations indicate a wealth of actionable opportunities within the complex molecular etiology of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2800569219,"Asymmetrically dividing muscle stem cells in skeletal muscle give rise to committed cells, where the myogenic determination factor Myf5 is transcriptionally activated by Pax7. This activation is dependent on Carm1, which methylates Pax7 on multiple arginine residues, to recruit the ASH2L:MLL1/2:WDR5:RBBP5 histone methyltransferase complex to the proximal promoter of Myf5. Here, we found that Carm1 is a specific substrate of p38γ/MAPK12 and that phosphorylation of Carm1 prevents its nuclear translocation. Basal localization of the p38γ/p-Carm1 complex in muscle stem cells occurs via binding to the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) through β1-syntrophin. In dystrophin-deficient muscle stem cells undergoing asymmetric division, p38γ/β1-syntrophin interactions are abrogated, resulting in enhanced Carm1 phosphorylation. The resulting progenitors exhibit reduced Carm1 binding to Pax7, reduced H3K4-methylation of chromatin, and reduced transcription of Myf5 and other Pax7 target genes. Therefore, our experiments suggest that dysregulation of p38γ/Carm1 results in altered epigenetic gene regulation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2802090278,"CRISPR-Cas9 technology is routinely applied for targeted mutagenesis in model organisms and cell lines. Recent studies indicate that the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas9 system is affected by eukaryotic chromatin structures. Here, we show that the likelihood of successful mutagenesis correlates with transcript levels during early development in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. In an experimental setting, we found that guide RNAs differ in their onset of mutagenesis activity in vivo. Furthermore, some guide RNAs with high in vitro activity possessed poor mutagenesis activity in vivo, suggesting the presence of factors that limit the mutagenesis in vivo. Using open access datasets generated from early developmental stages of the zebrafish, and guide RNAs selected from the CRISPRz database, we provide further evidence for an association between gene expression during early development and the success of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis in zebrafish embryos. In order to further inspect the effect of chromatin on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, we analysed the relationship of selected chromatin features on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis efficiency using publicly available data from zebrafish embryos. We found a correlation between chromatin openness and the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. These results indicate that CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis is influenced by chromatin accessibility in zebrafish embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2800438446,"Empathy is crucial for our emotional experience and social interactions, and its abnormalities manifest in various psychiatric disorders. Observational fear is a useful behavioral paradigm for assessing affective empathy in rodents. However, specific genes that regulate observational fear remain unknown. Here we showed that 129S1/SvImJ mice carrying a unique missense variant in neurexin 3 (Nrxn3) exhibited a profound and selective enhancement in observational fear. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, the arginine-to-tryptophan (R498W) change in Nrxn3 was confirmed to be the causative variant. Selective deletion of Nrxn3 in somatostatin-expressing (SST+) interneurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) markedly increased observational fear and impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission from SST+ neurons. Concordantly, optogenetic manipulation revealed that SST+ neurons in the ACC bidirectionally controlled the degree of socially transmitted fear. Together, these results provide insights into the genetic basis of behavioral variability and the neurophysiological mechanism controlling empathy in mammalian brains."
https://openalex.org/W2800394030,"People often perceive configurations rather than the elements they comprise, a bias that may emerge because configurations often predict outcomes. But how does the brain learn to associate configurations with outcomes and how does this learning differ from learning about individual elements? We combined behavior, reinforcement learning models, and functional imaging to understand how people learn to associate configurations of cues with outcomes. We found that configural learning depended on the relative predictive strength of elements versus configurations and was related to both the strength of BOLD activity and patterns of BOLD activity in the hippocampus. Configural learning was further related to functional connectivity between the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. Moreover, configural learning was associated with flexible knowledge about associations and differential eye movements during choice. Together, this suggests that configural learning is associated with a distinct computational, cognitive, and neural profile that is well suited to support flexible and adaptive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2800409811,"In the context of avoiding research waste, the conduct of a feasibility study before a clinical trial should reduce the risk that further resources will be committed to a trial that is likely to 'fail'. However, there is little evidence indicating whether feasibility studies add to or reduce waste in research. Feasibility studies funded by the National Institute for Health Research's (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) programme were examined to determine how many had published their findings, how many had applied for further funding for a full trial and the timeframe in which both of these occurred. A total of 120 feasibility studies which had closed by May 2016 were identified and each Principal Investigator (PI) was sent a questionnaire of which 89 responses were received and deemed suitable for analysis. Based on self reported answers from the PIs a total of 57 feasibility studies were judged as feasible, 20 were judged not feasible and for 12 it was judged as uncertain whether a full trial was feasible. The RfPB programme had spent approximately £19.5m on the 89 feasibility studies of which 16 further studies had been subsequently funded to a total of £16.8m. The 20 feasibility studies which were judged as not feasible potentially saved up to approximately £20m of further research funding which would likely to have not completed successfully. The average RfPB feasibility study took 31 months (range 18 to 48) to complete and cost £219,048 (range £72,031 to £326,830) and the average full trial funded from an RfPB feasibility study took 42 months (range 26 to 55) to complete and cost £1,163,996 (range £321,403 to £2,099,813). The average timeframe of feasibility study and full trial was 72 months (range 56 to 91), however in addition to this time an average of 10 months (range -7 to 29) was taken between the end of the feasibility study and the application for the full trial, and a further average of 18 months (range 13 to 28) between the application for the full trial and the start of the full trial. Approximately 58% of the 89 feasibility studies had published their findings with the majority of the remaining studies still planning to publish. Due to the long time frames involved a number of studies were still in the process of publishing the feasibility findings and/or applying for a full trial. Feasibility studies are potentially useful at avoiding waste and de-risking funding investments of more expensive full trials, however there is a clear time delay and therefore some potential waste in the existing research pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2799511849,"Introduction The prognosis of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been improved by development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as nivolumab for second-line treatment. As phase III trials include only selected patients, we here investigated the clinical factors associated with efficacy and safety of nivolumab in ‘real life’ patients with advanced NSCLC. Methods Clinical and histological characteristics, therapies and survival data of all consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC included prospectively and treated by nivolumab in two French academic hospitals between February 2015 and December 2016 were examined. Results Sixty-seven patients were included, mostly male (69%), current or former smokers (87%) with PS <2 (73%). Median age was 68.5 years and 42% were aged ≥70 years. According to uni- and multi-variate analyses, only PS 2 (OR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.03–0.99, p = 0.049) and number of previous treatment lines (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.13–0.85, p = 0.022) were significantly negatively associated with tumor control. Worse progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly associated with PS 2 (HR = 5.17, 95% CI 1.99–13.43, p = 0.001) and use of steroids (HR = 3.27, 95% CI 1.39–7.69, p = 0.006). Worse overall survival was associated with symptomatic brain metastasis (HR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.23–8.85, p = 0.029). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 47 patients (70%), symptomatic brain metastasis being significantly associated with Grade ≥3 toxicity (OR = 8.13, 95% CI 1.21–55.56, p = 0.031). Age and nutritional status were not associated with response, PFS, OS or toxicity. Conclusion Our results suggest that nivolumab is not beneficial or safe for patients with PS 2 and symptomatic brain metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2802332658,"Spermatogenesis is a dynamic process involving self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells, meiosis, and ultimately, the differentiation of haploid spermatids into sperm. Centrosomal protein 55 kDa (CEP55) is necessary for somatic cell abscission during cytokinesis. It facilitates equal segregation of cytoplasmic contents between daughter cells by recruiting endosomal sorting complex required for transport machinery (ESCRT) at the midbody. In germ cells, CEP55, in partnership with testes expressed-14 (TEX14) protein, has also been shown to be an integral component of intercellular bridge before meiosis. Various in vitro studies have demonstrated a role for CEP55 in multiple cancers and other diseases. However, its oncogenic potential in vivo remains elusive. To investigate, we generated ubiquitously overexpressing Cep55 transgenic ( Cep55Tg/Tg) mice aiming to characterize its oncogenic role in cancer. Unexpectedly, we found that Cep55Tg/Tg male mice were sterile and had severe and progressive defects in spermatogenesis related to spermatogenic arrest and lack of spermatids in the testes. In this study, we characterized this male-specific phenotype and showed that excessively high levels of Cep55 results in hyperactivation of PI3K/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling in testis. In line with this finding, we observed increased phosphorylation of forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), and suppression of its nuclear retention, along with the relative enrichment of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) -positive cells. Independently, we observed that Cep55 amplification favored upregulation of ret ( Ret) proto-oncogene and glial-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor α-1 ( Gfra1). Consistent with these data, we observed selective down-regulation of genes associated with germ cell differentiation in Cep55-overexpressing testes at postnatal day 10, including early growth response-4 ( Egr4) and spermatogenesis and oogenesis specific basic helix-loop-helix-1 ( Sohlh1). Thus, Cep55 amplification leads to a shift toward the initial maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia and ultimately results in progressive germ cell loss. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that Cep55 overexpression causes change in germ cell proportions and manifests as a Sertoli cell only tubule phenotype, similar to that seen in many azoospermic men.-Sinha, D., Kalimutho, M., Bowles, J., Chan, A.-L., Merriner, D.

https://openalex.org/W2802204404,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, fibrotic parenchymal lung disease of unknown etiology and lacks an effective intervention. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in organ fibrosis and various pulmonary diseases, but the role of lncRNAs in lung fibrosis is not fully understood. In the present study, we identified that lncRNA NONMMUT021928, designated as pulmonary fibrosis-associated lncRNA (PFAL), was up-regulated in the lungs of mice with experimental lung fibrosis, and in TGF-β1-induced fibrotic lung fibroblasts. Further study showed that overexpression of PFAL promoted cell proliferation, migration, and fibroblast-myofibroblast transition. Overexpression further resulted in extracellular matrix deposition and fibrogenesis in lung fibroblasts through regulation of microRNA-18a (miR-18a). Importantly, knockdown of PFAL alleviated lung fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, our study showed that PFAL promoted lung-fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis by acting as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-18a: forced expression of PFAL inhibited the expression and activity of miR-18a, whereas silencing of PFAL had the opposite effect. Furthermore, we found that miR-18a was decreased during lung fibrosis in vitro and in vivo, as well as in patients with IPF. Moreover, knockdown of miR-18a led to fibrogenesis in lung fibroblasts, whereas enhanced expression of miR-18a attenuated TGF-β1-induced lung fibrosis by directly targeting the regulation of connecting tissue growth factor. Taken together, these results revealed the effect and mechanism of lncRNA PFAL in pulmonary fibrosis and suggested that PFAL depletion may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of lung fibrosis.-Li, X., Yu, T., Shan, H., Jiang, H., Sun, J., Zhao, X., Su, W., Yang, L., Shan, H., Liang, H. lncRNA PFAL promotes lung fibrosis through CTGF by competitively binding miR-18a."

The limited availability of human hypothalamic neurons hampers our understanding of obesity disease mechanisms. To address this, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from multiple normal body mass index (BMI; BMI ≤ 25) subjects and super-obese (OBS) donors (BMI ≥ 50) with polygenic coding variants in obesity-associated genes. We developed a method to reliably differentiate hiPSCs into hypothalamic-like neurons (iHTNs) capable of secreting orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that, although iHTNs maintain a fetal identity, they respond appropriately to metabolic hormones ghrelin and leptin. Notably, OBS iHTNs retained disease signatures and phenotypes of high BMI, exhibiting dysregulated respiratory function, ghrelin-leptin signaling, axonal guidance, glutamate receptors, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways. Thus, human iHTNs provide a powerful platform to study obesity and gene-environment interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2800090919,"Endometrial Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (endMSCs) are multipotent cells with immunomodulatory and pro-regenerative activity which is mainly mediated by a paracrine effect. The exosomes released by MSCs have become a promising therapeutic tool for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. More specifically, extracellular vesicles derived from endMSCs (EV-endMSCs) have demonstrated a cardioprotective effect through the release of anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic factors. Here we hypothesize that EV-endMSCs may be used as a co-adjuvant to improve in vitro fertilization outcomes and embryo quality. Firstly, endMSCs and EV-endMSCs were isolated and phenotypically characterized for in vitro assays. Then, in vitro studies were performed on murine embryos co-cultured with EV-endMSCs at different concentrations. Our results firstly demonstrated a significant increase on the total blastomere count of expanded murine blastocysts. Moreover, EV-endMSCs triggered the release of pro-angiogenic molecules from embryos demonstrating an EV-endMSCs concentration-dependent increase of VEGF and PDGF-AA. The release of VEGF and PDGF-AA by the embryos may indicate that the beneficial effect of EV-endMSCs could be mediating not only an increase in the blastocyst’s total cell number, but also may promote endometrial angiogenesis, vascularization, differentiation and tissue remodeling. In summary, these results could be relevant for assisted reproduction being the first report describing the beneficial effect of human EV-endMSCs on embryo development."
https://openalex.org/W2801100908,"South Africa has a Universal Test and Treat (UTT) policy in place to ensure that everyone tests for HIV and can access treatment if they test positive. The aim of this study is to document the pathways that older South Africans who are living with HIV take to access testing and treatment in this context. Despite the aging of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and clear evidence that testing older persons (over age 50) is necessary, very little is known about the circumstances under which older persons test for HIV or their motivations for doing so. In this study, we analyze 21 qualitative, in-depth interviews with women and men aged 50 and over who are living with HIV from two townships outside of Cape Town. Using grounded theory to specify emerging themes, we find similarities and differences between older men and women in their pathways to testing. Men primarily test for HIV when their spouse is diagnosed or in connection with TB testing and treatment. Older women, who are more likely to be widowed or divorced, often test for HIV only when they are symptomatic or not responding appropriately to care for non-communicable diseases. Most importantly, we find that older South Africans do not seek testing as a response to risk. Instead, older men and women test only once they are symptomatic and referred by a provider, or as a result of a partner’s status. Our respondents, particularly the women, expressed “shock” and confusion at learning they were HIV-positive because they do not see themselves as at risk of acquiring HIV. Because the benefits of UTT are greatest with early detection and treatment, older persons’ tendency to test at such a late stage of illness decreases the individual and population level advantages of UTT. More research is needed to understand older persons’ risk and testing behavior so that policy and programs include HIV testing messages that reach this population."
https://openalex.org/W2801922626,"Aedes albopictus, originally considered as a secondary vector for arbovirus transmission, especially in areas where this species co-exist with Aedes aegypti, has been described in most regions of the world. Dispersion and domiciliation of Ae. albopictus in a complex of densely urbanized slums in Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil, was evidenced. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that 1) Ae. albopictus distribution in urban slums is negatively related to distance from vegetation, and 2) these vectors have taken on a domestic life style with a portion of the population feeding, ovipositing, and resting indoors. To do this, we developed an integrated surveillance proposal, aiming to detect the presence and abundance of Aedes mosquitoes. The study, based on a febrile syndrome surveillance system in a cohort of infants living in the slum complex, was performed on a weekly basis between February 2014 and April 2017. A total of 8,418 adult mosquitoes (3,052 Ae. aegypti, 44 Ae. albopictus, 16 Ae. scapularis, 4 Ae. fluviatilis and 5,302 Culex quinquefasciatus) were collected by direct aspiration and 46,047 Aedes spp. eggs were collected by oviposition traps. The Asian tiger mosquito, Ae. albopictus, was aspirated in its adult form (n = 44), and immature forms of this species (n = 12) were identified from the eggs collected by the ovitraps. In most collection sites, co-occurrence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus was observed. Key-sites, such as junkyards, thrift stores, factories, tire repair shops and garages, had the higher abundance of Ae. albopictus, followed by schools and households. We collected Ae. albopictus at up to 400 meters to the nearest vegetation cover. The log transformed (n+1) number of females Ae. albopictus captured at each collection point was inversely related to the distance to the nearest vegetation border. These results show that Ae. albopictus, a competent vector for important arboviruses and more commonly found in areas with higher vegetation coverage, is present and spread in neglected and densely urbanized areas, being collected at a long distance from the typical encounter areas for this species. Besides, as Ae. albopictus can easily move between sylvatic and urban environment, the entomological monitoring of Ae. albopictus should be an integral part of mosquito surveillance and control. Finally, key-sites, characterized by high human influx and presence of potential Aedes breeding sites, should be included in entomological monitoring."

The T3S system is tightly regulated by a complex network of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators. Using transposon mutagenesis, here we identified the ybeZYX-Int operon as being required for normal T3S levels. Deletion analyses localized the regulation to the endoribonuclease YbeY, previously linked to 16S rRNA maturation and small RNA (sRNA) function. Loss of ybeY in EHEC had pleiotropic effects on EHEC cells, including reduced motility and growth and cold sensitivity. Using UV cross-linking and RNA-Seq (CRAC) analysis, we identified YbeY-binding sites throughout the transcriptome and discovered specific binding of YbeY to the “neck” and “beak” regions of 16S rRNA but identified no significant association of YbeY with sRNA, suggesting that YbeY modulates T3S by depleting mature ribosomes. In E. coli, translation is strongly linked to mRNA stabilization, and subinhibitory concentrations of the translation-initiation inhibitor kasugamycin provoked rapid degradation of a polycistronic mRNA encoding needle filament and needle tip proteins of the T3S system. We conclude that T3S is particularly sensitive to depletion of initiating ribosomes, explaining the inhibition of T3S in the ΔybeY strain.

https://openalex.org/W2803034764,"This study was conducted to document the extent and basis of compositional variation of shoot biomass of the energy Sorghum bicolor hybrid TX08001 during development under field conditions. TX08001 is capable of accumulating ~40 Mg/ha of dry biomass under good growing conditions and this genotype allocates ~80% of its shoot biomass to stems. After 150 days of growth TX08001 stems had a fresh/dry weight ratio of ~3:1 and soluble biomass accounted for ~30% of stem biomass. A panel of diverse energy sorghum genotypes varied ~6-fold in the ratio of stem structural to soluble biomass after 150 days of growth. Near-infrared spectroscopic analysis (NIRS) showed that TX08001 leaves accumulated higher levels of protein, water extractives and ash compared to stems, which have higher sugar, cellulose, and lignin contents. TX08001 stem sucrose content varied during development, whereas the composition of TX08001 stem cell walls, which consisted of ~45-49% cellulose, ~27-30% xylan, and ~15-18% lignin, remained constant after 90 days post emergence until the end of the growing season (180 days). TX08001 and Della stem syringyl (S)/guaiacyl (G) (0.53-0.58) and ferulic acid (FA)/para-coumaric acid (pCA) ratios were similar whereas ratios of pCA/(S+G) differed between these genotypes. Additionally, an analysis of irrigated versus non-irrigated TX08001 revealed that non-irrigated hybrids exhibited a 50% reduction in total cell wall biomass, an ~2-fold increase in stem sugars, and an ~25% increase in water extractives relative to irrigated hybrids. This study provides a baseline of information to help guide further optimization of energy sorghum composition for various end-uses."
https://openalex.org/W2802899333,"The aim of this study was to determine the individual oxidized phosphatidylcholine (OxPC) molecules generated during renal ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury.Kidney ischemia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by clamping the left renal pedicle for 45 min followed by reperfusion for either 6h or 24h. Kidney tissue was subjected to lipid extraction. Phospholipids and OxPC species were identified and quantitated using liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry using internal standards.We identified fifty-five distinct OxPC in rat kidney following I/R injury. These included a variety of fragmented (aldehyde and carboxylic acid containing species) and non-fragmented products. 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (SLPC-OH), which is a non-fragmented OxPC and 1-palmitoyl-2-azelaoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAzPC), which is a fragmented OxPC, were the most abundant OxPC species after 6h and 24 h I/R respectively. Total fragmented aldehyde OxPC were significantly higher in 6h and 24h I/R groups compared to sham operated groups (P = 0.03, 0.001 respectively). Moreover, levels of aldehyde OxPC at 24h I/R were significantly greater than those in 6h I/R (P = 0.007). Fragmented carboxylic acid increased significantly in 24h I/R group compared with sham and 6h I/R groups (P = 0.001, 0.001). Moreover, levels of fragmented OxPC were significantly correlated with creatinine levels (r = 0.885, P = 0.001). Among non-fragmented OxPC, only isoprostanes were elevated significantly in 6h I/R group compared with sham group but not in 24h I/R group (P = 0.01). No significant changes were observed in other non-fragmented OxPC including long chain products and terminal furans.We have shown for the first time that bioactive OxPC species are produced in renal I/R and their levels increase with increasing time of reperfusion in a kidney model of I/R and correlate with severity of I/R injury. Given the pathological activity of fragmented OxPCs, therapies focused on their reduction may be a mechanism to attenuate renal I/R injury."
https://openalex.org/W2801136107,"d-Tagatose has gained substantial interest due to its potential functionalities as a sucrose substitute. In this study, the gene araA, encoding l-arabinose isomerase (l-AI) from Clostridium hylemonae (DSM 15053), was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). This gene consists of 1,506 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 501 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 56,554 Da. Since l-AI was expressed as an intracellular inclusion body, this enzyme was solubilized with guanidine hydrochloride, refolded, and activated with a descending concentration gradient of urea. The purified enzyme exhibited the greatest activity at 50°C, pH 7–7.5, and required 1 mM of Mg2+ as a cofactor. Notably, the catalytic efficiency (3.69 mM-1sec-1) of l-AI from C. hylemonae on galactose was significantly greater than that of other previously reported enzymes. The bioconversion yield of d-tagatose using the C. hylemonae l-arabinose isomerase at 60°C reached approximately 46% from 10 mM of d-galactose after 2 h. From these results, it is suggested that the l-arabinose isomerase from C. hylemonae could be utilized as a potential enzyme for d-tagatose production due to its high conversion yield at an industrially competitive temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2801427199,"The spread of dengue (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) is a major public health concern. The primary target of antibodies that neutralize DENV and ZIKV is the envelope (E) glycoprotein, and there is interest in using soluble recombinant E (sRecE) proteins as subunit vaccines. However, the most potent neutralizing antibodies against DENV and ZIKV recognize epitopes on the virion surface that span two or more E proteins. Therefore, to create effective DENV and ZIKV vaccines, presentation of these quaternary epitopes may be necessary. The sRecE proteins from DENV and ZIKV crystallize as native-like dimers, but studies in solution suggest that these dimers are marginally stable. To better understand the challenges associated with creating stable sRecE dimers, we characterized the thermostability of sRecE proteins from ZIKV and three DENV serotypes, DENV2-4. All four proteins irreversibly unfolded at moderate temperatures (46-53 °C). At 23 °C and low micromolar concentrations, DENV2 and ZIKV were primarily dimeric, and DENV3-4 were primarily monomeric, whereas at 37 °C, all four proteins were predominantly monomeric. We further show that the dissociation constant for DENV2 dimerization is very temperature-sensitive, ranging from <1 μm at 25 °C to 50 μm at 41 °C, due to a large exothermic enthalpy of binding of -79 kcal/mol. We also found that quaternary epitope antibody binding to DENV2-4 and ZIKV sRecE is reduced at 37 °C. Our observation of reduced sRecE dimerization at physiological temperature highlights the need for stabilizing the dimer as part of its development as a subunit vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2801975383,"New insights into G protein coupled receptor regulation of glucose metabolism by β-cells, skeletal muscle and liver hepatocytes identify GPRC6A as a potential therapeutic target for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Activating GPRC6A with a small molecule drug represents a potential paradigm-shifting opportunity to make significant strides in regulating glucose homeostasis by simultaneously correcting multiple metabolic derangements that underlie T2D, including abnormalities in β-cell proliferation and insulin secretion and peripheral insulin resistance. Using a computational, structure-based high-throughput screening approach, we identified novel tri-phenyl compounds predicted to bind to the venus fly trap (VFT) and 7-transmembrane (7-TM) domains of GPRC6A. Experimental testing found that these compounds dose-dependently stimulated GPRC6A signaling in a heterologous cell expression system. Additional chemical modifications and functional analysis identified one tri-phenyl lead compound, DJ-V-159 that demonstrated the greatest potency in stimulating insulin secretion in β-cells and lowering serum glucose in wild-type mice. Collectively, these studies show that GPRC6A is a druggable target for developing chemical probes to treat T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2800434812,"The present research explored whether components of social identity, namely ingroup ties, affect, and centrality, were differentially linked to mental health and inflammatory immune responses, and whether rumination mediated those relations. Study 1 (N = 138) indicated that stronger ingroup ties were associated with fewer mental health (depressive and post-traumatic stress) symptoms; those relations were mediated by the tendency for individuals with strong ties to rely less on ruminative coping to deal with a stressful life event. Study 2 (N = 54) demonstrated that ingroup ties were negatively associated with depressive symptoms, dispositional rumination, as well as stress-linked inflammatory elements at the physiological level. Consistent associations for centrality and ingroup affect were absent, suggesting that ingroup ties may have unique health benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2800344316,"The role of forest management in mitigating climate change is a central concern for the Canadian province of British Columbia. The successful implementation of forest management activities to achieve climate change mitigation in British Columbia will be strongly influenced by public support or opposition. While we now have increasingly clear ideas of the management opportunities associated with forest mitigation and some insight into public support for climate change mitigation in the context of sustainable forest management, very little is known with respect to the levels and basis of public support for potential forest management strategies to mitigate climate change. This paper, by describing the results of a web-based survey, documents levels of public support for the implementation of eight forest carbon mitigation strategies in British Columbia’s forest sector, and examines and quantifies the influence of the factors that shape this support. Overall, respondents ascribed a high level of importance to forest carbon mitigation and supported all of the eight proposed strategies, indicating that the British Columbia public is inclined to consider alternative practices in managing forests and wood products to mitigate climate change. That said, we found differences in levels of support for the mitigation strategies. In general, we found greater levels of support for a rehabilitation strategy (e.g. reforestation of unproductive forest land), and to a lesser extent for conservation strategies (e.g. old growth conservation, reduced harvest) over enhanced forest management strategies (e.g. improved harvesting and silvicultural techniques). We also highlighted multiple variables within the British Columbia population that appear to play a role in predicting levels of support for conservation and/or enhanced forest management strategies, including environmental values, risk perception, trust in groups of actors, prioritized objectives of forest management and socio-demographic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2801881314,"The present study aimed to identify novel microbial producers of bioemulsificant compounds from Antarctic soils. Fifty-nine microbial strains were isolated from five different locations at South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, and screened for biosurfactant production by β-hemolytic activity. Strain So 3.2 was determined as bioemulsifier-producer and identified by phenotypic and molecular characterization as Streptomyces luridus. Emulsification activity, oil displacement method and drop-collapsing test were performed to evaluate the biosurfactant activity with different oils and hydrocarbons using two different culture media (Luria Bertani and Bushnell Haas in the presence of different carbon sources: glucose, glycerol, olive oil and n-Hexadecane). Cell free supernatant of Bushnell Haas culture supplemented with n-Hexadecane showed the best results for all tests. Emulsification of hydrocarbons exceeded 60%, reaching up to 90% on oil with high API grade, while displacement tests ranged from 8 cm to 4 cm in diameter according the culture media and tested oils. Our results revealed that Streptomyces luridus So3.2 is able to produce bioemulsifiers capable of emulsifying hydrocarbons and oils, which could be used in different biotechnological applications, particularly for bioremediation of environments contaminated by oil leaks."
https://openalex.org/W2800952046,"A survey of the ecological variability within 52 populations of Schoenoplectus californicus (C.A. Mey.) Soják across its distributional range revealed that it is commonly found in nitrogen (N) limited areas, but rarely in phosphorus limited soils. We explored the hypothesis that S. californicus supplements its nitrogen demand by bacterial N2-fixation processes associated with its roots and rhizomes. We estimated N2-fixation of diazotrophs associated with plant rhizomes and roots from several locations throughout the species' range and conducted an experiment growing plants in zero, low, and high N additions. Nitrogenase activity in rhizomes and roots was measured using the acetylene reduction assay. The presence of diazotrophs was verified by the detection of the nifH gene. Nitrogenase activity was restricted to rhizomes and roots and it was two orders of magnitude higher in the latter plant organs (81 and 2032 nmol C2H4 g DW-1 d-1, respectively). Correspondingly, 40x more nifH gene copies were found on roots compared to rhizomes. The proportion of the nifH gene copies in total bacterial DNA was positively correlated with the nitrogenase activity. In the experiment, the contribution of fixed N to the plant N content ranged from 13.8% to 32.5% among clones from different locations. These are relatively high values for a non-cultivated plant and justify future research on the link between N-fixing bacteria and S. californicus production."

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the effect of plasma exchange therapy on short-term prognoses in patients with pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to AAV.This study utilized the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, which is a nationwide inpatient database in Japan. We checked the abstract data and medical actions and identified the patients with pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to AAV who required proactive treatment between 2009 and 2014. To compare the in-hospital mortality, we performed propensity score matching between the plasma exchange and non-plasma exchange groups at a ratio of 1:1.Of the 52,932 patients with AAV, 940 developed pulmonary hemorrhage as a complication. A total of 249 patients from 194 hospitals were eligible for the study. Propensity score matching at a ratio of 1:1 was performed, and 59 pairs were formed (plasma exchange group, n = 59; non-plasma exchange group, n = 59). A statistically significant difference was found in the all-cause in-hospital mortality between the plasma exchange and non-plasma exchange groups (35.6% vs. 54.2%; p = 0041; risk difference, -18.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), -35.4% to -0.67%).Thus, plasma exchange therapy was associated with improved in-hospital mortality in patients with pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to AAV."
https://openalex.org/W2801337303,"CD44 is a widely expressed cell adhesion molecule that binds to the extracellular matrix component, hyaluronan. However, this interaction is not constitutive in most immune cells at steady state, as the ability of CD44 to engage hyaluronan is highly regulated. While activated T cells and macrophages gain the ability to bind hyaluronan by CD44, the status in other immune cells is less studied. Here we found a percentage of murine eosinophils, natural killer and natural killer T cells were capable of interacting with hyaluronan at steady state. To further investigate the consequences of hyaluronan binding by CD44 in the hematopoietic system, point mutations of CD44 that either cannot bind hyaluronan (LOF-CD44) or have an increased affinity for hyaluronan (GOF-CD44) were expressed in CD44-deficient bone marrow. Competitive bone marrow reconstitution of irradiated mice revealed an early preference for GOF-CD44 over WT-CD44 expressing cells, and for WT-CD44 over LOF-CD44 expressing cells, in the hematopoietic progenitor cell compartment. The advantage of the hyaluronan-binding cells was observed in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor populations, and was maintained throughout the immune system. Hematopoietic stem cells bound minimal hyaluronan at steady state, and this was increased when the cells were induced to proliferate whereas multipotent progenitors had an increased ability to bind hyaluronan at steady state. In vitro, the addition of hyaluronan promoted their proliferation. Thus, proliferating hematopoietic progenitors bind hyaluronan, and hyaluronan binding cells have a striking competitive advantage in bone marrow engraftment."

Based on AspICU algorithm, 21 had putative IA (8.9%), 12 were colonised (5.1%).Adjusting the confounding factors, significant risk factors for IA were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), temperature of ≥38°C, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The best predictor of IA was AspICU algorithm (AUC, 1) followed by serum galactomannan antigen (GM) cut-off (≥1.24) calculated based on AspICU algorithm (AUC, 0.822). For 37% of patients, IA diagnoses was made earlier with serum GM than radiology. There were 70/235 (29.8%) deaths within 30 days of enrolment in the study. Aspergillus culture positivity (34/235, 14.5%) was associated with very high mortality (27/34, 79.4%), (p<0.05). The best predictor of mortality was GM cut-off (≥1.24) calculated based on AspICU algorithm (AUC, 0.835).This study imparts the focus on relatively underestimated Aspergillus infections prevalent in ICUs. The AspICU algorithm was found to be useful over others for IA diagnosis. The prognostic usefulness of serum GM antigen detection test highlighted overlooking the same may not be rewarding for the outcome of IA suspected ICU subpopulation."
https://openalex.org/W2802421064,"Tularemia is a fatal human disease caused by Francisella tularensis, a Gram-negative encapsulated coccobacillus bacterium. Due to its low infectious dose, ease of aerosolized transmission, and lethal effects, the CDC lists F. tularensis as a Category A pathogen, the highest level for a potential biothreat agent. Previous vaccine studies have been conducted with live attenuated, inactivated, and subunit vaccines, which have achieved partial or full protection from F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) challenge, but no vaccine has been approved for human use. We demonstrate the improved efficacy of a multi-antigen subunit vaccine by using Tobacco Mosaic virus (TMV) as an antigen carrier for the F. tularensis SchuS4 proteins DnaK, OmpA, SucB and Tul4 (DOST). The magnitude and quality of immune responses were compared after mice were immunized by subcutaneous or intranasal routes of administration with a TMV-DOST mixture, with or without four different adjuvants. Immune responses varied in magnitude and isotype profile, by antigen, by route of administration, and by protection in an F. tularensis LVS challenge model of disease. Interestingly, our analysis demonstrates an overwhelming IgG2 response to SucB after intranasal dosing, as well as a robust cellular response, which may account for the improved two-dose survival imparted by the tetravalent vaccine, compared to a previous study that tested efficacy of TMV-DOT. Our study provides evidence that potent humoral, cellular and mucosal immunity can be achieved by optimal antigen combination, delivery, adjuvant and appropriate route of administration, to improve vaccine potency and provide protection from pathogen challenge."

This study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms and effects of chronic calcitriol [1,25-(OH)2D3, hormonal form of vitamin D] on gut-adipose tissue-liver axis abnormalities using a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rat model of NASH. In HFD-fed obese rats on a 10-week calcitriol (0.3 μg/kg/TIW) or vehicle treatment (NASH-vit. D and NASH-V rats) reigme, various in vivo and in vitro experiments were undertaken. Through anti-TNFα-TNFR1-NFκB signaling effects, chronic calcitriol treatment significantly restored plasma calcitriol levels and significantly improved vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in monocytes and the small intestine of NASH-vit. D rats. Significantly, plasma and portal endotoxin/TNFα levels, bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes, plasma DX-4000-FITC, fecal albumin-assessed intestinal hyper-permeability, over-expression of TNFα-related immune profiles in monocytes, inflammation of intestinal/mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT)/liver and hepatic steatosis were improved by chronic calcitriol treatment of NASH rats. Additionally, in vitro experiments with acute calcitriol co-incubation reversed NASH-V rat monocyte supernatant/TNFα-induced monolayer barrier dysfunction in caco-2 cells, cytokine release from MAT-derived adipocytes, and triglyceride synthesis by lean-V rat hepatocytes. Using in vivo and in vitro experiments, our study reported calcitriol signaling in the gut as well as in adipose tissue. Meanwhile, our study suggests that restoration of systemic and intestinal vitamin D deficiency using by chronic vitamin D treatment effectively reduces TNFα-mediated immunological abnormalities associated with the gut-adipose tissue-liver axis and hepatic steatosis in NASH rats."

This paper reports the results of a pilot study aimed at developing, implementing and evaluating the course, ""Applicative Use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Medicine,"" upon medical school entry. The Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, introduced a curriculum reform in 2014 that included the implementation of the course, ""Applicative Use of ICT in Medicine"" for first year medical students. The course was designed using a blended learning format to introduce the concepts of Web-based learning environments. Data regarding student knowledge, use and attitudes towards ICT were prospectively collected for the classes of 2015/16 and 2016/17. The teaching approach was supported by multimedia didactic materials using Moodle LMS. The overall quality of the course was also assessed. The five level Likert scale was used to measure attitudes related to ICT. In total, 1110 students were assessed upon medical school entry. A small number of students (19%) had previous experience with e-learning. Students were largely in agreement that informatics is needed in medical education, and that it is also useful for doctors (4.1±1.0 and 4.1±0.9, respectively). Ability in informatics and use of the Internet in education in the adjusted multivariate regression model were significantly associated with positive student attitudes toward ICT. More than 80% of students stated that they had learned to evaluate medical information and would use the Internet to search medical literature as an additional source for education. The majority of students (77%) agreed that a blended learning approach facilitates access to learning materials and enables time independent learning (72%). Implementing the blended learning course, ""Applicative Use of ICT in Medicine,"" may bridge the gap between medicine and informatics upon medical school entry. Students displayed positive attitudes towards using ICT and gained adequate skills necessary to function effectively in an information-rich environment."
https://openalex.org/W2803100486,"Introduction Neuropathic pain (NP) can cause substantial suffering and, therefore, it must be diagnosed and treated promptly. Diagnosis of NP can be difficult and if made by an expert pain physician is considered the gold standard, however where expert help may not be easily available, screening tools for NP can be used. The painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) is a simple screening tool and has been widely used in several languages. We developed an Arabic version of PD-Q and tested its validity and reliability. Methods The original PD-Q was translated into the Arabic language by a team of experts. The translated version of the PD-Q was administered to the study population, which included patients having moderate to severe pain for at least three months. Reliability of the Arabic version was evaluated by an intra-class-correlation coefficient (ICC) between pre- and post-measures and Cronbach’s α values. Validity was measured by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Expert pain physician diagnosis was considered as the gold standard for comparing the diagnostic accuracy. Results A total of 375 patients were included in the study, of which 153 (40.8%) patients were diagnosed with NP and 222 [59.2%] patients had nociceptive pain. The ICC between pre- and post-PD-Q scale total scores for the overall sample, NP group, and NocP group was 0.970 (95% CI, 0.964–0.976), 0.963 (95% CI, 0.949–0.973), and 0.962 (95% CI, 0.951–0.971), respectively. The Cronbach’s α values for the post-assessment measures in the overall sample, NP group, and nociceptive pain group, were 0.764, 0.684, and 0.746, respectively. The area under the ROC curve was 0.775 (95% CI, 0.725–0.825) for the PD-Q total score. Conclusion The Arabic version of the PD-Q showed good reliability and validity in the detection of NP component in patients with chronic pain."

In this study, we investigated the association between CAS and the development of open-angle glaucoma in the Taiwanese population-based cohort derived from a longitudinal database containing claims data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) program; this study enrolled 2093 patients with CAS and 8372 patients without CAS matched by age and sex from 1999 to 2010. Diagnoses of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) were identified during a follow-up period lasting through December 31, 2013. A Cox proportional hazards model was applied to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) for OAG in the CAS cohort compared with the matched cohort. We found that the HR for open-angle glaucoma in the CAS cohort compared with the matched cohort. The adjusted HR for OAG in the CAS cohort was 1.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.02, P = .008). The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the CAS cohort had a higher cumulative incidence of OAG than did the matched cohort during the follow-up period (log-rank test, P < .001). We concluded that CAS is a significantly independent risk factor for the development of OAG. Our finding is clinically important for the aging population, which has an increasing prevalence of CAS."
https://openalex.org/W2799291378,"In environmental epidemiology, it is often encountered that multiple time series data with a long-term trend, including seasonality, cannot be fully adjusted by the observed covariates. The long-term trend is difficult to separate from abnormal short-term signals of interest. This paper addresses how to estimate the long-term trend in order to recover short-term signals. Our case study demonstrates that the current spline smoothing methods can result in significant positive and negative cross-correlations from the same dataset, depending on how the smoothing parameters are chosen. To circumvent this dilemma, three classes of time series smoothers are proposed to detrend time series data. These smoothers do not require fine tuning of parameters and can be applied to recover short-term signals. The properties of these smoothers are shown with both a case study using a factorial design and a simulation study using datasets generated from the original dataset. General guidelines are provided on how to discover short-term signals from time series with a long-term trend. The benefit of this research is that a problem is identified and characteristics of possible solutions are determined."

(b) To examine the attitudes towards the program of students with ID in the inclusion model.The sample included 31 adults with ID: students with ID who were fully included (N = 10) and students with ID who participated in the adapted enrichment model (N = 21). Crystallized and fluid intelligence were examined (WAIS-III, Wechsler, 1997) and Hebrew abstract verbal tests (Glanz, 1989). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in order to examine the attitudes of students in the inclusion model towards the program.The ANOVAs indicate that the most prominent difference between the groups was in vocabulary, knowledge and working memory. ROC analysis, a fundamental tool for diagnostic test evaluation, was used to determine the students' eligibility for appropriate placement in the two models. Seven tests distinguished between the groups in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The interviews were analyzed according to three phases.The results indicate that students with ID are able to participate in undergraduate courses and achieve academic goals. The general IQ and idioms test seem to be best determiners for appropriate placement of students with ID to one of the two models. The included students with ID are motivated and self-determined in continuing in the program."
https://openalex.org/W2800260276,"Trace metal dynamics have not been studied with respect to growth increments in octocorals. It is particularly unknown whether ontogenetic compartmentalization of trace metal accumulation is species-specific. We studied here for the first time the intracolonial distribution and concentrations of 18 trace metals in the octocorals Subergorgia suberosa, Echinogorgia complexa and E. reticulata that were retrieved from the northern coast of Taiwan. Levels of trace metals were considerably elevated in corals collected at these particular coral habitats as a result of diverse anthropogenic inputs. There was a significant difference in the concentration of metals among octocorals except for Sn. Both species of Echinogorgia contained significantly higher concentrations of Cu, Zn and Al than Subergorgia suberosa. We used for the first time exponential growth curves that describe an age-specific relationship of octocoral trace metal concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb where the distance from the grip point was reflecting younger age as linear regressions. The larger colony (C7) had a lower accumulation rate constant than the smaller one (C6) for Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb, while other trace metals showed an opposite trend. The Cu concentration declined exponentially from the grip point, whereas the concentrations of Zn, Cd, Cr and Pb increased exponentially. In S. suberosa and E. reticulata, Zn occurred primarily in coenosarc tissues and Zn concentrations increased with distance from the grip point in both skeletal and coenosarc tissues. Metals which appeared at high concentrations (e.g. Ca, Zn and Fe) generally tended to accumulate in the outer coenosarc tissues, while metals with low concentrations (e.g. V) tended to accumulate in the soft tissues of the inner skeleton."

https://openalex.org/W2799489100,"Pituitary endocrine cells are supplied by Sox2-expressing stem/progenitor cells in the anterior lobe of the adult pituitary. In relation to their microenvironment (""niche""), SOX2-positive cells exist in two types of niches; the marginal cell layer-niche and the parenchymal-niche. Recently, we isolated dense stem/progenitor cell clusters from the parenchymal-niche as parenchymal stem/progenitor cell (PS)-clusters. We classified these PS-clusters into three subtypes based on differences in S100β-expression (S100β-positive, -negative, and -mixed type), and reported that S100β-positive PS-clusters exhibited the capacity for differentiation into endocrine cells under 3-dimensional cultivation system. In the present study, we further characterized S100β-positive PS-clusters using an in vitro 2-dimensional cultivation system. The results demonstrated that S100β-positive PS-clusters in the 2-dimensional cultivation system proliferated more actively than S100β-negative clusters. Moreover, in 2-dimensional cultivation conditions, S100β-positive PS-clusters showed differentiation capacity into non-endocrine cells (Myogenin-, αSMA-, NG2-, or SOX17-positive cells) but not into endocrine cells, whereas S100β-negative PS-clusters did not. Collectively, PS-clusters were heterogeneous, exhibiting different proliferation and differentiation properties based on the difference in S100β-expression. Specifically, a part of SOX2-positive cells in the parenchymal-niche had capacities for differentiation into non-endocrine cells, and S100β-positive PS-clusters may be in more progressive stages toward differentiation than S100β-negative clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2800637576,"Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate whether hypnotic suggestions can alter knee extensor neuromuscular function at rest and during exercise. Methods Thirteen healthy volunteers (8 men and 5 women, 27 ± 3 years old) took part in this counterbalanced, crossover study including two experimental (hypnosis and control) sessions. Knee extensor neuromuscular function was tested before and after hypnosis suggestion by using a combination of voluntary contraction, transcutaneous femoral nerve electrical stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A fatiguing exercise (sustained submaximal contraction at 20% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force) was also performed to evaluate the potential influence of hypnosis on the extent and origin of neuromuscular adjustments. Results Hypnosis did not (p>0.05) alter MVC force or knee extensor neural properties. Corticospinal excitability, assessed with the amplitude of knee extensor motor evoked potentials, was also unchanged (p>0.05), as was the level of intracortical inhibition assessed with paired pulse TMS (short-interval intracortical inhibition, SICI). Time to task failure (~300 s) was not different (p>0.05) between the two sessions; accordingly, hypnosis did not influence neuromuscular adjustments measured during exercise and at task failure (p>0.05). Conclusion Hypnotic suggestions did not alter neuromuscular properties of the knee extensor muscles under resting condition or during/after exercise, suggesting that hypnosis-induced improvement in exercise performance and enhanced corticospinal excitability might be limited to highly susceptible participants."
https://openalex.org/W2800027302,"Tenovin-6 is the most studied member of a family of small molecules with antitumour activity in vivo. Previously, it has been determined that part of the effects of tenovin-6 associate with its ability to inhibit SirT1 and activate p53. However, tenovin-6 has also been shown to modulate autophagic flux. Here we show that blockage of autophagic flux occurs in a variety of cell lines in response to certain tenovins, that autophagy blockage occurs regardless of the effect of tenovins on SirT1 or p53, and that this blockage is dependent on the aliphatic tertiary amine side chain of these molecules. Additionally, we evaluate the contribution of this tertiary amine to the elimination of proliferating melanoma cells in culture. We also demonstrate that the presence of the tertiary amine is sufficient to lead to death of tumour cells arrested in G1 phase following vemurafenib treatment. We conclude that blockage of autophagic flux by tenovins is necessary to eliminate melanoma cells that survive B-Raf inhibition and achieve total tumour cell kill and that autophagy blockage can be achieved at a lower concentration than by chloroquine. This observation is of great relevance as relapse and resistance are frequently observed in cancer patients treated with B-Raf inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2799908334,"Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Ca2+-dependent protein kinase 1 (NtCDPK1) is involved in feedback regulation of the plant hormone gibberellin through the phosphorylation of the transcription factor, REPRESSION OF SHOOT GROWTH (RSG). Previously, Ser-6 and Thr-21 were identified as autophosphorylation sites in NtCDPK1. Autophosphorylation of Ser-6 and Thr-21 not only decreases the binding affinity of NtCDPK1 for RSG, but also inhibits the homodimerization of NtCDPK1. Furthermore, autophosphorylation decreases the phosphorylation efficiency of RSG. We demonstrated that Ser-6 and Thr-21 of NtCDPK1 are phosphorylated in response to GAs in plants. The substitution of these autophosphorylation sites with Ala enhances the NtCDPK1 overexpression-induced sensitization of seeds to a GA biosynthetic inhibitor during germination. These findings suggested that autophosphorylation of Ser-6 and Thr-21 prevents excessive phosphorylation of RSG. In this study, we attempted to determine which autophosphorylation site is responsible for the functional regulation of NtCDPK1. Ser-6 was autophosphorylated within 1 min, whereas Thr-21 required over 5 min to be completely autophosphorylated. Furthermore, we found that Ser-6 and Thr-21 were autophosphorylated by inter- and intramolecular mechanisms, respectively, which may be reflected in the faster autophosphorylation of Ser-6. Although both autophosphorylation sites were involved in the reduction of the binding affinity of NtCDPK1 for RSG and the inhibition of NtCDPK1 homodimerization, autophosphorylation of Ser-6 alone was sufficient to decrease the kinase activity of NtCDPK1 for RSG. These results suggest that autophosphorylation of Ser-6 is important for the rapid reduction of NtCDPK1 kinase activity for RSG, whereas that of Thr-21 may play an auxiliary role."
https://openalex.org/W2799978040,"Enzymatic functionalization of cross-β structured protein nanofibrils has hitherto resulted in a severe reduction of the catalytic efficiency of high turnover biocatalysts. It has been speculated that steric restrictions and mass transport pose limits on the attached enzymes, but detailed kinetics analyzing this have not yet been reported. For a more comprehensive understanding, we studied protein nanofibrils endowed with TEM1, a β-lactamase from Escherichia coli. The packing density of TEM1 along the fibrils was controlled by co-fibrillation; in other words, the N-terminal ureidosuccinate transporter Ure2(1–80) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was simultaneously aggregated with the chimeric proteins TEM1-Ure2(1–80). The mature fibrils were trapped in a column, and the rate of ampicillin hydrolysis was recorded using a continuous substrate flow. The turnover rate was plotted as a function of substrate molecules available per enzyme per second, which demonstrated that an elevated substrate availability counteracts mass transport limitations. To analyze this data set, we derived a kinetic model, which makes it possible to easily characterize and compare enzymes packed in columns. The functional TEM1 nanofibrils possess 80% of the catalytic turnover rate compared to free TEM1 in solution. Altogether, we have created protein nanofibrils that can effectively hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotic contaminations and provided a groundwork strategy for other highly functional enzymatic nanofibrils."

S uppressor of c opper s ensitivity (Scs) proteins contribute to this response in some bacteria, but have poorly defined molecular functions. Furlong et al. now demonstrate that two Scs proteins from Proteus mirabilis provide a redox relay functionally equivalent to, but structurally distinct from, the Dsb proteins that orchestrate disulfide bonding in Escherichia coli, emphasizing the wide prevalence of this mechanism in bacteria."
