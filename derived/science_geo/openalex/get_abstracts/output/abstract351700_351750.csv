https://openalex.org/W1619082318,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder characterized pathologically by ubiquitinated TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) inclusions. The function of TDP-43 in the nervous system is uncertain, and a mechanistic role in neurodegeneration remains speculative. We identified neighboring mutations in a highly conserved region of TARDBP in sporadic and familial ALS cases. TARDBPM337V segregated with disease within one kindred and a genome-wide scan confirmed that linkage was restricted to chromosome 1p36, which contains the TARDBP locus. Mutant forms of TDP-43 fragmented in vitro more readily than wild type and, in vivo, caused neural apoptosis and developmental delay in the chick embryo. Our evidence suggests a pathophysiological link between TDP-43 and ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2027385173,"Stalactites, stalagmites and the many other forms of mineral deposits found in caves are a mainstay of climate studies, recording oxygen isotope ratios in limestone laid down over time. That pattern links to the water temperature of ancient oceans, and thus to climate. A new oxygen isotope record from Sanbao Cave, central China, tells the story of the region's climate stretching back 200,000 years, filling gaps in the record of a particularly important climate event, the East Asian monsoon. High-resolution speleothem records from China have provided insights into the factors that control the strength of the East Asian monsoon1,2,3,4. Our understanding of these factors remains incomplete, however, owing to gaps in the record of monsoon history over the past two interglacial–glacial cycles. In particular, missing sections have hampered our ability to test ideas about orbital-scale controls on the monsoon5,6,7, the causes of millennial-scale events8,9 and relationships between changes in the monsoon and climate in other regions. Here we present an absolute-dated oxygen isotope record from Sanbao cave, central China, that completes a Chinese-cave-based record of the strength of the East Asian monsoon that covers the past 224,000 years. The record is dominated by 23,000-year-long cycles that are synchronous within dating errors with summer insolation at 65° N (ref. 10), supporting the idea that tropical/subtropical monsoons respond dominantly and directly to changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation on orbital timescales5. The cycles are punctuated by millennial-scale strong-summer-monsoon events (Chinese interstadials1), and the new record allows us to identify the complete series of these events over the past two interglacial–glacial cycles. Their duration decreases and their frequency increases during glacial build-up in both the last and penultimate glacial periods, indicating that ice sheet size affects their character and pacing. The ages of the events are exceptionally well constrained and may thus serve as benchmarks for correlating and calibrating climate records."

https://openalex.org/W1985820605,"Stomatal pores, formed by two surrounding guard cells in the epidermis of plant leaves, allow influx of atmospheric carbon dioxide in exchange for transpirational water loss. Stomata also restrict the entry of ozone--an important air pollutant that has an increasingly negative impact on crop yields, and thus global carbon fixation and climate change. The aperture of stomatal pores is regulated by the transport of osmotically active ions and metabolites across guard cell membranes. Despite the vital role of guard cells in controlling plant water loss, ozone sensitivity and CO2 supply, the genes encoding some of the main regulators of stomatal movements remain unknown. It has been proposed that guard cell anion channels function as important regulators of stomatal closure and are essential in mediating stomatal responses to physiological and stress stimuli. However, the genes encoding membrane proteins that mediate guard cell anion efflux have not yet been identified. Here we report the mapping and characterization of an ozone-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, slac1. We show that SLAC1 (SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1) is preferentially expressed in guard cells and encodes a distant homologue of fungal and bacterial dicarboxylate/malic acid transport proteins. The plasma membrane protein SLAC1 is essential for stomatal closure in response to CO2, abscisic acid, ozone, light/dark transitions, humidity change, calcium ions, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide. Mutations in SLAC1 impair slow (S-type) anion channel currents that are activated by cytosolic Ca2+ and abscisic acid, but do not affect rapid (R-type) anion channel currents or Ca2+ channel function. A low homology of SLAC1 to bacterial and fungal organic acid transport proteins, and the permeability of S-type anion channels to malate suggest a vital role for SLAC1 in the function of S-type anion channels."

https://openalex.org/W2019124038,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses is considered to underlie learning and memory and is associated with the enlargement of dendritic spines. Because the consolidation of memory and LTP require protein synthesis, it is important to clarify how protein synthesis affects spine enlargement. In rat brain slices, the repetitive pairing of postsynaptic spikes and two-photon uncaging of glutamate at single spines (a spike-timing protocol) produced both immediate and gradual phases of spine enlargement in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The gradual enlargement was strongly dependent on protein synthesis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) action, often associated with spine twitching, and was induced specifically at the spines that were immediately enlarged by the synaptic stimulation. Thus, this spike-timing protocol is an efficient trigger for BDNF secretion and induces protein synthesis–dependent long-term enlargement at the level of single spines."

https://openalex.org/W2058353078,"Defining critical points of modulation across heterogeneous clinical syndromes may provide insight into new therapeutic approaches. Coagulation initiated by the cytokine-receptor family member known as tissue factor is a hallmark of systemic inflammatory response syndromes in bacterial sepsis and viral haemorrhagic fevers, and anticoagulants can be effective in severe sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation. The precise mechanism coupling coagulation and inflammation remains unresolved. Here we show that protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) signalling sustains a lethal inflammatory response that can be interrupted by inhibition of either thrombin or PAR1 signalling. The sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) axis is a downstream component of PAR1 signalling, and by combining chemical and genetic probes for S1P receptor 3 (S1P3) we show a critical role for dendritic cell PAR1-S1P3 cross-talk in regulating amplification of inflammation in sepsis syndrome. Conversely, dendritic cells sustain escalated systemic coagulation and are the primary hub at which coagulation and inflammation intersect within the lymphatic compartment. Loss of dendritic cell PAR1-S1P3 signalling sequesters dendritic cells and inflammation into draining lymph nodes, and attenuates dissemination of interleukin-1beta to the lungs. Thus, activation of dendritic cells by coagulation in the lymphatics emerges as a previously unknown mechanism that promotes systemic inflammation and lethality in decompensated innate immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2084060774,"Massive stars are very rare, but their extreme luminosities make them both the only type of young star we can observe in distant galaxies and the dominant energy sources in the Universe today. They form rarely because efficient radiative cooling keeps most star--forming gas clouds close to isothermal as they collapse, and this favours fragmentation into stars of one solar mass or lower. Heating of a cloud by accreting low-mass stars within it can prevent fragmentation and allow formation of massive stars, but the necessary properties for a cloud to form massive stars-and therefore where massive stars form in a galaxy--have not yet been determined. Here we show that only clouds with column densities of at least 1 g cm(-2) can avoid fragmentation and form massive stars. This threshold, and the environmental variation of the stellar initial mass function that it implies, naturally explain the characteristic column densities associated with massive star clusters and the difference between the radial profiles of Halpha and ultraviolet emission in galactic disks. The existence of a threshold also implies that the initial mass function should show detectable variation with environment within the Galaxy, that the characteristic column densities of clusters containing massive stars should vary between galaxies, and that star formation rates in some galactic environments may have been systematically underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W2054645758,"In brain and tumor cells, the hexokinase isoforms HK-I and HK-II bind to the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in the outer mitochondrial membrane. We have previously shown that HK-I decreases murine VDAC1 (mVDAC1) channel conductance, inhibits cytochrome c release, and protects against apoptotic cell death. Now, we define mVDAC1 residues, found in two cytoplasmic domains, involved in the interaction with HK-I. Protection against cell death by HK-I, as induced by overexpression of native or mutated mVDAC1, served to identify the mVDAC1 amino acids required for interaction with HK-I. HK-I binding to mVDAC1 either in isolated mitochondria or reconstituted in a bilayer was inhibited upon mutation of specific VDAC1 residues. HK-I anti-apoptotic activity was also diminished upon mutation of these amino acids. HK-I-mediated inhibition of cytochrome c release induced by staurosporine was also diminished in cells expressing VDAC1 mutants. Our results thus offer new insights into the mechanism by which HK-I promotes tumor cell survival via inhibition of cytochrome c release through HK-I binding to VDAC1. These results, moreover, point to VDAC1 as a key player in mitochondrially mediated apoptosis and implicate an HK-I-VDAC1 interaction in the regulation of apoptosis. Finally, these findings suggest that interference with the binding of HK-I to mitochondria by VDAC1-derived peptides may offer a novel strategy by which to potentiate the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2065918682,"Dust plays a critical role in Earth's climate system and serves as a natural source of iron and other micronutrients to remote regions of the ocean. We have generated records of dust deposition over the past 500,000 years at three sites spanning the breadth of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Equatorial Pacific dust fluxes are highly correlated with global ice volume and with dust fluxes to Antarctica, which suggests that dust generation in interhemispheric source regions exhibited a common response to climate change over late-Pleistocene glacial cycles. Our results provide quantitative constraints on the variability of aeolian iron supply to the equatorial Pacific Ocean and, more generally, on the potential contribution of dust to past climate change and to related changes in biogeochemical cycles."

https://openalex.org/W2004430284,"Iron is essential for most living organisms, and thus iron deficiency poses a major abiotic stress in crop production. Plants induce iron utilization systems under conditions of low iron availability, but the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation under iron deficiency remain largely unknown. We identified a novel transcription factor of rice and barley, IDEF2, which specifically binds to the iron deficiency-responsive cis-acting element 2 (IDE2) by yeast one-hybrid screening. IDEF2 belongs to an uncharacterized branch of the NAC transcription factor family and exhibits novel properties of sequence recognition. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay and cyclic amplification and selection of targets experiment revealed that IDEF2 predominantly recognized CA(A/C)G(T/C)(T/C/A)(T/C/A) within IDE2 as the core-binding site. IDEF2 transcripts are constitutively present in rice roots and leaves. Repression of the function of IDEF2 by the RNA interference (RNAi) technique and chimeric repressor gene-silencing technology (CRES-T) caused aberrant iron homeostasis in rice. Several genes up-regulated by iron deficiency, including the Fe(II)-nicotianamine transporter gene OsYSL2, were less induced by iron deficiency in the RNAi rice of IDEF2, suggesting that IDEF2 is involved in the regulation of these genes. Many genes with repressed expression in IDEF2 RNAi rice possessed the IDEF2-binding core sites in their promoters, and the flanking sequences were also highly homologous to IDE2. IDEF2 bound to OsYSL2 promoter region containing the binding core site, suggesting direct regulation of OsYSL2 expression.

Iron is an essential element for most living organisms, and iron deficiency, a major abiotic stress, reduces crop yields, especially in calcareous soils in which the solubility of iron is extremely low because of the high soil pH. Higher plants have evolved two major strategies for iron acquisition, reduction (referred to as strategy I) and chelation (strategy II) (1Römheld V. Marschner H. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 175-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strategy II mechanism is specific to graminaceous plants and is mediated by natural iron chelators, the mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) 3The abbreviations used are: MA, mugineic acid; IDE2, iron deficiency-responsive element 2; CASTing, cyclic amplification and selection of targets; RNAi, RNA interference; ORF, open reading frame; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; UTR, untranslated region; NT, nontransgenic rice; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NA, nicotianamine; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; AD, activation domain.

Three molecules of S-adenosylmethionine are combined to form nicotianamine (NA) in both graminaceous and non-graminaceous plants. In graminaceous plants, NA is converted into a 3″-keto intermediate and then deoxymugineic acid (3Mori S. Nishizawa N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1081-1092Google Scholar, 4Shojima S.

Recently, we have identified a novel ABI3/VP1 family transcription factor that specifically recognizes IDE1; this we designated as IDEF1 (IDE-binding factor 1) (27Kobayashi T. Ogo Y. Itai R.N.

IDEF1 transactivates IDE1-mediated expression under iron-deficient conditions and regulates several genes involved in iron acquisition. In this study, we isolated a novel NAC domain transcription factor, IDEF2, which specifically binds to IDE2, by yeast one-hybrid screening. We provide evidence to support that IDEF2 functions as a key transcription factor regulating the iron-deficiency response. Construction of Reporter Vectors for the Yeast One-hybrid—The reporter vectors for the yeast one-hybrid were constructed using the target DNA fragments shown in supplemental Table S1. IDE1-IDE2 × 2 indicates the target DNA of a twice-repeated DNA fragment of tandemly arranged IDE1 and IDE2. IDE1 × 4 and IDE2 × 3 indicate four and three times tandemly repeated DNA fragments of IDE1 and IDE2, respectively. The double-stranded DNA fragments of the target DNA were synthesized by sense oligomers and antisense primers, followed by in-filling using DNA polymerase. These fragments were inserted into reporter vectors using the restriction sites shown in supplemental Table S1. Yeast One-hybrid Screening—We performed the yeast one-hybrid screening of rice using the MATCHMAKER library construction and screening kits (K1617-1; Clontech) according to the user manual (PT3529-1; Clontech). The cDNA expression library was constructed with mRNA from iron-deficient rice roots purified with the NucleoTrap mRNA mini kit (Macherey-Nagel, Easton, PA) and the SMART III™ Oligonucleotide primer (Clontech) and the CDS III/6 primer (Clontech). Screening was performed with pHIS2-IDE1-IDE2 × 2 on medium lacking His, but in the presence of 50 mm 3-aminotriazole. The isolated IDEF2 clone included all of the longest open-reading frame (ORF) of AK099540, except for the 80 bp at the 3′ end of the ORF. The yeast one-hybrid screening of barley was performed using the MATCHMAKER one-hybrid system (K1603-1; Clontech) according to the user manual (PT1031-1; Clontech). The cDNA expression library of iron-deficient barley roots was constructed with the pGAD424 vector (Clontech), modified by inserting restriction sites (BamHI-SalI-HindIII-XbaI-EcoRV-NotI-EcoRI) between the EcoRI and SalI sites. Screening was performed with pHISi-IDE2 × 3 on medium lacking His but in the presence of 80 mm 3-aminotriazole. The isolated HvIDEF2 clone was predicted to include the whole ORF. LacZ Assay of the Yeast One-hybrid—The LacZ assay was performed according to the Yeast Protocols Handbook (Clontech). The reporter vectors and effector vectors were introduced into yeast YM4271 (Clontech); 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for the experiment with IDEF2, and o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for the experiment with HvIDEF2, respectively, were used as substrates. Yeast cells transformed with the empty pGAD7-Rec2 vector (Clontech) or pGAD424 vector were assayed as a negative control for IDEF2 and HvIDEF2, respectively. For the transcription-activating assay, the ORF of IDEF2 in the pGADT7-Rec2 vector was amplified with the primers 5′-AAGCTTGAATTCATGGCTCAAACTTGCTTGCCACC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGATGGACGCGAGTCACCAGATG-3′ and cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO (Invitrogen). The cloned and verified IDEF2 ORF was inserted into the HindIII and the XbaI sites of the yeast expression vector pYH23 (10Takahashi M. Yamaguchi H. Nakanishi H. Shioiri T. Nishizawa N.K. Mori S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and introduced into yeast YM4271. EMSA and CASTing—The ORF of IDEF2 in the yeast transcription-activation assay vector was inserted into pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) by EcoRI and XbaI sites (MBP-IDEF2). The NAC domain of IDEF2 was amplified using primers of 5′-CTCGAGTCTAGAATGGCTCAAACTTGCTTGCC-3′ and 5′-TTAATCTGCATGCTCCCATTCTTC-3′ and the full-length cDNA of IDEF2 (AK099540), provided by the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, as a template. The amplified fragment was cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO and the sequence verified. The inserted NAC domain was cloned into the pMAL-c2 vector at the XbaI and HindIII sites (MBP-IDEF2 NAC domain). These fusion plasmids, as well as pMAL-c2 itself (which expresses MBP-LacZ fusion), were introduced into Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue. The maltose-binding fusion proteins were produced and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). EMSA was carried out using the MBP-IDEF2 protein as described previously (19Ogo Y. Itai R.N. Nakanishi H. Inoue H. Kobayashi T. Suzuki M. Takahashi M. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. J. Exp.

Five hundred nanograms of MBP-IDEF2 were incubated with 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 51 mm KCl, 6% glycerol, 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 200 ng of poly(dG-dC)2 (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.5-1.0 ng of the IDE2 probe, which consists of 27-bp IDE2 and its flanking regions corresponding to -272/-227 region of the IDS2 promoter (25Kobayashi T. Nakayama Y. Itai R.N. Nakanishi H. Yoshihara T. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant J. 2003; 36: 780-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For competition analysis, the IDE2 sequence was substituted for its derivatives, as shown in Fig. 2a. The -368/-323 region of the OsYSL2 promoter (5′-GACAATGTTTTATTTATATCAAAACGTGCCAAGTATAAGTTGCAAA-3′) and the -83/-38 region of the AK065090 promoter (5′-GATGTACTACAAGTATTGCAGACGATGGGACACGTACACTAGCTAG-3′) from the predicted transcriptional initiation sites were also used as competitors in Fig. 8 (IDEF2-binding core sites are underlined). The whole sequences of the 35S promoter fragments used are shown in Fig. 2f. CASTing was carried out with the MBP-IDEF2 NAC domain proteins as described previously (19Ogo Y. Itai R.N. Nakanishi H.

The IDE2 probe was incubated with 500 ng of the MBP-IDEF2 fusion protein. Competition experiments were carried out by adding 50-fold excess unlabeled competitors. OsYSL2 and AK065090 competitors were composed of -368/-323 region of the OsYSL2 promoter and the -83/-38 region of the AK065090 promoter, respectively, each containing two IDEF2-binding core sites. The shifted bands are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern Blot and Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (19Ogo Y.

For the IDEF2 probe, the 500 bp of the non-NAC domain region in the 3′ end of the ORF was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-CACCCAGTCCTGTAATTGAGGGGC-3′ and 5′-GTGGGAACTGCATGCTGGGT-3′. To detect the expression of HvIDEF2, the HvIDEF2 insertion in the modified pGAD424 was digested using AflII and SacI sites, and the 800 bp-fragment, composed mainly of the non-NAC domain region and the 3′-UTR, was used as a specific probe. For the OsYSL2 probe, a gene-specific region (16Koike S. Inoue H. Mizuno D. Takahashi M. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant J. 2004; 39: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously (15Ishimaru Y. Suzuki M. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki K.

Plant J. 2006; 45: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) with slight modification. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using Rever-Tra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) priming with (dT)30. The primers used in the RT-PCR were 5′-AGATCCGCCGCAACTGCTTC-3′ and 5′-CTTATTAACGCGCGCACGGC-3′ for AK065090, 5′-ACCCGCAAAGAAGGGTGCTA-3′ and 5′-GCCTGGAATACCGTAACAATACTG-3′ for AK099523, and 5′-GTGGCCACAGCAAGGAGCTG-3′ and 5′-CATTCAGAGTGATGATAGAGGG-3′ for AK103890. Observation of Subcellular Localization—The ORF of IDEF2 was amplified by PCR with primers of 5′-GGTACCATGGCTCAAACTTGCTTGCC-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCTGACAGTGGGAACTGCATGC-3′ and the full-length cDNA of IDEF2 as the template. The amplified fragment was cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO, and the sequence was verified. The inserted ORF was cloned into CaMV35S-SalI-KpnI-sGFP(S65T)-NOS3 (15Ishimaru Y. Suzuki M. Tsukamoto T.

Niwa, University of Shizuoka, Japan, at the KpnI and SacI sites. Transient gene expression in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells and fluorescence observation were carried out as described previously (28Mizuno D. Higuchi K. Sakamoto T. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Construction of IDEF2 RNAi Rice and CRES-T Rice—To suppress IDEF2 expression, a binary vector for RNA interference (RNAi), pIG121-RNAi-DEST, was constructed (20Ogo Y. Itai R.N. Nakanishi H. Kobayashi T. Takahashi M. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant J. 2007; 51: 366-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) using the Gateway technology by modifying pIG121Hm (29Hiei Y. Ohta S. Komari T. Kumashiro T. Plant J. 1994; 6: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Three hundred base pairs of the 3′-UTR of IDEF2 was amplified with the primers 5′-CACCTCCTCAGTAGCGCGCCAGGC-3′ and 5′-TGTCATAACTAAGTCCAGAAC-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into pIG121-RNAi-DEST as described previously (20Ogo Y. Itai R.N. Nakanishi H. Kobayashi T. Takahashi M. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant J. 2007; 51: 366-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To construct the vector for the chimeric repressor gene-silencing technology (CRES-T) system, the coding sequences of IDEF2, except for the stop codon, were amplified with the primer 5′-CTCGAGTCTAGAATGGCTCAAACTTGCTTGCC-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCTTAAGCGAAACCCAAACGGAGTTCTAGATCCAGATCGAGTGACAGTGGGAACTGCATGCTGGG-3′. The latter primer included the repression domain SRDX coding region (30Hiratsu K. Matsui K. Koyama T. Ohme-Takagi M. Plant J. 2003; 34: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO, and the sequence was verified. The inserted ORF-SRDX was cloned into a construct I2 vector (26Kobayashi T. Nakayama Y. Takahashi M. Inoue H. Nakanishi H. Yoshihara T. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 2004; 50: 1167-1175Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) at the XhoI/SacI sites. Then the rice actin 1 promoter restricted by HindIII and SalI in pUC19 was inserted at HindIII and XhoI sites of this vector. Rice actin 1 promoter was amplified using the rice genome (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) as a template and the following sequences, 5′-AAGCTTCGAGGTCATTCATATGCTTG-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCTTCTACCTACAAAAAAGCT-3′, and inserted into pUC19 (Toyobo) at HindIII and SalI sites. The transformation of rice (O. sativa L. cv. Tsukinohikari) was performed by Dr. Toki and H. Onodera at the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences as described previously (31Toki S. Hara N. Ono K. Onodera H. Tagiri A. Oka S. Tanaka H. Plant J. 2006; 47: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Twenty independently transformed RNAi and 20 independently transformed CRES-T rice plants were generated. T1 seeds were used for analysis. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions—Rice was grown hydroponically as described previously (18Kobayashi T. Suzuki M. Inoue H. Itai R.N. Takahashi M. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 1305-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) under 14-h/10-h light/dark cycles and at 30/25 °C. For Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3a), iron deficiency was initiated 27 days after germination by omitting Fe(III)-EDTA from the culture medium, and plants were harvested on days 5 and 11. For microarray and Northern blot analysis of IDEF2 RNAi and CRES-T rice, iron deficiency was initiated 29-31 days after germination when plant height reached about 34 cm. Plants were harvested on day 7 of iron deficiency. Barley was grown hydroponically, as described previously (19Ogo Y. Itai R.N. Nakanishi H. Inoue H. Kobayashi T. Suzuki M. Takahashi M. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 2867-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Plants were harvested on days 1-3 of iron deficiency for construction of the cDNA library for the yeast one-hybrid screening and days 5 and 9 for Northern blot analysis. Determination of Metal Concentrations—IDEF2 RNAi rice, CRES-T rice, and nontransgenic rice (NT) were transferred to iron-deficient or iron-sufficient medium when their height reached about 45 cm. Plants were harvested 9 days after transfer. The roots were washed serially in 5 mm EDTA and ion-exchanged water. The plants were then wet-ashed with 11 m HNO3 for 40 min at 230 °C using a MarsXpress oven (CEM Corp., Matthews, NC). The metal concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry as described previously (15Ishimaru Y. Suzuki M. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki K. Nakazono M. Kobayashi T. Wada Y. Watanabe S. Matsuhashi S. Takahashi M. Nakanishi H. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. Plant J. 2006; 45: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Oligo-DNA Microarray Analysis—The rice 44 K oligo-DNA microarray (Agilent Technologies, San Jose, CA) contains 43,144 unique 60-mer oligonucleotides that were synthesized based on sequence data from the Rice Full-length cDNA Project. Total RNA from RNAi23 and NT rice was prepared from roots or shoots from four biological replicates using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Microarray hybridization, scanning, and data analysis were performed as described previously (19Ogo Y. Itai R.N. Nakanishi H. Inoue H. Kobayashi T. Suzuki M. Takahashi M. Mori S. Nishizawa N.K. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 2867-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The reproducibility of the microarray analysis was assessed by a dye swap in each experiment. Genes showing a signal value of >100 and a significant t test (p < 0.05) were further analyzed. The RNAi/NT ratio was calculated as (average signal values of the RNAi rice)/(average signal values of the NT rice). The -Fe/+Fe in the NT plants was calculated as (average signal values of the NT rice under iron-deficient conditions)/(average signal values under iron-sufficient conditions), and these ratios were used for identifying iron-deficiency induction of the genes. cis Search—The IDEF2-binding sequence was searched within 500 nucleotides upstream of the predicted transcriptional initiation site of the genes. The rice genome sequences were obtained from the Rice Annotation Project Data base. The IDEF2-binding site and its flanking sequences were compared with IDE2 and their homology was calculated without gaps. Identification of IDEF2 as a Transcription Factor Recognizing IDE2—We conducted yeast one-hybrid screening to identify transcription factors that bind to IDE1 or IDE2. A yeast GAL4 activation domain (AD) fusion cDNA library was constructed from mRNA prepared from iron-deficient rice roots. The screening was performed with a reporter vector that had HIS3 fused to a twice-repeated 45-bp DNA fragment of tandemly arranged IDE1 and IDE2 (IDE1-IDE2 × 2) (Fig. 1a). Through the screening of 3.2 × 106 cDNA clones, one positive clone was obtained (clone 51), which encoded a NAC family transcription factor corresponding to the rice full-length cDNA, AK099540. To examine recognition sequences of clone 51 within IDE1-IDE2 × 2, we constructed a reporter gene that had lacZ fused to four tandemly repeated IDE1 (IDE1 × 4) or three tandemly repeated IDE2 (IDE2 × 3) (Fig. 1a). In yeast cells carrying clone 51, IDE1-IDE2 × 2 or IDE2 × 3 induced substantial LacZ activity, whereas IDE1 × 4 did not (Fig. 1b). These results revealed that clone 51 preferentially bound IDE2 but not IDE1. We designated clone 51 as IDEF2 (IDE-binding factor 2). IDEF2 induced gene expression even in the absence of AD in yeast cells carrying the lacZ gene fused to IDE2-IDE1 × 2 or IDE2 × 3 (Fig. 1c), indicating that IDEF2 works as a transcriptional activator. As IDE1 and IDE2 were identified from the promoter of the barley gene IDS2, which encodes dioxygenase of MAs, we also conducted yeast one-hybrid screening with the cDNA library of barley. Then 5.0 × 106 cDNA clones of iron-deficient barley roots wer"

Signaling initiated by trypsin-like serine proteases are transduced across the plasma membrane primarily by members of the protease-activated receptor (PAR) family of G protein-coupled receptors. Here we show, using Ca2+ flux assays, that KLK4 signals via both PAR-1 and PAR-2 but not via PAR-4. Dose-response analysis over the enzyme concentration range 0.1–1000 nm indicated that KLK4-induced Ca2+ mobilization via PAR-1 is more potent than via PAR-2, whereas KLK4 displayed greater efficacy via the latter PAR. We confirmed the specificity of KLK4 signaling via PAR-2 using in vitro protease cleavage assays and anti-phospho-ERK1/2/total ERK1/2 Western blot analysis of PAR-2-overexpressing and small interfering RNA-mediated receptor knockdown cell lines. Consistently, confocal microscopy analyses indicated that KLK4 initiates loss of PAR-2 from the cell surface and receptor internalization. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated the co-expression of agonist and PAR-2 in primary prostate cancer and bone metastases, suggesting that KLK4 signaling via this receptor will have pathological relevance.

For example, stable overexpression of KLK4 in prostate cancer PC-3 cells resulted in an increased ability of these cells to migrate, accompanied by a transition from an epithelial morphology to a fibroblastic shape and, consistently, a significant decrease in E-cadherin protein levels and an increase in vimentin expression (11Veveris-Lowe T.L.

In addition, using an inducible expression system, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of KLK4 results in significantly increased colony formation, migration, and proliferation of PC-3 cells and another prostate cancer cell line, DU145 (12Klokk T.I. Kilander A. Xi Z. Waehre H. Risberg B. Danielsen H.E. Saatcioglu F. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5221-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KLK4 protein levels are elevated in malignant prostate compared with normal tissue (12Klokk T.I. Kilander A. Xi Z. Waehre H. Risberg B. Danielsen H.E. Saatcioglu F.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7114-7120Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Most recently, using co-culture systems, it has been shown that KLK4 is a potential mediator of cellular interactions between prostate cancer cells and osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) in bone metastases (15Gao J. Collard R.L. Bui L. Herington A.C. Nicol D.L. Clements J.A. Prostate. 2007; 67: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) subfamily comprising protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 to PAR-4, in contrast to other GPCRs, which are activated by docking of soluble ligands, are irreversibly activated by the action of proteases (16Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 17Macfarlane S.R. Seatter M.J. Kanke T. Hunter G.D. Plevin R. Pharmacol.

Nephrology. 2007; 12: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, PAR activation is almost exclusively mediated by trypsin fold serine proteases with substrate specificity for cleavage following arginine or lysine residues. Cleavage-inducing activation occurs at a unique site within the amino-terminal exodomain of the receptor, generating a new amino terminus that serves as a tethered ligand that binds intramolecularly, causing allosteric changes within the PAR, followed by receptor coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins and signal transduction (16Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Importantly, cleavage downstream of the activation site fails to mobilize Ca2+ and results in unresponsiveness to protease agonists (20Dulon S. Cande C. Bunnett N.W. Hollenberg M.D. Chignard M.

Recently, several members of the KLK family have been shown to initiate trans-plasma membrane signal transduction via PARs. Oikonomopoulou et al. (22Oikonomopoulou K. Hansen K.K. Saifeddine M. Tea I.

This group also showed that KLK5 and KLK6 activate PAR-2 (22Oikonomopoulou K. Hansen K.K. Saifeddine M. Tea I. Blaber M. Blaber S.I. Scarisbrick I. Andrade-Gordon P. Cottrell G.S. Bunnett N.W.

KLK5 and KLK14 signaling via PAR-2 has been demonstrated independently in a study that also showed that KLK7 and KLK8 are not capable of signaling through this receptor (24Stefansson K. Brattsand M.

Since the mechanism by which KLK4 mediates its effects on cells is not known, we have examined the ability of this protease to initiate cell signaling via members of the PAR family by examining changes in intracellular calcium ion concentration. We show that KLK4 initiates Ca2+ mobilization via PAR-1 and PAR-2 but not via PAR-4. Focusing on PAR-2, we have also examined the ability of KLK4 to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), including siRNA knockdown approaches, to demonstrate that KLK4 signaling is specifically mediated by this receptor. The potential physiological relevance of KLK4 signaling via PAR-2 was explored by immunohistochemical analysis of agonist and receptor expression in primary prostate cancer and bone metastasis lesions. We have also examined cellular consequences of KLK4-mediated signaling via PAR-2 in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Reagents—PAR-2 activating peptide (AP; SLIGKV), PAR-1 AP (TFLLR), PAR-4 AP (AYPGKF) as the carboxyl amide, a peptide spanning the PAR-2 serine protease activation site (ortho-aminobenzoic acid-SKGR↓SLIGK(N-(2,4-dintrophenyl)ethylenediamine)-Asp-OH, where the downward arrow indicates the cleaved peptide bond), and a tripeptide substrate for kinetic studies (benzyl-FVR-p-nitroanilide) were from Auspep (Parkville, Australia); trypsin was from Worthington; thermolysin was from Calbiochem; 4-methylumbelliferone, 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate, and the thermolysin inhibitor phosphoramidon were from Sigma; and EZ-link NHS-SS-Biotin and ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin were from Pierce. Antibodies were purchased from the following vendors: phospho-specific monoclonal antibody to ERK1/2 and rabbit anti-ERK1/2 antibody, Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); monoclonal anti-PAR-1 (ATAP2), anti-PAR-2 (SAM11), and anti-GFP antibodies, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody, Abcam (Sapphire Bioscience Pty. Ltd., Redfern, Australia). Cell Culture—The nontumorigenic and tumorigenic prostate epithelium-derived cell lines (RWPE-1 and RWPE-2, respectively) and the prostate cancer-derived cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Lung murine fibroblasts (LMF) from Par-1 null mice (25Darrow A.L. Fung-Leung W.P. Ye R.D. Santulli R.J. Cheung W.M. Derian C.K. Burns C.L. Damiano B.P. Zhou L. Keenan C.M. Peterson P.A. Andrade-Gordon P. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 76: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) stably expressing human PAR-1, PAR-2 or PAR-4 (26Andrade-Gordon P. Maryanoff B.E. Derian C.K. Zhang H.C. Addo M.F. Darrow A.L. Eckardt A.J. Hoekstra W.J. McComsey D.F. Oksenberg D. Reynolds E.E. Santulli R.J. Scarborough R.M. Smith C.E. White K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12257-12262Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were from Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development (Spring House, PA). These cells are designated PAR-1-LMF, PAR-2-LMF, and PAR-4-LMF, respectively. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and propagated in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cultures of PAR-1-LMF, PAR-2-LMF, and PAR-4-LMF murine fibroblasts were supplemented with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Insect Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells were grown in SF9002 serum-free medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 27 °C. Expression Constructs and Transfections—An insect cell KLK4 expression construct was generated by ligating the human KLK4 open reading frame, including the prepro region from the previously published pDNA3.1:KLK4 construct (11Veveris-Lowe T.L. Lawrence M.G. Collard R.L. Bui L. Herington A.C. Nicol D.L. Clements J.A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2005; 12: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), into the pIB/V5-His vector (Invitrogen). This construct generates the complete KLK4 amino acid sequence followed by V5 (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) and His6 tags. Insect Sf9 cells were transfected using Cellfectin (Invitrogen). A mammalian expression construct encoding PAR-2 with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the COOH terminus was generated in the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). A PCR employing Pfu DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was used to amplify the PAR-2 coding region. Following amplification and purification, the PAR-2 PCR product was restriction-digested and then ligated into pEGFP-N1. Mammalian cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The sequence of both constructs was verified. Generation and Purification of Recombinant KLK4 (rKLK4)—Following transfection with the KLK4-pIB/V5-His construct, stable Sf9 cells were selected with 50 μg/ml Blasticidin (Invivo-Gen, San Diego, CA). KLK4 was purified from conditioned media from these cells using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow resin by following the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen, Doncaster, Australia). Eluted fractions containing KLK4, identified by analysis of a Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gel, were pooled and then concentrated. Following dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight, KLK4 was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Activation of rKLK4—Recombinant zymogen KLK4 was incubated with the metalloendopeptidase thermolysin in PBS at pH 7.4 for 1 h at 37 °C (KLK4/thermolysin ratio 80:1). The amount of active enzyme produced was quantified by active site titration using the pseudosuicide inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate (27Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Zymogen KLK4 and thermolysin-treated KLK4 were examined on a Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gel, protein bands were excised, and the amino terminus of the excised treated KLK4 was sequenced by Edman degradation at the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility (North Ryde, Australia). Thermolysin activity was stopped by the addition of phosphoramidon (10 μm). Kinetic Measurements of Activated rKLK4—Determination of kinetic parameters was performed using 40 nm active rKLK4 against the tripeptide substrate benzyl-FVR-p-nitroanilide. Assays were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm CaCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 at 28 °C by following p-nitroanilide release photometrically at 405 nm. Experiments to determine the kinetics of cleavage of a fluorescence-quenched peptide with sequence spanning the PAR-2 serine protease activation site were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm CaCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 by continuously measuring fluorescence at 440 nm following excitation at 330 nm. Emissions were monitored over 15 min using a Polarstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech, Melbourne, Australia). Enzyme activity was determined from a standard curve generated from the fluorescence obtained following complete cleavage by trypsin of known amounts of peptide using an absorption coefficient of 104 m-1 cm-1. To obtain kcat and Km values, initial velocity data at each substrate concentration were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Experiments were performed in triplicate on three independent occasions with results displayed as means ± S.E. Measurement of Changes in Intracellular Ca2+—Cells grown to 80% confluence were washed with PBS, detached nonenzymatically, resuspended (4 × 106 cells/ml) in extracellular medium (121 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and then loaded with the fluorescence indicator Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (1.0 μm; Invitrogen) at room temperature for 60 min. Cells were then pelleted followed by resuspension in extracellular medium (without bovine serum albumin) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml for fluorescence measurements. The ratio of fluorescence at 510 nm after excitation at 340 and 380 nm was monitored using a Polarstar Optima fluorescent plate reader. Single agonist treatments were KLK4 (300 nm), trypsin (10 nm), thrombin (10 nm), PAR-1 AP and PAR-2 AP (100 μm), and PAR-4 AP (500 μm). Displayed data are representative of experiments performed in triplicate and repeated on three independent occasions. Dose-response experiments were performed over the KLK4 concentration range of 0.1–1000 nm in triplicate and performed on three independent occasions with results displayed as means ± S.E. Knockdown of PAR-2 Expression—The mammalian siRNA expression vector pSilencer 3.1-H1 puro (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used to reduce expression of PAR-2. Candidate PAR-2 siRNA target sequences were designed as previously described (28Pei Y. Tuschl T. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and then aligned against the human genome data base using the BLAST algorithm to eliminate those with significant homology to other genes. Three sequences selected were 5′-GATCCAGGAAGAAGCCTTATTGGTTTCAAGAGAACCAATAAGGCTTCTTCCTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′, 5′-GATCCAGTAGACTTGGTGTGAAGATTCAAGAGATCTTCACACCAAGTCTACTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′, and 5′-GATCCGTAGTCGTGAATCTTGTTCATTCAAGAGATGAACAAGATTCACGACTATTTTTTGGAAA-3′. The sequences were synthesized (Sigma) and inserted into the pSilencer 3.1-H1 puro vector (Ambion) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Fibroblasts from Par-1 null mice stably expressing PAR-2 (PAR-2-LMF) were transfected with the PAR-2 pSilencer 3.1-H1 constructs or the supplied pSilencer 3.1-H1 negative control using Lipofectamine. After 48 h, 2 μg/ml puromycin was added to the medium to select for stable transfected cells. PAR-2 expression levels and agonist-induced induction of ERK phosphorylation were examined by Western blot analysis. PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNA Expression Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells as previously described (29Hooper J.D. Campagnolo L. Goodarzi G. Truong T.N. Stuhlmann H. Quigley J.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 689-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cDNA synthesized using Superscript II (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed as previously described (30Hooper J.D. Zijlstra A. Aimes R.T. Liang H. Claassen G.F. Tarin D. Testa J.E. Quigley J.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1783-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) with primers specific for PAR-1 (5′-TGTATCCCATGCAGTCCCTCTC-3′ and 5′-CACCTGGATGGTTTGCTCCTT-3′), PAR-2 (5′-AGAAGCCTTATTGGTAAGGTT-3′ and 5′-AACATCATGACAGGTGGTGAT-3′), or β-actin (human 5′-TGTCACCTTCACCGTTCCA-3′ and 5′-CAAGATCATTGCTCCTCCTG-3′; mouse 5′-CGTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCACCA-3′ and 5′-TTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGGG-3′). Cell Surface Biotinylation—PC-3 cells were washed three times with cold PBS, and then plasma membrane proteins were biotinylated by incubation with 1.22 mg/ml EZ-link NHS-SS-Biotin at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation. The cells were then washed in PBS prior to lysis in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation, bead immobilized streptavidin was added into the supernatant and incubated for 15 min on ice to capture biotinylated proteins. The streptavidin beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was recovered for analysis of cytoplasmic (nonbiotinylated) proteins. The beads were then washed thoroughly, and associated cell surface (biotinylated) proteins were eluted into Laemmli sample buffer. Cytoplasmic and cell surface fractions were examined for PAR-2 by Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were collected in a buffer containing Triton X-100 (1%, v/v), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), NaCl (150 mm), and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Fractions containing membrane proteins and soluble proteins were isolated as previously described (31Compton S.J. Sandhu S. Wijesuriya S.J. Hollenberg M.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by microbicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). For ERK1/2 phosphorylation, cells were grown to 50% confluence and serum-deprived for 24 h before treatment, and then collection of whole cell lysates was as above, except the lysis buffer also contained 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 50 mm NaF (Sigma). Equal amounts of lysates (20 μg) or biotinylated fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-PAR-1 (1:1000), anti-PAR2 (1:1000), anti-GAPDH (1:1000), anti-ERK (1:1,000), or anti-phospho-ERK (1:2,000) antibody and then washed before incubation with species-appropriate fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were analyzed using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR; Millennium Science, Surrey Hills, Australia) and where relevant signal intensity determined using LI-COR imaging software and exported to Microsoft Excel for graphical representation as mean ± S.E. Significance was examined using Student's t test with a p value of <0.05 considered significant. Flow Cytometry—Cells grown in serum-free media overnight were detached nonenzymatically, washed in PBS, and then resuspended at 2 × l06 cells/ml. Cells were subjected to nonpermeabilizing fixation in 1% formaldehyde on ice for 5 min, washed with PBS, and then resuspended in staining buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin). Following incubation with an anti-PAR-2 antibody (SAM11; 2 μg/106 cells) on ice for 60 min, cells were washed and then incubated with fluorescently tagged anti-mouse secondary antibody. Cell surface PAR-2 was assessed using an FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Gladesville, Australia). In parallel, to assess the levels of total PAR-2, following fixation, cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Confocal Microscopy—Cells plated on sterile poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips were allowed to adhere overnight then transfected with either the PAR-2-GFP expression construct or vector pEGFP-N1. For agonist treatments, cells were incubated with either KLK4 (100 nm) or PAR-2 AP (100 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C before fixation with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde. Nuclei were stained by incubating cells for 5 min at room temperature with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:1500) in PBS. Coverslips were mounted on slides, and cells were imaged with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Sydney, Australia). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 and displayed using CorelDraw. The amount of PAR-2 on the cell surface was quantified by examining the fluorescence of randomly selected untreated and KLK4-treated cells (n = 15) using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), adapting the approach of Scherrer et al. (32Scherrer G. Tryoen-Toth P. Filliol D. Matifas A. Laustriat D. Cao Y.Q. Basbaum A.I. Dierich A. Vonesh J.L. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Kieffer B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9691-9696Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) for quantifying GPCR cell surface expression. Briefly, three cellular regions of interest were defined: the whole cell, the intracellular region, and the nucleus. The signal obtained for the whole cell and the intracellular region was corrected for background signal by subtracting nuclear fluorescence. Cell surface fluorescence was then obtained by subtracting the corrected value for the intracellular region from the corrected value for the whole cell. These values were then divided by the number of pixels contained within each region to give fluorescence density values for the cell surface (Di surface) and cytoplasm (Di cytoplasm). The ratio of Di surface to Di cytoplasm was determined to normalize data across the counted cell population. Results are displayed graphically as mean ± S.E., and significance was examined using Student's t test with a p value of <0.05 considered significant. Immunohistochemical Analysis—Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks from primary prostate cancers (n = 6; Gleason scores 3 + 4 to 4 + 5) and prostate cancer bone metastases (n = 2) were obtained from Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology (Taringa, Australia) and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (Sydney, Australia), respectively, following institutional ethics approval. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (33Hooper J.D. Nicol D.L. Dickinson J.L. Eyre H.J. Scarman A.L. Normyle J.F. Stuttgen M.A. Douglas M.L. Loveland K.A. Sutherland G.R. Antalis T.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3199-3205PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, serial sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized and then rehydrated, and after antigen retrieval in urea (5% w/v) in 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 9.5), serial sections were incubated in H2O2 (3%, v/v) to quench endogenous peroxidase. Sections were then blocked in normal goat serum (10%) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either an anti-PAR-2 monoclonal (SAM11; 1:1000 dilution) or an anti-KLK4 rabbit polyclonal (1:250 dilution) antibody. As negative controls, mouse and rabbit immunoglobulins replaced the SAM11 and anti-KLK4 primary antibodies, respectively. The EnVision+ peroxidase polymer detection system (Dako, Botany, Australia) was used with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as the chromogen. The sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin, visualized by microscopy (Leitz, Laborlux S, Germany), and photographed using a Nikon OXM1200 digital camera. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 and displayed using CorelDraw. Examination of KLK4-initiated Changes in Intracel"
https://openalex.org/W2068603872,"Intraerythrocytic malaria parasites use host hemoglobin as a major nutrient source. Aspartic proteases (plasmepsins) and cysteine proteases (falcipains) function in the early steps of the hemoglobin degradation pathway. There is extensive functional redundancy within and between these protease families. Plasmepsins are synthesized as integral membrane proenzymes that are activated by cleavage from the membrane. This cleavage is mediated by a maturase activity whose identity has been elusive. We have used a combination of cell biology, chemical biology, and enzymology approaches to analyze this processing event. These studies reveal that plasmepsin processing occurs primarily via the falcipains; however, if falcipain activity is blocked, autoprocessing can take place, serving as an alternate activation system. These results establish a further level of redundancy between the protease families involved in Plasmodium hemoglobin degradation.

These results establish a further level of redundancy between the protease families involved in Plasmodium hemoglobin degradation. Human malaria is a disease of devastating proportions. Approximately 40% of the world population is at risk for acquiring it, and an estimated two million people, mostly children, die of it each year (1Snow R.W. Guerra C.A. Noor A.M. Myint H.Y. Hay S.I. Nature. 2005; 434: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). The most deadly form of malaria is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum. During the disease-causing stage of its life cycle, the parasite lives within human red blood cells and consumes over two-thirds of the hemoglobin of the host cell (2Goldberg D.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 295: 275-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This massive catabolic process is essential for parasite survival and is facilitated by numerous endo- and exo-peptidases within an acidic organelle termed the food vacuole (3Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 275-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 4Liu J. Istvan E.S. Gluzman I.Y. Gross J. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two families of proteases are involved in the initial steps of hemoglobin catabolism: three cysteine protease falcipains (FP-2, FP-2′, FP-3) and four aspartic protease plasmepsins (PM I, PM II, HAP, and PM IV). The plasmepsins are synthesized as type II integral membrane proteins that are delivered to the food vacuole through the secretory system via the plasma membrane of the parasite. Once at the plasma membrane, they appear to incorporate into the membranes of the forming cytostomes that deliver host cell hemoglobin to the food vacuole (7Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Once at the food vacuole, the plasmepsins are activated and released from the membrane by proteolytic cleavage at a conserved sequence site (see Fig. 1A) (7Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although numerous examples of autocatalytic protease activation exist, PM activation is refractory to inhibitors of aspartic proteases such as pepstatin (a potent inhibitor of plasmepsin activity) as well as to general inhibitors of cysteine, serine, or metalloproteases (7Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) both in cell culture and cell-free assays. Processing can, however, be inhibited by tripeptide aldehydes such as N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal (ALLN). 3The abbreviations used are: ALLN, N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PM, plasmepsin; FP, falcipain. 3The abbreviations used are: ALLN, N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PM, plasmepsin; FP, falcipain. This has led to a model of plasmepsin processing in which a unique ALLN-sensitive trans-processing activity, or maturase, serves to cleave the proplasmepsins to their mature, active form (9Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have extended these studies with the identification of the enzymes involved in proplasmepsin processing. These findings significantly revise our current model for this event and have important ramifications for the notion of proplasmepsin processing as a potential drug target. Materials—Unless otherwise noted, all of the reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. [35S]Cysteine/methionine (1175 Ci/mmol) and [3H]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), RPMI and Albumax (Invitrogen), brefeldin A (Calbiochem), pepstatin (Roche Applied Science), HHDG peptide (dabcyl-GABA-NYLGSSND-edans; Anaspec), Z-Leu-Arg-AMC peptide (R & D Systems), and tetanolysin (List Biological Laboratories) were used. E-64-bio was synthesized by the method of Greenbaum et al. (10Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Parasite Culture and Purification—P. falciparum clone 3D7 was grown at 37 °C under 3% O2, 3%CO2, 94% N2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 30 mg/l hypoxanthine, 0.225% NaHCO3, and 0.5% Albumax I (Invitrogen). Parasites were grown in 2% human red blood cells and were synchronized using successive rounds of 5% sorbitol treatment. The parasites were purified from host red blood cells by incubation with 50 hemolytic units/ml tetanolysin in PBS for 10 min on ice, followed by two cold PBS washes. Immunoprecipitation—Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against plasmepsin II (antibody 737) was made using the peptide HSHSSNDNIELNDFQNIMFYGDAEV derived from the mature N terminus of native plasmepsin II prepared as described (7Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Labeled trophozoite stage parasites (routinely 5 × 108) were immunoprecipitated using denaturing conditions. Free parasites were lysed by the addition of 1% SDS (100 μl) at 100 °C for 10 min. The solution was adjusted to 150 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 6 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS; insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Antibody was added at a 1:250 dilution (determined to be saturating) along with 70 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1:1 bead slurry to immunoprecipitation buffer). The samples were mixed by nutation at 4 °C for 16–20 h, and immunocomplexes were collected, added to an equal volume of 2× nonreducing sample buffer, boiled 5 min, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE with fluorography. In Vivo Processing Assay—Inhibitor experiments were performed with synchronized cultures of trophozoite stage parasites. The cultures were washed one time in RPMI prepared without methionine and cysteine, resuspended in the same medium at a density of 2.0 × 108/ml with [35S]methionine/cysteine (350 μCi/ml), and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (3% O2, 3%CO2). The cultures were chased for the indicated times by removal of labeling media and addition of complete RPMI. The parasites were harvested by tetanolysin purification and processed immediately for immunoprecipitation. Kinetics of processing was calculated by densitometry and calculation of the fraction of plasmepsin II (PM II) processed at each time point. Band intensities were normalized to account for change in specific activity caused by the loss of 35S-labeled cysteine and methionine residues upon processing. Cell-free Processing Assay—The assay was by the method of Francis et al. (7Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Trophozoite stage parasites were metabolically labeled as above except that brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) and [35S]methionine/cysteine were added at the same time. The cultures were incubated for 4–5 h and then harvested and lysed in PBS by gentle sonication. The radiolabeled lysates were incubated in the presence of an equal amount of unlabeled parasite lysate plus inhibitors in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of one volume of 2% SDS and boiling. PM II was immunoprecipitated as described above. In Vitro Transcription/Translation and Radiosequencing—Capped PM II RNA was prepared using linearized plasmid DNA containing the entire open reading frame of plasmepsin II and T7 polymerase Message Machine kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transcript was added to nuclease-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of 0.5 μl of [35S]methionine, 10 μg of brewer's yeast tRNA, and 1.8 μl of canine pancreatic microsomes/25 μl of translation reaction. 2 μl of in vitro translated protein (above) was incubated with parasite lysate treated with either 10 μm E-64 or pepstatin for 3 h at 37 °C. Denaturing immunoprecipitations were performed as above, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Plasmepsin bands were excised and subjected to Edman degradation. Each cycle from the sequencer was assayed for radioactivity in a scintillation counter. Nonspecific background increases with successive cycles as is typical with Edman degradation. Target Analysis with E-64-biotin—Synchronized trophozoite stage culture (∼5% parasitemia) was incubated with 10 μm inhibitor for 15 min to block accessible active sites followed by purification of parasites by tetanolysin. The parasites were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The parasite pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of lysis/labeling mix (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1.0%Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm E-64-bio) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of 25 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. 30 μl of sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Biotinylated proteins were detected using Vectastain ABC-AmP kit and DuoLuX reagent (Vector Laboratories) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorogenic Cleavage Assays—Cleavage of HHDG internally quenched fluorogenic peptide was initiated by the addition of 0.5 μl of purified recombinant FP-2 or FP-3 to a final reaction volume of 200 μl (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, HHDG peptide, 10 mm dithiothreitol) and monitored over time using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter fitted with a 96-well plate reader. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 355 and 495 nm, respectively. The reaction rates were plotted relative to substrate concentration, and Km and Vmax values were determined by a Michaelis-Menten curve fit using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). Enzyme concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using calculated extinction coefficients of 41,870 and 55,280 m–1 cm–1 for mature FP-2 and FP-3, respectively. Plasmepsin Processing Is Inhibited by Combined Treatment with E-64d and Pepstatin—Pulse-chase experiments on cultured parasites incubated with various protease inhibitors clearly demonstrate that the pro-plasmepsin processing activity is refractory to the general cysteine and aspartic protease inhibitors, E-64 and pepstatin, but sensitive to ALLN as previously reported (7Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). We tested combinations of inhibitors and surprisingly, the combination of E-64d and pepstatin inhibited pro-PM II processing activity to a similar degree as ALLN. This result indicates the presence of two redundant, yet unique, processing activities. In the case of treatment with pepstatin, a potent plasmepsin inhibitor, processing of pro-PM II appears normal. This is in contrast, however, to E-64d treatment, which resulted in two processed forms of PM II, both of which appear to be the result of autoprocessing (see below). Evidently, both activities (the pepstatin-sensitive and the E-64d-sensitive) can process pro-PM II, albeit with different specificities. Inhibition of pro-PM II processing therefore requires inhibition of both of these activities. We were concerned that the inhibition of processing seen by the combined treatment with E-64d and pepstatin could be due to a general toxic effect and not through a direct inhibition of processing activity. Therefore, we carried out a complementary experiment using a cell-free processing assay (9Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in which pro-PM II was generated in vivo by incubating parasites with brefeldin A during a metabolic labeling with [35S[Met/Cys (Fig. 1C). A sonicate was then prepared from these parasites and incubated with additional unlabeled parasite lysate in the presence of inhibitors. Processing of endogenously synthesized pro-PM II was inhibited by the combination of E-64 and pepstatin as well as by ALLN. This indicates a direct effect of these inhibitors on PM processing activity. The result also revealed, in contrast to the in vivo assay, that the E-64d-sensitive processing activity is accessible and sensitive to E-64 in the cell-free system, indicating that proplasmepsin processing in vivo occurs in a cellular compartment not readily accessible to E-64. Endogenous Cleavage of PM II Is Inhibited by E-64d—Previous efforts had identified that endogenous processing of pro-PM II occurs at the G124-S125 peptide bond (11Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in the cleavage specificities of each of these redundant processing activities and whether one, or both, contributed to endogenous pro-PM II processing. To address this question we mapped, by radiosequencing, the N terminus of in vitro translated pro-PM II that had been incubated with parasite lysate pretreated with either E-64 or pepstatin (Fig. 2). Radiosequencing of these cleavage products showed that the pepstatin-treated lysate processes pro-PM II at the endogenous Gly124–Ser125 cleavage site (as shown by peak of radiolabeled methionine released 15 amino acids after the N terminus), whereas incubation with E-64-treated lysate resulted in cleavage one amino acid C-terminal to this site at the Ser125–Ser126 peptide bond (peak of radiolabeled methionine released 14 amino acids after the N terminus). Given that endogenous cleavage at Ser125–Ser126 does not occur (9Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), this experiment indicates that the E-64d-sensitive cysteine protease activity represents the dominant processing activity present in vivo. Alternative Processing Is via Autoprocessing That Proceeds with Slower Kinetics—Alternative processing is only seen in the presence of E-64d (and E-64 in vitro), suggesting to us that it is functionally recessive to the endogenous, E-64d-sensitive processing activity. We hypothesized that this might be the result of a difference in the kinetics of these two activities. To explore this idea, we performed pulse-chase experiments measuring the half-time of pro-PM II processing and determined that there was an ∼60% increase in the t½ of pro-PM II processing in the presence of E-64d (no inhibitor = 15 min versus E-64d = 9.5 min; Fig. 3). This significant rate difference likely explains why pro-PM II processing normally occurs via the E-64d-sensitive activity in vivo. E-64d Efficiently Labels Specific Cysteine Proteases in Vivo—It was clear from the previous experiments that when used in combination with pepstatin, the membrane-permeant E-64d, but not the less permeant E-64, was able to inhibit the endogenous processing activity in vivo. We decided therefore to take advantage of this distinction to aid in identifying the protease target(s) of E-64d. We accomplished this by incubating parasitized red blood cell cultures with either E-64 or E-64d to irreversibly label all accessible, protease active sites (Fig. 4). Following this incubation, the cultures were washed free of inhibitor, and the parasites were purified from the host red blood cells. Total parasite lysate was then prepared and incubated with a biotinylated version of E-64 (E-64-bio) to identify the remaining, unlabeled active sites. These lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the biotinylated proteins were detected by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Although numerous bands are labeled in the absence of inhibitor pretreatment, a diffuse protein band that is competed by E-64d but not by E-64 was apparent at ∼30 kDa. When E-64 was added post-lysis, however, it was able to compete. This labeling pattern mimics the sensitivity of processing to these inhibitors (when used in combination with pepstatin; Fig. 1). Previous work by Greenbaum et al. (12Greenbaum D.C. Baruch A. Grainger M. Bozdech Z. Medzihradszky K.F. Engel J. DeRisi J. Holder A.A. Bogyo M. Science. 2002; 298: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) using an identical biotinylated E-64 compound identified this dominant 30-kDa band as comprising falcipains 2 and 3. Falcipains Cleave a PM II Peptide at the Endogenous Processing Site—To directly test the notion that falcipains are responsible for proplasmepsin processing, we assayed the activity of purified, recombinant FP-2 and FP-3 on a synthetic eight-amino acid, fluorogenic peptide comprising the endogenous cleavage site of pro-PM II. Both FP-2 and FP-3 were able to cleave the processing site peptide in a time-dependent fashion with kcat/Km values of 1.4 × 104 and 2.3 × 103 s–1 m–1, respectively (Table 1). Purified, recombinant PM II and PM IV were also tested but were both inactive on this peptide (not shown).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of FP-2 and FP-3 with internally quenched fluorogenic octapeptide substrate HHDGKmkcatkcat/Kmms-1s-1 m-1FP-21.9 × 10-60.0271.4 × 104FP-39.8 × 10-60.0232.3 × 103 Open table in a new tab We next used mass spectrometry to map the falcipain cleavage site(s) on this peptide (Fig. 5). Following incubation of peptide with FP-2 or FP-3, the dominant ion species present corresponded to predicted C- and N-terminal fragments of a single cleavage event at the G-S peptide bond. Evidence of alternative cleavage sites was not detected. These results indicate that both enzymes (and also presumably FP-2′ given its extremely high level of identity to FP-2 (13Singh N. Sijwali P.S. Pandey K.C. Rosenthal P.J. Exp. Parasitol. 2006; 112: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) recognize and cleave PM II at the endogenous processing site. Two Redundant Activities Are Capable of Proplasmepsin Processing in Vivo—It has been of great interest to our lab to identify the proplasmepsin processing maturase activity. That general protease inhibitors did not block this activity led us to believe that a unique processing enzyme was likely responsible. The data presented here reveal that processing is not a result of a unique enzymatic activity but rather that proplasmepsin processing can occur through either of two redundant activities. Our in vivo processing experiment demonstrates this clearly because neither E-64d nor pepstatin individually inhibit processing; however, the combination of E-64d and pepstatin does inhibit processing (Fig. 1B). Therefore, blocking of proplasmepsin processing requires inhibition of both an E-64d-sensitive cysteine protease activity as well as inhibition of a pepstatin-sensitive aspartic protease activity. The Pepstatin-sensitive Autoprocessing Activity Is Functionally Recessive—Previous work from our lab has determined that a cleavage motif is conserved for all four food vacuole plasmepsins (9Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with the N-terminal residue of endogenous mature plasmepsin II being serine 125 (11Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the studies presented here, we have determined using in vitro translated PM II that the E-64d sensitive activity in parasite lysate correctly processed this substrate, whereas the pepstatin sensitive activity cleaved just one amino acid C-terminal to this site (Fig. 2). These data indicate that the pepstatin-sensitive activity is functionally recessive to the E-64d-sensitive activity. In other words, the pepstatin-sensitive alternative processing is only seen upon treatment with E-64d. Consistent with this is the presence of the alternative processed forms of PM II that are seen upon treatment with E-64d in vivo or in vitro (Fig. 1B). The higher molecular weight band is at the correct size for mature plasmepsin II and likely corresponds to the autoprocessing site we have mapped one amino acid C-terminal from the endogenous site in our in vitro transcription-translation experiments (Fig. 2). The lower molecular weight band is uncharacterized, but presumably is due to a second autoprocessing site given that it is lost upon pepstatin treatment. We believe the pepstatin-sensitive activity to be the result of alternative plasmepsin autoprocessing. Previous observations have demonstrated that recombinant PM II readily autoprocesses under acidic conditions (14Hill J. Tyas L. Phylip L.H. Kay J. Dunn B.M. Berry C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Luker K.E. Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Kim et al. (16Kim Y.M. Lee M.H. Piao T.G. Lee J.W. Kim J.H. Lee S. Choi K.M. Jiang J.H. Kim T.U. Park H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have extended these studies by demonstrating that recombinant PM II and PM IV undergo autoprocessing in both cis- and trans-catalytic fashions. We also observe in the cell-free assay a minor amount of the lower band present in the absence of inhibitor or in the presence of ALLN (Fig. 1C). This makes sense given that the PM II substrate in this assay is significantly diluted relative to the situation in vivo, conditions that would favor intramolecular autoprocessing. Consistent with this is the finding that ALLN inhibits trans-catalysis more potently than autocatalysis (16Kim Y.M. Lee M.H. Piao T.G. Lee J.W. Kim J.H. Lee S. Choi K.M. Jiang J.H. Kim T.U. Park H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Falcipains Are Responsible for the E-64d-sensitive Processing Activity—The plasmepsins traffic through the secretory system to the plasma membrane of the parasite, at which point they appear to incorporate into the membranes of the forming cytostomes that deliver host cell hemoglobin to the food vacuole (7Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is clear that an acidic pH is required for both the E-64d-sensitive processing and the pepstatin-sensitive autoprocessing (9Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The neutral pH environment of both the secretory and the cytostomal vesicles (17Klonis N. Tan O. Jackson K. Goldberg D. Klemba M. Tilley L. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) limits the location of proplasmepsin processing to the food vacuole. Falcipains 2, 2′, and 3 constitute the predominant food vacuole cysteine protease activity (18Rosenthal P.J. McKerrow J.H. Aikawa M. Nagasawa H. Leech J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and represent the only characterized cysteine endo-peptidases within this organelle (5Dahl E.L. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Subramanian S. Sijwali P.S. Rosenthal P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24961-24969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, the falcipains appear to be the best (only) known candidates for the proplasmepsin maturase. In our experiments we found that when used in combination with pepstatin, E-64d but not E-64, was able to inhibit PM2 processing (Fig. 1B). This indicates that the cysteine protease processing activity takes place in an intracellular compartment not readily accessible by E-64. Consistent with this, the food vacuole falcipains displayed a decreased sensitivity to E-64 relative to E-64d in our in vivo target analysis experiments (Fig. 4). This result indicates that E-64, as compared with E-64d, does not readily gain access to the food vacuole. This is consistent with the design of E-64d as a membrane-permeant analog of E-64. Studies have shown, however, that E-64 has an inhibitory effect on hemoglobin digestion within the parasite and elicits a “swollen” food vacuole morphology (18Rosenthal P.J. McKerrow J.H. Aikawa M. Nagasawa H. Leech J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This is probably best explained by the relatively high concentrations (>100 μm) and long incubation times (>10 h) used to produce the effect in these studies compared with our in vivo processing assays. Through these experiments we propose a model by which the falcipains serve as the endogenous proplasmepsin maturase, and only upon their inhibition, as by E-64d, are alternative autoprocessed forms of PM II generated (Fig. 6). Although both activities are capable of proplasmepsin processing, the falcipains appear to “win out” because of their faster processing kinetics (Fig. 3). The falcipains belong to the papain (C1A) family of cysteine proteases. Published characterization of the substrate specificities for the falcipains reveals differences between FP-2 (and presumably the nearly identical FP-2′) and FP-3 (19Ramjee M.K. Flinn N.S. Pemberton T.P. Quibell M. Wang Y. Watts J.P. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although both enzymes favor substrates with Leu at P2 (20Shenai B.R. Sijwali P.S. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29000-29010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 21Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.R. Gut J. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Consistent with this preference, it is expected that both FP-2 and FP-3 are able to cleave proplasmepsin II at the endogenous cleavage site. That both FP-2 and FP-3 are able to cleave our proplasmepsin peptide, as well as recombinant proplasmepsin II (not shown) is not without precedent because this same analysis did identify peptides that were cleaved with similar kinetics by these enzymes. Which, if any, of the falcipain enzymes plays a dominant role in proplasmepsin processing in vivo has not been directly addressed in this paper other than our determination that the enzymes cleave the proplasmepsin peptide with an approximate 6-fold difference in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 1.4 × 104 and 2.3 × 103 s–1 m–1 for FP-2 and FP-3, respectively). Also, published data indicate that FP-2′ and FP-3 are expressed later in the erythrocytic cycle of the parasite (21Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.R. Gut J. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This would suggest that FP-2 might serve as the dominant proplasmepsin maturase, although the contribution of FP-2′ and FP-3 cannot be ruled out. One possible experiment to test this would be to use the available FP-2 and FP-2′ knock-out cell lines (4Liu J. Istvan E.S. Gluzman I.Y. Gross J. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8840-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 22Sijwali P.S. Koo J. Singh N. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to measure the proplasmepsin processing kinetics of these lines with respect to the parental line. We have attempted this experiment with FP-2 knock-out cells but were unable to detect any measurable difference. It is possible that FP-2′ and/or FP-3 activity was sufficient for processing. These experiments are also challenging given the inherent stage heterogeneity of the parasite cultures. This work brings into question the idea of a unique proplasmepsin processing activity as a viable drug target. We predict that drugs designed to specifically inhibit the falcipains or the plasmepsins are unlikely to be effective inhibitors of processing activity. Only drugs that inhibit both enzyme families would successfully block proplasmepsin processing. An example of this idea is ALLN, our earlier described maturase inhibitor (7Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ALLN can block proplasmepsin processing because it is both a low micromolar inhibitor of the falcipains (not shown) and, surprisingly, a noncompetitive inhibitor of the plasmepsins (our observations and Kim et al. (16Kim Y.M. Lee M.H. Piao T.G. Lee J.W. Kim J.H. Lee S. Choi K.M. Jiang J.H. Kim T.U. Park H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). We have shown here that pro-PM II can be proteolytically activated by two redundant processing activities and given the conserved processing site, similar processing inhibitor sensitivities, and processing kinetics, we feel that this is likely the case for all food vacuole plasmepsins. Functional redundancy appears to be a common theme in Plasmodium biology. Well documented examples can be found in the multiple invasion pathways of the parasite (23Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 755-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and the SERA gene family (24McCoubrie J.E. Miller S.K. Sargeant T. Good R.T. Hodder A.N. Speed T.P. de Koning-Ward T.F. Crabb B.S. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 5565-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). With respect to the plasmepsins, redundancy can also be seen in their contribution, along with the falcipains, to hemoglobin degradation. With the exception of FP-3, single (or multiple) knock-outs of each plasmepsin and falcipain have been successfully generated (22Sijwali P.S. Koo J. Singh N. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Liu J. Gluzman I.Y. Drew M.E. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1432-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Bonilla J.A. Moura P.A. Bonilla T.D. Yowell C.A. Fidock D.A. Dame J.B. Int. J. Parasitol. 2007; 37: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been reported that the falcipains appear able to compensate, at least in culture, for the loss of all four food vacuole plasmepsins (27Bonilla J.A. Bonilla T.D. Yowell C.A. Fujioka H. Dame J.B. Mol. Micro. 2007; 65: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these results is that these enzymes function by simple mass action to degrade hemoglobin and that gene duplication has served as a mechanism for the parasite to ensure a sufficient level of enzymatic activity. Functional overlap exists among plasmepsin family members and between plasmepsin and falcipain enzyme families. We now provide another level of functional overlap: the ability of the multiple members of the multiple families to activate plasmepsins. Through the work presented here characterizing proplasmepsin processing, it appears the parasite has struck a balance between specialization and redundancy by maintaining the option to activate the plasmepsins through autoprocessing. To what extent this alternative processing activity is advantageous in the course of natural infection is not understood at this time. We thank Anna Oksman for parasite culturing, Eva Istvan and Jun Liu for helpful discussions, and Ruiguang Ge for assistance with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization."
https://openalex.org/W2024544120,"Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) catalyzes the conversion of cysteine to cysteinesulfinic acid and is important in the regulation of intracellular cysteine levels in mammals and in the provision of oxidized cysteine metabolites such as sulfate and taurine. Several crystal structure studies of mammalian CDO have shown that there is a cross-linked cofactor present in the active site of the enzyme. The cofactor consists of a thioether bond between the γ-sulfur of residue cysteine 93 and the aromatic side chain of residue tyrosine 157. The exact requirements for cofactor synthesis and the contribution of the cofactor to the catalytic activity of the enzyme have yet to be fully described. In this study, therefore, we explored the factors necessary for cofactor biogenesis in vitro and in vivo and examined what effect cofactor formation had on activity in vitro. Like other cross-linked cofactor-containing enzymes, formation of the Cys-Tyr cofactor in CDO required a transition metal cofactor (Fe2+) and O2. Unlike other enzymes, however, biogenesis was also strictly dependent upon the presence of substrate. Cofactor formation was also appreciably slower than the rates reported for other enzymes and, indeed, took hundreds of catalytic turnover cycles to occur. In the absence of the Cys-Tyr cofactor, CDO possessed appreciable catalytic activity, suggesting that the cofactor was not essential for catalysis. Nevertheless, at physiologically relevant cysteine concentrations, cofactor formation increased CDO catalytic efficiency by ∼10-fold. Overall, the regulation of Cys-Tyr cofactor formation in CDO by ambient cysteine levels represents an unusual form of substrate-mediated feed-forward activation of enzyme activity with important physiological consequences.

Recent biochemical and crystallographic studies have revealed that some enzymes contain unusual modifications to the amino acid residues residing within their active sites. Also known as amino acid-derived cofactors, these altered residues represent a new and exciting area for research in the field of protein post-translational modifications. Unlike other post-translational modifications, which are made by attaching extrinsic molecules onto target proteins through reactions that are specifically catalyzed by third party enzymes, amino acid cofactors are generated directly from the amino acids within the proteins that contain them and are required for the production of fully competent enzymes (1Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5283-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2Okeley N.M. van der Donk W.A. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R159-R171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). From a biological perspective, amino acid-derived cofactors are significant because they can create novel structural motifs within the enzyme active site as well as alter the chemical properties of the unmodified parent amino acid residues and thus expand the otherwise limited range of catalytic reactions in which the common amino acids can participate. One recent addition to the list of enzymes known to contain an amino acid cofactor is cysteine dioxygenase (CDO). 3The abbreviations used are: CDO, cysteine dioxygenase; WT, wild type; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, Mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; nanoLC, nano-liquid chromatography; DTNB, dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); IDA, information-dependent acquisition; ACN, acetonitrile; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PD, pyruvate dehydrogenase. 3The abbreviations used are: CDO, cysteine dioxygenase; WT, wild type; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, Mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; nanoLC, nano-liquid chromatography; DTNB, dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); IDA, information-dependent acquisition; ACN, acetonitrile; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PD, pyruvate dehydrogenase. CDO is an iron (Fe2+)-dependent thiol dioxygenase that uses molecular oxygen to oxidize the sulfhydryl group of cysteine to generate cysteinesulfinic acid (see Fig. 1A for reaction). In mammals, the enzyme plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular free cysteine levels and catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of essential metabolites of cysteine, such as sulfate, hypotaurine, and taurine (3Dominy Jr., J.E.

It has also been shown that CDO protein levels are highly regulated in response to cysteine in both cultured cells and in living animals (6Dominy Jr., J.E. Hirschberger L.L. Coloso R.M. Stipanuk M.H. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Stipanuk M.H. Hirschberger L.L. Londono M.P. Cresenzi C.L. Yu A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E439-E448Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This regulation occurs almost exclusively by changes in the rate at which CDO is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome system. Crystallographic studies have revealed that the amino acid cofactor in the active site of CDO consists of two cross-linked residues, cysteine 93 and tyrosine 157 (Fig. 1B). The γ-sulfur of cysteine 93 (Cys93-Sγ) is covalently bonded to the ortho-position of tyrosine 157 (Tyr157-C∈2). The cis configuration of the coplanar bond between Cys93-Sγ and Tyr157-C∈2 suggests that it may have partial double bond character. A similar thioether-containing cofactor has been previously reported in galactose oxidase (8Ito N. Phillips S.E. Stevens C. Ogel Z.B. McPherson M.J. Keen J.N. Yadav K.D. Knowles P.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), glyoxal oxidase (9Whittaker M.M. Kersten P.J. Cullen D. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 27319-27328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). There are two major aspects of the cross-linked cofactor in CDO that have yet to be adequately characterized: how the cofactor is synthesized and the role that it plays in CDO catalysis. Inadequate characterization of cofactor biosynthesis is not a problem that is unique to CDO, however, as the mechanisms by which most protein-derived cofactors are formed remain poorly understood (12Klinman J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14766-14768Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Galactose oxidase, however, forms a cross-linked cofactor that is identical to CDO, and the process by which it is synthesized has been examined. The in vitro formation of the cross-linked cofactor in galactose oxidase is a self-assembly process that is distinct from the biologically relevant catalytic activity of the enzyme and requires only the enzyme itself, molecular oxygen, and copper(I) (13Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22090-22101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Rogers M.S. Baron A.J. McPherson M.J. Knowles P.F. Dooley D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 990-991Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The processing event is very fast (t½ = 3.9 s at pH 7), and formation of the cofactor is required before galactose oxidase is able to achieve catalytic competency (13Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22090-22101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Another interesting finding from studies of galactose oxidase is that gel electrophoresis can be a useful analytical tool for the evaluation of cross-linked cofactor formation. Upon SDS-PAGE, recombinant galactose oxidase runs as a double band (Fig. 1D). Both mutational and mass spectrometry studies have verified that the apparent mass difference is an aberration caused by the presence of the cross-linked cofactor exclusively in the lower band. Multiple reports have indicated that the CDO protein expressed by a variety of mammalian tissues runs as a double band on SDS-PAGE (6Dominy Jr., J.E. Hirschberger L.L. Coloso R.M. Stipanuk M.H. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Stipanuk M.H. Hirschberger L.L. Londono M.P. Cresenzi C.L. Yu A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E439-E448Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Stipanuk M.H. Londono M. Hirschberger L.L. Hickey C. Thiel D.J. Wang L. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2004; 26: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a pattern that is very similar to that of galactose oxidase (Fig. 1D). This banding pattern had been attributed to an artifact of SDS-PAGE analysis after attempts to determine whether the difference in migration between the two bands represented an actual post-translational modification failed to identify any canonical small molecular weight modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation (15Stipanuk M.H. Londono M. Hirschberger L.L. Hickey C. Thiel D.J. Wang L. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2004; 26: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In light of the recent discovery that CDO possesses a cross-linked cofactor, it seemed very likely that the underlying cause for the anomalous SDS-PAGE migration pattern of CDO is similar to that of galactose oxidase and is actually because of two separate populations of protein being expressed in vivo, one with the cofactor and one without. Whether the mechanism of cofactor synthesis is also similar to that of galactose oxidase is not known, although proposals have been made that it is and requires only oxygen and ferrous iron (16Simmons C.R. Liu Q. Huang Q. Hao Q. Begley T.P. Karplus P.A. Stipanuk M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18723-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J.

The second unresolved issue regarding the cross-linked cofactor of CDO is its exact purpose. It has been postulated that the Cys93–Tyr157 cross-link plays an important structural role in the positioning of Tyr157 for participation in catalysis and in the maintenance of a tetrahedral coordination geometry around the iron metallocenter of the enzyme (16Simmons C.R. Liu Q. Huang Q. Hao Q. Begley T.P. Karplus P.A. Stipanuk M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18723-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J.

Bartlam M. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3391-3402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Ye et al. (18Ye S. Wu X. Wei L. Tang D. Sun P. Bartlam M. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3391-3402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) recently claimed that support for this hypothesis could be found in crystallographic observations of a CDO that is expressed by the bacterium Cupriavidus necator (PDB entry 2GM6). This bacterial CDO is unable to form a cross-linked cofactor, because its Cys93 equivalent is a glycine residue, and the enzyme displays a distorted octahedral geometry around its metallocenter as opposed to the tetrahedral geometry found in mammalian CDOs. Nevertheless, a characterization of the catalytic competencies of four separate bacterial CDOs, all of which have glycine substituted for Cys93 and hence are unable to form a thioether cross-link, has shown that these enzymes are highly active and show substrate specificities that are identical to mammalian CDO (19Dominy Jr., J.E. Simmons C.R. Karplus P.A. Gehring A.M. Stipanuk M.H. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, a close examination of the superimposed active sites of Rattus norvegicus CDO (PDB entry 2B5H) and C. necator CDO shows that the absence of the thioether bond results in only a slight displacement of the Tyr157 equivalent in C. necator CDO (Fig. 1C). Therefore, on the basis of structural observations alone, it is difficult to definitively deduce the precise role of the cross-linked cofactor. Another proposal is that the Cys-Tyr bond effectively stabilizes a radical intermediate and prevents extraneous reactions from damaging the enzyme (18Ye S. Wu X. Wei L. Tang D. Sun P. Bartlam M. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3391-3402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), although there has been no direct evidence to support this hypothesis. In this work, we report a series of investigations that explored the formation of the cross-linked cofactor of CDO in vitro using purified recombinant protein and rat liver lysate and in vivo using transfected hepatoma cells and intact rats. Using a panel of recombinant mutant proteins, we also explored the contribution of the cofactor to catalytic efficiency as well as its effect on catalytic half-life. These studies have revealed new insights into the mechanism of cofactor formation and its role in CDO activity. They also suggest that the synthesis of the cross-linked cofactor represents another level of post-translational control of the enzyme in response to substrate. Cell Culture—HepG2/C3A human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (ATCC CRL-10741) were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in sulfur amino acid-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm l-methionine, 0.3 mm cysteine, 1× minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acid solution, and 0.05 mm bathocuproine disulfonate. Animal Feeding Studies—For the animal study, Sprague-Dawley rats (170–210 g) were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). These rats were housed individually in polycarbonate cages containing wood chips and paper bedding in a room maintained at 20 °C and 60–70% humidity with light from 2100 to 0900 h. The rats had free access to water at all times but had access to food only during the dark cycle. For 2 weeks, the rats were fed a semipurified diet that contained 100 g of casein/kg (low protein). At the end of the light cycle on day 15, the diet was switched to one that contained 400 g of casein/kg (high protein). Rats were killed at 12, 24, 48, 72, or 144 h after the start of the new diet. Liver was removed, rinsed with ice-cold saline, weighed, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until analysis. Diets were prepared by Dyets, Inc. (Bethlehem, PA). The detailed composition of these diets has been reported previously by Lee et al. (20Lee J.I. Londono M. Hirschberger L.L. Stipanuk M.H. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2004; 15: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Plasmids/CDO Expression Constructs—For the expression of recombinant CDO protein in Escherichia coli, the open reading frame of wild-type (WT) rat CDO was subcloned into a modified version of the pET-32a expression plasmid as described previously (21Simmons C.R. Hirschberger L.L. Machi M.S. Stipanuk M.H. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Single point mutants of this construct were engineered using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the appropriate primer sets (supplemental Fig. 1). To transiently express CDO protein in HepG2/C3A cells, the open reading frame of wild-type rat CDO was subcloned into NotI/BamHI restriction sites of the p3XFLAG-CMV-7.1 vector (Sigma). This expression vector added a 3.5-kDa 3× FLAG peptide sequence to the N terminus of CDO, yielding a fusion protein with a final molecular mass of ∼26 kDa. R60A, C93S, and C164A mutants were made of the p3X-FLAG WT CDO mammalian expression vector using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the appropriate primer sets (supplemental Fig. 1). Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant protein was prepared as described previously (21Simmons C.R. Hirschberger L.L. Machi M.S. Stipanuk M.H. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but with the minor modification that the ion-exchange step was omitted. Protein was cleaved from its thioredoxin-His6 tag by treatment with factor Xa (Calbiochem) and purified over a nickel immobilized metal affinity chromatography column as described previously (21Simmons C.R. Hirschberger L.L. Machi M.S. Stipanuk M.H. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transfection Conditions for HepG2/C3A Cultures—Cells were seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and allowed to attach for 24 h in the maintenance medium. When cells were at a confluency of ∼95% they were then transfected with the CDO expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cultures were allowed to take up the plasmid DNA complexes for 6 h, after which time the cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the experimental medium was added. The experimental medium was analogous to the maintenance medium with the exception that the concentration of cysteine was varied (0, 0.2, or 0.5 mm). Cells were incubated in the experimental medium for 24 h prior to harvesting. Measurement of Total Free Thiol Content of Recombinant CDO Protein—Total free thiol content of recombinant CDO protein was assayed using dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) as outlined by Whittaker and Whittaker (13Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22090-22101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For this assay, the final concentration of protein was 5 μm in a solution of 4 m guanidinium chloride buffered with 50 mm MES, pH 5.3. Thiol concentrations were quantified by the use of a cysteine standard curve. Cysteine standards were processed in the same fashion as recombinant protein samples to obviate the effects of guanidinium chloride on the λmax of DTNB. Molecular Weight Determination of Whole CDO Protein—Purified recombinant R60A CDO protein was initially dissolved in 20 mm ammonium acetate at a concentration of 22.2 μm (0.5 mg/ml). The protein was then diluted with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN), 20 mm ammonium acetate, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid to yield a final concentration of 10 pmol/μl. The diluted sample was infused at 2 μl/min into a three-dimensional ion trap mass spectrometer, Esquire-LC (Bruker, Billerica, MA). The instrument was operated under positive ion mode. The temperature was set to 280 °C, with spray voltage as 4 kV and nebulizer gas as 6 p.s.i./min. The instrument was optimized using 5 pmol/μl of standard lysozyme in the same solvent. Mass spectrometry (MS) spectra were acquired across the mass range of m/z 600–1800, and the molecular weight of identified proteins was determined by deconvolution using Bruker Daltonics DataAnalysis version 3.0. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and In-gel Digestion for Excised Two-dimensional Gel Spots—The two isoforms of R60A CDO protein were resolved into two separate spots by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Following visualization of the two-dimensional gel, the protein spots were excised and placed into microtubes for subsequent in-gel digestion and manual extraction. The in-gel digestion and tryptic/chymotryptic peptide extractions were performed following a protocol from Shevchenko et al. (22Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7787) Google Scholar) that was slightly modified. The gel pieces were washed and destained using the following sequence of solutions: 50 μl of water; 50 μl of 50% (v/v) ACN in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8; and 50 μl of 100% ACN. The samples were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated by treatment with iodoacetamide. Samples were then dried completely, and 0.2 μg of modified trypsin (Promega) or chymotrypsin (Sigma) in 20 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, in 10% (v/v) ACN was added to each tube. Samples were left on ice for 15 min and then incubated overnight at 37 °C. Enzymatic Peptide Mapping by MALDI TOF-TOF and NanoLC/MS/MS Analyses—Digested sample was reconstituted in 5 μl of 50% ACN with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to MS analysis, and 1 μl was used to spot a MALDI target plate. Before the spotted sample could dry on the plate, 0.5 μl of saturated matrix (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% ACN with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 1 mm ammonium phosphate) was spotted on top of each sample and then allowed to dry completely. The samples were then subjected to MALDI MS/MS analysis using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer equipped with TOF-TOF ion optics (Applied Biosystem, Framingham, MA) and 4700 Explorer version 3.0. The instrument was operated in 1-kV reflector positive ion mode and calibrated with a calibration kit (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) containing a mixture of six standard peptides, which was used as the default for chymotryptic samples. An additional internal calibration of two trypsin autolysis ions (m/z 842.508 and m/z 1045.564) was used for spectra acquisition of tryptic samples. The laser power was set to 2000 for MS and 3000 for MS/MS with collision-induced dissociation off. MS spectra were acquired across the mass range of 800–4000 Da. MS/MS spectra were acquired for the precursor ions of interest with a total accumulation of 2000 laser shots. The remainder of each sample was dried and reconstituted in 10 μl of 2% ACN with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. NanoLC was carried out by a LC Packings Ultimate integrated capillary high performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a Switchos valve switching unit (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The reconstituted peptides (6.4 μl) were injected using a Famous auto sampler onto a C18 PepMap trap column (5 μm, 300 μm × 5 mm, Dionex) for on-line desalting and then separated on a PepMap C-18 RP nano column. Peptides were eluted from the column over the course of 30 min using a linear gradient of 5–45% ACN in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The nanoLC was connected in-line to a hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer, 4000 Q Trap (ABI/MDS Sciex, Framingham, MA) equipped with a Micro Ion Spray Head ion source. MS data acquisition was performed using Analyst 1.4.1 software (Applied Biosystems) in the positive ion mode for information-dependent acquisition (IDA) analysis. The nanospray voltage was set to 2.0 kV and used in positive ion mode for all experiments. Nitrogen was used as the curtain (value of 10) and collision gas (set to high) with heated interface on. The declustering potential was set at 50 eV and Gas1 was 15 p.s.i. In IDA analysis, after each survey scan for m/z 400 to m/z 1550 and an enhanced resolution scan, the three highest intensity ions with multiple charge states were selected for tandem MS (MS/MS) with rolling collision energy applied for detected ions based on different charge states and m/z values. MS Data Analysis—The MS spectra from MALDI-TOF/TOF on each sample were manually inspected and compared with the predicted in silico tryptic/chymotryptic digest of R60A CDO. The MS/MS spectra of individual peptides were also inspected for differences between the two CDO isoforms. The MS/MS data generated from nanoLC/ESI-based IDA analysis were submitted to Mascot 2.1 for data base searching using in-house licensed Mascot local server, and the search was performed to query to the NCBInr (taxonomy, Mammals) data base with one missed cleavage site by trypsin and two missed cleavage sites by chymotrypsin allowed. The peptide tolerance was set to 1.2 Da and MS/MS tolerance was set to 0.6 Da. Carboxyamidomethyl modifications of cysteine and a methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. Only significant scores for the peptides defined by Mascot probability analysis greater than “identity” were considered for the peptide identifications. For the mutant samples, the error tolerant search was performed to confirm identification. For identification of any other potential biological modifications, the MS/MS data generated from nanoLC/ESI-based IDA analysis were also searched against the Mammals FASTA data base using ProteinPilot™ software 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the paragon algorithm. The carboxyamidomethyl modifications of cysteine and a methionine oxidation were used for thorough Protein ID searching with additional biological modifications. Peptide identifications were confirmed with scores representing >95% statistical significance. CDO Activity Assays—Purified recombinant protein was assayed for its ability to oxidize cysteine to cysteinesulfinic acid in vitro. The basic assay conditions consisted of 100 μl of protein, 0.1–10 nmol of CDO (as quantified by a bicinchoninic acid assay) diluted to a final volume of 400 μl in a buffer system that contained the following reagents (values indicate final concentrations): 50 mm MES, 0.3 mm ferrous sulfate, 0–50 mm cysteine, and 62.5 μm bathocuproine disulfonate. The final concentration of protein used in the reaction varied for each construct and was adjusted to ensure that no more than 10% of cysteine was consumed during the reaction. Reactions were initiated by the addition of cysteine and incubated at 37 °C on an Eppendorf thermomixer (Brinkmann Instruments) with shaking at 900 rpm. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 5% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid, and tubes were centrifuged at 16,000 × g to pellet precipitated protein. Then 10 μl of supernatant was removed and diluted with 10 μl of 200 μm asparagine (an internal standard) and 380 μl of 200 mm borate buffer, pH 10.4. Cysteinesulfinic acid and asparagine levels in this mixture were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with detection of the fluorescent derivatives of these amino acids. Chromatography of derivatized samples was carried out on a 4.6 × 150-mm column packed with Nova-Pack C18 packing materials (4 μm spherical particles; Waters) equipped with a C18 cartridge (5 μm spherical particles; All-tech). Using an automatic sample injector (WISP model 717 plus; Waters), 70 μl of o-phthalaldehyde/β-mercaptoethanol derivatization reagent and 30-μl volume of sample solution were injected into the pre-column tubing. The o-phthalaldehyde/β-mercaptoethanol/sample solution was allowed to react for 1 min prior to injection into the eluent stream. The derivatization reagent was prepared fresh daily by first mixing 3.5 mg of o-phthalaldehyde with 150 μl of 100% ethanol and then adding 5 ml of 200 mm borate buffer, pH 10.4, and 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. Separation of amino acids was accomplished by gradient elution at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and a column temperature of 30 °C. Buffer A of the gradient consisted of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer with 3% (v/v) tetrahydrofuran, final pH 7.0, and buffer B consisted of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer with 3% tetrahydrofuran and 60% ACN, final pH 7.0. Buffers were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter prior to use. The mobile phase was started at 100% buffer A and then linearly increased to 30% buffer B over the first 10 min. 30% buffer B was then maintained for a total of 3 min after which it was linearly increased to 100% buffer B over 3 min and then maintained at 100% buffer B for 2 min. The gradient was then switched back to 100% buffer A over the course of an additional 3 min, and the column was allowed to equilibrate for 6 min prior to the next injection. Dete"

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, neurons produce significant amounts of intracellular Aβ in vivo and in vitro (6Wertkin A.M. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E.

A specific feature of γ-secretase is that it is capable of cleaving APP only after a major part of the APP luminal domain is removed. Under normal circumstances it is therefore not possible to assay γ-secretase activity directly. Analyses of APP-FAD mutations (9Hardy J. Acta Neurol. Scand. Suppl. 1996; 165: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as well as of PS-FAD mutations (10Borchelt D.R. Thinakaran G. Eckman C.B. Lee M.K. Davenport F. Ratovitsky T. Prada C.M. Kim G.

Neurol. 1995; 37: 287-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The subcellular activities of both β- and γ-secretase have been extensively studied. Processing of APP to Aβ differs for different intracellular compartments (12Grimm H.S. Beher D. Lichtenthaler S.F. Shearman M.S. Beyreuther K. Hartmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13077-13085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and depends among others on the interaction of membrane composition and the APP transmembrane domain (13Grziwa B.

Variable amounts of β-secretase activity were found along the secretory pathway starting in the ER/intermediate compartment, post-Golgi vesicles, TGN, and endosomes (14Chyung A.S. Greenberg B.D.

In contrast, γ-secretase activity was found to be prominent in the ER, TGN, and plasma membrane and to produce different Aβ isoforms in different compartments (reviewed by Hartmann (16Hartmann T.

APP processing by the ER/intermediate compartment pathway in neurons generated only Aβ42 (17Hartmann T. Bieger S.C. Bruhl B. Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G.

There are a number of findings that indicate that cholesterol lowering might be of use in AD therapy. Several epidemiological studies showed a strongly decreased prevalence of AD and other dementias in patients that underwent treatment with statins (20Wolozin B. Kellman W. Ruosseau P. Celesia G.G.

Two high dosage pilot intention-to-treat clinical trials using atorvastatin or simvastatin in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease showed a slower cognitive decline in the treatment group (23Sparks D.L. Sabbagh M. Connor D.J. Lopez J. Launer L.J. Browne P. Wasser D. Johnson-Traver S. Lochhead J. Ziolwolski C. Arch. Neurol. 2005; 62: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 24Simons M.

Disord. 2005; 19: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although these findings indicate a molecular link between cholesterol and AD too little is still known about the molecular mechanisms involved and it currently remains unclear whether cholesterol lowering is sufficiently effective for AD therapy or prevention. Statins are inhibitors of the key enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase). They are widely used and well tolerated drugs, active in various cell types including brain cells (26Vaughan C.J. Delanty N. Stroke. 1999; 30: 1969-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), but the first potential link between lipids and AD was established with apolipoprotein E (apoE), a protein involved in cholesterol transport between tissues (27Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). In AD the apoE ϵ-4 allele reduces the age of disease onset (28Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E.

Perkins A. Lahiri D.K. Poirier J. Farlow M.R. Neurology. 2004; 62: 1869-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The link between lipids and AD has recently been significantly extended with findings connecting elevated cholesterol levels with increased amyloid plaque formation in animal models (30Sparks D.L.

On a cellular level cholesterol has been identified to be a relevant factor regulating Aβ production in vitro (34Simons M. Keller P. De Strooper B. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. Simons K. Proc. Natl.

Hall J.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 637-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). β-Secretase activity can be stimulated by cholesterol (39Kalvodova L. Kahya N. Schwille P. Ehehalt R. Verkade P. Drechsel D. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36815-36823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), the γ-secretase complex and BACE I have been found associated with lipid microdomains (40Vetrivel K.S. Cheng H. Lin W. Sakurai T. Li T. Nukina N. Wong P.C. Xu H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 22: 44945-44954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 41Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Moreover, γ-secretase activity is increased in cellular compartments in which cholesterol accumulates (42Runz H. Rietdorf J. Tomic I. de Bernard M. Beyreuther K. Pepperkok R. Hartmann T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1679-1689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme cascade of γ-secretase, APP processing, and Aβ is mechanistically linked to lipid homeostasis because Aβ regulates cholesterol and sphingomyelin homeostasis via HMG-CoA reductase inhibition and sphingomyelinase activation (43Grimm M.O. Grimm H.S. Patzold A.J. Zinser E.G. Halonen R. Duering M. Tschape J.A. De Strooper B. Muller U. Shen J. Hartmann T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed the cellular mechanism by which cellular cholesterol levels influence intracellular Aβ production. For this purpose we utilized a set of APP deletion mutants that allowed us also to analyze the influence of cholesterol on each of the Aβ generating enzymes independently of each other. Our results demonstrate that γ-secretase activity is regulated by cellular cholesterol levels and corroborate that cellular cholesterol levels also regulate β-secretase activity. Importantly, our results show that regulation of β- and γ-secretase activities by cellular cholesterol levels are, at least in part, independent of each other. This indicates that cellular cholesterol levels regulate the enzymatic activity of both secretases by different mechanisms and may indicate ways to specifically target β-secretase activity. Constructs—To clarify the modulation of cellular cholesterol levels on Aβ generation we took advantage of comparisons between the processing of APP (34Simons M. Keller P. De Strooper B. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6460-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) and of two truncated APP constructs termed C99 and C111 (Fig. 1). Whereas β-secretase is able to cleave full-length APP, γ-secretase requires previous APP cleavage by another secretase. Therefore, we used a construct termed SP-C99, which mimics β-cleaved APP, a substrate for γ-secretase, which directly yields Aβ. Thus, in comparison to full-length APP, this construct allowed us to examine Aβ generation independent of β-secretase. It was previously shown that directly expressed SP-C99 protein is processed to Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the same way as full-length APP (48Lichtenthaler S.F. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15396-15403Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To facilitate efficient removal of the signal peptide by SP peptidase, the dipeptide LE was introduced directly between the original APP signal peptide and C99 (49Dyrks T. Dyrks E. Masters C. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To further address the mechanisms involved in cholesterol-dependent regulation of Aβ production we used another construct termed SP-C111, which has the structure of δ-secretase-cleaved APP. This δ cleavage is a naturally occurring secretase cleavage event 12 amino acids N-terminal of the β-cleavage (56Tienari P.J. De Strooper B. Ikonen E. Simons M. Weidemann A. Czech C. Hartmann T. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5218-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore C111 is identical to C99 except that it contains the 12 amino acids preceding the Aβ domain. This construct resembles APP as it requires β- and γ-secretase cleavage for Aβ production. However, due to the small luminal domain the β-cleavage is not an essential prerequisite for γ-secretase cleavage. Without β-cleavage, γ-cleavage of Sp-C111 produces a 5.5-kDa Aβ-like peptide consisting of the Aβ-domain and the first 12 amino acids preceding the Aβ-domain. In this regard C111 resembles more the C99 construct that does not require β-secretase cleavage for γ-secretase activation (56Tienari P.J. De Strooper B. Ikonen E. Simons M. Weidemann A. Czech C. Hartmann T. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5218-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, the relevant Aβ generating secretases may act here independent of each other. This allowed us to analyze whether the observed inhibition of β-secretase and γ-secretase activities are due to the same or distinct mechanisms triggered by reducing the cellular cholesterol content. Moreover, C111 allowed us to analyze further the possible additive effects of β- and γ-secretase inhibition that were indicated by comparison of the APP and C99 inhibition profiles. The SpeI site in the 3′-untranslated region of the APP cDNA was removed by Klenow polymerase and the resultant blunt ends were re-ligated prior to cloning into the expression vector pSFV1 (56Tienari P.J. De Strooper B. Ikonen E. Simons M. Weidemann A. Czech C. Hartmann T. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5218-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This was necessary as the pSFV1/APP have to be linearized from the SpeI site of pSFV1. The APP cDNA was cloned into the SmaI site of the pSFV1 expression vector (56Tienari P.J. De Strooper B. Ikonen E. Simons M. Weidemann A. Czech C. Hartmann T. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5218-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Preparation of Recombinant SFV—The pSFV1/APP, pSFV1/C99, and pSFV1/C111 and pSFV helper DNAs were linearized with SpeI and in vitro transcribed as described (76Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Biotechnology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The transcription mixture of both pSFV1/APP and pSFV1/C99 or pSFV1/C111 and pSFVhelper was co-transfected into baby hamster kidney cells using electroporation (77Olkkonen V.M. Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Simons K. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The baby hamster cells were cultured in Glasgow's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamate, and 10% tryptose phosphate broth. The culture supernatant containing infective recombinant SFV particles was collected 36 h after electroporation (77Olkkonen V.M. Liljestrom P. Garoff H. Simons K. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Infections—Hippocampal neurons were prepared as described elsewhere (44De Hoop, M. J., Meyn, L., and Dotti, C. G. (1998) in Cell Biology, A Laboratory Handbook (Cellis, J., ed) Vol. 1, 2nd Ed., pp. 154–163, Academic Press, San DiegoGoogle Scholar). The glial feeding layer was replaced by addition of the B27 supplement (45Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Primary mixed cortical neurons were prepared from 14-day-old fetal rats as described earlier with slight modifications (46De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 87-90Crossref Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). Briefly pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed by etherization at gestation day E14, brains were dissected, cells were plated on 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated dishes and kept in minimal essential medium supplemented with 0.2% ovalbumin, 1% N2 supplement, and 1% B27 supplement at 5% CO2 and 36.5 °C. In the absence of a glial feeding layer, but with B27 supplement, neurons survived for 30 days or more. Experiments were performed at the age of 6–10 days. At this time neurons were mature and fully polarized (47Dotti C.G. Sullivan C.A. Banker G.A. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1454-1468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture agents were purchased from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe). Infections were performed by diluting the recombinant SFV particles with serum-free N2 medium. To allow viral entry infection was continued for 1 h, the virus solution was then removed and incubation continued for 4–6 h to allow SFV-driven protein synthesis (56Tienari P.J. De Strooper B. Ikonen E. Simons M. Weidemann A. Czech C. Hartmann T. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5218-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies G2-10 and G2-11 specific for Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively, were used for immunoprecipitation. Antibody W0-2 directed against amino acids 4–10 of human Aβ was used for detection (50Jensen M. Hartmann T. Engvall B. Wang R. Uljon S.N. Sennvik K. Naslund J. Muehlhauser F. Nordstedt C. Beyreuther K. Lannfelt L. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 291-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). W0-2 antibody (1 μg/ml) was used for detection of G2-10 and G2-11 precipitates to facilitate a greater linear range, better detection levels, and to avoid detection of endogenous rat Aβ40,Aβ42, and APP. W0-2 is specific for the human Aβ sequence. P3 was detected with G2-10. Polyclonal antibody 22/13 raised against the C-terminal 13 residues of C99 (13Grziwa B. Grimm M.O. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Hartmann T. Lichtenthaler S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6803-6808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was used for immunoprecipitation and detection of C-terminal fragments. Cholesterol Depletion—For cholesterol depletion of primary neurons we used two different strategies. De novo cholesterol synthesis was inhibited by lovastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. A basic level of mevalonate was maintained by adding mevalonate to the cell culture media to avoid toxicity due to inhibition of non-steroidal pathways (51Langan T.J. Volpe J.J. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 52Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane cholesterol was extracted by methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin is a well established tool that selectively and quickly extracts cholesterol from plasma membranes in preference to other lipids (53Kilsdonk E.P. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). These treatments reduce intracellular cholesterol without affecting cell viability and polarity within the time window selected for the experiments (54Fassbender K. Simons M. Bergmann C. Stroick M. Lutjohann D. Keller P. Runz H. Kuhl S. Bertsch T. von Bergmann K. Hennerici M. Beyreuther K. Hartmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After 4–8 days in culture, 4 μm lovastatin (Calbiochem) and 0.25 mm mevalonate (Sigma) were added for 48 h. Control cells were left untreated. Recombinant SFV encoding SP-APP695, SP-C99, or SP-C111 were prepared as described elsewhere (56Tienari P.J. De Strooper B. Ikonen E. Simons M. Weidemann A. Czech C. Hartmann T. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5218-5229Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Neurons between 6 and 10 days of age were infected for 90 min at 36.5 °C and 5% CO2 with recombinant SFV. This solution was replaced by maintenance medium and cells incubated for 2 h. Cells were then treated with 5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) for 10 min and further incubated for 4.5 h. These extraction times did not completely abolish Aβ production, therefore allowing quantification of the effects of cholesterol depletion on the production of Aβ40/Aβ42 and their ratio. For some experiments different amounts of extraction times were used as indicated. Immunoprecipitation and Quantification—Cell extracts were prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, supplemented with 2× Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). Because Aβ42 constitutes only a minor amount of total Aβ, different amounts of cell lysate were used for immunoprecipitation to obtain similar signal intensity. Cell lysates were divided for Aβ42 (80%) and Aβ40 immunoprecipitation (20%). Immunoprecipitates were recovered on protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) and analyzed on 10–20% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gels (Novex, Frankfurtg/Main). Quantitative Western blotting was performed as described (57Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R. Forstl H. Sandbrink R. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22908-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), except that 3% milk powder instead of bovine serum albumin was used for blocking. For detection of CTFs cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody 22/13 raised against the C-terminal 13 residues of C99 (13Grziwa B. Grimm M.O. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Hartmann T. Lichtenthaler S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6803-6808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and recovered on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). For detection, antibody 22/13 was used in a dilution of 1:5000. For detection of p3, conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with G2-10 and Western blot analysis was performed as described above with the exception that biotinylated G2-10 (50Jensen M. Hartmann T. Engvall B. Wang R. Uljon S.N. Sennvik K. Naslund J. Muehlhauser F. Nordstedt C. Beyreuther K. Lannfelt L. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 291-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and streptavidin-coated horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) were used for detection. Quantification was performed using Macbas-2 software with densitometric scans from Western blots standardized against control Aβ protein. Staining of Hippocampal Neurons with Filipin—Neurons grown on coverslips for 8 days were treated for 48 h with lovastatin and mevalonate and for 10 min with 5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin. After fixation on ice with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.1% saponin (Sigma) neurons were stained with 125 μg/ml filipin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Filipin is a fluorescent polyene antibiotic that forms complexes with cholesterol that can be visualized with ultraviolet light (58Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W1968814400,"The transcription factor FoxO1 contributes to the metabolic adaptation to fasting by suppressing muscle oxidation of glucose, sparing it for glucose-dependent tissues. Previously, we reported that FoxO1 activation in C(2)C(12) muscle cells recruits the fatty acid translocase CD36 to the plasma membrane and increases fatty acid uptake and oxidation. This, together with FoxO1 induction of lipoprotein lipase, would promote the reliance on fatty acid utilization characteristic of the fasted muscle. Here, we show that CD36-mediated fatty acid uptake, in turn, up-regulates protein levels and activity of FoxO1 as well as its target PDK4, the negative regulator of glucose oxidation. Increased fatty acid flux or enforced CD36 expression in C(2)C(12) cells is sufficient to induce FoxO1 and PDK4, whereas CD36 knockdown has opposite effects. In vivo, CD36 loss blunts fasting induction of FoxO1 and PDK4 and the associated suppression of glucose oxidation. Importantly, CD36-dependent regulation of FoxO1 is mediated by the nuclear receptor PPARdelta/beta. Loss of PPARdelta/beta phenocopies CD36 deficiency in blunting fasting induction of muscle FoxO1 and PDK4 in vivo. Expression of PPARdelta/beta in C(2)C(12) cells, like that of CD36, robustly induces FoxO1 and suppresses glucose oxidation, whereas co-expression of a dominant negative PPARdelta/beta compromises FoxO1 induction. Finally, several PPRE sites were identified in the FoxO1 promoter, which was responsive to PPARdelta/beta. Agonists of PPARdelta/beta were sufficient to confer responsiveness and transactivate the heterologous FoxO1 promoter but not in the presence of dominant negative PPARdelta/beta. Taken together, our findings suggest that CD36-dependent FA activation of PPARdelta/beta results in the transcriptional regulation of FoxO1 as well as PDK4, recently shown to be a direct PPARdelta/beta target. FoxO1 in turn can regulate CD36, lipoprotein lipase, and PDK4, reinforcing the action of PPARdelta/beta to increase muscle reliance on FA. The findings could have implications in the chronic abnormalities of fatty acid metabolism associated with obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2046505220,"Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA), is widely used as an immunosuppressive agent. MPA selectively inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a rate-limiting enzyme for the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, leading to depletion of the guanine nucleotide pool. Its chemotherapeutic effects have been attributed to its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. MPA treatment has also been shown to induce and activate p53. However, the mechanism underlying the p53 activation pathway is still unclear. Here, we show that MPA treatment results in inhibition of pre-rRNA synthesis and disruption of the nucleolus. This treatment enhances the interaction of MDM2 with L5 and L11. Interestingly, knockdown of endogenous L5 or L11 markedly impairs the induction of p53 and G(1) cell cycle arrest induced by MPA. These results suggest that MPA may trigger a nucleolar stress that induces p53 activation via inhibition of MDM2 by ribosomal proteins L5 and L11."
https://openalex.org/W2094946421,"Previously, it was found that a novel class of neutral fucosylated glycosphingolipids (GSLs) is required for male fertility. These lipids contain very long-chain (C26-C32) polyunsaturated (4-6 double bonds) fatty acid residues (VLC-PUFAs). To assess the role of these complex GSLs in spermatogenesis, we have now investigated with which of the testicular cell types these lipids are associated. During postnatal development, complex glycosylated and simple VLC-PUFA sphingolipids were first detectable at day 15, when the most advanced germ cells are pachytene spermatocytes. Their synthesis is most likely driven by ceramide synthase-3. This enzyme is encoded by the Cers3/Lass3 gene (longevity assurance genes), and out of six members of this gene family, only Cers3 mRNA expression was limited to germ cells, where it was up-regulated more than 700-fold during postnatal testicular maturation. Increasing levels of neutral complex VLC-PUFA GSLs also correlated with the progression of spermatogenesis in a series of male sterile mutants with arrests at different stages of spermatogenesis. Remarkably, fucosylation of the complex VLC-PUFA GSLs was not essential for spermatogenesis, as fucosylation-deficient mice produced nonfucosylated versions of the complex testicular VLC-PUFA GSLs, had complete spermatogenesis, and were fertile. Nevertheless, sterile Galgt1-/- mice, with a defective meiotic cytokinesis and a subsequent block in spermiogenesis, lacked complex but contained simple VLC-PUFA GSLs, as well as VLC-PUFA ceramides and sphingomyelins, indicating that the latter lipids are not sufficient for completion of spermatogenesis.

Tight junctions contribute to the establishment of the BTB, which is made up of adjacent Sertoli cells and physically segregates post-meiotic germ cells from nutrients and biomolecules in the systemic circulation (3Russell L.D.

The development of the male germ cells, taking place within the seminiferous tubules, is a complex and highly regulated process (2Russell, L., Ettlin, R. A., Sinha Hikim, A. P., and Clegg, E. J. (eds) (1990) Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis, pp. 1-38, Cache River Press, Clearwater, FLGoogle Scholar). During spermatogenesis, testicular stem cells (undifferentiated spermatogonia) give rise to a lineage of cells that multiply by mitosis (proliferative spermatogonia). These cells differentiate to go through the meiotic division (spermatocytes) and become haploid germ cells (spermatids), which transform into spermatozoa. It is during the meiotic prophase that leptotene spermatocytes transit the BTB. The post-meiotic development (spermiogenesis) involves a dramatic change of nuclear shape, chromatin condensation, the loss of most cell organelles, and the formation of specialized structures, including a flagellum, an acrosome, and a mitochondrial sheath. In mice, spermatogenesis is dependent on two types of glycolipids, seminolipid, a sulfated galactoglycerolipid (5Fujimoto H. Tadano-Aritomi K. Tokumasu A. Ito K. Hikita T. Suzuki K. Ishizuka I. J.

Their spermatogenesis, the transformation of diploid spermatogonial stem cells into haploid spermatozoa, abrogates at the stage of haploid spermatid formation. Spermatogonial stem cell division, proliferation, and differentiation into preleptotene and leptotene spermatocytes appears unchanged.

Recently, we performed a detailed analysis of GSLs in mouse testis revealing the presence of more than 13 complex neutral and acidic GSLs. Of these GSLs a class of eight fucosylated GSLs (FGSLs) was discovered to contain polyenoic (4-6 double bonds) very long-chain fatty acid residues (C26-C32) in their ceramide moieties (Fig. 2) (9Sandhoff R.

Comparison of infertile Galgt1-/- and fertile Siat9-/- mice, lacking different subsets of GSLs, linked the absence of neutral polyenoic FGSLs to the spermatogenic arrest of meiosis in Galgt1-/- mice suggesting an essential role of polyenoic FGSLs in meiotic and post-meiotic membrane processes (9Sandhoff R.

Two features distinguish the polyenoic FGSLs from conventional GSLs as follows: (i) their fucosylation and (ii) their fatty acid tail being mainly of very long chain and polyenoic. Both structural features could be essential for proper spermatogenesis, which has still to be clarified. In this study we present the following: (i) we classify and localize fucosylated GSLs to different germ cell classes according to their charge; (ii) we demonstrate that polyenoic very long-chain fatty acid-containing sphingolipids in general (FGSLs, GSLs, ceramides, and sphingomyelins) are restricted to germ cells and are expressed in a differentiation stage-specific manner (Fig. 1B); (iii) we link the synthesis of polyenoic VLCFA sphingolipids to the expression of one of six potential (dihydro)ceramide synthases; and (iv) we show the dispensability of sphingolipid fucosylation for the generation of functional spermatozoa.

Without stimulation of c-kit by its ligand, stem cell factor, differentiated type A spermatogonia and subsequent germ cell stages are lost. All other testicular cell types are maintained (25Ohta H. Yomogida K. Dohmae K. Nishimune Y. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 2125-2131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Light microscopy analysis of semithin Epon sections of seminiferous tubules of KitW-v/KitW mice revealed the complete absence of spermatocytes and spermatids. The atrophic tubules contained mainly Sertoli cells but also a residual undifferentiated type A spermatogonial compartment, in agreement with previous reports (25Ohta H. Yomogida K. Dohmae K. Nishimune Y. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 2125-2131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both differentiating spermatogonia and Sertoli cells undergo apoptosis (Fig. 3, A and B for overview see also supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). “Germ Cell-free” Testes (KitW-v/KitW Mice) Lack Polyenoic Sphingolipids—To distinguish which of the testicular GSLs are associated with germ cells (except from residual spermatogonia), sterile germ cell-free KitW-v/KitW and fertile control KitW-v mice were analyzed by TLC. The set of neutral FGSLs was lacking and the set of acidic FGSLs was reduced in KitW-v/KitW testes. Bands due to nonfucosylated GSLs such as Forssman lipid, GM3, GM2, GD1a, GT1b, and GQ1b appeared to be not altered or slightly enhanced (Fig. 3E). Whereas neutral FGSLs were reported previously to contain almost exclusively VLC-PUFAs, fucosylated gangliosides also contain to a significant degree palmitic acid (C16:0) (9Sandhoff R. Geyer R. Jennemann R. Paret C. Kiss E. Yamashita T. Gorgas K. Sijmonsma T.P. Iwamori M. Finaz C. Proia R.L. Wiegandt H. Grone H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27310-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, GSLs of mutant and control testes were further compared by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry: signals corresponding to complex VLC-PUFA containing neutral GSLs (IV2-α-Fuc-GA1, IV3-α-Gal, IV2-α-Fuc-GA1, IV3-α-GalNAc, IV2-α-Fuc-GA1, and IV3-α-GalNAcβ3Gal, IV2-α-Fuc-GA1) and VLC-PUFA gangliosides (IV3-α-Gal, IV2-α-Fuc-GM1a, IV3-α-GalNAc, IV2-α-Fuc-GM1a, and IV3-α-GalNAcβ3Gal,-IV2-α-Fuc-GM1a) were not detectable in KitW-v/KitW testes. Signals corresponding to VLC-PUFA FucGM1 could be detected in control mice after elimination of GD1 signals by prior digestion of the sample with sialidase from Vibrio cholerae. These signals were not present in the testis of KitW-v/KitW mice (data not shown). Taking the detection limits into account, signals for the major VLC-PUFA FGSLs, VLC-PUFA IV2-α-Fuc-GA1 (FucGA1), were reduced in KitW-v/KitW testes to at least 1% as compared with control testes. As the remaining FGSLs, only IV2-α-Fuc-GM1a (FucGM1) containing a saturated long-chain fatty acid moiety, palmitic acid, could be detected in KitW-v/KitW testes and appeared to be reduced (Fig. 3, C and D). In adult mice, FucGM1 is localized mainly in spermatogonia but not in differentiating spermatocytes (9Sandhoff R. Geyer R. Jennemann R. Paret C. Kiss E. Yamashita T. Gorgas K. Sijmonsma T.P.

By quantitative HPLC analysis of derivatized GSLs according to Neville et al. 6By this HPLC analysis, GSLs are detected quantitatively without the need of individual GSL standards. However it does not discriminate ceramide compositions of individual GSLs. For the latter, mass spectrometry was performed. (20Neville D.C. Coquard V. Priestman D.A. te Vruchte D.J. Sillence D.J. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Butters T.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 331: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), neutral FGSLs were undetectable, whereas all four fucosylated acidic GSLs (gangliosides) were detectable but were 50-75% lower in KitW-v/KitW testis as compared with controls (Fig. 6, D and E). The latter represented the fraction with long-chain saturated but not very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid moieties. Further quantitative mass spectrometric analysis of GlcCer and the nonglycosylated sphingolipids ceramide and sphingomyelin revealed that the subsets of these sphingolipids that contain VLC-PUFAs were absent from KitW-v/KitW testes (Fig. 3F). The Expression of Cers3 mRNA, Encoding a Dihydroceramide Synthase, Is Lost in Germ Cell-free Testes (KitW-v/KitW-v Mice)—Fatty acids are transferred to sphingoid bases by a family of (dihydro)ceramide synthases (CerS) encoded by the genes Cers1-6 formerly known as longevity assurance genes (Lass). To find the CerS potentially responsible for the incorporation of VLC-PUFAs into sphingolipids, testicular mRNA levels of all six Cers genes were determined in KitW-v/KitW and corresponding control mice by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). In control mice, the levels of Cers mRNAs could be ranked as Cers3 > Cers5 and Cers2 > Cers6. Cers1 and Cers4 mRNA were barely detectable. In KitW-v/KitW testes, the level of Cers3 mRNA was over 150-fold decreased, to 0.6% of control value. Cers5, Cers6, and Cers2 mRNAs could also be detected in the germ cell-free testes; their levels were 80, 45, and 20% of control values, respectively (Fig. 3G). Taking the overall decrease of Cers mRNAs in KitW-v/KitW testes into account, the only significant decrease that could be responsible for the complete loss of VLC-PUFA sphingolipids was that of Cers3 mRNA. During the First Wave of Spermatogenesis Polyenoic Sphingolipids Appear Around Postnatal Day 15/16—Having studied the GSL composition of germ cell-free testes (see above) and those of normal testes (with a full germ cell complement), we monitored the expression of VLC-PUFA glycosphingolipids in the testes during the first wave of spermatogenesis. During this phase of development, the germ cell complement of the testes gradually expands from exclusively spermatogonial precursor cells (gonocytes, at postnatal day 6) to the full range of germ cells, including the first spermatozoa (postnatal day 30-35). Over this time the germ cells develop in a synchronized fashion, offering an opportunity to identify at which developmental step germ cells first express the VLC-PUFA sphingolipids. The postnatal germ cell development has been described in detail (26Oakberg E.F. Am. J. Anat. 1956; 99: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 27Nebel B.R. Amarose A.P. Hacket E.M.

Briefly, seminiferous tubules of newborn mice contain only Sertoli cells and gonocytes, which turn into spermatogonia that subsequently proliferate and differentiate into spermatocytes and spermatids. At 10 days of age meiotic prophase is initiated, and predominantly preleptotene and leptotene primary spermatocytes are visible (Fig. 4A, for an overview see supplemental Fig. 2). At P14, spermatocytes of mainly leptotene, zygotene, and pachytene stages are found, and at P15 spermatocytes of pachytene stage are present in most tubules (Fig. 4, B and C). Between P16 and P18, the functional maturation of Sertoli cells and the blood-testis barrier are established (supplemental Fig. 3). At P20 most seminiferous tubules contain large numbers of pachytene spermatocytes, and some round spermatids are found (Fig. 4D). At P30 the number of round spermatids enlarges, and 50% of the tubules also contain elongating spermatids (supplemental Fig. 2). TLC analysis and HPLC quantification revealed that the subset of neutral FGSLs, essential for spermatogenesis beyond the stage of round spermatids, was absent b"
https://openalex.org/W2053693072,"An assay that measures synchronized, processive DNA replication by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme was used to reveal replacement of pol III by the specialized lesion bypass DNA polymerase IV when the replicative polymerase is stalled. When idled replication is restarted, a rapid burst of pol III-catalyzed synthesis accompanied by approximately 7-kb full-length products is strongly inhibited by the presence of pol IV. The production of slower-forming, shorter length DNA reflects a rapid takeover of DNA synthesis by pol IV. Here we demonstrate that pol IV rapidly (<15 s) obstructs the stable interaction between pol III* and the beta clamp (the lifetime of the complex is >5 min), causing the removal of pol III* from template DNA. We propose that the rapid replacement of pol III* on the beta clamp with pol IV is mediated by two processes, an interaction between pol IV and the beta clamp and a separate interaction between pol IV and pol III*. This newly discovered property of pol IV facilitates a dynamic exchange between the two free polymerases at the primer terminus. Our study suggests a model in which the interaction between pol III* and the beta clamp is mediated by pol IV to ensure that DNA replication proceeds with minimal interruption."

https://openalex.org/W2082097023,"The capacity to associate stimuli underlies many cognitive abilities, including recognition, in humans and other animals. Vertebrates process different categories of information separately and then reassemble the distilled information for unique identification, storage and recall. Invertebrates have fewer neural networks and fewer neural processing options so study of their behavior may reveal underlying mechanisms still not fully understood for any animal. Some invertebrates form complex social colonies and are capable of visual memory–bees and wasps, for example. This ability would not be predicted in species that interact in random pairs without strong social cohesion; for example, crayfish. They have chemical memory but the extent to which they remember visual features is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the crayfish Cherax destructor is capable of visual recognition of individuals. The simplicity of their interactions allowed us to examine the behavior and some characteristics of the visual features involved. We showed that facial features are learned during face-to-face fights, that highly variable cues are used, that the type of variability is important, and that the learning is context-dependent. We also tested whether it is possible to engineer false identifications and for animals to distinguish between twin opponents."

https://openalex.org/W1970426009,"The Drosophila immune deficiency (IMD) pathway, homologous to the mammalian tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) signaling pathway, initiates antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production in response to infection by gram-negative bacteria. A membrane-spanning peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP-LC, functions as the receptor for the IMD pathway. This receptor is activated via pattern recognition and binding of monomeric peptidoglycan (DAP-type PGN) through the PGRP ectodomain. In this article, we show that the receptor PGRP-LC is down-regulated in response to Salmonella/Escherichia coli infection but is not affected by Staphylococcus infection in vivo, and an ectodomain-deleted PGRP-LC lacking the PGRP domain is an active receptor. We show that the receptor PGRP-LC regulates and integrates two host defense systems: the AMP production and melanization. A working model is proposed in which pathogen invasion and tissue damage may be monitored through the receptor integrity of PGRP-LC after host and pathogen are engaged via pattern recognition. The irreversible cleavage or down-regulation of PGRP-LC may provide an additional cue for the host to distinguish pathogenic microbes from nonpathogenic ones and to subsequently activate multiple host defense systems in Drosophila, thereby effectively combating bacterial infection and initiating tissue repair."

PduX with a C-terminal His tag (PduX-His6) was produced at high levels in Escherichia coli, purified by nickel affinity chromatography, and partially characterized. 31P NMR spectroscopy established that purified PduX-His6 catalyzed the conversion of l-threonine and ATP to l-threonine-O-3-phosphate and ADP. Enzyme assays showed that ATP was the preferred substrate compared with GTP, CTP, or UTP. PduX displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to both ATP and l-threonine and nonlinear regression was used to determine the following kinetic constants: Vmax = 62.1 ± 3.6 nmol min–1 mg of protein–1; Km, ATP = 54.7 ± 5.7 μm and Km,Thr = 146.1 ± 8.4 μm. Growth studies showed that pduX mutants were impaired for the synthesis of coenzyme B12 de novo and from Cby, but not from cobinamide, which was the expected phenotype for an l-threonine kinase mutant. The defect in Cby assimilation was corrected by ectopic expression of pduX or by supplementation of growth medium with l-threonine-O-3-phosphate, providing further support that PduX is an l-threonine kinase.

The B12 coenzymes (adenosylcobalamin, AdoCbl, and methylcobalamin, MeCbl) are required cofactors for at least 15 different enzymes that are widely distributed in nature and are essential for human health (1Banerjee R.

Corrinoid assimilation begins with transport into the cytoplasm by the B12 uptake system (btu) followed by synthetic steps specific to a particular corrinoid (Fig. 1) (6de Veaux L.C. Clevenson D.S. Bradbeer C. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 920-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Heller K. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 904-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Van Bibber M. Bradbeer C. Clark N. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5539-5541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of Cbi, an adenosyl group is added to the central cobalt atom to form adenosyl-Cbi, which is phosphorylated to adenosyl-Cbi-phosphate (9Escalante-Semerena J.C. Suh S.J. Roth J.R. J.

J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Last, a portion of the AdoCbl is converted to MeCbl (11Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol.

(1999) in Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12 (Banerjee, R., ed) pp. 681–706, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Many of the steps used for Cbi assimilation are also used for the assimilation of Cby as well as the de novo synthesis of AdoCbl and MeCbl (Fig. 1). A key difference is that Cby assimilation and de novo synthesis require (R)-1-amino-2-propanol-O-2-phosphate (AP-P), whereas the conversion of Cbi to the B12 coenzymes does not (3Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Prior studies showed that AP-P was produced by decarboxylation of l-threonine-O-3-phosphate (l-Thr-P), which was catalyzed by the CobD enzyme (13Brushaber K.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2684-3691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These findings predicted that an l-threonine (l-Thr) kinase would be required for the de novo synthesis of AdoCbl and MeCbl, and the assimilation of Cby. However, this enzyme has not been identified in any system. In S. enterica, AdoCbl and MeCbl are required cofactors for three enzymes (5Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobik T.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). MeCbl-dependent methionine synthase is used to convert homocysteine to methionine (14Cauthen S.E. Foster M.A. Woods D.D. Biochem. J. 1966; 98: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); AdoCbl-dependent diol dehydratase and ethanolamine ammonia lyase are required for growth on 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD) and ethanolamine, respectively (15Jeter R.M.

The genes specific for 1,2-PD utilization (pdu) are found in a large contiguous cluster (15Jeter R.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Bobik T.A. Havemann G.D. Busch R.J. Williams D.S. Aldrich H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5967-5975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bioinformatic studies tentatively suggest that the last gene of the pdu operon (pduX) encodes an l-Thr kinase (18Rodionov D.A. Vitreschak A.G. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41148-41159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The PduX protein has homology to the GHMP (galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase) family of kinases and a number of PduX homologues are encoded by genes located proximal to genes for AdoCbl biosynthesis. However, no experimental studies of PduX homologues have been conducted in any system. Here, we present genetic and biochemical studies that show PduX is an l-Thr kinase used for the de novo synthesis of AdoCbl and the assimilation of Cby. To our knowledge, PduX is the first enzyme shown to phosphorylate free l-Thr.

The reverse primer used for fusing six histidine residues to the C terminus of PduX was 5′-GCCGCCAAGCTTATCAATGATGATGATGATGATGCTGCAGTTTGACCCCGCCA-3′. These PCR primers introduced BglII and HindIII restriction sites that were used for cloning into vector pTA925 or pLac22 (20Johnson C.L. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J.

Following ligation, clones were introduced into Escherichia coli DH5α by electroporation, and transformants were selected by plating on LB agar supplemented with 25 μgml–1 kanamycin (pTA925) or 100 μgml–1 ampicillin (pLac22). Pure cultures were prepared from selected transformants. The presence of insert DNA was verified by restriction analysis or PCR, and the DNA sequence of selected pduX clones was determined. Clones with the expected DNA sequence were used for further study.

To prepare the inoculum, 2 ml LB cultures were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and then cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in growth curve medium. Media were inoculated to a density of 0.15 absorbance units, and the cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm using a BioTek Synergy microplate reader and 48-well flat-bottom plates (Falcon). Each well was inoculated with 0.3 ml of culture and incubated at 37 °C as described (21Liu Y. Leal N.A. Sampson E.M. Johnson C.L. Havemann G.D. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Corrinoid Extraction and Quantification—Selected strains of S. enterica were grown aerobically on 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 1% 1,2-PD, 1 μm 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, and 5 μm CoCl2 overnight at 37 °C in 17 × 100-mm test tubes. Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0. The cell suspension was transferred into 3-ml serum vials. The vials were sealed and flushed with helium for 3 min. The suspension was autoclaved for 10 min at 121 °C, then placed on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The corrinoids present in the supernatant were quantified using a bioassay based on the AdoCbl-dependent growth of S. enterica strain BE86 on the ethanolamine minimal medium. Growth measurements were carried out using a microplate reader as described above for “growth curves.” Quantitation was based on a standard curve of vitamin B12 concentration versus maximum cell density of BE86. The assay was linear from 0 to 20 nm vitamin B12 with an r2 value of 0.9843. Growth of pduX Expression Strains—The E. coli strains used for expression of pduX were grown on 400 ml of LB supplemented with 25 μgml–1 kanamycin at 16 °C in a New Brunswick Scientific, Innova 4230, refrigerated shaker incubator with shaking speed at 275 rpm. Cells were grown to an absorbance of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were incubated at 16 °C with shaking at 275 rpm for an additional 18 h and harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C using a Beckman JA-10 rotor. Preparation of Cell Extract of S. enterica—About 2.0 g of cell paste was suspended in 8 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole and broken by French press (Thermo Electron Corp.) at 20,000 psi. Pefabloc SC PLUS was added to the cell extract to a concentration of 100 μgml–1 to inhibit proteases. The crude cell extract was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C using a Beckman JA-17 rotor to separate the soluble and insoluble fractions. The supernatant was the soluble fraction used for enzyme purification. Purification of pduX-His6—8 ml of soluble cell extract from an E. coli expression strain was loaded onto a column containing 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 5 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 80 mm imidazole, then the enzyme bound to the column was eluted with 2.5 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole. The purified protein was desalted by using PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and eluted with 3.5 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, following the manufacturer's instructions. PduX Enzyme Assay—The activity of PduX was measured by using an ADP Quest assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (DiscoverRx, Fremont, CA). The assay uses a coupled enzyme reaction system to generate hydrogen peroxide from ADP (ADP reacts with PEP to form pyruvate by pyruvate kinase, and then pyruvate oxidase generates hydrogen peroxide). Hydrogen peroxide when combined with acetyl dihydroxy phenoxazine in the presence of peroxidase generates the fluorescently active resorufin dye. Standard assay mixtures contained 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Activity was determined by monitoring the fluorescence intensity with a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader. The excitation wavelength was 530 nm and emission wavelength was 590 nm. To minimize background fluorescence, 96-well black microplates were used (Greiner Bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany). For kinetic studies, the concentrations of certain assay components varied as indicated in the text. Quantitation was based on standard curves made with ATP, GTP, CTP, or UTP. 31P NMR Spectroscopy—The products of the PduX reaction were analyzed by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Reactions were performed using conditions described for the PduX enzyme assay with 1 mg of purified PduX-His6 in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C. Protein was removed by a Vivaspin 500, 10K filtration device. Samples were transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes (WILMAD). 50 μl of 100% D2O was added (finally 5%). 31P NMR spectra of reference compounds and kinase reaction products were obtained with a 11.7 tesla magnet (Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Facility, Iowa State University, Ames, IA) and a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer at the following settings: frequency, 202.347 MHz; excitation pulse width, 8.1 μs; pulse repetition delay, 6 s; and spectral width, 12.136 kHz. Spectra were processed with TOPSPIN 1.3 software from Bruker. Chemical shifts were referenced to triphenyl phosphate, which was set to –18.0 ppm. High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—A Mono Q HR5/5 column (GE Healthcare) was used with a Varian ProStar system that included a model 230 solvent delivery module, a model 430 autosampler, and a model 325 UV-visible detector (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). Buffers A and B contained 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 50 mm and 1 m NaCl, respectively. The flow rate was 1 ml min–1, and analytes were eluted with a linear gradient from 50 to 700 mm NaCl over 10 min. The retention times for ATP, ADP, GTP, GDP, UTP, UDP, CTP, and CDP were 4.46, 6.05, 5.18, 6.28, 4.37, 5.63, 4.09, and 5.47 min, respectively. PduX Is Needed for S. enterica Growth on 1,2-PD Minimal Medium Supplemented with Cby, but Not on Similar Medium Supplemented with Cbi—l-Thr kinase is predicted to be required for the synthesis of AdoCbl from Cby, but not from Cbi (Fig. 1). Therefore, we measured aerobic growth of S. enterica and a pduX deletion mutant (BE892) on 1,2-PD minimal medium supplemented with Cby or Cbi. Under these conditions, growth requires the synthesis of AdoCbl from Cby or Cbi (15Jeter R.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Results showed that a pduX mutant was significantly impaired for growth on 1,2-PD minimal medium supplemented with Cby, but grew well on similar medium supplemented with Cbi (Fig. 2). In contrast, wild-type S. enterica grew well on 1,2-PD medium supplemented with either Cby or Cbi. The generation times of S. enterica with Cbi and Cby were 4.2 and 5.8 h, whereas those of the pduX mutant were 4.2 and 17.8 h, respectively. These are the expected phenotypes of an l-Thr kinase mutant. Normal growth with Cbi indicates that the 1,2-PD degradative pathway is intact, and that corrinoid uptake is unimpaired because a single system is used for uptake of Cbi, Cby, and other corrinoids (6de Veaux L.C. Clevenson D.S. Bradbeer C. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 920-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Heller K. Kadner R.J. J.

It also shows that pduX mutants can carry out all the steps needed for the conversion of Cbi to AdoCbl (Fig. 1). Thus, the inability of pduX mutants to use Cby can be attributed to a defect in the conversion of Cby to AdoCbi-phosphate (Fig. 1). This process requires four enzymes: 1) an adenosyltransferase (CobA); 2) an enzyme that converts AdoCby to AdoCbi-phosphate (CbiB); 3) an l-Thr-P decarboxylase (CobD); and 4) an l-Thr kinase (9Escalante-Semerena J.C. Suh S.J. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 273-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Brushaber K.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The CobA, CbiB, and CobD enzymes have been characterized in S. enterica (9Escalante-Semerena J.C. Suh S.J. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 273-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Brushaber K.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hence, the above studies suggest that PduX is an l-Thr kinase used for the conversion of Cby to AdoCbl. A pduX Deletion Mutation Is Complemented by Ectopic Expression of pduX—A pduX expression plasmid (pLac22-pduX) was introduced into a pduX deletion mutant by electroporation. This plasmid fully corrected the growth defect of a pduX mutant on 1,2-PD minimal medium supplemented with Cby (the generation time was 6.9 h compared with 6.1 h for wild-type) (Fig. 3). In contrast, plasmid without insert had little effect on growth (the generation time is 17.4 h). This showed that the observed phenotype (poor growth with Cby) resulted from the pduX mutation but not from polarity or an unknown mutation. Supplementation of Growth Media with l-Threonine Phosphate Substantially Corrects the Growth Defect of a pduX Mutant—In many cases, biosynthetic mutants are corrected by supplementation of growth medium with a downstream metabolite. Studies conducted here showed that 100 μm l-Thr-P substantially corrected the growth defect of a pduX mutant on 1,2-PD minimum media containing Cby (Fig. 4). With 100 μm l-Thr-P the generation time for a pduX deletion mutant was 8.8 h compared with a generation time of 8.3 h for the wild-type strain. Both strains reached a maximum optical density at 600 nm of about 0.4. These results indicate that PduX has a role in the synthesis of l-Thr-P. AP Is Ineffective for Correction of a pduX Deletion Mutant—Prior studies showed that a cobD mutant was partly corrected for the synthesis of MeCbl from Cby by addition of AP to growth media (23Grabau C. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2138-2144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This and subsequent findings indicated that an unknown kinase phosphorylated AP to AP-P bypassing the cobD defect (Fig. 1) (13Brushaber K.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2684-3691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, PduX was tested for AP kinase activity. However, results were negative. Both a cobD mutant and a pduX cobD double mutant grew similarly on minimal glucose medium supplemented with Cby and AP indicating that S. enterica converts AP to AP-P in the absence of PduX (data not shown). Concentrations of AP between 1 and 20 mm were tested and in no case did the PduX+ strain grow better than the PduX– strain. The studies described above were conducted in a metE background under conditions where the conversion of Cby to MeCbl is required for growth in minimal medium (24Jeter R.M. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3189-3198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tests of PduX for AP kinase activity using 1,2-PD minimal medium supplemented with Cby and enzyme assays with purified recombinant enzyme were also negative (data not shown). Thus, results indicate that PduX does not phosphorylate AP. PduX Is Needed for S. enterica Growth on Minimal Ethanolamine Medium Supplemented with Cby, but Not on Similar Medium Supplemented with Cbi—The pduX gene is the last gene in the pdu operon (17Bobik T.A. Havemann G.D. Busch R.J. Williams D.S. Aldrich H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5967-5975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurable expression of this operon requires 1,2-PD (15Jeter R.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Bobik T.A. Ailion M. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2253-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rondon M.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ailion M. Bobik T.A. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7200-7208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raised the question of whether PduX supports ethanolamine degradation. Results showed that a pduX mutant was unable to grow on ethanolamine minimal medium supplemented with Cby, but grew well on similar medium supplemented with Cbi (Fig. 5). In contrast, wild-type S. enterica grew well on ethanolamine medium supplemented with either Cby or Cbi. The generation times of S. enterica with Cbi and Cby were 4.3 and 4.4 h, whereas those of the pduX mutant were 4.3 and 33.1 h, respectively. In addition, the growth defect of the pduX mutant on ethanolamine with Cby was fully corrected by ectopic expression of pduX, showing this defect resulted from the pduX mutation, but not from polarity or an unknown mutation (data not shown). Hence, pduX is used for AdoCbl synthesis even in the absence of 1,2-PD, which is required for transcription of the pdu operon (15Jeter R.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Bobik T.A. Havemann G.D. Busch R.J. Williams D.S. Aldrich H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5967-5975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rondon M.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ailion M. Bobik T.A. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7200-7208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is surprising to us because it suggests that pduX has a different regulatory pattern than upstream genes presumed to be in the same operon. Thr-P but Not AP Supplementation Allows Growth of a pduX Mutant on Ethanolamine with Cby—The growth defect of a pduX mutant on minimal ethanolamine medium-supplemented Cby was corrected by addition of Thr-P, but not by addition of AP-P (data not shown). This was similar to results obtained with 1,2-PD (above) and provided further evidence that PduX is an l-Thr kinase. Production of MeCbl Sufficient to Support Methionine Biosynthesis Is Independent of PduX—S. enterica metE mutants require MeCbl for methionine biosynthesis; hence, l-Thr kinase should be required for growth of metE strains on minimal medium supplemented with Cby (Fig. 1) (14Cauthen S.E. Foster M.A. Woods D.D. Biochem. J. 1966; 98: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, results showed that a metE pduX double mutant grew only slightly slower than wild-type on minimal glucose medium supplemented with Cby. Doubling times for the wild-type, metE mutant, and metE pduX double mutant were 2.0, 2.0, and 3.8 h, respectively. This suggested that PduX contributed to MeCbl synthesis, but S. enterica also produced a second l-Thr kinase that allowed substantial growth of a metE mutant as is further explained under “Discussion.” PduX Is Used for the de Novo Synthesis of B12—l-Thr kinase is expected to be required for the de novo synthesis of AdoCbl (Fig. 1) (13Brushaber K.R. O'Toole G.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2684-3691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a bioassay to quantitate de novo synthesis of AdoCbl and MeCbl by S. enterica, a pduX mutant and a cbiB mutant (as negative control). These strains produced B12 in the following amounts (picomole/g of wet cells): 2620 ± 112, 280 ± 11, and undetectable, respectively. Thus, a pduX mutant produced about 11% as much B12 as the wild-type strain. S. enterica BE86 was used for the bioassay. This strain grows on ethanolamine minimal medium supplemented with complete corrinoids such as AdoCbl and M"
https://openalex.org/W2068320316,"Enhancement of AMPA receptor activity in response to synaptic plasticity inducing stimuli may arise, in part, through phosphorylation of the GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit at Ser-831. This site is a substrate for both Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase C (PKC). However, neuronal protein levels of CaMKII may exceed those of PKC by an order of magnitude. Thus, it is unclear how PKC could effectively regulate this common target site. The multivalent neuronal scaffold A-kinase-anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79) is known to bind PKC and is linked to GluR1 by synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97). Here, biochemical studies demonstrate that AKAP79 localizes PKC activity near the receptor, thus accelerating Ser-831 phosphorylation. Complementary electrophysiological studies indicate that AKAP79 selectively shifts the dose-dependence for PKC modulation of GluR1 receptor currents approximately 20-fold, such that low concentrations of PKC are as effective as much higher CaMKII concentrations. By boosting PKC activity near a target substrate, AKAP79 provides a mechanism to overcome limitations in kinase abundance thereby ensuring faithful signal propagation and efficient modification of AMPA receptor-mediated responses."
https://openalex.org/W1992183412,"CK2 is a ubiquitous, pleiotropic, and constitutively active Ser/Thr protein kinase that controls protein expression, cell signaling, and ion channel activity. Phosphorylation sites for CK2 are located in the C terminus of both β- and γ-subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). We examined the role of CK2 on the regulation of both endogenous ENaC in native murine epithelia and in Xenopus oocytes expressing rENaC. In Ussing chamber experiments with mouse airways, colon, and cultured M1-collecting duct cells, amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport was inhibited dose-dependently by the selective CK2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB). In oocytes, ENaC currents were also inhibited by TBB and by the structurally unrelated inhibitors heparin and poly(E:Y). Expression of a trimeric channel lacking both CK2 sites (αβS631AγT599A) produced a largely attenuated amiloride-sensitive whole cell conductance and rendered the mutant channel insensitive to CK2. In Xenopus oocytes, CK2 was translocated to the cell membrane upon expression of wt-ENaC but not of αβS631AγT599A-ENaC. Phosphorylation by CK2 is essential for ENaC activation, and to a lesser degree, it also controls membrane expression of αβγ-ENaC. Channels lacking the Nedd4-2 binding motif in β-ENaC (R561X, Y618A) no longer required the CK2 site for channel activity and siRNA-knockdown of Nedd4-2 eliminated the effects of TBB. This implies a role for CK2 in inhibiting the Nedd4-2 pathway. We propose that the C terminus of β-ENaC is targeted by this essential, conserved pleiotropic kinase that directs its constitutive activity toward many cellular protein complexes.

In kidney-collecting duct, distal colon, airway, secretory ducts from a variety of organs, and the absorptive sweat duct, ENaC is regulated by an interaction between the β- and γ-subunits (at their C terminus) and the E3-ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2. The WW domains of Nedd4-2 bind proline-rich PY (PXXY) motifs in each ENaC subunit leading to channel ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation and hence channel inactivation (7Debonneville C.

Nedd4-2 interaction with ENaC is positively and negatively controlled by phosphorylation of either Nedd4-2, or the C termini of both β- and γ-ENaC. Accordingly, the aldosterone-induced serum and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase, Sgk-1, phosphorylates Nedd4-2 on serines (Ser) 444 and 338, thereby reducing its interaction with the channel and causing enhanced ENaC activity (7Debonneville C.

Apart from this, Sgk-1 also phosphorylates α-ENaC directly at Ser-621, causing a stimulatory effect on the channel, which appears to be Nedd-4-2-independent (8Diakov A. Korbmacher C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38134-38142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A (PKA), which is known to activate ENaC in alveolar epithelial cells, sweat duct, and kidney, was also shown to phosphorylate Nedd4-2 (at serine residues 221, 246, and 327) and to reduce binding to ENaC (22Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Kabra R. Zhou R. Steines J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45753-45758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Moreover, PKA prevents inhibition of ENaC by preventing β-ENaC phosphorylation at threonine (Thr) 613 by the extracellular-regulated kinase (Erk) (26Yang L.M. Rinke R. Korbmacher C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9859-9868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Indeed, phosphorylation of Thr-613 in β-ENaC and Thr-623 in γ-ENaC were previously shown to increase channel affinity toward Nedd4-2, thereby down-regulating channel activity (20Shi H. Asher C. Chigaev A. Yung Y. Reuveny E. Seger R. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, differential phosphorylation of both β- and γ-ENaC subunits can either enhance or reduce its affinity for Nedd4-2, thereby controlling its degradation and hence the channel activity. Along this line, the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Grk2) was found recently to upregulate the activity of ENaC in salivary duct cells (9Dinudom A. Fotia A.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11886-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Grk2 acts at the C terminus of β-ENaC phosphorylating Ser-633, i.e. twenty amino acids downstream of Erk. Grk2 increases the activity of ENaC by rendering the channel insensitive to Nedd4-2 (9Dinudom A. Fotia A.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11886-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Notably, an increased Grk2 activity has been reported to be associated with hypertension in humans and in animal models (11Feldman R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 707-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, imbalance in ENaC channel regulation by activatory or inhibitory pathways may lead to inappropriate Na+ absorption, hypertension, or cystic fibrosis (15Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. Nitschke R. Mall M. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 440: 193-201PubMed Google Scholar). Additional phosphorylation sites at the C terminus of the β- and γ-subunits of ENaC include those for the pleiotropic but essential protein casein kinase 2 (CK2) (21Shi H. Asher C. Yung Y. Kligman L.

It has been demonstrated that CK2 specifically binds to and phosphorylates the C termini of both these ENaC subunits. As found for the Grk2 site (Ser-633) in β-ENaC, a pair of CK2 phosphorylation sites (βSer-631 and γThr-599) are located in close proximity to their respective PY motifs. CK2 is not easy to study, as siRNA approaches invariably impact on a number of targets in multiple pathways, some of which coupled to its essential function for cell survival. In a previous study, no contribution of CK2 to regulation of ENaC was observed following the mutation of single putative CK2 sites (21Shi H. Asher C. Yung Y. Kligman L. Reuveny E. Seger R. Garty H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4551-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, we investigated a role for CK2 on ENaC function in native epithelia from airway and colon as well as in Xenopus oocytes expressing rat ENaC. We found that constitutive CK2 phosphorylation not only maintains ENaC active, but it also controls the membrane expression of its subunits. Ussing Chamber Experiments—Tracheas and distal colon were removed from mice euthanized by ethically approved institutional procedures (C57BL/6, Charles Rivers, Germany). Tissues were put immediately into ice-cold buffer solution of the following composition (mmol/liter): NaCl 145, KCI 3.8, d-glucose 5, MgCI2 1, HEPES 5, Ca2+ gluconate 1.3. After stripping the colonic mucosa and opening tracheas by a longitudinal cut, tissues were mounted into a micro Ussing chamber with a circular aperture of 0.95 mm2. Mouse M-1 kidney cortex-collecting duct cells (kindly provided by C. Korbmacher, Physiologisches Institut, Universität Erlangen, Germany) were grown to confluence on permeable supports and mounted into the Ussing chamber (2Bachhuber T. König J. Voelcker T. Mürle B.

Luminal and basolateral sides of the epithelium were perfused continuously at a rate of 5 ml/min. The bath solution containing (mmol/liter) NaCl 145, KH2PO4 0.4, K2HPO4 1.6, d-glucose 5, MgCI2 1, HEPES 5, and calcium gluconate 1.3, was heated to 37 °C, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4. Experiments were carried out under open circuit conditions. Values for transepithelial voltages (Vte) were referred to the serosal side of the epithelium. Transepithelial resistance (Rte) was determined by applying short (1 s) current pulses (Δl = 0.5 μA) and after subtracting the resistance of the empty chamber, using Ohm's law (Rte =ΔVte/ΔI). Transepithelial resistances were 63 ± 3.8 Ωcm2; n = 12 (trachea), 31 ± 2.1; n = 13 (colon), and 669 ± 45 Ωcm2; n = 38 (M1). cRNAs for ENaC Subunits and CFTR—cDNAs-encoding rat (FLAG-tagged or non-tagged) αβγ-ENaC (kindly provided by Prof. Dr. B.

Isolation and microinjection of oocytes have been described in detail elsewhere (2Bachhuber T. König J. Voelcker T. Mürle B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. J. Biol.

The ENaC mutants βS631A, γT599A, βR561X, βY618A, and βS633A were generated by PCR, and correct sequences were verified by sequencing. Double Electrode Voltage Clamp—Oocytes were injected with cRNA (10 ng, 47 nl double-distilled water). Water-injected oocytes served as controls. 2-4 days after injection, oocytes were impaled with two electrodes (Clark Instruments Ltd, Salisbury, UK), which had a resistance of <1 mΩ when filled with 2.7 mol/liter KCI. Using two bath electrodes and a virtual ground head stage, the voltage drop across Rserial was effectively zero. Membrane currents were measured by voltage clamping (oocyte clamp amplifier, Warner Instruments LLC, Hamden CT) in intervals from -90 to +30 mV, in steps of 10 mV, each 1 s. The bath was continuously perfused at a rate of 5 ml/min. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (22 °C). Chemiluminescence Measurements—Oocytes were fixed for 60 min at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde (in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 8.0) and washed with TBS; (mm) 50 Tris, 138 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, pH 8.0 at room temperature. Then oocytes were incubated for 60 min in TBS with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), another 60 min with 1 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody in 1% BSA/TBS at 4 °C (Sigma-Aldrich), washed at 4 °C with 1% BSA/TBS and incubated with sheep anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:20,000 in 1% BSA/TBS for 40 min at 4 °C. Afterward oocytes were washed for 60 min at 4 °C in 1% BSA/TBS and finally in TBS (60 min, 4 °C). Oocytes were placed separately in 50 μl of ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, chemiluminescence was measured in a BioOrbit 1250 Luminometer (Turku, Finland), and an integration period of 1 s was allowed. Oocyte Staining—Oocytes were incubated for 60 min in ND96 solution (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2.0 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 5.0 HEPES, pH 7.4), fixed for 60 min with 3% paraformaldehyde (in TBS, pH 8.0) and washed in TBS. After embedding in optimum cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek Europe, Zoeterwoude, NL), oocytes were cut to 20-μm slices with a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were put in either TBS or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; (mm) 137 NaCl, 1.8 KH2PO4, 10.3 Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), incubated for 5 min in 0.1% (w/v) SDS in PBS and washed two times with either TBS or PBS. Sections were incubated for 60 min in TBS or PBS (5% BSA) and for 60 min at 37 °C with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody diluted 1:50 in 2% BSA/TBS or a goat polyclonal casein kinase IIα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) diluted 1:25 in 2% BSA/PBS. Afterward sections were washed twice in PBS and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies (donkey anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated and donkey anti-goat IgG-Alexa Fluor 546 conjugated; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:1000 in 2% BSA/PBS. Sections were washed two times with PBS for 5 min and covered with DakoCytomation fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Inc., Carpinteria, CA). Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope with a ×63 objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany). Materials and Statistical Analysis—All compounds used were of highest available grade of purity. Amiloride, 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT), forskolin, IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine), heparin, okadaic acid, poly(E:Y) peptide, and poly(K) were from Sigma. TBB was a generous gift from Prof. L. Pinna (Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Padua, Italy). The Nedd4-2 antibody was a generous gift from Prof. Dr. J. Loffing (University of Zürich, Switzerland). mNedd4-2-RNAi (5′-CCA UUU GUC CUA UUU CAC CUU CAU U-3′), xNedd4-2-RNAi (5′-GCG UGC CUA UGA AUG GAU U-3′), and mCK2-RNAi (5′-UUG UCA AGA AGA UCU AGG GCC UCC G-3′) were from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). Scrambled RNA is a mixture of double-stranded RNA sequences that has no match to any of the known Xenopus mRNA sequences. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. A p value of <0.05 was regarded as significant. CK2 Blocker Inhibits ENaC Activity—We examined the contribution of CK2 to the regulation of epithelial Na+ channels in native epithelia from mouse trachea and colon. In Ussing chamber experiments, we explored CK2-selective concentrations of the specific inhibitor TBB, which was shown to have no effect on over 30 other kinases. TBB selectivity depends on its ability to bind an unusual hydrophobic ATP binding site that differs from the equivalent in conventional kinases. Electrogenic Na+ transport in mouse trachea was assessed by inhibition of ENaC with amiloride (10 μm) (Fig. 1A). TBB (10 μm) reduced the transepithelial voltage Vte and attenuated amiloride-sensitive short-circuit currents (Isc-amil) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Similarly, TBB significantly blocked amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport in mouse distal colon (Fig. 1, C and D). This effect could be reproduced in cultured mouse M1-collecting duct cells, grown on permeable supports (Fig. 1, E and F). These combined results suggest that endogenous epithelial Na+ channels expressed in epithelial tissues are maintained in an active state by constitutively active CK2. To further confirm regulation of epithelial Na+ channels by CK2, the three (αβγ)-ENaC subunits were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and examined in double electrode voltage clamp experiments. As shown in the original recording in Fig. 2A, the simultaneous expression of the three ENaC subunits produced a large current, which was inhibited by amiloride (A, 10 μm). The CK2 structure is virtually identical in Xenopus compared with mammals. Thus, TBB (10 μm) also significantly reduced amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents and conductance (Gamil), respectively (Fig. 2, A and B) in oocytes. Another compound, DMAT, has recently been shown to inhibit CK2 with higher inhibitory potency, but it has limited efficacy in vivo due to its rapid turnover. 5L. A. Pinna, personal communication. At 2 μm, we did not observe inhibition of ENaC currents by DMAT in Xenopus oocytes; however, 5 μm reduced amiloride-sensitive ENaC conductance significantly from 31.9 ± 6.8 to 25.7 ± 4.1 μS(n = 5). Regulation of ENaC by CK2 was further validated using the structurally unrelated peptide inhibitor of CK2, poly(E:Y) and conversely, by activating CK2 with polylysine (poly(K)) (16Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Issinger O.G. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4336-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Treharne K.J. Crawford R.M. Best O.G. Schulte E.A. Chen J.-H. Gruenert D.C.

The peptides were injected into oocytes at final concentrations between 10 and 100 μm, and amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductances were compared before and 1-5 h after injection. During these few hours, ENaC conductance increased, almost doubling initial values in water-injected controls (Fig. 2), This time-enhanced Na+ conductance was nevertheless inhibited by poly(E:Y) and was further activated through stimulation of CK2 by poly(K) (Fig. 2C). CK2 is known to associate with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). To confirm phosphorylation-dependent activation of ENaC, ooctyes were exposed to okadaic acid at a PP2A-specific concentration (10 nm), which further increased amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus ENaC appears to be stimulated by constitutively active CK2 with counter-regulation by PP2A-like inhibition. To further confirm this activation by CK2, injection of the nonspecific CK2 inhibitor heparin (10 μm) also reduced Na+ conductance in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4CK2 controls membrane expression of ENaC in Xenopus oocytes. Time course for Gamil (A, C, E) and membrane expression of αFlag-ENaC (B, D, F). Ooctyes were kept in ND97 or in ND97 containing TBB (10 μm), or were injected with heparin (10 μm), poly(E:Y) (50 μm), or equal amounts (30 nl) of water. The asterisk (*) indicates significant differences when compared with ND96 or water (unpaired t-tests, 6-13 experiments for each series).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Removal of CK2 Sites from β- and γ-ENaC Inhibits Amiloride-sensitive Na+ Conductance and Renders It Insensitive to TBB—Similar to endogenous Na+ currents present in epithelial tissues (Fig. 1), ENaC expressed exogenously in Xenopus oocytes was inhibited by TBB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and C). ENaC contains two phosphorylation sites for CK2, in β-ENaC (serine 631) and γ-ENaC (threonine 599). Changing both CK2 sites to alanines (αβS631AγT599A) virtually eliminated Na+ conductance and rendered residual conductance of the double mutant channel insensitive to TBB (Fig. 3, B and D). Trimeric Na+ channels carrying only one mutation in either β-ENaC (αβS631Aγ) or γ-ENaC (αβγT599A), produced more measurable but still significantly attenuated Na+ conductances when compared with wt-ENaC (Fig. 3E). Moreover, the remaining amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductances formed by dimeric αβ-ENaC and αγ-ENaC channels were further reduced by βS631A and γT599A, respectively (Fig. 3F). Finally, coexpression of hCK2 together with wt-ENaC increased Gamil (65.9 ± 9.0 μS; n = 7), when compared with injection of wt-ENaC alone (47.2 ± 8.1 μS; n = 7). Co-expression of hCK2 did not augment Gamil of αβS631AγT599A-ENaC (3.3 ± 0.7 μS; n = 11 versus 3.4 ± 0.5 μS; n = 11). Taken together, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of βS631 and γT599 is essential for ENaC. CK2 Controls ENaC Activity and Membrane Expression of α-ENaC—To examine whether CK2 phosphorylation controls membrane expression of ENaC, FLAG-tagged α-ENaC was co-expressed with non-flagged βγ-ENaC in Xenopus oocytes. The appearance of αFlag-ENaC in the cell membrane was monitored by chemiluminescence, during an observation period of 40-48 h (Fig. 4, B, D, and F and Fig. 5A, see “Materials and Methods”). Control injection with non-flagged ENaC did not produce a chemiluminescence different from background (data not shown). In parallel, amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance was assessed at corresponding intervals (Fig. 4, A, C, and E). When αFlagβγ-ENaC was expressed in control oocytes, both Gamil and membrane expression continuously increased (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, when oocytes were kept in 10 μm TBB-containing buffer, amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance was completely abolished, and membrane expression was significantly reduced, albeit not completely. Moreover, co-injection of αβγ-ENaC-cRNAs together with the CK2 inhibitors heparin (final concentration 10 μm) or the peptide inhibitor poly(E:Y) (final concentration 50 μm) also inhibited Na+ conductance along with membrane expression of α-ENaC (Fig. 4, C-F). Finally, M1 cells were grown on permeable supports, in the absence or presence of 10 μm TBB. As observed in oocytes, TBB reduced amiloride-sensitive transport from 2.05 ± 0.35 μA/cm2 (n = 19) to 1.52 ± 0.25 μA/cm2 (n = 16). Thus, CK2 phosphorylation differentially controls membrane expression of α-ENaC and ENaC activity. Of note, the inhibitory effect on conductance (3-5-fold) was significantly greater than on membrane expression (typically 2-fold). CK2 Is Essential for ENaC Activity, but Has a Small Effect on Membrane Expression of α-ENaC—The contribution of both CK2 phosphorylation sites in β-ENaC and γ-ENaC, to membrane expression of α-ENaC was further examined by expressing single mutants (αFlagβS631Aγ-ENaC or αFlagβγT599A-ENaC) or the double mutant (αFlagβS631AγT599A-ENaC) in oocytes. For the sake of simplicity, we only show a summary of the data obtained for membrane expression and ENaC conductance after 40 h of expression of those ENaC variants (relative to wild type). Importantly, single mutations in β-ENaC or γ-ENaC largely reduced the Na+ conductance but had only a small effect on membrane expression. Elimination of both CK2 sites in β-ENaC and γ-ENaC also strongly reduced Gamil, with a minor effect on membrane expression (Fig. 5A). Of note, TBB reduced α-ENaC expression only when one CK2 site was intact. The nearby located Grk2 phosphorylation site Ser-633 was reported to control Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC (9Dinudom A. Fotia A.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11886-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We explored whether the same might hold true for CK2 phosphorylation sites. To this end, we compared whole cell conductances of several ENaC mutants to that of wt-ENaC. A mutation in the Nedd4-2 binding site (βY618A) increased ENaC whole cell conductance relative to the wild type and eliminated the inhibitory effect of S631A on ENaC conductance (Fig. 5B). This strongly suggests that CK2 phosphorylation at Ser-631 antagonizes the inhibitory action of Nedd4-2 in ENaC (20Shi H. Asher C. Chigaev A. Yung Y. Reuveny E. Seger R. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13539-13547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). Similarly, when we expressed the truncated αβR561Xγ-ENaC channel, we found that amiloride-sensitive whole cell conductance was largely increased (64.5 ± 5.9 μS; n = 14) when compared with αβγ-ENaC, and was now unaffected by 10 μm TBB (64.1 ± 6.1 μS). Interestingly, mutating the Grk2 site also reduced ENaC conductance; however, eliminating both CK2 and Grk2 sites in β-ENaC produced a channel with similar activity to that of wt-ENaC (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the closely located phosphorylation sites of CK2 and Grk2 (Ser-631, Ser-633) influence each other. The role of Nedd4-2 on CK2 regulation of ENaC was further examined by siRNA-knockdown of xNedd4-2, similar to a recent study (Fig. 5C) (18Rajamanickam J. Palmada M. Lang F. Boehmer C. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Two remarkable results were obtained, namely: (i) wt-ENaC was no longer inhibited by TBB. (ii) αβS631Aγ-rENaC, which normally produced only small amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance, generated a whole cell conductance that was indistinguishable to that obtained for wt αβγ-rENaC (Fig. 5C). These effects were not observed when scrambled RNAi was injected. The contribution of Nedd4-2 to CK2 regulation of ENaC was further examined in mammalian cells. M1 cells were grown on permeable supports after treatment with RNAi for mCK2, mNedd4-2, or scrambled RNAi, or as nontransfected control cells (Fig. 5D). Knockdown of CK2 and Nedd4-2 was verified by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S1). Isc-amil was enhanced in M1 cells following Nedd4-2 knockdown, and inhibition by TBB was largely reduced (Fig. 5D). In contrast, CK2 knockdown reduced Isc-amil and also abolished the effect of TBB on Isc-amil (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results suggest that CK2 phosphorylation of ENaC antagonizes the inhibitory effects of Nedd4-2. CK2 Controls Membrane Expression of β-ENaC and γ-ENaC—The activity of epithelial Na+ channels largely depends on co-expression of both β- and γ-subunits. Membrane expression of β-ENaC and γ-ENaC was monitored by injecting αβFlagγ-ENaC or αβγFlag-ENaC, respectively, and Na+ conductances were measured in parallel. Na+ conductances generated by either αβFlagγ-ENaC or αβγFlag-ENaC, respectively, were almost completely abolished when oocytes were exposed to 10 μm TBB, while membrane expression of βFlag and γFlag were reduced by about 50% (Fig. 6A). We further examined whether βFlag and γFlag behave in a similar fashion in the absence of α-ENaC. Dimeric channels formed by βFlagγ-ENaC or βγFlag-ENaC produced small but detectable amiloride-sensitive whole cell conductances (0.74 ± 0.2 μS; n = 8 and 0.2 ± 0.1 μS; n = 7, respectively). Interestingly expression of βFlag-ENaC and γFlag-ENaC in dimeric and trimeric channels was similar, but expression of both subunits in the dimeric channel was not affected by TBB (data not shown). This suggests a complex role of α-ENaC for expression of βγ-ENaC. To further assess the impact of CK2 phosphorylation on membrane expression of β-ENaC and γ-ENaC in trimeric (αβFlagγ-ENaC and αβγFlag-ENaC) channels, we expressed single mutants (αβS631A-Flagγ-ENaC or αβγT599A-Flag-ENaC) and double mutants (αβS631A-FlagγT599A-ENaC or αβS631AγT599A-Flag-ENaC) in the absence or presence of 10 μm TBB. For all mutant combinations, Na+ conductances were largely reduced in comparison to that of wt-ENaC, and residual conductances generated by the double mutants were insensitive to TBB (Fig. 6, B and C). In contrast, the membrane expression of β-ENaC and γ-ENaC was not affected by any of the mutations individually, and membrane expression of the double mutants (αβS631A-FlagγT599A-ENaC; αβS631AγT599A-Flag-ENaC) was no longer inhibited by TBB (Fig. 6, B and C). These data suggest that when CK2 sites are present in β-ENaC and γ-ENaC, they need to be phosphorylated to allow proper membrane expression of all three subunits. ENaC Translocates CK2 to the Cell Membrane—It has been reported that CK2 binds directly to ENaC (21Shi H. Asher C. Yung Y. Kligman L. Reuveny E. Seger R. Garty H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4551-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This suggests that CK2 may be translocated by ENaC to the cell membrane as found for CFTR (24Treha"

Interestingly, the groups of muramidase and lytic transglycosylase (digesting MurNAc-GlcNAc linkage) in B. subtilis are still not characterized, even many hydrolases in those groups, including hen egg white lysozyme, have already been identified. Previously Atrih et al. (4Atrih A. Bacher G. Allmaier G. Williamson M.P. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3956-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described that the vegetative peptidoglycan in B. subtilis includes (1→6)-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid. Thus, it is possible that lytic transglycosylase, which digests MurNAc-GlcNAc linkage with synthesis of a 1,6-anhydro bond in the N-acetylmuramic acid (5Thunnissen A.M. Dijkstra A.J. Kalk K.H. Rozeboom H.J. Engel H. Keck W. Dijkstra B.W. Nature. 1994; 367: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), hydrolyzes the vegetative peptidoglycan. However, as seen in the Pfam data base, the soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT) family contains not only lytic transglycosylase but also goose lysozyme (muramidase), and it remains unknown whether the candidate of hydrolase is lytic transglycosylase or muramidase. Therefore, we studied the SLT domain. In this study, we found that the C-terminal domain is a dl-endopeptidase that hydrolyzes the linkage of d-γ-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid of peptidoglycan and that the N-terminal domain is an N-acetylmuramidase, which digests the linkage of MurNAc-GlcNAc even though it is predicted as an SLT domain. Moreover, we report that the active sites for hydrolysis of the N-terminal domain are Glu-87 and Asp-94. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The strains of B. subtilis and Escherichia coli used are listed in supplemental Table 1. The primers used in this study are shown in supplemental Table 2. For the LacZ assay, B. subtilis was incubated on a nutrient agar plate (6Fukushima T. Yamamoto H. Atrih A. Foster S.J. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6007-6015Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) at 30 °C, and then the cells were inoculated to DSM (Schaeffer) medium (7Schaeffer P. Millet J. Aubert J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), followed by incubation at 37 °C. For purification of several proteins, E. coli was grown in LB medium (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or 2× YT medium (9Fukushima T. Kitajima T. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). If necessary, erythromycin (final concentration, 0.3 μg/ml) and ampicillin (final concentration, 50 μg/ml or 100 μg/ml) were added to B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively. Construction of a cwlT-deficient Mutant That Has a cwlT-lacZ Fusion Gene—A part of the cwlT (yddH) gene was amplified with the h-YDDH and b-YDDH primers with B. subtilis 168 DNA as a template. The amplified fragment was digested with HindIII and BamHI and then ligated to the corresponding sites of pMUTIN2, resulting in pM2-DDH. B. subtilis 168 (wild type) was transformed with the plasmid from E. coli C600(pM2-DDH) to obtain a ddH strain (cwlT::pM2-DDH) through Campbell-type recombination. The constructed strain had a cwlT gene transcriptionally fused with lacZ. Proper integration of this plasmid was confirmed by PCR. Construction of Plasmids for Overexpression of a Truncated CwlT Protein—A truncated cwlT fragment (the C-terminal domain) was amplified by PCR with the BF-YDDH and KR-YDDH primers. The obtained fragment was digested with BamHI and KpnI, and then ligated to the corresponding sites of pQE-30, resulting in pQEDDH. The plasmid was used for overexpression of CwlT-C-His (containing the region from amino acid (aa) 207 to 329 of CwlT). A truncated cwlT fragment (the N-terminal domain) was amplified by PCR with the yddH-ΔSU and yddH-ΔSDHis primers. The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and then ligated to the corresponding sites of pGEM3Zf(+), resulting in pGMddHN. The created pGMddHN was digested with EcoRI and PstI and then ligated to the corresponding sites of pQE-30, resulting in pQE-ddH-N. The plasmid was used for overproduction of CwlT-N-His (from aa 30 to 206 of CwlT). A cwlT fragment (containing the N- and C-terminal domains) was amplified by PCR with the yddH-ΔSU and yddH-fhR primers. The obtained fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and then ligated to the corresponding sites of pGMvcECWB, which has a histidine tag sequence (10Yamaguchi H. Furuhata K. Fukushima T. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 98: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), resulting in pGMddHFL. The created pGMddHFL was digested with EcoRI and PstI and then ligated to the corresponding sites of pQE-30, resulting in pQE-ddH-FL. The plasmid was used for overexpression of CwlT-FL-His (from aa 30 to 329 of CwlT). Construction of Plasmids for Overexpression of Mutated CwlT Proteins—To overexpress the N-terminal domain of mutated CwlT proteins in E. coli, plasmids for site-specific mutations were created using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the pQE-ddH-N plasmid, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For PCR amplification to create site-specific mutations in the plasmid, two complementary DNA oligomers as primers (supplemental Table 2) were used. E. coli JM109 containing the created plasmids (supplemental Table 1) overexpressed the mutated CwlT proteins (E87Q, D94N, S98A, S99A, E100Q, S101A, S115A, D133N, and S167A). Transformation of E. coli and B. subtilis—E. coli transformation was performed as described by Sambrook et al. (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and B. subtilis transformation was performed by the competent-cell method (11Anagnostopoulos C. Spizizen J. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 741-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Assay—The β-galactosidase assay was performed as described by Shimotsu and Henner (12Shimotsu H. Henner D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 380-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Wall and Peptidoglycan from B. subtilis ATCC6633 and 168—Cell wall was prepared from B. subtilis ATCC6633 (Sigma) or B. subtilis 168 as described previously (13Ohnishi R. Ishikawa S. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fein J.E. Rogers H.J. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 127: 1427-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptidoglycan from B. subtilis ATCC6633 was prepared as described by DeHart et al. (15DeHart H.P. Heath H.E. Heath L.S. LeBlanc P.A. Sloan G.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Shida et al. (16Shida T. Hattori H. Ise F. Sekiguchi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28140-28146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Zymography—SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Sambrook et al. (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Zymography was performed as described by Leclerc and Asselin (17Leclerc D. Asselin A. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), with a SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 mg/ml purified B. subtilis ATCC 6633 or 168 cell wall as a substrate for cell wall hydrolase. Renaturation was performed as described previously (18Fukushima T. Afkham A. Kurosawa S. Tanabe T. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Purification of Various CwlT Proteins—Proteins containing the C-terminal and/or N-terminal domains of CwlT were overexpressed in E. coli. E. coli JM109 harboring pQEDDH, pQE-ddH-N, or pQE-ddH-FL was incubated at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. At an absorbance of 0.7–0.9 at 600 nm, 2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture. After 2 h of incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 10 mm imidazole NPB buffer (10 mm imidazole, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4)). Purification of CwlT-C-His, CwlT-N-His, and CwlT-FL-His was performed as described previously (10Yamaguchi H. Furuhata K. Fukushima T. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 98: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the purification of various mutated CwlT proteins, E. coli JM109 containing a plasmid, pQEYN-XXX (where X is any letter (supplemental Table 1)), was incubated in 2× YT medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. At an absorbance of 0.7 at 600 nm, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture. After 1 h of incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 20 mm imidazole NPB buffer (20 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4)). The various mutated CwlT proteins were purified as described previously (10Yamaguchi H. Furuhata K. Fukushima T. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 98: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Determination of the Optimum pH Values and Temperatures of CwlT-N-His, CwlT-C-His, and CwlT-FL-His—Determination of the optimum pH values and temperatures of the truncated CwlT proteins was performed as described previously (3Fukushima T. Yao Y. Kitajima T. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2007; 278: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Ohnishi R. Ishikawa S. Sekiguchi J. J.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One unit of hydrolase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to decrease the absorbance at 540 nm by 0.001 in 1 min (3Fukushima T. Yao Y. Kitajima T. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2007; 278: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Ohnishi R. Ishikawa S. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fukushima T. Afkham A. Kurosawa S. Tanabe T. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Determination of the Sites of Cleavage of Cell Wall by CwlT-C-His—Determination of the sites of cleavage of cell wall for CwlT-C-His was performed as described previously (10Yamaguchi H. Furuhata K. Fukushima T. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 98: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Ohnishi R. Ishikawa S. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Glycan Strands of GlcNAc-MurNAc Polymer from Peptidoglycan—To remove peptide side chains from the glycan strands, the digestion of peptidoglycan by h-CwlH, which is an N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase (19Nugroho F.A. Yamamoto H. Kobayashi Y. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6230-6237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was performed as described previously (9Fukushima T. Kitajima T. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To separate the glycan strands and peptide side chains, the sample was applied to a Sep-Pak Plus (C18) cartridge (Waters) equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The cartridge was washed with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and glycan strands were eluted with a stepwise gradient of 5, 10, 20, and 30% CH3CN containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The fractions were checked by gel filtration on a TSKgelG2000SW column (TOSOH) as described by Fukushima et al. (9Fukushima T. Kitajima T. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to determine whether or not the glycan strands could be separated from the peptide side chains. Because the fraction eluted with 20% CH3CN containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid contained glycan strands, the eluate was freeze-dried and used for digestion of glycan strands with CwlT-N-His. Digestion of Glycan Strands of GlcNAc-MurNAc Polymer by CwlT-N-His—After dried glycan strands had been dissolved in 300 μl of 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 0.1 mg/ml CwlT-N-His was added to the mixture, which was then kept at 37 °C overnight. The mixture was divided into two (samples 1 and 2), and phosphoric acid was added to one-half (sample 1) to adjust the pH to 2–3. (This sample is the “nonreduced sample.”) On the other hand, after the other half (sample 2) and 150 μl of 0.5 m borate buffer (pH 9.0) had been mixed, 12.5 mg/ml NaBH4 was added to the sample, which was then kept at 37 °C for 30 min to reduce the reducing ends of amino sugars. Finally, the pH of the sample was adjusted at 2–3. (This sample is the “reduced sample.”) The samples were separated by RP-HPLC as described previously (9Fukushima T. Kitajima T. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For this HPLC, a Symmetry Shield PR18 column (Waters) was used, and elution buffer A consisting of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and elution buffer B consisting of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and 40% CH3CN were prepared. Elution was performed for 10 min with buffer A (nongradient) and then for 30 min with a linear gradient of buffer B (from 0 to 50%). Identification of Separated Peaks on RP-HPLC by ESI-MS and AXIMA-QIT—The peaks obtained on RP-HPLC were freeze-dried. For analysis by ESI-MS (Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD Trap VL), samples were dissolved in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The fragment ions were detected in the negative mode. For analysis with an AXIMA-QIT (Shimadzu), after the samples had been dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% acetic acid, 0.5 μl of the sample and 0.5 μl of a dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution (10 mg of dihydroxybenzoic acid dissolved in 1 ml of 40% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) were mixed on a plate for MS, and then the mixture was dried. The fragment ions were detected in the positive and negative modes, and these fragment ions were used for MS-MS analysis. Identification of the Active Site of the N-terminal Domain of CwlT—To identify the active sites of the N-terminal domain of CwlT, 2.5 μg of wild-type CwlT-N-His and each mutated CwlT protein (E87Q, D94N, S98A, S99A, E100Q, S101A, S115A, D133N, and S167A) was applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 mg/ml purified B. subtilis cell wall. The gel was also used for zymography, as described above. For quantification of the cell wall hydrolase activities of CwlT-N-His and the mutated CwlT proteins, the purified proteins were precipitated with 2.5% (w/v) (final concentration) of trichloroacetic acid on ice for 25 min to remove salts from the protein samples. After the samples were centrifuged, the pellets were washed with 70% ethanol and then dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were used for zymography as described above, and then the intensity of the hydrolytic bands by zymography was quantified with the NIH image program. Amino Acid Sequence of CwlT—It is predicted that CwlT has two domains associated with cell wall hydrolase activity. Fig. 1 shows the domain structure of CwlT. With the Pfam data base, its N-terminal and C-terminal domains were assigned as an SLT and NlpC/P60 (dl-endopeptidase), respectively. With the BLAST software program, the similarity between the C-terminal domain of CwlT (from aa 211 to 327) and the dl-endopeptidase domain of LytF (from aa 375 to 486) is 37%; however, the C-terminal domain of CwlT (from aa 212 to 327) is also similar to a part of PgdS (from aa 169 to 285), which is a poly-γ-glutamate depolymerase (20Suzuki T. Tahara Y. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2379-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (the similarity is 43%). On the other hand, the N-terminal domain of CwlT is not very similar to an SLT domain (25.9%). It is also predicted that CwlT has a lipoprotein signal peptide, and the cleavage site may be 20FVL ↓ C23 (the arrow and numbers indicate the cleavage point and positions of amino acids, respectively) described by Tjalsma et al. (21Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. Jongbloed J.D. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 515-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Transcription of CwlT with Mitomycin C—The cwlT gene was predicted to be located in the prophage region (1Smith T.J. Blackman S.A. Foster S.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 22Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Borriss R. Boursier L. Brans A. Braun M. Brignell S.C. Bron S. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar). Recently this region was determined to be an integrative and conjugative element, ICEBs1 (23Auchtung J.M. Lee C.A. Monson R.E. Lehman A.P. Grossman A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12554-12559Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To analyze the expression of cwlT, a cwlT-lacZ transcriptional fusion gene was constructed, and the transcription of cwlT was determined asβ-galactosidase activity. When the constructed strain was incubated in Difco sporulation medium (DSM), there was no β-galactosidase activity (data not shown). When mitomycin C, which is an inducer of ICEBs1 (23Auchtung J.M. Lee C.A. Monson R.E. Lehman A.P. Grossman A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12554-12559Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), was added to DSM, the activity was increased around 2 Miller units (supplemental Fig. 1). This finding suggested that cwlT is expressed through induction of ICE with mitomycin C. Cell Wall Lytic Activity of the N-terminal and C-terminal Domains—To confirm that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are cell wall hydrolases, CwlT-N-His, CwlT-C-His, and CwlT-FL-His were purified by affinity chromatography. Fig. 2A shows the SDS-PAGE and zymography of the purified proteins. All of the purified proteins (CwlT-N-His (21.0 kDa), CwlT-C-His (15.0 kDa), and CwlT-FL-His (34.8 kDa)) gave only a single band on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and these bands exhibited cell wall lytic activity. This finding suggests that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of CwlT have cell wall hydrolase activity. The enzymatic properties of CwlT derivatives were determined. Fig. 2B shows the activities against cell wall under the optimum conditions (the optimum temperature and pH for all proteins were 32 °C and 6.5, respectively.). CwlT-N-His and CwlT-C-His had almost the same cell wall lytic activity (CwlT-N-His, 90 units/nmol (4,290 units/mg protein); CwlT-C-His, 90 units/nmol (6,000 units/mg protein)). The lytic activity of CwlT-FL-His was 212 units/nmol (6,090 units/mg protein). Because there was a possibility that the activity of CwlT-FL-His may only depend on one of the two catalytic domains, the amino terminal and reduced sugar terminal amounts released by the activities of dl-endopeptidase and muramidase (see below) from the cell wall were determined with ninhydrin and by the Nelson-Somogyi method (24Green F. Clausen C.A. Highley T.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), respectively (supplemental Table 3). These results clearly indicated CwlT-FL-His has both dl-endopeptidase and muramidase activities. Determination of the Sites of Cleavage of B. subtilis Cell Wall by the C-terminal Domain—The sites of cleavage of peptidoglycan by the C-terminal domain of CwlT were determined by the dinitrophenyl method described by Yamaguchi et al. (10Yamaguchi H. Furuhata K. Fukushima T. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 98: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and Ohnishi et al. (13Ohnishi R. Ishikawa S. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified cell wall of B. subtilis was digested with CwlT-C-His and then the free amino groups of the digested sample were labeled with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, followed by hydrolysis of glycoside and amido linkages of the cell wall with HCl. Finally, the dinitrophenyl (DNP)-amino acids were separated by RP-HPLC. Fig. 3 shows the amounts of detected DNP-amino acids. Mono-DNP-A2pm and bis-DNP-A2pm increased during the enzymatic reaction; however, DNP-l-Ala, DNP-d-Ala, and DNP-d-Glu were not detected (Fig. 3; data not shown). From this experiment, CwlT-C-His is not a dd-endopeptidase that can digest the cross-linkage between d-alanine and meso-diaminopimelic acid because the DNP derivative on dd-endopeptidase digestion should be only mono-DNP-A2pm. Thus, the results suggest that the C-terminal domain of CwlT has the dl-endopeptidase activity. Determination of the Sites of Cleavage of B. subtilis Cell Wall by the N-terminal Domain—With the Pfam data base, the N-terminal domain of CwlT was assigned as an SLT. Because lytic transglycosylases digest the linkage of peptidoglycan between MurNAc and GlcNAc, the glycan strands (mainly [GlcNAc-MurNAc]n) derived from peptidoglycan of B. subtilis were purified as a substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified glycan strands without reduction of the ends of amino sugars were digested with CwlT-N-His, and then the sample was separated by RP-HPLC as described by Fukushima et al. (9Fukushima T. Kitajima T. Sekiguchi J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As a result, several peaks were detected (Fig. 4A), indicating that CwlT-N-His could digest the glycan strands. A lytic transglycosylase produces a 1,6-anhydro bond in MurNAc, and the resulting product does not have a reducing end on the amino sugar (25Engel H. Kazemier B. Keck W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6773-6782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the digested sample has a reducing end on amino sugar or not, glycan strands digested with CwlT-N-His were reduced with sodium borohydride, and then the sample was separated by RP-HPLC. The detected peaks (Fig. 4B) were different from those of the nonreduced sample (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that glycan strands digested with CwlT-N-His have a reducing end on amino sugar and thus this enzyme is not a lytic transglycosylase. In other words, it may be a muramidase or glucosaminidase because the enzyme could digest the glycan strands. In Fig. 4B, peaks A–E were collected, and then MS analysis was performed with ESI-MS. As a result, MS analysis of these materials revealed fragment ions at m/z 975 (peak A), 726 (peak B), 965 (peak C), 1,204 (peak D), and 1,443 (peak E) in the negative mode. These values for peaks A–E corresponded to [M – H]– of a tetrasaccharide (consisting of GlcNAc and MurNAc with a reduced end; the reducing end of the oligosaccharide was reduced with NaBH4) (Mr, 975), [M – 2H]2– of a hexasaccharide with a reduced end (Mr, 726), [M – 2H]2– of an octasaccharide with a reduced end (Mr, 965), [M – 2H]2– of a decasaccharide with a reduced end (Mr, 1,205), and [M – 2H]2– of a dodecasaccharide with a reduced end (Mr, 1,444), respectively. To clarify whether CwlT-N-His is a muramidase or glucosaminidase, peak A (tetrasaccharide with a reduced end) and peak B (hexasaccharide with a reduced end) in Fig. 4B were identified by MS-MS analysis with an AXIMA-QIT. MS analysis of peak A in the positive and negative modes gave fragment ions at m/z 999.4 and 975.2, respectively. These values correspond to [M + Na]+ and [M – H]– of a tetrasaccharide with a reduced end, respectively. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5A (positive MS-MS analysis) and Fig. 5B (negative MS-MS analysis) on MS-MS analysis, peak A represented a tetrasaccharide with a reduced end (GlcNAc-MurNAc-GlcNAc-MurNAcr) (Fig. 5C). For peak B, MS analysis in the positive and negative modes showed fragment ions at m/z 1,477.6 and 1,453.2, respectively. On MS-MS analysis of peak B, peak B represented a hexasaccharide with a reduced end ([Glc-NAc-MurNAc]2-GlcNAc-MurNAcr) (supplemental Fig. 2). Because a muramidase produces the GlcNAc-MurNAc oligosaccharides, these results suggest that the N-terminal domain of CwlT is a muramidase. Moreover, to confirm that CwlT-N-His is a muramidase, peaks B and C in Fig. 4B were digested with hen egg white lysozyme (muramidase), and the reducing ends of amin"
https://openalex.org/W2094079825,"Graphite whiskers (GWs), an allotrope of carbon that has been proposed to occur in space, have been discovered in three CV-type carbonaceous chondrites via Raman imaging and electron microscopy. The GWs are associated with high-temperature calcium-aluminum inclusion (CAI) rims and interiors, with the rim of a dark inclusion, and within an inclusion inside an unusual chondrule that bears mineralogy and texture indicative of high-temperature processing. Current understanding of CAI formation places their condensation, and that of associated GWs, relatively close to the Sun and early in the condensation sequence of protoplanetary disk materials. If this is the case, then it is a possibility that GWs are expelled from any young solar system early in its history, thus populating interstellar space with diffuse GWs. Graphite whiskers have been postulated to play a role in the near-infrared (near-IR) dimming of type Ia supernovae, as well as in the thermalization of both the cosmic IR and microwave background and in galactic center dimming between 3 and 9 micrometers. Our observations, along with the further possibility that GWs could be manufactured during supernovae, suggest that GWs may have substantial effects in observational astronomy."

In mammalian in vitro systems, mtDNA transcription requires mtRNA polymerase, transcription factor A (TFAM), and either transcription factor B1 (TFB1M) or B2 (TFB2M). We have silenced the expression of TFB2M by RNA interference in Drosophila melanogaster. RNA interference knockdown of TF2BM causes lethality by arrest of larval development. Molecular analysis demonstrates that TF2BM is essential for mtDNA transcription during Drosophila development and is not redundant with TFB1M. The impairment of mtDNA transcription causes a dramatic decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial ATP synthesis in the long-lived larvae, and a metabolic shift to glycolysis, which partially restores ATP levels and elicits a compensatory response at the nuclear level that increases mitochondrial mass. At the cellular level, the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by TFB2M knockdown causes a severe reduction in cell proliferation without affecting cell growth, and increases the level of apoptosis. In contrast, cell differentiation and morphogenesis are largely unaffected. Our data demonstrate the essential role of TFB2M in mtDNA transcription in a multicellular organism, and reveal the complex cellular, biochemical, and molecular responses induced by impairment of oxidative phosphorylation during Drosophila development.

The majority of cellular ATP is generated by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) 4The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; AEL, after egg laying; BrdUrd, 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; da, daughterless; IR, inverted repeat; TFB1/2M, mitochondrial transcription factor B1/2; TFAM, mitochondrial transcription factor A; UAS, upstream activating sequences; RNAi, RNA interference; qPCR, quantitative PCR; d, Drosophila; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 4The abbreviations used are: OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; AEL, after egg laying; BrdUrd, 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; da, daughterless; IR, inverted repeat; TFB1/2M, mitochondrial transcription factor B1/2; TFAM, mitochondrial transcription factor A; UAS, upstream activating sequences; RNAi, RNA interference; qPCR, quantitative PCR; d, Drosophila; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The OXPHOS system is composed of five multiprotein complexes that contain subunits encoded in two genomes, nuclear and mitochondrial. As a consequence, the biogenesis of the OXPHOS system is subject to a highly coordinated, dual genetic control (1Garesse R. Vallejo C.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes 13 essential proteins in animals that participate in four of the five OXPHOS complexes (I, III, IV, and V), as well as the genes for the two ribosomal RNAs and 22 tRNAs of the mitochondrial translational machinery. Both mtDNA and mtRNA metabolism in eukaryotic cells require nuclear-encoded, organelle-specific factors. A dedicated RNA polymerase that is evolutionarily related to the bacteriophage T3, T7, and Sp6 RNA polymerases, and a limited number of auxiliary factors direct transcription of mitochondrial genes (2Gaspari M. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1659: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Shadel G.S. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4Bonawitz N.D. Clayton D.A. Shadel G.S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 813-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the basal transcriptional machinery comprises the yeast mtRNA polymerase, Rpo41p, and a specificity factor, the transcription factor B (Mtf1p), which facilitates the binding of the RNA polymerase to numerous promoters scattered in the yeast mitochondrial genome (5Schinkel A.H. Groot Koerkamp M.J. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3255-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22671-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2101-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although Mtf1p was initially considered to be a σ factor, its structure is homologous to bacterial rRNA dimethyltransferases (8Schubot F.D. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The mammalian mitochondrial genome differs substantially from yeast mtDNA in several aspects including its small size, lack of introns, and presence of only two promoters located in the non-coding region, also known as the displacement loop region (9Clayton D.A. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1992; 15: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Each promoter directs the synthesis of a polycistronic transcript encompassing all of the genes contained in each strand, the light strand (L strand) and the heavy strand (H strand). The light strand promoter contains a single transcriptional start site, whereas the heavy strand promoter initiates RNA synthesis from two sites, one used specifically for the synthesis of the rRNAs (10Martin M. Cho J. Cesare A.J. Griffith J.D. Attardi G. Cell. 2005; 123: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Likewise, the mammalian transcriptional machinery differs from that of yeast. It comprises the mtRNA polymerase that contributes critically to promoter specificity (11Gaspari M. Falkenberg M. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4606-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and two transcription factors, TFAM (also known as mtTFA) and TFBM (also known as mtTFB). TFAM is a member of the high mobility group family of proteins and is related structurally to bacterial HU protein (12Parisi M.A. Clayton D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 13Parisi M.A. Xu B. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1951-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). TFAM plays a dual role in mtDNA maintenance and transcription (14Larsson N.G. Wang J. Wilhelmsson H. Oldfors A. Rustin P. Lewandoski M. Barsh G.S. Clayton D.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of the TFBM factor in mammals that are encoded by different genes, TFB1M and TFB2M (15Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The establishment of an in vitro transcription system employing recombinant proteins showed that both factors can stimulate specific transcription from light and heavy strand promoters, in a reaction that is strictly dependent on TFAM, and arguing that the basal transcription machinery in mammals is composed of mtRNA polymerase, TFAM, and either TFB1M or TFB2M, with the latter being at least 1 order of magnitude more active in the in vitro system (15Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 16McCulloch V. Seidel-Rogol B.L. Shadel G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Similar to yeast mtTFB, the mammalian TFBM factors are related structurally to bacterial rRNA dimethyltransferases. Recent evidence demonstrates that both TFB1M and TFB2M can bind S-adenosylmethionine in vitro, and can methylate the Escherichia coli small rRNA in vivo (17Seidel-Rogol B.L. McCulloch V. Shadel G.S. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Cotney J. Shadel G.S. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting dual roles for both TFBM factors in transcription and translation. Information about the mechanism of transcription in other animal systems remains more limited. The structure and gene content of the Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial genome is similar to that of mammals (19Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fly mtDNA is also transcribed polycistronically, most likely from several promoters (20Berthier F. Renaud M. Alziari S. Durand R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4519-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Drosophila contains genes homologous to mtRNA polymerase, TFAM, TFB1M, and TFB2M, suggesting that the basal transcriptional machinery is conserved from fly to man. We have recently demonstrated by RNAi knockdown that d-TFB2M is essential for mtDNA transcription and replication in Schneider cells (21Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In striking contrast, the knockdown of d-TFB1M does not affect either process, but reduces significantly the efficiency of mitochondrial translation (22Matsushima Y. Adán C. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16815-16820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that d-TFB1M is important for mitochondrial protein biosynthesis in vivo. To date, the data we have reported in Drosophila Schneider cells represent the only in vivo evidence regarding the cellular role of the two TFBM factors, and data evaluating their roles in the whole animal are lacking. To address this question we have silenced by RNAi the expression of d-TFB2M in transgenic flies. Our data show unequivocally that d-TFB2M is essential for mtDNA transcription during Drosophila development. The mitochondrial impairment caused by the decrease in TFB2M level elicits a complex retrograde response including a shift to glycolysis, and an increase in the mitochondrial mass. Fly Stocks and Culture—Flies were raised on standard yeast-glucose-agar medium at 25 °C and 65% relative humidity in 12-h light/dark cycles unless otherwise indicated. The y1w1118 embryos were microinjected with the appropriated transformation plasmids. To determine the chromosomal location of the transgenes and manipulation of transgenic lines the stock w; CyO/If; TM6B/MKRS was used. Other stocks and GAL4 lines used in this study were: w; UAS-LacZ/UAS-LacZ; w; mioLacZ/mioLacZ; w; da-GAL4/da-GAL4. The driver da-GAL4 was obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University (genotype: w*;P{GAL4-da.G32}UH1, #5460). The UAS-LacZ reporter line (23Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. G. Morata. The mioLacZ/mioLacZ line was a gift of Dr. M. Cervera. Generation of Transgenic UAS-IRB2 Lines—The constructs needed for RNAi consisted of inverted repeat (IR) fragments from d-TFB2M cDNA cloned into the pUAST Drosophila transformation vector. The IRB2-insert was 365 bp long and obtained as previously described (21Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recombinant pUAST-IR constructs were transformed in Sure competent bacteria (Stratagene) to minimize DNA recombination. Transgenic lines were generated by microinjection of the pUAST-IR plasmids in y1w1118 embryos according to standard procedures (24Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar). Two independent transgenic lines (UAS-IRB2 A-B) were obtained for silencing d-TFB2M. Each of them carried a single independent insertion in chromosome III, which was brought to homozygosis. Chromosome insertion was determined using balancer stocks. UAS-GAL4 Experiments—IRB2 fragments were expressed using the UAS-GAL4 system described by Brand and Perrimon (23Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The daughterless GAL4 driver (da-GAL4) yields a high and ubiquitous transgene expression throughout development and was used to induce the silencing of d-TFB2M. The homozygous da-GAL4 driver was crossed to homozygous UAS lines and the progeny was subjected to study. Crosses were set with ∼100–150 individuals in standard food vials and were passed daily. Weight and Size Analysis—Body weight of third instar larvae was measured with a precision scale (max = 410 g, d = 0.001 g; Boeco). About 50 larvae reared under the same growth conditions were collected 7 or 14 days after egg laying (AEL), washed, and transferred to a plastic tube before weighing. Oligonucleotides—All oligonucleotides were purchased from Isogen (The Netherlands). All sequences are given in the 5′ to 3′ direction. Probes used for Southern and Northern hybridization were PCR products obtained from the amplification of Drosophila nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs using the following primers: d-Cytb (dir): AGGTGTTACTAAAGGAGTTGCTGG; d-Cytb (rev): TACGTAACATCTTTAGCCTCTAATG; d-ND4 (dir): AGGAGCTGCTATATTAGCTG; d-ND4 (rev): CAGCCAGAACGTTTACAAGC; d-RP49 (dir): GACCATCCGCCCAGCATAC; d-RP49 (rev): AGAACGGAGGCGACCGTTG; d-histone (dir): ACACACGGAACACGAATGCTCG; d-histone (rev): AGCGAAGCCAAAGCCTGTAGTAGC. Oligonucleotides used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) are as follows: d-mtTFB2 (dir): CCCAGAAAGCGTTTACAGAT; d-mtTFB2 (rev): GAGATGTATGTATATGGGTG; d-mtTFB1 (dir): GCACAACAGGATGGCCCAA; d-mtTFB1 (rev): CGCTCGTCCATGAGGAAG; d-RPOLII (dir): GAGTCCGCGTAACACCTATCAAA; d-RPOLII (rev): ACAAGTGGCTTCATCGGATAGTAAAG. Quantitative RT-PCR Assays—About 10 frozen larvae from each genotype were used for RNA extraction with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). From each sample 2 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions using oligo(dT) as a primer and the SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The gene encoding the 140-kDa subunit of RNA polymerase II was used as a normalizing internal control (25Marin M.C. Rodriguez J.R. Ferrus A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exon-specific oligonucleotide primers for the two genes tested, d-TFB1M and d-TFB2M, were designed with Primer3 software. Real time PCRs were performed in a Rotor Gene thermocycler (Corbett Research) using SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes) as double-stranded DNA binding dye and the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min; 40 cycles (94 °C for 20 min; 58 °C for 20 min; 72 °C for 20 min; 82 °C for 15 min); 72 °C for 6 min; 50 °C for 3 min; melting ramp. Each sample contained 1× SYBR Green I, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1× enzyme buffer, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (Biotools), 0.3 μm from each oligonucleotide, and 4 μl of a 1/20 dilution of the reverse transcribed products in a final volume of 20 μl. Three separate samples were collected from each genotype and triplicate measurements were conducted. Immunoblotting—Mitochondrial protein extracts obtained by differential centrifugation were fractionated by 10.5% SDS-PAGE (20 μg/lane) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were preincubated for 1 h with 5% skim milk in PBS, followed by incubation for 1 h with the corresponding primary antibody. Polyclonal antibodies against Drosophila TFB1M and TFB2M were used as previously described (21Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Matsushima Y. Adán C. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16815-16820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against Drosophila hsp60 was used at 1:400 dilution and was a kind gift of Dr. Juan Fernández-Santarén. To detect the mtDNA-encoded COXIII subunit, we used a monoclonal antibody raised against the COXIII yeast subunit (Molecular Probes) at a 1:200 dilution. As loading control, an antibody against Drosophila β-ATPase was used as previously described (26Peña P. Garesse R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). DNA Extraction and Southern Blotting—Aliquots of 10 frozen third instar staged larvae were ground in 400 μl of homogenization solution that contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 60 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS. The precipitates were removed by centrifugation and the supernatants were extracted once with phenol/chloroform (1:1), treated with 10 μg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 15 min, re-extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1), and precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. DNA precipitates were washed with 80% ethanol and resuspended in 50 μl of H2O. Southern analysis was performed as previously described (21Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and Northern Blotting—Aliquots of 10 frozen third instar staged larvae were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using standard procedures, RNA (5 μg/lane) was fractionated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, blotted onto a Zeta-Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) and hybridized to randomly 32P-labeled probes for each of these genes: ribosomal protein 49 (RP49), cytochrome b (Cytb), and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4). Hybridization, washing, and autoradiography of the membranes was performed as previously described (21Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Preparations—For ATP synthesis determination, aliquots of fresh third instar larvae were ground in buffer containing 0.22 m sucrose, 0.12 m mannitol, 40 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA as described previously (27Toivonen J.M. O'Dell K.M. Petit N. Irvine S.C. Knight G.K. Lehtonen M. Longmuir M. Luoto K. Touraille S. Wang Z. Alziari S. Shah Z.H. Jacobs H.T. Genetics. 2001; 159: 241-254PubMed Google Scholar) and mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation. For enzymatic measurements, the same procedure was followed except for grounding buffer, which contained 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 100 IU/liter heparin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and purified mitochondria were sonicated for 6 s at 4 °C, frozen and thawed. Protein determination was performed using the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis—Mitochondrial ATP synthesis was measured with an Optocomp I BG-1 luminometer (GEM Biomedical Inc.) using the ATP Bioluminiscent Assay Kit (Sigma). Incubation buffer contained 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KH2PO4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm ADP, and 54 μm APP. Substrates used were glutamate and malate, 10 mm each. Calibration was performed at the end of every measurement by the addition of 100 pmol of ATP. OXPHOS Activities—Mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes and citrate synthase activities were measured as described previously (28Perez-Carreras M. Del Hoyo P. Martin M.A. Rubio J.C. Martin A. Castellano G. Colina F. Arenas J. Solis-Herruzo J.A. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 999-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Incubation temperatures were 30 °C except for complex IV, which was measured at 38 °C. Enzyme activities are expressed in nanomoles of substrate catalyzed per minute and per milligram of protein. Metabolite Measurements—Determinations of glycolytic intermediates, ATP, ADP, and AMP, was performed as described previously (29Gonzalez-Mateos F. Gomez M. Garcia-Salguero L. Sanchez V. Aragon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7809-7817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications on sample preparation. About 0.5 g of frozen third instar larvae were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold 8% perchloric acid, 40% ethanol and further treated as indicated to obtain cytosolic extracts. Metabolites were measured in a UV-visible spectrophotometer UV-1603 (Shimadzu Corp.). Histochemistry—Standard procedures were used to assay β-galactosidase enzyme activity in w;UAS-LacZ/+; UAS-IRB2/daGAL4 larvae with minor modifications (30Marco-Ferreres R. Vivar J. Arredondo J.J. Portillo F. Cervera M. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 681-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The complete expression pattern was visualized after 10 min of staining at room temperature. The preparations were viewed in a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope. Images were captured using an Olympus DP50 digital camera and ViewFinder and Studio Lite software. Neuromuscular Joint Staining—Dissected larvae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then washed in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100 every 15 min for 1 h. To visualize neurons, the fixed preparations were blocked in PBS, 5% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% Triton X-100 for 30 min, incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-horseradish peroxidase (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch), washed four times in PBS, 0.4% Triton X-100 for 1 h, and incubated with the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 568 (1:400; Molecular Probes) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Then they were washed in PBS, 0.4% Triton X-100 every 15 min for 1 h and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Preparations were imaged using a Leica TCS SP2 laser-scanning microscope (Heidelberg, Germany) with ×63 or ×100 oil immersion lenses. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Labeling in the Larval Central Nervous System—BrdUrd incorporation was performed as previously described (31Truman J.W. Bate M. Dev. Biol. 1988; 125: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Dissected larvae were cultured in Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 μg/ml 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature and fixation was performed in PBS, 5% formaldehyde for 15 min. After a 2.2 n HCl denaturing treatment, larval tissue was neutralized with 100 mm borax for 5 min. Incorporation was monitored with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-BrdUrd (1:20; BD Biosciences) following the suppliers procedures. Larval brains were dissected free from the remainder of the tissue and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing 1.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for viewing on a Leica TCS SP2 laser-scanning microscope (Heidelberg, Germany) with ×10 or ×63 oil immersion lens. Larval brain areas were measured using LCS Simulator software (Leica Microsystems). Immunocytochemistry in Imaginal Wing Discs—Imaginal discs from third instar larvae were dissected in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. They were blocked in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h, incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C (dilution 1:50), washed four times in blocking buffer and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature in the dark (dilution 1:200). Finally, they were washed and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Primary antibodies used were: mouse anti-wingless (Hybridoma Center) and rabbit anti-caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology). Secondary antibodies were coupled to the fluorochromes Alexa Fluor 467 (Molecular Probes), fluorescein isothiocyanate, and Rhodamine Red X (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Preparations were imaged with a Leica TCS SP2 laser-scanning microscope (Heidelberg, Germany). A number of apoptotic cells were measured using analySIS FIVE software (Olympus Digital Imaging Solutions). Flow Cytometry—Larvae at the third instar stage were dissected in 1× PBS. Cell dissociation of wing discs and larval brains was done as described before (32Neufeld T.P. de la Cruz A.F. Johnston L.A. Edgar B.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1183-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). An average of 20 wing discs and 10 brains were dissociated. The cell suspension was analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACS Vantage SE and data were processed with BD FACS Diva and Cell Quest Pro software. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of data were performed with Prism 4.03 software (GraphPad Software). The one-way ANOVA test and the Bonferroni post-test were used to determine statistical significance of the results. d-TFB2M Is Essential during Drosophila Development—To characterize the functional role of d-TFB2M in Drosophila we adopted a strategy to induce gene silencing by RNAi in the whole animal. An interfering RNA containing IR that form double-stranded RNAs homologous to d-TFB2M (21Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pUAST vector and microinjected into Drosophila embryos. We recovered several transgenic lines, and two independent lines with the UAS-IRB2 construct (UAS-IRB2A and -B) were characterized in detail. RNAi-dependent knockdown was induced using the da-GAL4 strain as a driver, which expresses the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 under control of the daughterless enhancer. da-GAL4 expresses GAL4 throughout development and in most if not all tissues, and has been used extensively to overexpress constitutively transgenes containing UAS binding sites in Drosophila (33Zordan M.A. Cisotto P. Benna C. Agostino A. Rizzo G. Piccin A. Pegoraro M. Sandrelli F. Perini G. Tognon G. De Caro R. Peron S. Kronnie T.T. Megighian A. Reggiani C. Zeviani M. Costa R. Genetics. 2006; 172: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We found that widespread knockdown of d-TFB2M induces 100% lethality. Less than 3% of the larvae entered pupariation, and the remainder died during the third larval stage in both crosses da-GAL4/UAS-IRB2A and da-GAL4/UAS-IRB2B. Quantitative PCR (Fig. 1A) and immunoblot (Fig. 1B) analyses revealed severe reductions (60–80%) in d-TFB2M mRNA and protein. The level of expression of d-TFB1M was evaluated as a control. Interestingly, d-TFB1M expression is increased 1.5-fold at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting a retrograde compensatory response in nuclear gene expression. These data show that TFB2M is essential in D. melanogaster development, and that it cannot be compensated by TFB1M, even at moderately increased levels of the latter. d-TFB2M Silencing Produces Long-lived Larvae with a Severe Impairment in mtDNA Transcription—To evaluate further the phenotype produced by a reduction in the level of d-TFB2M, we characterized several morphological and molecular parameters in the knockdown larvae. In control lines (parental and yw), 100% of the larvae entered pupariation 6–9 days AEL. Interestingly the larval stage in both RNAiB2 lines was extended substantially, with most larvae living more than 30 days AEL (data not shown). The RNAiB2 larvae remained close to the food without entering the wandering stage, and never embarked upon pupariation. We confirmed that the larvae reached the third larval instar stage by detecting the presence of two specific morphological markers, mouth hooks and spiracles (data not shown). Interestingly, the duration of the first and second larval instar stages was not extended significantly as compared with those of control larvae, demonstrating a specific arrest at the third larval instar stage induced by d-TFB2M silencing. Finally, a significant reduction in the length and diameter of the RNAiB2 larvae was detected in both lines. Consequently, the total mass of the RNAiB2 larvae was about 50% lower than in the control larvae (Fig. 1, C and D). To confirm that silencing of d-TFB2M expression was maintained throughout larval development, we measured the abundance of d-TFB2M mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR in RNAiB2 larvae of different ages, and found that it remained below 25–30% of the level detected in control larvae (Fig. 2A). The induction of the expression of d-TFB1M was also maintained between 1.5- and 1.75-fold in larvae of different ages (Fig. 2A). We have shown previously that d-TFB2M regulates mtDNA copy number and transcription in Drosophila Schneider cells (21Matsushima Y. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26900-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To analyze if silencing d-TFB2M expression in the whole animal affected mtDNA transcription, we measured the steady-st"
https://openalex.org/W2035934643,"Transcriptional regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is critically dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). However, not only hypoxia, but selected growth factors can induce HIF-1. High levels of both VEGF and HIF-1 coexist in certain conditions, e.g. tumors. Nonetheless, the possibility that the stimulatory relationship between HIF-1 and VEGF may be bi-directional has not been addressed up to date. The present study in endothelial cells analyzed whether HIF-1 is regulated by a product of its own transcriptionally activated genes, namely, VEGF. As a main finding, VEGF-A165 induced the increase of HIF-1α mRNA and HIF-1α protein and nuclear translocation. Autologous endothelial cell VEGF mRNA and protein were also increased upon exposure to exogenous VEGF. The signaling implication of reactive oxygen species was examined by comparison with H2O2 and hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase and by the superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTMPyP, the Rac1-NAD(P)H oxidase complex inhibitor, apocynin, transfection of a dominant negative Rac1 mutant, and transfection of a p67phox antisense oligonucleotide. Superoxide anion, largely dependent on Rac1-NAD(P)H oxidase complex activity, was the critical signaling element. The transductional functionality of the pathway was confirmed by means of a reporter gene flanked by a transcription site-related VEGF sequence and by quantitative PCR. In summary, the present results reveal a previously undescribed action of VEGF on the expression of its own transcription factor, HIF-1, and on VEGF itself. This effect is principally mediated by superoxide anion, therefore identifying a new, potentially relevant role of reactive oxygen species in VEGF signaling.

Angiogenesis is a principal component of physiologic vascular remodeling. However, it is also a major mechanism in diseases as diverse as tumor neovascularization, proliferative retinopathies, or chronic ischemia.

In EC, VEGF-A165 binds to two main tyrosine kinase receptors, i.e. VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), activating a host of mechanisms, including proliferation, chemotaxis, and permeability and increasing the expression of numerous proteins (1Ferrara N. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar). In addition to its function as a mitogen, VEGF has EC protective properties which result in enhanced survival and resistance (2Zachary I. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gonzalez-Pacheco F.R. Deudero J.J. Castellanos M.C. Castilla M.A. Alvarez-Arroyo M.V. Yague S. Caramelo C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 291: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This VEGF-induced protection is effective against different noxious stimuli, including serum deprivation, oxidative challenge, calcineurin binding drugs, and cytoskeletal disruption (4Alvarez Arroyo M.V. Suzuki Y. Yague S. Lorz C. Jimenez S. Soto C. Barat A. Belda E. Gonzalez-Pacheco F.R. Deudero J.J. Castilla M.A. Egido J. Ortiz A. Caramelo C. Transplantation. 2002; 74: 1618-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Even though VEGF expression is regulated by a number of stimuli, hypoxia is the principal trigger to increase VEGF gene transcription. This increment is mainly mediated by a specialized transcription factor, HIF-1 (5Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed by two subunits (HIF-1α and HIF-1β) with apparent molecular masses of 120–130 and 91–94 kDa, respectively (6Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). The mRNA of both subunits is expressed constitutively, albeit in variable amounts. However, HIF-1α protein and HIF-1 activity are only detectable in cells exposed to hypoxia (7Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Recently, several growth factors and cytokines have also been reported to induce HIF-1α protein synthesis and HIF-1 activity in normoxia (8Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M.

The major signaling pathways identified as contributing to the HIF-1α induction by these growth factors include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (protein kinase B) and Ras/MAPK/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (MEK) (10Hellwig-Burgel T.

In these circumstances the transactivated HIF-1 leads to increased VEGF synthesis and/or protein stabilization, therefore amplifying the angiogenic signal. The limits and potential importance of this type of HIF-1 activation have not yet been accurately appraised. Among their numerous effects, ROS participate in activation pathways for redox-sensitive transcription factors mainly through protein tyrosine phosphorylation (17Monteiro H.P. Stern A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 18Sun Y. Oberley L.W. Free Radic. Biol.

Dial. Transplant. 2002; 17: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Among these activations, that of HIF-1 is singularly relevant. In addition, the interaction of certain growth factors with their tyrosine kinase receptors leads to ROS production. ROS act as ubiquitous intracellular messengers, e.g. (O2·¯), and H2O2 in mitogenic and cytoprotective responses (20Maulik N. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Mikkelsen R.B. Wardman P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5734-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 22Millar T.M. Phan V.

Physiol. 2007; 212: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In terms of mechanism, the main pathway of receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated ROS production involves the Rac1-NAD(P)H oxidase-like membrane complex (24Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J.

Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Taking into account the aforementioned role of Rac1-NAD(P)H oxidase complex as a main source of ROS in vascular tissue (30Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar) as well as the capability of VEGF for signaling through ROS and the described effect of ROS in HIF-1 activation, the hypothesis was raised that the products of HIF-1-activated genes, e.g. VEGF or erythropoietin, may act on the expression of HIF-1 itself. A series of experiments has been performed to examine this hypothesis and to clarify the signaling mechanisms involved. The potential importance of the pathway we examined herein can be traced to an ample setting of non-hypoxic inflammatory conditions and to neoplastic cells. Cell Culture—Bovine aorta EC were obtained, cultured up to confluence, and characterized as previously described (31Castilla M.A. Arroyo M.V. Aceituno E. Aragoncillo P. Gonzalez-Pacheco F.R. Texeiro E. Bragado R. Caramelo C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1132-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These cells, named simply as EC throughout the manuscript, were used between the second and fifth passages. Under these conditions, EC response has been tested by growth rate assays in the presence of recombinant human VEGF-A165 (henceforth designed as VEGF) (31Castilla M.A. Arroyo M.V. Aceituno E.

Castilla M.A. Gonzalez Pacheco F.R. Tan D. Riesco A. Casado S. Caramelo C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1998-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental Maneuvers—After 24 h of depletion in minimum essential medium/d-Val without calf serum, cells were incubated for different times with VEGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), darbepoetin α (AranespNR), a gift of Amgen SA (Barcelona, Spain), or erythropoietin α (EprexNR), a gift of Janssen-Cilag (Madrid, Spain). When indicated, EC were pretreated with specific drugs or their vehicles for 30 min. Drugs used were the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, apocynin (1 mm), the cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTMPyP (25 μm), the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (20 μm) (Calbiochem), the JNK inhibitor, dicumarol (20 μm), the p42/p44 MAPK inhibitor, PD98059 (100 μm), and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (400 nm) (Sigma-Aldrich). The nitric-oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NAME (400 nm, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to study NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) implication. Protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX, 10 μg/ml), CoCl2 was used as an hypoxic equivalent, and HX (2 mm)/XO were used as donors of (O2·¯) (Sigma-Aldrich). The efficacy of H2O2 exposure in this system has been previously checked by electrophoretic mobility shift assay of NFκB. Protein Extraction—After the different treatments, the EC were washed and scrapped in 1 ml of cold PBS. Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins for Western blots were extracted using the method described by Schreiber et al. (33Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) and quantified by Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent method (Pierce). Extraction buffers contained 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins (30 μg) were electrophoretically separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Trans-Blot Transfer Medium, Bio-Rad). Loading and transfers were verified by staining with Ponceau S Solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Blocked membranes were incubated with blocking buffer containing mouse mAb anti-HIF-1α (1:250, 4 °C, overnight, BD Transduction Laboratories) or mouse mAb anti-α-tubulin (1:2000, 4 °C, overnight, Sigma-Aldrich) then with blocking buffer containing goat mAb anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (1:6000, Bio-Rad) and revealed using the ECL system and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Quantifying of ECL images was done using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Plasmids and Transfections—For expression vectors a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (pcDNA3-Rac1N17) was transfected and overexpressed to inhibit superoxide production dependent from Rac1-NAD(P)H oxidase. This vector was kindly provided by Dr. Alberto Muñoz (Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas de Madrid). A pcDNA3-empty vector was used as the control. Antisense Oligonucleotide for p67phox—Antisense or sense oligonucleotides for the Rac1-NAD(P)H oxidase complex protein, p67phox (antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-CGGCCAGGGACATGGTCAGG-3′; sense oligonucleotide, 5′-CCTGACCATGTCCCTGGCCG-3′ (Metabion, Martinsried, Germany)) were added to primary bovine aorta EC at a 2 μm concentration and incubated for 72 h before treatment with 40 ng/ml VEGF for 6 h. Sense oligonucleotide was used as control. Detection of (O2·¯) Production by Dihydroethidium—After 24 h of serum deprivation, confluent EC cultured in poly-l-lysine-coated coverslides (BD Biosciences) were treated with 40 ng/ml VEGF or vehicle for 1 h and thereafter incubated with 10 mm dihydroethidium (Calbiochem). After that, EC were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed with Merckofix (Merck). To estimate the amount of (O2·¯) production, confluent EC with the same treatment as just described were incubated in the presence of the (O2·¯)-generating system, HX/XO. Fluorescence of the oxidized form of dihydroethidium, i.e. ethidium, was measured using an Infinite F200 fluorometry system (Tecan Ibérica, Barcelona, Spain). Images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Madrid, Spain). Quantifying of images was done using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Reporter Plasmids—The reporter construct VEGF-luc was kindly provided by Dr. Gregg Semenza (John Hopkins Hospital). This construct contains the human VEGF sequence from -2274 to 379 relative to the transcription initiation site (5Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar) ligated into the KpnI-MluI sites of pGL2-Basic (Promega Biotech Ibérica, Madrid, Spain), a firefly luciferase reporter vector. Cells were co-transfected with each reporter construct (VEGF-luc and pGL2-Basic) and the renilla luciferase vector pRL-CMV (Promega Biotech Ibérica) stimulated with or without VEGF (40 ng/ml) or XO (2.5 milliunits/ml) for 12 h and then treated with active lysis buffer according to the Dual-Luciferase assay. The results were expressed as relative luciferase activity. Transient Expression Assays—Transient expression of EC was carried out using CaCl2 method. Briefly, the EC were grown to near confluence (80–90%). The optimal transfection was achieved at a CaCl2 to DNA ratio of 6.5 mm to 10 μg/ml, respectively. For the reporter assays the DNA quantities were 0.1 and 10 μg/ml for pRL cytomegalovirus and VEGF-luc/pGL2-Basic, respectively. The CaCl2-DNA complex was performed in HBS buffer (21 mm HEPES, 0.14 m NaCl, 5.5 mm D(+) glucose, 50 mm KCl, 1.32 m Na2HPO4 at pH 7.1). The transfection mix remained during an additional time of 6 h; hence, cells were washed with PBS × 2, and growth medium was added until confluence (24–48 h). Cell stimulations were performed as described. To evaluate transfection efficiency, all assays were also transfected using pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences). Transfection efficiency was more than 50% in all cases. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was extracted using the Tripure Isolation Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted at 6, 12, and 24 h after treatments based on previous studies in our laboratory. One μg of total RNA from each sample was retrotranscripted to cDNA (Improm-II reverse transcriptase; Promega). 1–3 μl of cDNA samples were used as the template for amplification reactions carried out with the LC Fast Start DNA master SYBR Green I kit (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplifications were carried out in a Light Cycler System (Roche Diagnostics), and data were analyzed with LightCycler software 3 Version 3.5.28 (Idaho Technology Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). For analysis purposes, the amplicon for each of the analyzed genes was cloned, and known amounts of the cloned product were used to generate a standard curve. The number of copies of the gene of interest in each sample was extrapolated from the corresponding standard curve by the indicated software. For each sample, duplicate determinations were made, and the gene copy number was normalized by the amount of β-actin. The primer pairs used in this study are reported elsewhere (35Naranjo-Suarez S. Castellanos M.C. Alvarez-Tejado M. Vara A. Landazuri M.O. del Peso L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31895-31901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Assay—EC were grown and treated on Falcon Culture Slides (BD Biosciences) and were washed ×5 with PBS and fixed with Merckofix (Merck). Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (15 min), washed, and incubated in blocking buffer for 1 h (PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin). Slides were incubated overnight with mouse mAb anti-VEGF primary antibody (1:500). Slides were then washed and incubated with goat mAb anti-mouse coupled to FITC (1:2000) for 2 h (both, Sigma-Aldrich). Propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) was added (45 min, 50 ng/ml) for visualization of the cell nucleus. Images were obtained using a Confocal System TCS SP20 (Leica, Madrid, Spain). Quantifying of images was done using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Statistics—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Unless stated otherwise, values correspond to a minimum of five experiments done by triplicate. When applicable, Student's t test or analysis of variance were used to compare variables. Fisher and Scheffe tests for multiple comparisons were used to determine the p value, which was considered significant at < 0.05. The statistic analyses were performed with the Windows SPSS 10.0 package (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL). VEGF Increases Nuclear HIF-1α Protein in a Time- and Concentration-dependent Manner—EC were incubated under different experimental conditions, and cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were loaded according to protein quantization. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, only trace levels of HIF-1α could be detected in the nuclear extract of untreated EC. VEGF (40 ng/ml) treatment increased nuclear HIF-1α protein in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), reaching the maximum level after 6 h. At all the time points assessed, HIF-1α protein was undetectable in the cytoplasmic extract. Nuclear HIF-1α increased in the presence of VEGF in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). An additional experiment was performed to ascertain whether a selective ligand of VEGFR1, i.e. placental growth factor (PlGF), was able of inducing an increase of HIF-1α. As can be observed in Fig. 1C, PlGF increased nuclear HIF-1α protein. Of importance, the concentration-response curve of PlGF was rightward shifted with respect to that of VEGF (p < 0.01). Because VEGF binds to both types of receptors, whereas PlGF binds only to VEGFR1, the difference between the concentration-response curves of both agents suggests that the two types of VEGF receptor are involved in the response. To test whether the effects observed with VEGF were shared by the product of another HIF-1 transcriptionally activated gene, similar experiments were performed using erythropoietic-stimulating agents (ESAs), namely, darbepoetin and erythropoietin (both at final concentrations equivalent to 50, 100, and 200 units/ml of erythropoietin). These experiments revealed no effects of the ESAs on HIF-1α protein levels (Fig. 1D). Superoxide and Rac1 Are Necessary for VEGF-induced HIF-1α Protein Increase—At a first glance and based on the known regulation of HIF-1α protein, none of the more common VEGF-induced signaling pathways appeared as a probable regulator of HIF-1α increase. However, two facts were already known. First, according to the literature (36Ushio-Fukai M. Tang Y. Fukai T. Dikalov S.I. Ma Y. Fujimoto M. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Johnson C. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and our own data, 3J. J. P. Deudero, C. Caramelo, M. C. Castellanos, F. Neria, R. Fernández-Sánchez, O. Calabia, S. Peñate, and F. R. González-Pacheco, unpublished observations. VEGF is capable of inducing ROS production and ROS-dependent NFκB activation; second, HIF-1α synthesis can putatively augment by using a ROS-related signaling pathway (12Gorlach A. Diebold I. Schini-Kerth V.B. Berchner-Pfannschmidt U. Roth U. Brandes R.P. Kietzmann T. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 37Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J.

Accordingly, our analysis was focused on the investigation of whether ROS were involved in the increased VEGF-induced HIF-1α expression. With this purpose we first examined the effect of both exogenously added H2O2 and (O2·¯) for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, no effect on HIF-1α protein level was observed within the range of 2–250 μm H2O2. On the contrary, a clear-cut effect of (O2·¯) was found with the HX/XO system. In these conditions, HIF-1α protein levels were directly proportional to (O2·¯) production. Of note, because a saturating HX concentration (2 mm) was used, (O2·¯) generation by the HX/XO system was dependent on XO concentration. Based on this background, we further investigated the participation of (O2·¯) in VEGF-induced HIF-1α increase. The main source of (O2·¯) in EC in conditions of normal aerobic metabolism are the oxidases of the Rac1-NAD(P)H complex (36Ushio-Fukai M. Tang Y. Fukai T. Dikalov S.I. Ma Y. Fujimoto M. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Johnson C. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Therefore, EC were incubated with VEGF or HX/XO in the presence or in the absence of the non-scavenging, specific Rac1-NAD(P)H oxidase complex inhibitor, apocynin (1 mm), and the cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTMPyP (25 μm). As shown in Fig. 2B, apocynin completely blocked VEGF- but not HX/XO-induced HIF-1α increase, whereas MnTMPyP completely blocked both stimuli. Additionally, we determined whether NO or ONOO- formed from NO + (O2·¯) were implicated in the VEGF- and HX/XO-induced HIF-1α protein increase. With this purpose, EC were also incubated with the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (400 nm). No effect of L-NAME was detected in VEGF-treated EC, but a small one could be observed when treated with HX/XO (Fig. 2B). The effects of apocynin gave us an important clue about the participation of Rac1-NAD(P)H. Therefore, to provide a specific confirmation of its role in VEGF-increased HIF-1α protein level, EC were transfected with a dominant negative mutant of Rac1. As shown in Fig. 2C, expression of a negative form of Rac1 is enough to abolish the VEGF effect on HIF-1α increase. With the purpose of ruling out the remote, albeit real, possibility that the effect of Rac1 inhibition might have been independent of NAD(P)H, EC were transfected with a p67phox antisense oligonucleotide. This antisense oligonucleotide also blocked the VEGF effect (Fig. 2, D and E). Collectively, this set of results supports that the Rac1-NAD(P)H oxidase complex is involved and necessary in VEGF signaling on HIF-1α and that (O2·¯) acts as a second messenger of VEGF in the induction of HIF-1α protein increase. This effect appears to be more probably related to a direct action of (O2·¯) itself rather than by means of ONOO– formation. VEGFs Increase (O2·¯) Production in EC—To confirm (O2·¯) production by VEGF, we labeled EC with the cell-permeable molecule, dihydroethidium. Two different experiments were carried out with this method, both based on the capability of dihydroethidium to react specifically with (O2·¯), producing ethidium, which has different fluorescent properties than dihydroethidium. Therefore, ethidium formation depends of (O2·¯) levels. On the first experiment, we detected ethidium formation, i.e. (O2·¯) production, by means of fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 3, A and B). On the second experiment, we analyzed ethidium/ (O2·¯) production by using a fluorescence detector (Fig. 3C). On the first experiment, cells were fixed after VEGF exposure; on the second experiment, fluorescent detection was carried out in real time, whereas EC were stimulated alive on culture wells. In both cases, VEGF exposure (40 ng/ml) increased ethidium fluorescence, and the cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTMPyP (25 μm) abolished this effect. In setting-up studies, we ruled out the existence of a fluorescence quenching by MnTMPyP. VEGF and ROS-induced HIF-1α Protein Increase Requires JNK, p38, and Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt Activity—A number of proteins could be theoretically involved in VEGF signaling on HIF-1α. To test the participation of the main pathways possibly implicated in the process, we tested the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, JNK, and MAPKs. For this purpose, EC were pretreated with specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (wortmannin), JNK (dicumarol), and MAPKs, namely, p38 (SB203580) and p42/44 (PD98059), and then stimulated with VEGF or HX/XO. As shown in Fig. 4A, blockade of all the kinases, except p42/p44, markedly inhibited the effects of both VEGF and HX/XO signaling on HIF-1α increase. Based on these screening findings, we analyzed VEGF capability to activate JNK, p38, and Akt by assessing the status of their phosphorylated forms after VEGF exposure. As shown in Fig. 4B, VEGF increased JNK and p38 phosphorylation after 30 min of stimulation, with an apparent peak at about 60 min. Akt phosphorylation was already detected in the earliest sample (1 min), but no increase was evident under the effect of VEGF (Fig. 4B). VEGF Does Not Affect HIF-1α Protein Degradation but Increases HIF-1α mRNA Levels Using (O2·¯) as an Intracellular Mediator—The findings mentioned above prompted us to study the mechanism of VEGF-related HIF-1α protein increase. HIF-1α half-life was assessed by comparing HIF-1α signal as induced by either CoCl2 or VEGF in the presence of the protein s"

The essential function of Met30 is the inactivation of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> transcription factor Met4, because fully activated Met4 induces a cell cycle arrest. Met4 regulates expression of genes involved in the sulfur assimilation pathway and coordinates the transcriptional program and cell cycle progression in response to cadmium and arsenic stress. Met4 lacks DNA binding activity and requires either Cbf1 or one of the two homologous proteins Met31 and Met32 for promoter association. Accordingly, <i>met4</i> mutants, <i>cbf1</i> mutants, and <i>met31 met32</i> double mutants are methionine auxotroph. We isolated a truncated version of Met32 (Met32<sup>Δ145-192</sup>) as a dominant suppressor of the cell cycle defect of <i>met30</i> mutants. Expression of Met32<sup>Δ145-192</sup> significantly reduced induction of Met4-regulated genes. Interestingly, both Cbf1- and Met31/32-dependent genes were affected by Met32<sup>Δ145-192</sup>. Mechanistically, Met32<sup>Δ145-192</sup> prevented recruitment of Met4 to both Cbf1 and Met31/32-dependent promoters. We further demonstrated that Met32 is part of the Cbf1-Met4 complex bound to Cbf1-recruiting promoter elements and that Met31/32 are required for formation of a stable Met4-Cbf1 transcription complex. These results suggest a regulatory role of Met32 as part of the Cbf1-Met4 complex and provide molecular insight into coordination of cell cycle response and modulation of gene expression programs."

https://openalex.org/W4251218628,The observation of nonclassical rotational inertia (NCRI) by the torsional oscillator in 2004 gave rise to a renaissance in the study of solid helium-4. Recent theoretical and experimental studies found evidence that disorder in the solid plays a key role in enabling superfluidity. A recent experiment found a marked increase in the shear modulus that shares the same temperature and helium-3 impurity concentration dependence as that of NCRI. This correlation indicates that the onset of superfluidity requires the pinning and stiffening of the dislocation network by helium-3.

Hence it protects p53 from degradation through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In some conditions, sequestering MDM2 in the nucleolus by ARF may also contribute to stabilization and activation of p53 (5Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), but it has been demonstrated not to be essential for the inhibitory effect of ARF on MDM2 (6Llanos S. Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Apart from its major function in activating the p53 pathway, ARF does regulate other cellular activities such as ribosomal RNA processing and gene expression (7Sherr C.J. Bertwistle D.

ARF colocalizes with COMMD1 in the nucleoplasm and promotes Lys63-mediated, proteasome-independent polyubiquitination of COMMD1. Reagents and Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal Ab (Sigma), rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal Ab (Sigma), rabbit anti-HA polyclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-Myc monoclonal Ab (Cell Signaling Technology), goat anti-actin polyclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-ARF polyclonal Ab (Neomarkers), mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal Ab (Molecular Probes), rabbit anti-GCN5 Ab (Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse anti-COMMD1 Ab (Abnova). Rhodamine- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein G was purchased from Bio-Rad. MG132 and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A Gal4-based system (Matchmaker, Clontech) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Full-length human p14ARF was cloned into pGBKT7, which carries a DNA-binding domain, to create a bait protein. This plasmid was transformed into yeast strain AH109, and no spontaneous transactivation was detected. The transformed AH109 cells were then mated with yeast strain Y187 cells pretransformed with a Clontech Matchmaker human skeletal muscle cDNA library fused with a DNA activation domain in the pACT2 plasmid. After screening, plasmids were extracted from positive colonies, propagated in Escherichia coli, and analyzed by automated sequencing. Plasmid Construction—To create the mammalian expression plasmids, full-length ARF was amplified using pGBKT7-ARF as the template and subcloned into the pcMV5-HA vector. COMMD1 cDNA was amplified using reverse transcription-PCR from HeLa total RNA extracts and subcloned into the pcDNA3-FLAG vector. pCMV5-Myc-ub and pCMV5-Myc-ubK48R were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Cheung. The K63R mutant of ubiquitin was generated by introducing the mutation site into the reverse primer and then subcloning it into the pCMV5 backbone. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human NCI-H1299 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mm l-glutamine, 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfection of cells with mammalian expression constructs by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was according to the methods recommended by the manufacturer. Protein Stability Assay—H1299 cells grown on 6-well plates were transfected with the plasmid as indicated. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide or 2 μm MG132 for the indicated period of time. Protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in Pierce M-PER lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The protein samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, membranes were incubated with antibodies as indicated for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein G (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody detections were performed with a Pierce ECL detection kit or Amersham Biosciences ECL advanced Western blotting system according to the manufacturer's instructions. For FLAG-tagged protein immunoprecipitation, FLAG M2 affinity gels were added to the cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. For HA-tagged ARF or endogenous COMMD1, cell lysates were first incubated with anti-HA or anti-COMMD1 polyclonal antibody for 6 h, followed by protein G-Sepharose bead incubation for another 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 500 mm NaCl), boiled in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis. Indirect Immunofluorescence Staining and Microscopy—H1299 cells grown on a glass coverslip were transfected with plasmids as indicated. 1 day after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Fixed cells were first incubated with anti-HA antibody for 2 h, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for another 1 h, incubation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 2 h, and incubation with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody for another 1 h. To detect localization of endogenous proteins, H1299 cells were treated with specific drugs or left untreated for the indicated period of time. After stimulation, cells were fixed and stained first with anti-ARF Ab for detection of ARF and then with anti-COMMD1 Ab for detection of COMMD1. Fluorescence signals were visualized using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. ARF Interacts with COMMD1 in Vivo—We performed a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify novel ARF-interacting proteins. Full-length p14ARF fused with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was used to screen a human skeletal muscle library fused with the DNA activation domain. This screen led to identification of a protein named COMMD1 as an ARF-binding partner candidate. The interaction between ARF and COMMD1 in the mammalian cells was verified by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay. As shown in Fig. 1A (panel a), HA-ARF could be detected in the FLAG-COMMD1 immunoprecipitate but not in FLAG mock. In a reciprocal co-IP experiment when HA-ARF was precipitated from cell lysates (Fig. 1A, panel b), FLAG-COMMD1 could be pulled down together only with HA-ARF but not with HA, demonstrating that ARF interacts with COMMD1 specifically in mammalian cells. To delineate the region of ARF involved in the interaction with COMMD1, full-length ARF and various deletion mutants were constructed (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-64) of ARF encoded by exon 1β was found to be sufficient for the interaction with COMMD1 (Fig. 1C, lane 3), whereas the exon 2-encoded C-terminal domain (amino acids 65-132) did not show any binding to COMMD1 (lane 4). To better define the interacting domain, ARF mutants with more discrete deletions in the N terminus were generated. Deletion of the first 14 residues of ARF (ARFΔN14) had no discernible effect on the interaction with COMMD1, whereas deletion of residues 1-29 (ARFΔN29) still resulted in binding to COMMD1. Deletion of residues 1-45 of ARF (ARFΔ45) totally abolished the interaction with COMMD1, suggesting that the binding site may lie between amino acids 30 and 45. However, the ARFΔN30-45 mutant still retained some capacity to bind COMMD1, whereas deletion of residues 15-45 completely abrogated the association. These results suggest that amino acids 15-45 contribute to the interaction of ARF with COMMD1 (Fig. 1C). COMMD1 Colocalizes with ARF in the Nucleoplasm—ARF normally localizes in the nucleolus in cancer cell lines and colocalizes with its associated proteins such as MDM2, E2F1, and HIF-1α in the nucleolus (5Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 13Datta A. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28421-28429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the localization of COMMD1 upon simultaneous expression with ARF. pCMV5-HA-ARF and pcDNA3-FLAG-COMMD1 or the corresponding empty vector were transfected into H1299 cells, followed by immunostaining using anti-FLAG antibody for FLAG-COMMD1 and anti-HA antibody for HA-ARF. As shown in Fig. 2A, HA-ARF localized in the nucleolus when it was coexpressed together with the empty vector. In contrast, FLAG-COMMD1 exhibited a mainly cytoplasmic localization pattern with accumulation of the protein in some discrete perinuclear regions. FLAG-COMMD1 could also be detected in the nucleus, but it was excluded from the nucleolus. However, when FLAG-COMMD1 was coexpressed along with HA-ARF, FLAG-COMMD1 was found in the nucleus and colocalized with HA-ARF in the nucleoplasm. Previous studies have shown that although ARF is capable of sequestering its binding partners into the nucleolus, the nucleolar localization signal of the binding partners may also be required for the nucleolus colocalization (23Fatyol K. Szalay A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28421-28429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We found that FLAG-COMMD1 did not localize to the nucleolus when it was coexpressed with HA-ARF; instead, they both localized in the nucleoplasm. It could be due to the lack of the nucleolar localization signal in COMMD1. Nevertheless, this result indicates that formation of the ARF-COMMD1 complex alone is not sufficient for ARF to sequester protein to the nucleolus. Previously it was reported that the DNA damage reagent actinomycin D can induce nucleolus disruption and rapid redistribution of endogenous ARF into the nucleoplasm (25Lindstrom M.S. Klangby U. Inoue R. Pisa P. Wiman K.G. Asker C.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is possible that ARF would colocalize and interact with COMMD1 in the nucleoplasm after DNA damage stimulation. To test this idea, immunostaining and co-IP assay were performed after treatment of H1299 cells with actinomycin D for 8 h. As shown in Fig. 2B (lower panelS), actinomycin D induced a complete redistribution of ARF in the nucleus and subsequently led to more ARF colocalizing with COMMD1 in the nucleoplasm. H1299 cells are deficient of p53, so the redistribution of ARF in response to actinomycin D treatment is independent of p53. Consistent with this observation, the complex of endogenous ARF-COMMD1 could be detected only in H1299 cells with actinomycin D stimulation but not in untreated cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, the interaction of ARF and COMMD1 under physiological conditions appears to be dependent, at least partially, on their colocalization in the nucleoplasm. ARF Stabilizes COMMD1 by Regulating Its Turnover—We noticed that the level of FLAG-COMMD1 appeared to be higher in cells transfected with HA-ARF than in cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 3A). The accumulation of FLAG-COMMD1 was observed in both A549 (p53+/+) and H1299 (p53-/-) cells, indicating that it is p53- and MDM2-independent. Conversely, in Fig. 3B, knockdown of endogenous ARF by RNAi led to a decrease in COMMD1 protein levels. We next examined whether elevation of FLAG-COMMD1 by ARF occurs at the transcriptional or post-translational level. Cycloheximide was used to block protein synthesis in cells. H1299 cells transfected with HA-ARF or the empty vector were incubated with cycloheximide and harvested at the time indicated (Fig. 3C). The cells were lysed, and the cells lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3B, in the presence of cycloheximide, FLAG-COMMD1 appeared to be quite unstable, with a half-life of ∼1 h as described previously (19Burstein E. Ganesh L. Dick R.D. van de Sluis B. Wilkinson J.C. Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. Brewer G.J. Nabel G.J. Duckett C.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, in cells ectopically expressing HA-ARF, FLAG-COMMD1 decayed at much slower rate, with a half-life of 4 h. This result suggests that COMMD1 is stabilized in the presence of ARF, which occurs at the post-translational state. COMMD1 is a proteasome substrate, and ubiquitination is essential for its specific degradation (19Burstein E. Ganesh L. Dick R.D. van de Sluis B. Wilkinson J.C. Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. Brewer G.J. Nabel G.J. Duckett C.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that ARF might affect COMMD1 expression by regulating the ubiquitination process. We tested whether up-regulation of COMMD1 by ARF is sensitive to the treatment with MG132, a potent proteasome inhibitor. FLAG-COMMD1 levels increased dramatically after a 2-h proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3D, second lane), indicating that degradation of COMMD1 is mediated by the 26 S proteasome complex. However, no obvious accumulation of FLAG-COMMD1 was detected after MG132 treatment in the presence of ectopically expressed HA-ARF, suggesting that ARF may stabilize COMMD1 by either down-regulating the level of polyubiquitinated COMMD1 that is targeted for proteasomal degradation or acting similarly as a proteasome inhibitor to enhance and sustain COMMD1. ARF Promotes Proteasome-independent Polyubiquitination of COMMD1—Next we examined the effect of ARF expression on the level of ubiquitinated COMMD1 by performing in vivo ubiquitination assay. H1299 cells were transfected with Myc-ub along with FLAG-COMMD1 and HA-ARF or the corresponding empty vector. Transfected cells were treated with 2 μm MG132 or buffer as a control for another 8 h. FLAG-COMMD1 was then immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, followed by Western blot analysis. Consistent with previous findings (19Burstein E. Ganesh L. Dick R.D. van de Sluis B. Wilkinson J.C. Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. Brewer G.J. Nabel G.J. Duckett C.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), COMMD1 was ubiquitinated in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 4A, upper right panel). Surprisingly, we found that in the sample coexpressing FLAG-COMMD1, Myc-ub, and HA-ARF (Fig. 4A, upper left panel) without MG132 treatment, the level of ub-conjugated COMMD1 was increased significantly, demonstrating that ARF promotes polyubiquitination of COMMD1. When MG132 was added to allow accumulation of polyubiquitinated COMMD1 that ultimately was degraded by the proteasome, a high molecular mass smear that is characteristic of polyubiquitination was detected in cells transfected with both the HA vector and HA-ARF, but transfection with HA-ARF led to greater recovery of ubiquitinated COMMD1 (Fig. 4A, upper right panel). The ubiquitination of COMMD1 in the absence or presence of MG132 was also confirmed using anti-Myc antibody to probe the precipitated COMMD1-ub conjugates (Fig. 4A, middle panels). We noted that the amount of COMMD1-ub conjugates induced by ARF was not elevated after proteasome blockade. In many cases, the ubiquitinated form of proteasome substrate can be detected only in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Therefore, the possible explanation for this result is that ARF-facilitated ubiquitination of COMMD1 is proteasome-independent, and it does not target the protein for degradation. To further confirm that ARF-induced COMMD1 ubiquitination is proteasome-independent, the K48R point mutant of ubiquitin, which cannot form Lys48-conjugated polyubiquitin chains, was used for the in vivo ubiquitination assay. As shown in Fig. 4B (left panels), the ubK48R mutant did not inhibit ARF-induced COMMD1 ubiquitination. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of HA-ARF still enhanced the ubiquitination of COMMD1 in the presence of the Myc-ubK48R mutant, demonstrating that ARF induces proteasome-independent non-Lys48 ubiquitin chain conjugation to COMMD1. In addition to Lys48-mediated ubiquitination, ubiquitination could also occur at Lys63 of ubiquitin. It has been reported that Lys63-linked polyubiquitination does not involve proteolysis. Therefore we sought to investigate whether the apparent stability of ubiquitinated COMMD1 induced by ARF is due to the assembly of the polyubiquitin chain involving Lys63 but not Lys48 of ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 4B (right panels), overexpression of HA-ARF did not enhance polyubiquitination of FLAG-COMMD1 as compared with control transfection in the presence of Myc-ubK63R. This result suggests that Lys63 of ubiquitin is important for ARF-induced COMMD1 polyubiquitination. We found that ARF promotes non-Lys48 ubiquitination of COMMD1, which is mediated through the Lys63-Gly76 linkage. Previously it was reported that the RNAi of XIAP, an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates and degrades COMMD1 through Lys48 linkage, could enhance non-Lys48 ubiquitination of COMMD1 (19Burstein E. Ganesh L. Dick R.D. van de Sluis B. Wilkinson J.C. Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. Brewer G.J. Nabel G.J. Duckett C.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This result suggests that XIAP-mediated Lys48 ubiquitin chains may be assembled at the same lysine residues as those when ubiquitination occurs via non-Lys48 linkage. Hence, reduction in Lys48 ubiquitination could result in greater ubiquitination through non-Lys48 linkage. In our study, we have shown that ARF-facilitated Lys63 ubiquitination stabilizes COMMD1; COMMD1 is destabilized in cells deficient in ARF. It is possible that the Lys63 ubiquitination induced by ARF may compete with Lys48 ubiquitination and thus protect COMMD1 from proteasomal degradation. Therefore, we sought to determine COMMD1 ubiquitination pattern in cells depleted of ARF. As shown in Fig. 4C (left panels), knockdown of endogenous ARF by RNAi led to an obvious reduction in the total amount of COMMD1 ubiquitination, demonstrating that ARF-mediated ubiquitination constitutes a large part of COMMD1 ubiquitination. A decrease of ubiquitinated COMMD1 was also observed in cells cotransfected with ubK48R but not in cells cotransfected with the K63R mutant (Fig. 4C, right panels), indicating that Lys63-linked ubiquitination is mediated at least partially by endogenous ARF. We noticed that in contrast to the effect of XIAP RNAi, knockdown of ARF did not result in greater Lys48 ubiquitination of COMMD1. Consistent with this, the destabilization of COMMD1 caused by ARF RNAi was also not sensitive to the proteasome blockade (Fig. 4D). Together, these results suggest that ARF-induced Lys63 ubiquitin chains are assembled at some specific lysine residues that are not responsible for Lys48 ubiquitination; hence, a decrease in Lys63 ubiquitination would not enhance Lys48-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. The possible explanation for the destabilization of COMMD1 in ARF-deficient cells is that ARF-induced Lys63 ubiquitination could protect COMMD1 from degradation in some proteasome-independent manners; thus, COMMD1 would be degraded as a result of the loss of protection from Lys63 ubiquitin chains. Meanwhile, the above data also imply that the interaction of ARF and COMMD1 may already exist in the normal state, and thus, endogenous ARF could induce polyubiquitination of COMMD1 without any stimulation. Recently, it was found that the non-nucleolar form of the ARF mutant is inherently unstable compared with nucleolar ARF (26Rodway H. Llanos S. Rowe J. Peters G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6186-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Like other proteins, ARF also undergoes proteasomal proteolysis (9Kuo M.L. den Besten W. Bertwistle D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1862-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We reasoned that proteasome inhibition would result in recovery of the ARF-COMMD1 complex in the nucleoplasm in the normal state. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1A, treatment with MG132 led to great recovery of ARF in the nucleoplasm, which was not observed in non-stimulated cells. This indicates that nucleoplasmic ARF is less stable than nucleolar ARF. Similarly, in the co-IP experiment (supplemental Fig. 1B), no endogenous ARF could be coprecipitated with FLAG-COMMD1 in the absence of proteasome inhibition. However, after MG132 treatment, ARF could be readily detected in the FLAG-COMMD1 precipitates. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ARF specifically interacts with COMMD1 in vivo but is subjected to rapid degradation; endogenous ARF could induce Lys63 polyubiquitination of COMMD1 in the normal state. Finally, as ARF associates with COMMD1 in the nucleus, we determined whether ARF specifically induces ubiquitination of COMMD1 in the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 4E, compared with the cytoplasmic fraction, the nuclear COMMD1 protein level was dramatically down-regulated in ARF-depleted cells. Consistent with this, the decreased COMMD1 polyubiquitination in the nuclear fraction was also observed in cells depleted of ARF. Hence, these results suggest that ARF specifically induces COMMD1 polyubiquitination in the nucleus. ARF Mutants Are Defective in Promoting COMMD1 Polyubiquitination—To determine whether the physical interaction of ARF with COMMD1 is a prerequisite condition for COMMD1 ubiquitination, we tested the effect of two ARF deletion mutants: ARFΔN15-45, which is defective in binding COMMD1, and ARF-(1-64), which binds to COMMD1 efficiently but lacks the C-terminal domain encoded by exon 2. As shown in Fig. 5, full-length ARF promoted COMMD1 ubiquitination as observed previously, whereas expression of ARFΔN15-45 did not result in any ubiquitination of COMMD1, indicating that ARF-facilitated ubiquitin conjugation of COMMD1 depends on their physical association. Previous study has established that the functional domain of ARF is encoded by exon 1β (amino acids 1-64), and ARF interacts with most of its binding partners through the N-terminal region (6Llanos S. Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 27Quelle D.E. Zindy F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 993-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 28Rizos H. Darmanian A.P. Mann G.J. Kefford R.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2978-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C terminus contributes little to the function of ARF except nucleolus localization (24Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, our observation showed that although the ARF-(1-64) mutant strongly associated with COMMD1, it could not promote ubiquitination of COMMD1. We believe that deletion of the C terminus impairs the association of ARF with some other unknown factor that also participates in the ubiquitination process. It was reported that overexpression of ARF arrests proliferation of p53-null or p53/Mdm2-null cells (29Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in Arf, p53, and Mdm2 develop tumors at a greater frequency compared with mice lacking both p53 and Mdm2 or p53 alone (8Weber J.D. Jeffers J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ARF also possesses tumor suppressor functions that are independent of p53. In this study, we have characterized a novel p53-independent interaction between the tumor suppressor ARF and COMMD1. The physical association of the two proteins has been confirmed by co-IP assay and found to depend on their colocalization in the nucleoplasm. ARF normally localizes in the nucleolus, and it was proposed that physical sequestration of MDM2 by ARF can stabilize p53 by separating it from MDM2-mediated degradation (5Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). However, recent data demonstrated that nucleolar relocalization of MDM2 is not required for p53 activation and that redistribution of ARF into the nucleoplasm induced by DNA damage enhances its association with MDM2- and p53-dependent growth-suppressive activity (5Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 6Llanos S. Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Here, our results showed that ectopically expressed ARF relocalizes COMMD1 into the nucleoplasm without nucleolar sequestration. In nonstressed cells, endogenous ARF and COMMD1 have differential subcellular localization. However, the association of these two proteins could be observed when ARF was redistributed into the nucleoplasm in response to actinomycin D treatment. These observations suggest that under certain circumstances such as DNA damage stimulation, ARF would be released from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm, and therefore, it can perform its function by interacting with its binding partners such as MDM2 and COMMD1. Overexpression of ARF was reported to induce degradation of certain E2F family members through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. It was suggested that ARF may act conversely to trim down the level of E2F and thus protect cells from tumorigenesis upon oncogene activation (13Datta A. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8398-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that ARF promotes proteasomal degradation of nucleolar protein B23 and therefore inhibits B23-mediated ribosome biogenesis (10Itahana K. Bhat K.P. Jin A. Itahana Y. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1151-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, our results showed that instead of facilitating ubiquitination, which leads to degradation of its binding partners, ARF promotes Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of COMMD1. Lys63 ubiquitination is known as non-classic ubiquitination, as it does not target proteins for degradation. Instead, it has distinct roles in regulating cellular functions such as protein kinase activation, DNA repair, and vesicle trafficking (17Gill G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 30Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 31Sun L. Chen Z.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We found that ARF stabilizes COMMD1 through its ability to promote Lys63-mediated ubiquitination of COMMD1. Because non-proteasomal proteolysis is also utilized for COMMD1 degradation, it is possible that Lys63 ubiquitin chains may be capable of regulating and stabilizing the structure of the protein or protecting it from being recognized by some unknown protease. Lys63-linked ubiquitination could also regulate protein-protein interactions (31Sun L. Chen Z.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 32Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar), which may have additional functions, such as affecting the binding affinity of COMMD1 for other factors. COMMD1 has been demonstrated as a ubiquitously expressed inhibitor for NF-κB (20Ganesh L. Burstein E. Guha-Niyogi A. Louder M.K. Mascola J.R. Klomp L.W. Wijmenga C. Duckett C.S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 33Maine G.N. Mao X. Komarck C.M. Burstein E. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It was reported that COMMD1 interacts with and accelerates degradation of RelA in the nucleus, which terminates the association of RelA with chromatins (33Maine G.N. Mao X. Komarck C.M. Burstein E. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We found that ARF specifically promotes nuclear COMMD1 ubiquitination through Lys63 linkage. Therefore, it is possible that ARF-induced Lys63 polyubiquitination may regulate the inhibitory effect of COMMD1 on NF-κB-mediated transcription in the nucleus. Does ARF act as an E3 ligase for the ubiquitination process? Previous studies demonstrated that overexpression of ARF induces sumoylation of its binding partners such as MDM2, E2F1, B23, and Werner helicase (11Woods Y.L. Xirodimas D.P. Prescott A.R. Sparks A.

ARF also binds to UBC9, the only E2 found to be responsible for sumoylation (16Rizos H. Woodruff S. Kefford R.F. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which suggests that ARF may serve as an E3 ligase to bridge the E2 complex to its binding partners. In addition, overexpression of ARF promotes ubiquitination of its binding partners such as E2F and B23. Although ARF does not possess the typical E3 ligase structural feature or known catalytic activity for ubiquitination, it is possible that ARF mediates ubiquitination of these proteins indirectly by bringing different proteins such as E3 ligase together. We found that physical association of ARF and COMMD1 is necessary for the ubiquitination; therefore, we do not exclude the possibilities that the C terminus of ARF interacts with other factors, such as E3 ligase for COMMD1 ubiquitination, or that ARF itself serves as an E3 ligase for COMMD1 ubiquitination.

https://openalex.org/W2077940987,"The Glut4 glucose transporter undergoes complex insulin-regulated subcellular trafficking in adipocytes. Much effort has been expended in an attempt to identify targeting motifs within Glut4 that direct its subcellular trafficking, but an amino acid motif responsible for the targeting of the transporter to insulin-responsive intracellular compartments in the basal state or that is directly responsible for its insulin-stimulated redistribution to the plasma membrane has not yet been delineated. In this study we define amino acid residues within the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Glut4 that are essential for its insulin-stimulated translocation to the plasma membrane. The residues were identified based on sequence similarity (LXXLXPDEXD) between cytoplasmic domains of Glut4 and the insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP). Alteration of this putative targeting motif (IRM, insulin-responsive motif) resulted in the targeting of the bulk of the mutant Glut4 molecules to dispersed membrane vesicles that lacked detectable levels of wild-type Glut4 in either the basal or insulin-stimulated states and completely abolished the insulin-stimulated translocation of the mutant Glut4 to the plasma membrane in 3T3L1 adipocytes. The bulk of the dispersed membrane vesicles containing the IRM mutant did not contain detectable levels of any subcellular marker tested. A fraction of the total IRM mutant was also detected in a wild-type Glut4/Syntaxin 6-containing perinuclear compartment. Interestingly, mutation of the IRM sequence did not appreciably alter the subcellular trafficking of IRAP. We conclude that residues within the IRM are critical for the targeting of Glut4, but not of IRAP, to insulin-responsive intracellular membrane compartments in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

The transport step is rate limiting for glucose metabolism in these cell types, and therefore the appropriate regulation of Glut4 is critical to the maintenance of normal whole body glucose homeostasis (5Mueckler M. News Physiol. Sci. 1995; 10: 22-29Google Scholar). Dys-regulation of insulin-stimulated Glut4 activity appears to be the proximal cause of insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes (6Cline G.W. Petersen K.F. Krssak M. Shen J. Hundal R.S.

Morphologically, these compartments appear as tubular-vesicular elements clustered in the perinuclear region of the cell and as small spherical vesicles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (10Slot J.W.

The precise itinerary of Glut4 trafficking in the basal and insulin-stimulated states is still the subject of controversy. For example, it remains unclear to what extent Glut4 recycles through the plasma membrane in the basal state or whether it is sequestered in one or more “static” intracellular membrane compartments (14Zeigerer A.

Early studies often appeared to yield contradictory results, most likely because of differences in the cell systems and/or the techniques employed. A phenylalanine motif (FQQI) within the cytoplasmic N terminus of Glut4 (18Piper R.C. Tai C. Slot J.W. Hahn C.S. Rice C.M. Huang H. James D.E. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Conversely, a dileucine motif within the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Glut4 appears to act as an endocytic motif in cultured cell lines expressing ectopic Glut4 (24Verhey K.J. Birnbaum M.J. J.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 131-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In L6 myocytes, the C-terminal 25-amino acid residues of Glut4 appear to be both necessary and sufficient for its insulin-responsive subcellular trafficking (23Haney P.M. Levy M.A. Strube M.S. Mueckler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 641-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a result consistent with earlier studies conducted in Chinese hamster ovary cells (27Czech M.P. Chawla A. Woon C.W. Buxton J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26193-26199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implicating the extreme C terminus of the protein in Glut4 trafficking. Appropriate trafficking in L6 myocytes was shown to be dependent on the dileucine motif as well as additional unidentified residues downstream of this motif. Birnbaum and colleagues (22Verhey K.J. Yeh J.I. Birnbaum M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) reported that the C-terminal 30 residues of Glut4 are both necessary and sufficient for targeting of the protein to an insulin-responsive intracellular compartment in 3T3L1 adipocytes but that the dileucine motif does not play a role in this targeting behavior. Subsequently, James and colleagues (29Shewan A.M. Marsh B.J. Melvin D.R. Martin S. Gould G.W. James D.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) identified a sequence motif in the C-terminal tail of Glut4 that is similar to a motif in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP) 2The abbreviations used are: IRAP, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase; IRM, insulin-responsive motif; PM, plasma membrane; MPR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; GSV, Glut4 storage vesicle; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 2The abbreviations used are: IRAP, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase; IRM, insulin-responsive motif; PM, plasma membrane; MPR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; GSV, Glut4 storage vesicle; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This acidic motif (TELEY) was reported to be responsible for the movement of Glut4 from the general endosomal recycling pathway to a Syntaxin 6/16-containing post-endosomal compartment that was proposed to constitute a subcompartment of the trans-Golgi network (16Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 32Shewan A.M. Van Dam E.M. Martin S. Luen T.B. Hong W. Bryant N.J. James D.E. James. 2003; 14: 973-986Google Scholar). Mutations in this motif increased the level of Glut4 in a plasma membrane-enriched subcellular fraction in the basal state but did not abrogate insulin-stimulated movement of Glut4 to the plasma membrane fraction. The importance of this motif in the overall steady-state distribution of Glut4 in the basal and insulin-stimulated states is unclear, because data in which wild-type Glut4 was colocalized morphologically with TELEY mutants have not been published. Other residues within the C-terminal tail of Glut4 have been shown to influence the subcellular trafficking of the transporter in various cell types (33Cope D.L. Lee S. Melvin D.R. Gould G.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Martinez-Arca S. Lalioti V.S. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, a specific motif responsible for the trafficking of Glut4 to an insulin-sensitive membrane compartment or that is directly responsible for insulin-stimulated accumulation of Glut4 in the plasma membrane has not yet been identified. Thus, although the C terminus of Glut4 appears to contain one or more motifs that are necessary for trafficking of the protein to an insulin-sensitive subcellular compartment, the specific amino acids comprising these motifs have not yet been clearly defined.In the present study, we identify a putative targeting motif in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Glut4. This motif LXXLXP-DEX(D/E), designated IRM (insulin-responsive motif), is shared with a conserved amino acid sequence in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of IRAP, but the sequence similarity is based on a different amino acid alignment than that used by James and colleagues (29Shewan A.M. Marsh B.J. Melvin D.R. Martin S. Gould G.W. James D.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) to identify the acidic (TELEY) motif. Unlike other putative Glut4-targeting motifs that have been examined in a native, insulin-responsive cell-type, altering the IRM results in a targeting phenotype that radically differs from that of wild-type Glut4 in both the basal and insulin-stimulated states. We demonstrate that mutations in the IRM abolish insulin-stimulated redistribution of Glut4 to the plasma membrane. Additionally, in the basal state, the bulk of the IRM mutant accumulates in subcellular compartments that do not contain detectable levels of wild-type Glut4 or any other subcellular marker tested. Interestingly, mutation of the IRM does not appear to appreciably change the targeting of IRAP. These data indicate that the IRM is critical for the appropriate insulin-sensitive subcellular trafficking of Glut4, but not of IRAP, in 3T3L1 adipocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—DMEM and calf serum were purchased from Invitrogen.

Fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The pcDNA3-GLUT4/eGFP plasmid was a kind gift from Jeffrey E. Pessin (State University of New York, Stoneybrook).Cell Culture—3T3L1 fibroblasts (from American Tissue Type Culture Collection) were cultured on plastic dishes in DMEM supplemented with 20% calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 units/ml penicillin, 2 mml-glutamine, in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. 2 days after achieving confluence, cells were incubated in differentiation medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 670 nm insulin, 0.5 mm 1-isobutyl 3-methylxanthine, and 25 nm dexamethasone) for 48 h. The cells were then placed in the same medium containing 670 nm insulin but lacking additional supplements for an additional 2 days. Afterward, cells were maintained in the same medium lacking insulin until adenovirus infection 6 days post-differentiation.Adenovirus Production and Infection—The pShuttle-CMV constructs were linearized with PmeI and cotransformed with pAdeasy-1 into Escherichia coli BJ5183. Recombinants were selected and amplified in E. coli DH5α. The clones were then linearized with PacI and transfected into HEK 293A cells (Q. BIOgene) using Lipofectamine 2000 kits (Invitrogen) for the production of recombinant adenoviruses. The large scale amplification of virus was achieved as described previously (36He T.C.

A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar). 3T3L1 adipocytes were infected with adenovirus in serum-free DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin at day 6 after differentiation. Following overnight infection, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the infected cells were used for experiments 48 h later.Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was conducted using minor modifications of previously published procedures (37Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 38Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes on 10-cm dishes were serum-starved overnight, incubated in the absence or presence of 1 μm insulin for 30 min at 37 °C, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), and then scraped into HES buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.082 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin). All of the following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were passed through a Yamato SC homogenizer 12 times at 1,200 rpm. After removing unbroken cells by centrifugation in a Sorvall H6000A rotor at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was centrifuged for 20 min at 12,500 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 18,500 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 20 min, and the pellet was designated the high density microsomal fraction. The 18,500 rpm supernatant was further centrifuged at 44,000 rpm in a Beckman SW55.2 rotor for 2 h, the pellet was defined as the low density microsomal fraction, and the supernatant was defined as the cytoplasmic fraction. The 12,500 rpm pellet was resuspended in HES buffer, layered onto a sucrose cushion (1.12 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), and then centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 1 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor. The mitochondrial/nuclear fraction corresponded to the resulting pellet. The fluffy band at the sucrose cushion interface was collected and resuspended in HES buffer, and then pelleted by centrifugation at 17,500 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 20 min to obtain the plasma membrane (PM) fraction.Western Blotting—Infected 3T3L1 adipocytes were rinsed with cold PBS buffer and then lysed in TENET buffer (1% Triton, 0.5 m EDTA, 20 mm M Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl) containing the protease inhibitor mixture described above. The solubilized lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,500 rpm for 15 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Equal amounts of total protein were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitro-cellulose membrane, incubated in 5% milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, and then subsequently probed with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST buffer for 30 min, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate kit (Amersham Biosciences). The chemiluminescent bands were quantified using NIH Image software version 1.62.Glycosylation Assays—Cell lysates were solubilized in 1% SDS and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. For endoglycosidase H digestion (Roche Diagnostics, Germany), 20 μl of cell lysate was digested with 2.5 milliunits enzyme at 37 °C for 1 h after the addition of 0.5 μl3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5. For N-glycanase digestion (New England Biolabs), 25 μl of the 1% SDS cell lysate was adjusted to a final concentration of 0.25% SDS by the addition of 1.9% Nonidet P-40, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then digested with 1.5 μl of enzyme at 37 °C overnight.Laser Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Infected 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing Glut4 constructs were serum-starved at 37 °C for 2 h, treated with or without 1 μm insulin for 30 min, washed with cold PBS three times, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature or in methanol at -20 °C for 10 min, and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton for 15 min. After blocking with 2.5% bovine serum albumin and 2.5% goat serum in 0.1% Triton for 1 h at room temperature, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, washed with PBS three times and then incubated with Alexa-488 or Alexa-594-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector, Burlingame, CA) on glass slides. The fluorescent staining of the cells was imaged using a 63×/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective, equipped with an MRC 1024 laser confocal image system (Bio-Rad). The quantification of fluorescence intensity was carried out using Zeiss LSM 5 software, version 3.2 SP2 (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).Labeling of Cell Surface Glut4 in Living Cells—3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing Glut4/DsRed or IRM/DsRed were serum-starved for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated monoclonal HA antibody for 3 h in the presence or absence of 1 μm insulin, rinsed in ice-cold PBS, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The cells were then processed and imaged by confocal microscopy as described above.RESULTSFig. 1 (upper alignment) shows a sequence alignment between the extreme cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of Glut4 and the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of IRAP. A conserved motif (IRM) is shared between these two proteins corresponding to the amino acid sequence LXXLXPDEX(D/E), where X is any amino acid. To determine whether residues within this shared sequence are involved in the regulated subcellular trafficking of Glut4, a mutant was constructed in which the six conserved residues were all changed to alanine residues, and the mutant was tagged with a HA epitope in the first exofacial loop (HA-IRM) (Fig. 2). Additionally, we constructed HA-tagged mutants within the previously characterized N-terminal cytoplasmic FQQI motif, the C-terminal dileucine motif, a mutant containing substitutions in both of these motifs, and two mutants at Ser-488, the only known site of phosphorylation in Glut4 (39Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2324-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ser-488 mutants involved changes to either alanine or aspartate (see Fig. 2) to abrogate phosphorylation at this site or to mimic constitutive phosphorylation, respectively.FIGURE 2Schematic diagrams and nomenclature of the Glut4 mutants examined in this study. Amino acid residues are designated by the single-letter code.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed that encode each of the HA-tagged Glut4 mutants illustrated in Fig. 2, and the various constructs were used to infect 3T3L1 adipocytes. In the following experiments, eGFP-tagged wild-type Glut4 (Glut4/eGFP) and the various HA-tagged mutants were coexpressed in the same cell population, so that the extent of colocalization or mistargeting of the mutants compared with wild-type Glut4 could be directly assessed. The coexpression of an internal wild-type control also circumvented the possibility that the differential targeting behavior of a mutant compared with wild-type Glut4 might be caused by the saturation of normal trafficking mechanisms (26Marsh B.J. Alm R.A. McIntosh S.R. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was not possible to directly compare the targeting of the tagged, ectopically expressed wild-type Glut4 construct with endogenous Glut4, because all available antibodies against native Glut4 also recognize the tagged wild-type controls. However, we did assess the targeting behavior of the ectopically expressed wild-type Glut4/eGFP by comparing its subcellular distribution to that of endogenous IRAP, a protein that appears to target very similarly, if not identically, to Glut4 in the basal and insulin-stimulated states (40Keller S.R. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: s410-s420Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A demonstrates that the targeting of Glut4/eGFP under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions was virtually indistinguishable from that of endogenous IRAP at four different levels of expression that encompass the range of expression obtained throughout the current study. Fig. 3B shows that the expression of Glut4/eGFP did not significantly affect the expression of endogenous Glut4 or of endogenous IRAP. Additionally, the targeting behavior of the tagged wild-type Glut4 constructs in the following experiments strongly suggests that normal Glut4 subcellular trafficking patterns were not disrupted by the levels of ectopic protein expression attained. Specifically, the tagged wild-type Glut4 constructs exhibited the characteristic Glut4 perinuclear and dispersed cytoplasmic distribution in the basal state (41Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The wild-type constructs were excluded from the plasma membrane in the basal state and robustly redistributed to the plasma membrane after insulin stimulation. Thus, the subcellular trafficking behavior of the tagged wild-type Glut4 constructs was qualitatively indistinguishable from that of endogenous Glut4 in 3T3L1 adipocytes (41Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), in agreement with numerous studies demonstrating that wild-type Glut4 constructs containing the HA epitope in the first exofacial loop and/or with GFP protein fused to the C terminus target very similarly, if not identically, to native Glut4 (see a recent careful analysis by McGraw and colleagues (42Martin O.J. Lee A. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 484-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)).FIGURE 3Adenoviral-expressed Glut4/eGFP colocalizes with endogenous IRAP. 3T3L1 adipocytes were infected with increasing quantities of recombinant adenoviruses expressing Glut4/eGFP reflecting the range of ectopic expression obtained in these studies. Two days after infection, adipocytes were either maintained under basal conditions or treated with insulin for 30 min.

This enzyme belongs to the superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes, whose three-dimensional structures are analogous to one another. We here discovered a new reaction while studying the short-chain acyl-CoA synthetase that we recently reported (Hashimoto, Y., Hosaka, H., Oinuma, K., Goda, M., Higashibata, H., and Kobayashi, M.

This finding demonstrated that the enzyme formed a carbon-nitrogen bond (EC 6.3.1 acid-ammonia (or amide) ligase (amide synthase); EC 6.3.2 acid-amino acid ligase (peptide synthase)) comprising the amino group of the cysteine and the carboxyl group of the acid. N-Acyl-d-cysteine, N-acyl-dl-homocysteine, and N-acyl-l-cysteine methyl ester were also synthesized from the corresponding cysteine analog substrates by the enzyme.

The initial half-reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase comprises the formation of an acyl-AMP intermediate with the release of inorganic pyrophosphate (step 1, acid + ATP → acyl-AMP + PPi). Next, the AMP of the acyl-CoA synthetase-bound acyl-AMP intermediate is displaced rapidly by CoA yielding acyl-CoA (step 2, acyl-AMP + CoA → acyl-CoA + AMP). Although there have been a few reports describing investigation of thiols instead of CoA (8Hosaka K. Mishina M. Kamiryo T. Numa S.

The enzymes of the adenylate-forming superfamily have been well characterized; acetyl-CoA synthetase is an enzyme central to metabolism in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (24Starai V.J. Celic I. Cole R.N. Boeke J.D. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Science. 2002; 298: 2390-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and firefly luciferase has been widely used in molecular and cell biology (30Gould S.J. Subramani S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In this study, a new function of acetyl-CoA synthetase and firefly luciferase was revealed. All acyl-CoA compounds, amino acids, N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine, N-isobutyryl-d-cysteine, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine were purchased from Sigma. Acids and ATP were purchased from Nakalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) and Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Saccharomyces cerevisiae acetyl-CoA synthetase and Photinus pyralis luciferase, highly purified, were purchased from Sigma and Promega, respectively. Commercially available beetle luciferin (also known as d-luciferin; Promega) was used as a substrate for luciferase. Expression plasmid pET-acsA was used for the expression of the intact acyl-CoA synthetase from P. chlororaphis B23 (AcsA; accession number, BAD90933), and its purification was performed by the method previously reported. To express C-terminally histidine-tagged AcsA (AcsAHis), the fragment of the acsA gene was amplified by PCR using pET-acsA (10Hashimoto Y. Hosaka H. Oinuma K. Goda M. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8660-8667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as a template. The following two oligonucleotide primers were used: 5′-GAATTCTAAGGAGGAATAGCATATGCGCGATTATGAACACGTTGTTG-3′ (the NdeI recognition site is underlined) and 5′-CACTCGAGACCAAGCGCCTGTTGCTTGGCA-3′ (the XhoI recognition site is underlined). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and then inserted into the corresponding sites of pET-24a(+). The resultant plasmid was designated as pET-acsAHis. E. coli BL21-CodonPlus-(DE3)-RIL was transformed with pET-acsAHis. The transformed cells were grown in 2× YT medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) at 37 °C. When A600 nm reached 0.6, the incubation temperature was reduced to 18 °C, and protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. After a 12-h culture, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice, and then suspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) 4The abbreviations used are: KPB, potassium phosphate buffer; IC, isobutyrate-cysteine; AcsAHis, histidine-tagged AcsA; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization. (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The resuspended cells were sonicated, and the cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min). The resulting supernatant was applied to a nickel-chelating column of HisTrap™ HP (5 ml) (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) and washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m NaCl. AcsAHis was eluted with a linear gradient (0.01–0.4 m) of imidazole. The active fractions were collected and dialyzed, and then the enzyme solution was loaded onto a Resource Q column (6 ml) (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) equilibrated with 20 mm KPB (pH 7.5). The enzyme was eluted by increasing the ionic strength of KCl in a linear manner from 0 to 0.5 m in the same KPB. The active fractions were mixed and dialyzed against 20 mm KPB (pH 7.5). The homogeneity of the purified AcsAHis was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The CD spectrum of the purified AcsAHis was confirmed to be identical to that of AcsA (data not shown). Also, both AcsAHis and intact AcsA showed almost the same specific activity (isobutyryl-CoA synthetase activity: 16.3 and 15.1 units/mg; N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthetic activity: 0.012 and 0.013 units/mg, respectively). Therefore, Acs-AHis was used in all experiments in this study. The reaction mixture, comprising 5 mm isobutyrate or acetate, 10 mm l-cysteine, 5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and an appropriate amount of the purified enzyme in 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), was incubated at 20 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding 5% formic acid solvent (final 0.7%, pH 3.0). Then the mixture was analyzed by HPLC with a Shimadzu LC-6A system equipped with a Shim-Pack SCR-102H column (8.0 × 300 mm; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The mobile phase solvent system comprised 0.1% (v/v) formic acid solvent (pH 3.0), and chromatographic separation was performed at 40 °C at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The amount of each sample as a product was measured by monitoring the column effluent at 192 nm. The amount of isobutyrate was measured by the same procedure. The chirality of the products was determined with a CHIRALPAK® QN-AX (4.6 × 150 mm; Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) HPLC column. The mobile phase solvent system comprised 3% (v/v) acetic acid in methanol solvent, and chromatographic separation was performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Fast atom bombardment mass spectra of the purified IC were obtained with a JMS-HX110A mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), using glycerol as the matrix. For LC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis, an Agilent1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a Shim-pack SCR-102H column was used. The MS/MS analysis data were acquired with a QSTAR® XL mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) with TurboIonSpray® (ESI) in the positive and negative modes. The following conditions were used. An ion spray voltage of +5.5 kV or –4.5 kV was applied to the emitter, and the desolvation temperature was 500 °C. The product ion scan mode was used. NMR spectra were measured with an Avance 600 spectrometer (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). Samples were prepared by dissolution in D2O, which was used as an internal standard. Determination of the molecular masses of the products (i.e. N-acyl-l-cysteine, N-acyl-dl-homocysteine, and N-acyl-l-cysteine methyl ester) was performed by LC-ESI-MS with a Shimadzu LCMS-2010EV system equipped with a Shim-pack SCR-102H column. The reaction mixture for these products, comprising 5 mm various acids, 10 mm l-cysteine, 5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and an appropriate amount of the purified enzyme in 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), was incubated at 20 °C. The products were eluted with 0.1% formic acid solvent (pH 3.0), and chromatographic separation was performed at 40 °C at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. In the case of N-luciferyl-l-cysteine, the reaction mixture (10 mm d-luciferin, 100 mm l-cysteine, 10 mm ATP, 16 mm MgCl2, and an appropriate amount of the purified luciferase in 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8)) was incubated at 20 °C and then analyzed by LC-ESI-MS with a Shimadzu LCMS-2010EV system equipped with a Cosmosil 5C18-MS-II column (4.6 × 150 mm; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The mobile phase solvent comprised 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.9) containing 10% acetonitrile, and chromatographic separation was performed at 50 °C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The product was quantitated by monitoring at 190–600 nm. The MS analysis data were acquired with the following conditions; the curved desolvation line and heat block temperatures were set at 250 and 200 °C, respectively. The nebulizer gas flow rate and drying gas pressure were set at 1.5 liters/min and 0.2 megapascals, respectively. The detector voltage was set at +4.5 or –3.5 kV, and the ion source polarity was set in the positive and negative modes. Acyl-CoA Synthetase Activity—Acyl-CoA synthetase activity was measured by HPLC on a Cosmosil 5C18-AR-II column (4.6 × 150 mm; Nacalai Tesque) using the previously reported assay system by quantitating acyl-CoA products (10Hashimoto Y. Hosaka H. Oinuma K. Goda M. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8660-8667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31DeBuysere M.S. Olson M.S. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The reactions were performed under linear conditions with regard to protein (∼1.5 μg/ml) and time (∼4 min). One unit of acyl-CoA synthetic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of acyl-CoA/min under these assay conditions. N-Isobutyryl-l-cysteine Synthetic Activity—The reaction mixture (60 μl) for N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthetic activity comprised 5 mm isobutyrate, 0.03– 600 mm l-cysteine, 5 mm ATP, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and the purified AcsA in 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reaction was started by adding the enzyme (0.1 mg/ml), followed by incubation at 20 °C for 4 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 5% formic acid solvent (5 μl, final 0.7%) to the reaction mixture, and a supernatant was obtained by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min). The N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthetic activity was measured by HPLC on a CROWNPAK CR(+) column (4.0 × 150 mm; Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd.). The mobile phase solvent comprised perchloric acid solvent (pH 1.5), and chromatographic separation was performed at 35 °C at the flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The amount of the product was determined by monitoring the column effluent at 192 nm with authentic N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine as a standard (retention time, 8.9 min). One unit of N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthetic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine/min under these assay conditions. N-Isobutyryl-d-cysteine and N-acetyl-l-cysteine synthetic activities were also measured by this method. Measurement of Acid-dependent AMP Formation—N-Acylation compound synthetic activity was assayed by measuring AMP except in the cases of N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine, N-isobutyryl-d-cysteine, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine synthesis. AMP and ATP in each reaction series were separated on a Titansphere TiO HPLC column (4.6 × 150 mm; GL Science Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The mobile phase solvent comprised 50 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, and chromatographic separation was performed at 50 °C at the flow rate of 1 ml/min, with monitoring at 260 nm. One unit of N-acyl-l-cysteine synthetic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of AMP/min under these assay conditions. Specific activity is expressed as units/mg protein. kcat values were calculated using a Mr of 61,278 for AcsAHis. Protein concentrations were measured with a Nakalai Tesque protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was performed in a 11% polyacrylamide slab gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. CD spectra of the purified proteins were obtained with a spectrometer, J-720 (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan), at 20 °C. Detection of the Isobutyrate-cysteine (IC) Product—In order to further investigate the substrate specificity of AcsA, some thiols were used instead of CoA. Because isobutyrate was a suitable substrate among the acids, judging from the fact that it showed the highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for acyl-CoA synthesis (10Hashimoto Y. Hosaka H. Oinuma K. Goda M. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8660-8667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), isobutyrate was usually used as an acid substrate. When the reaction mixture comprising AcsA, ATP, isobutyrate, and l-cysteine was analyzed by HPLC on a Titansphere TiO HPLC column, a significant increase in AMP was observed. In addition, when the same reaction mixture was analyzed on a Shim-pack SCR-102H ion exclusion chromatography column, a new product peak (retention time, 15 min) other than that of AMP appeared. The amount of the product was in proportion to the reaction time and the enzyme concentration. Without AcsA, the new product and AMP were not detected. We also performed the reaction using a blank sample, as follows. A fraction was prepared from the Escherichia coli transformant carrying the intact pET-24a(+) vector (i.e. the transformant harboring no acsA gene) by the same procedure as that used for the purification of AcsA from the E. coli transformant, but it did not exhibit the production of the new product or an increase in AMP. These results suggested that AcsA itself catalyzes the new reaction using l-cysteine and isobutyrate, with the decomposition of ATP to AMP. There have been a few reports describing investigation of thiols instead of CoA (8Hosaka K. Mishina M. Kamiryo T. Numa S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 325-333Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 9Tanaka T. Hosaka K. Hoshimaru M. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The results of the spectrometric assay, where the amount of AMP produced in the reaction was determined through the coupling reaction with adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, and the following oxidation of NADH at 334 nm (8Hosaka K. Mishina M. Kamiryo T. Numa S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 325-333Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), indicate that the long chain acyl-CoA synthetase acts on dephospho-CoA, N6-etheno-CoA, 4′-phosphopantetheine, and pantetheine. However, identification of these reaction products other than AMP has never been reported, and l-cysteine and related compounds (e.g. N-acetylcysteamine, glutathione, and dithiothreitol) are inactive as substrates. The new method we used here (described under “Experimental Procedures”) enabled the measurement of a small amount of AMP, resulting in the discovery of the reactivity of l-cysteine as a substrate. Therefore, we performed analysis of the resultant reaction product. High resolution fast atom bombardment-MS analysis of the isolated resultant product indicated a molecular formula of C7H13O3NS (molecular ion [M + H]+ m/z 192.0713; mass calculated for C7H14O3NS). Because this formula shows that the compound ligates isobutyrate and cysteine are ligated through dehydration ((CH3)2CH-CO-NH-CH(COOH)CH2-SH (N-isobutyryl-cysteine) or (CH3)2CH-CO-S-CH2-CH(NH2)COOH (S-isobutyryl-cysteine)) this product was designated as the IC. N-Acylation by Acyl-CoA Synthetase: New Amide Bond Formation—Authentic N-isobutyryl-cysteine (32Bruckner H. Westhauser T. Godel H. J. Chromatogr. A. 1995; 711: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was eluted at exactly the same time as the IC compound from the Shim-pack SCR-102H column, to which the reaction mixture had been applied. Similarly, authentic N-isobutyryl-cysteine and the IC compound were eluted at the same retention time (9.0 min) from an HPLC CROWNPAK® CR (+) column, respectively. The structure of the IC compound was also determined by LC-MS/MS. The fragmentation of the reaction product (Fig. 1) was completely consistent with that of authentic N-isobutyryl-cysteine (data not shown). In the negative ion mode, a fragment ion at m/z 112 (Fig. 1B), which should be derived from only N-isobutyryl-cysteine, was also detected. Additionally, this identification was supported by the NMR spectra of the IC compound (1H NMR (600 MHz, D2O): δ 4.31 (dd, 1H, J = 4.46, 6.17), 2.85 (dd, 1H, J = 4.45, 14.2), 2.80 (dd, 1H, J = 6.17, 14.0), 2.47 (1H, q or qq), 0.98 (d, 3H, J = 6.95), 0.97 (d, 3H, J = 5.74); 13C-NMR (600 MHz, D2O): δ 181.12, 176.23, 55.31, 35.27, 26.35, 19.19, 18.72) and authentic N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine (1H NMR (600 MHz, D2O): δ 4.43 (dd, 1H, J = 4.68, 6.99), 2.85 (dd, 1H, J = 4.68, 14.2), 2.80 (dd, 1H, J = 6.99, 14.2), 2.47 (1H, q or qq), 0.98 (d, 3H, J = 6.86), 0.97 (d, 3H, J = 6.91); 13C NMR (600 MHz, D2O): δ 181.65, 174.18, 55.03, 35.06, 25.41, 19.02, 18.78). Analysis on a chiral compound separation column, CHIRALPAK® QN-AX, showed that the retention time of the IC compound was different from that of authentic N-isobutyryl-d-cysteine (21.5 min) but consistent with that of N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine (34 min). Based on these findings, the IC compound was identified as N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine but not as N-isobutyryl-d-cysteine. It is noteworthy that AcsA catalyzes amide bond formation; AcsA is thus capable of catalyzing not only S-acylation but also N-acylation. We previously described salt activation by ammonium sulfate of the acyl-CoA synthetic activity of AcsA (10Hashimoto Y. Hosaka H. Oinuma K. Goda M. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8660-8667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Hence, the effect of ammonium sulfate on N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthesis was compared with that on isobutyryl-CoA synthesis, the following results being obtained: for isobutyryl-CoA synthesis, 0 mm (NH4)2SO4, 30%; 5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 46%; 50 mm (NH4)2SO4, 88%; 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 100%, respectively; for N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthesis, 0 mm (NH4)2SO4, 33%; 5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 41%; 50 mm (NH4)2SO4, 73%; 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 100%, respectively. These findings demonstrated that the presence of the ammonium sulfate activates not only isobutyryl-CoA synthesis (thioester bond synthesis) but also N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthesis (amide bond synthesis); the mode of activation by ammonium sulfate for N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthesis is similar to that for isobutyryl-CoA synthesis. Moreover, the addition of 100 mm ammonium sulfate never inhibited both the isobutyryl-CoA synthesis and the N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthesis. Therefore, 100 mm ammonium sulfate was added to all of the reaction mixtures used in the assays. Stoichiometry—The stoichiometry of substrate consumption and product formation during the synthesis of N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine was examined in a reaction mixture consisting of 5 mm ATP, 5 mm isobutyrate, 400 mm l-cysteine, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and an appropriate amount of the enzyme, in a final volume of 700 μl. The reaction was carried out at 20 °C. At several time points, the molar amounts of the formed products (N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine and AMP) and accompanying decreases in the substrates (isobutyrate and ATP) were measured using four authentic compounds as standards (Fig. 2). The formation of no other compounds was observed. The results indicated that N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine and AMP were formed with the consumption of isobutyrate and ATP in a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry. Kinetics Analysis of N-Isobutyryl-l-Cysteine Synthetic Activity of AcsA—The N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthetic activity value calculated from Hanes-Woolf plots (Fig. 3) was compared with the isobutyryl-CoA synthetic activity (Table 1). The Vmax value of the N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthetic activity (0.197 units/mg) was one-fifteenth that of the isobutyryl-CoA synthetic activity (2.77 units/mg). The Km values for isobutyrate of the two reactions were nearly the same (0.083 ± 0.009 mm for N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthesis; 0.085 ± 0.013 mm for isobutyryl-CoA synthesis). In contrast, there was a significant difference between the Km values for CoA and l-cysteine (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetics comparison between isobutyryl-CoA synthesis and N-isobutyryl-cysteine synthesis by AcsAVmaxKmkcat/Kmunits/mgmms-1·mm-1N-Isobutyryl-l-cysteine synthesis0.197 ± 0.01371.1 ± 4.30.00283 ± 0.00003Isobutyryl-CoA synthesis2.77 ± 0.290.0789 ± 0.003435.8 ± 2.2"
https://openalex.org/W2021139567,"Formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) catalyzes the oxidation of a specific cysteine residue in nascent sulfatase polypeptides to formylglycine (FGly). This FGly is part of the active site of all sulfatases and is required for their catalytic activity. Here we demonstrate that residues 34–68 constitute an N-terminal extension of the FGE catalytic core that is dispensable for in vitro enzymatic activity of FGE but is required for its in vivo activity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), i.e. for generation of FGly residues in nascent sulfatases. In addition, this extension is needed for the retention of FGE in the ER. Fusing a KDEL retention signal to the C terminus of FGE is sufficient to mediate retention of an N-terminally truncated FGE but not sufficient to restore its biological activity. Fusion of FGE residues 1–88 to secretory proteins resulted in ER retention of the fusion protein. Moreover, when fused to the paralog of FGE (pFGE), which itself lacks FGly-generating activity, the FGE extension (residues 34–88) of this hybrid construct led to partial restoration of the biological activity of co-expressed N-terminally truncated FGE. Within the FGE N-terminal extension cysteine 52 is critical for the biological activity. We postulate that this N-terminal region of FGE mediates the interaction with an ER component to be identified and that this interaction is required for both the generation of FGly residues in nascent sulfatase polypeptides and for retention of FGE in the ER. Formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) catalyzes the oxidation of a specific cysteine residue in nascent sulfatase polypeptides to formylglycine (FGly). This FGly is part of the active site of all sulfatases and is required for their catalytic activity. Here we demonstrate that residues 34–68 constitute an N-terminal extension of the FGE catalytic core that is dispensable for in vitro enzymatic activity of FGE but is required for its in vivo activity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), i.e. for generation of FGly residues in nascent sulfatases. In addition, this extension is needed for the retention of FGE in the ER. Fusing a KDEL retention signal to the C terminus of FGE is sufficient to mediate retention of an N-terminally truncated FGE but not sufficient to restore its biological activity. Fusion of FGE residues 1–88 to secretory proteins resulted in ER retention of the fusion protein. Moreover, when fused to the paralog of FGE (pFGE), which itself lacks FGly-generating activity, the FGE extension (residues 34–88) of this hybrid construct led to partial restoration of the biological activity of co-expressed N-terminally truncated FGE. Within the FGE N-terminal extension cysteine 52 is critical for the biological activity. We postulate that this N-terminal region of FGE mediates the interaction with an ER component to be identified and that this interaction is required for both the generation of FGly residues in nascent sulfatase polypeptides and for retention of FGE in the ER.

FGE is localized in the ER and generates the FGly residue by oxidation of the cysteine in the C(T/S/C/A)PSR pentapeptide conserved in all human sulfatases. The N-terminal 33 residues of human FGE represent a cleavable signal peptide. The mature form of FGE is composed of a compact N-glycosylated monomeric core with a novel fold and little secondary structure that is stabilized by two Ca2+ ions and two intramolecular disulfide bonds (11Preusser-Kunze A.

Major structural differences between FGE and pFGE are the N-terminal extension of 55 residues (residue 34–88 in human FGE) and a loop of a 22-residue length (FGE residues 304–325), both found only in FGE (12Dierks T.

Hetero-complex formation of FGE, pFGE, and sulfatases has been observed and speculated to confer ER retention also to FGE (17Gande S.L. Mariappan M. Schmidt B. Pringle T.H. von Figura K. Dierks T.

Settembre C. Annunziata I. Surace E.M. Dierks T. Monti M. Cozzolino M. Pucci P. Ballabio A. Cosma M.P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2443-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the majority of FGE that escapes retention in the ER is secreted as an N-terminally truncated form starting with glutamate 73. A peptide inhibitor for furin-type proteinases prevents this cleavage, suggesting that a Golgi-localized furin-like proteinase initiates the proteolytic processing of FGE during secretion. 4M. Mariappan, unpublished results. 4M. Mariappan, unpublished results. In fact, consensus sequences for furin-type proteinases are found at arginine residues 69 and 72 of FGE. It has been demonstrated that a truncated FGE, lacking residues 34–68, is catalytically active (7Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J. Preusser A. Mariappan M. von Figura K.

This suggested that the N-terminal extension of FGE, harboring a sequence motif that is fully conserved in all eukaryotic FGEs from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals (see “Discussion”), contributes a functional property that is independent of its FGly-generating activity. Here we show that the N-terminal extension of FGE is required for the activation of sulfatases in vivo. Furthermore, the N-terminal extension is required for FGE retention in the ER and contains a transferable ER-retention signal. Retention of N-terminally truncated FGE in the ER, however, is not sufficient to restore the activation of sulfatases. Surprisingly, co-expression of a fusion protein carrying the N-terminal extension of FGE partially restores the in vivo activation of sulfatases by N-terminally truncated FGE. We conclude from these data that the N-terminal extension of FGE mediates the interaction with an ER component and thereby ensures both the retention of FGE in the ER and the generation of FGly residues in nascent sulfatase polypeptides. Construction of Expression Plasmids—The plasmids used to express galactose-6-sulfatase, steroid sulfatase (STS), and different forms of His6- or HA-tagged FGE and pFGE have been described previously (11Preusser-Kunze A.

For co-expression of FGE-HA, Δ34–68FGE-HA, or Δ34–68FGE-HA-KDEL with steroid sulfatase, the pBI vector (BD Biosciences) was used, which allows expression of two cDNAs from a bidirectional tetracycline/doxycycline-responsive promoter (15Mariappan M.

In the first step of cloning, FGE-HA, Δ34–68FGE-HA, or Δ34–68FGE-HA-KDEL-encoding PCR products were equipped with a 5′-EcoRV or BamHI site and a 3′-HA tag sequence followed by a stop codon (for Δ34–68FGE-HA-KDEL, extended by KDEL and stop codon) and a NotI site by add-on PCR using pBI-FGE-HA (15Mariappan M.

The following primers were used: GGATATCGGGACAACATGGCTGCG (EcoRV-FGE); CGGGATCCGCCACCATGGACAGCAAAGGTTCG (ppl-BamHI); ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTTATGCGTAGTCAGGCACATCATACGGATAGTCCATGGTGGGCAGGC (FGE-HA-NotI); TAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTTACAGCTCGTCCTTTGCGTAGTCAGGCACATCATA (FGE-HA-KDEL-NotI-nc). These PCR products were digested with EcoRV or BamHI followed by blunting the BamHI site with T4-polymerase/dNTPs and then cut with NotI. The digested PCR products were cloned into the multiple cloning site II of the pBI vector that had been opened by PstI, blunted as above, and cut with NotI. After ligation, the EcoRV or BamHI site of insert and PstI site of vector were destroyed. In the second step cloning of steroid sulfatase into multiple cloning site I of pBI vector was performed as described earlier (15Mariappan M. Preusser-Kunze A. Balleininger M. Eiselt N. Schmidt B.

To construct bidirectional expression vectors for co-expression of FGE1–88-pFGEΔPGEL with Δ34–68FGE-HA or FGE-HA or pFGE, the sequence encoding residues 1–88 of FGE was amplified with a 5′ NheI site and a 3′ EcoRV site using pBI-FGE-HA as template and the primers GCTAGCTAGCGGGACAACATGGCTGCG (NheI-atg-FGE-c) and CGCGATATCGTGCGCGAGTTGCCGCTC (FGE-88-EcoRV-nc). The resulting PCR products were digested with NheI and EcoRV and inserted into the corresponding sites of pBI multiple cloning site I with multiple cloning site II being empty or carrying either Δ34–68FGE-HA or FGE-HA or pFGE. Next, the sequence encoding residues 28–297 of pFGE was generated with a 5′-FspI site and a3′-EcoRV site using pBI-pFGE (17Gande S.L. Mariappan M. Schmidt B. Pringle T.H. von Figura K. Dierks T.

The FspI/EcoRV-digested PCR products were cloned into the constructs described above that had been opened up with EcoRV. It should be noted that after ligation, the FspI site was destroyed. All the cysteine mutants of FGE-HA were created by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) using pBI-STS+FGE-HA as template and complementary mutagenesis primers. The coding sequences of these primers were CTTGCGGGTTCTGCCGGCTGCGGCACGC (FGE-C50A), GGGTTCTTGCGGCGCCGGCACGCCCCAG (FGE-52A), and TTGCGGGTTCTGCCGGCGCCGGCACGCCCCAG (FGE-C50A/C52A). All PCR reactions were performed with Pfu-Ultra polymerase (Stratagene). The resulting constructs were analyzed by full-length sequencing of coding regions to preclude any PCR-derived errors.

Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 as recommended by Invitrogen. For single or co-expression experiments, the HT1080 Tet-On or MSDi Tet-On cells were transfected with 2 μg of pBI vector carrying one or two cDNAs from a bidirectional tet-responsive promotor.

The primary antibodies were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to Cy2 or Cy3 (Molecular Probes). Confocal images were taken on a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS laser-scanning microscope. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—HT1080 cells stably expressing FGE-His or Δ34–68FGE-His and transiently expressing pFGE or pFGEΔPGEL or FGE1–88-pFGEΔPGEL were grown to near confluency in 3-cm dishes. After 60 min of starving, they were pulsed with [35S]methionine/cysteine (Hartmann Analytic) for 90 min. Cells and media were collected after incubation for various periods in unlabeled medium. Immunoprecipitation of FGE or pFGE from cells and media was performed with an FGE antiserum or pFGE antiserum, respectively, according to a protocol described earlier (21Gieselmann V.

Pellets were finally solubilized and subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (BAS1000, Raytest). Densitometric quantification of FGE or pFGE was done using the MacBAS software (Fuji). Activity Assays for Sulfatases and Western Blotting—Activity assays of galactose-6-sulfatase and steroid sulfatase were performed as described earlier (22Rommerskirch W. von Figura K. Proc. Natl.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Western blot signals were quantified using the AIDA 2.1 software package (Raytest). FGE amounts were calculated on the basis of known amounts of purified FGE present on each Western blot. Signals of galactose-6-sulfatase and steroid sulfatase are given as relative amounts, i.e. related to signal intensities detected in cells expressing galactose-6-sulfatase or steroid sulfatase only. Relative specific sulfatase activities were calculated, i.e. catalytic activity divided by the Western blot signal (arbitrary units) and referred to that of cells expressing the sulfatase only (relative specific sulfatase activity = 1). N-terminally Truncated FGE Is Catalytically Active but Lacks Biological Function—FGE is a soluble ER-localized protein, where it converts in newly synthesized sulfatase polypeptides a cysteine into the active site FGly residue that is indispensable for sulfatases to become catalytically active. FGE is synthesized as a precursor of 374 amino acids with a cleavable signal peptide of 33 residues at its N terminus (11Preusser-Kunze A. Mariappan M. Schmidt B. Gande S.L. Mutenda K.

A fraction of mature FGE escapes retention in the ER and is secreted. The majority of secreted FGE lacks the N-terminal 39 amino acids of mature FGE (residues 34–72) but retains catalytic activity. For a recombinant form of FGE lacking N-terminal residues 34–68 (Δ34–68FGE), we could unequivocally demonstrate catalytic activity in vitro when using a synthetic peptide as a substrate that contains the C(T/S/C/A)PSR consensus motif of human sulfatases (11Preusser-Kunze A.

To examine whether truncated FGE retains biological activity in intact cells, we co-expressed cDNAs encoding full-length FGE or Δ34–68FGE together with cDNAs encoding sulfatases in two different experimental systems and determined the catalytic activity of the sulfatases. The activity of the sulfatases depends on FGE-mediated generation of the FGly residue and, therefore, can serve as an indirect indicator for the modification of the newly synthesized sulfatases by FGE. In the first system full-length FGE was stably expressed in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells that stably co-expressed galactose-6-sulfatase as a reporter sulfatase. We observed an up to a 340-fold increase in galactose-6-sulfatase activity due to FGE co-expression. The increase was proportional, although not linear, to the expression level of FGE (Fig. 1A). Expression of truncated FGE at levels comparable with that of full-length FGE did not increase galactose-6-sulfatase activity significantly above the basal level (Fig. 1A), indicating that the N terminus of FGE is required for the activation of sulfatases. In a second system we utilized for expression immortalized fibroblasts from a patient with multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSDi Tet-On cells, see “Experimental Procedures”), which almost completely lack endogenous FGE activity due to a severe homozygous mutation (p.S155P) in the SUMF1 gene (8Cosma M.P.

Carella M. Ballabio A. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Transient co-expression of steroid sulfatase with full-length FGE increased the activity of steroid sulfatase 95-fold compared with cells expressing steroid sulfatase only. Co-expression of truncated FGE with steroid sulfatase failed to increase the activity of the sulfatase also in this expression system (Fig. 1B). N-terminally Truncated FGE Is Rapidly Secreted—A possible explanation for the inability of Δ34–68FGE to support the formation of catalytically active sulfatases could be that the N-terminal fragment is required for the retention of FGE in the ER where it catalyzes the generation of FGly residues in nascent sulfatase polypeptides. To examine the role of the N-terminal residues 34–68 for the retention of FGE in the ER, HT1080 cells expressing full-length or Δ34–68FGE were metabolically labeled, and the secretion of the newly synthesized FGE was monitored during a subsequent chase for up to 8 h (Fig. 2). The data clearly show that Δ34–68FGE is rapidly secreted with less than 10% being retained intracellularly after chasing for 8 h, whereas after the same chase time half of the full-length FGE is still recovered intracellularly.

In this study we have identified MEKK3 Thr294 as a novel site of phosphorylation that regulates MEKK3 binding with 14-3-3. Phosphorylation of MEKK3 at Thr294 was observed for both endogenous and ectopically expressed MEKK3. Mutation of Thr294 to alanine abolished 14-3-3-MEKK3 association and incubation with phosphorylated peptides mimicking Thr(P)294 competed for 14-3-3 binding. Mutation of Thr294 did not alter Ser526 phosphorylation within the activation loop. However, expression of T294A MEKK3 elevated TNFα-stimulated NF-κB transcriptional activity, suggesting that Thr294 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding negatively regulate MEKK3. Stimulation with TNFα or lipopolysaccharide caused a rapid decrease in Thr294 phosphorylation of endogenous MEKK3 and subsequent loss of 14-3-3 association. Thus, this study identifies a potentially important regulatory step in MEKK3 signaling via dephosphorylation of Thr294, which reduces 14-3-3 binding correlating with MEKK3 pathway activation.

Protein kinases are key regulators of extracellular cues that illicit gene expression. One group of protein kinases involved in a wide array of cellular functions is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAP(3)K, MAPK kinase kinase; MEKK, MAPK/ERK kinase kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IKK, IκB kinase; WT, wild type; CIP, calf intestinal phosphatase. family consisting of the well characterized extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (also called stress-activated protein kinase), p38 MAPK, and the Big MAPK/ERK5. These family members are all activated by linear phosphorylation cascades involving upstream protein kinases called MAPK kinase and MAP(3)K. Numerous MAP(3)K have been identified, including MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, MEKK4, tumor progression locus 2, and transforming growth factor-B-activated kinase 1. MAP(3)Ks are emerging as important regulators of NF-κB. NF-κB belongs to a family of transcription factors that are essential mediators of pro-inflammatory signals involved in innate immunity. The mechanism of NF-κB regulation has been the subject of intense research for the past decade and is becoming better understood. NF-κB is sequestered to the cytoplasm by the inhibitor protein of κB(IκB). NF-κB can translocate to the nucleus following phosphorylation and degradation of IκBbyIκB kinase (IKK). Activation of IKK occurs rapidly following pro-inflammatory receptor activation, and both TNFα- and LPS-induced NF-κB activation is lost in mouse embryonic fibroblasts devoid of MEKK3 (1Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z.-G. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). IKK might be directly phosphorylated by MEKK3 (2Schmidt C. Peng B. Li Z. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Niu J. Schmidt-Supprian M. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Chiao P.J. Mol.

A potential mechanism of MEKK3 regulation is through interaction with 14-3-3 molecules. 14-3-3 proteins are recognized as important cellular regulators by facilitating the interaction between phosphorylated proteins (3Muslin A.J.

The interaction between another MAP(3)K, Raf-1, and 14-3-3 is an example of this complex regulation, with both activating and inactivating functions. For example, Raf-1 is inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser259, which promotes the association with 14-3-3 proteins and stabilizes Raf-1 in an inactive conformation that cannot be recruited and activated by Ras (8Roy S.

In contrast, Ser621 phosphorylation mediates distinct 14-3-3 binding, which stabilizes Raf-1 in an active conformation (11Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J.

Here we show that 14-3-3 binding occurs at phosphorylated Thr294 of MEKK3. Agonists of the MEKK3 pathway, including TNFα and LPS, caused a reduction in Thr294 phosphorylation for endogenous MEKK3 leading to a loss of 14-3-3 binding. Furthermore, mutation of Thr294 to alanine led to elevated TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activation. Therefore, this study suggests that pro-inflammatory molecules such as TNFα and LPS contribute to MEKK3-dependent NF-κB activation by modulating Thr294 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. Cell Culture—HEK 293, HeLa, and RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and humidity. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Human MEKK3 cDNA was cloned from IMAGE clone 7939519 by PCR and inserted into pCMV10-3xFLAG to introduce an N-terminal FLAG epitope. Mutagenesis of pCMV10-3xFLAG-MEKK3 was performed using QuikChange kit (Stratagene), and the mutations were sequence-verified. cDNA Transfection—HEK 293 or HeLa cells were plated onto 35-mm-diameter dishes at 80% confluency and transfected with 100-500 ng of cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection medium was removed and replaced with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—The cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS, 100 nm okadaic acid and protease inhibitors. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) were added to lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with 200 μl of lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer heated to 70 °C for 10 min. Portions of the lysates prior to immunoprecipitation were also boiled with lithium dodecyl sulfate-containing sample buffer. Lysates and immunoprecipitations were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked in 5% skim milk for 30 min, and probed with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C. Secondary decoration with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies was performed at room temperature for 1.5 h. The proteins were visualized using ECL according to the manufacturers' protocol (Amersham Biosciences). For blotting using the Licor Odyssey infrared imager, the membranes were probed with IR700 anti-rabbit and IR800 anti-mouse secondary antibodies. FLAG was stained with anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal (Sigma), and 14-3-3 isoforms were detected with anti-14-3-3β (H8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Metabolic Labeling—HEK 293 cells were plated onto 35-mm-diameter dishes at 80% confluency and transfected with 500 ng of pCMV10-FLAG-MEKK3 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers' protocol. After 24 h, the cells were placed in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mCi/ml 32P-labeled orthophosphate at 37 °C for 4 h. FLAG-MEKK3 was immunoprecipitated from detergent-solubilized lysates and fractionated on an 8% gel. 32P-Labeled MEKK3 was detected by autoradiography. Tryptic Digestion, Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Mapping, and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Metabolically 32P-labeled FLAG-MEKK3 was isolated as described above, excised from the gel, and digested with 10 μg/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Promega) in 50 mm (NH4)HCO3, pH 7.8, overnight at 37 °C. The gel fragments were pelleted by centrifugation, and the remaining supernatant was transferred to clean tubes and dried under vacuum. Dried peptides were resuspended in 50 μl of performic acid, incubated on ice for 2 h, and dried under vacuum. The peptides were washed with diminishing volumes of water and resuspended in 5 μl of pH 1.9 electrophoresis buffer. Electrophoresis was performed on 200-μm microcrystalline cellulose plates (Kodak) at 1000 V, 7 °C for 30 min. The plates were chromatographed in the second dimension in chromatography buffer (n-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water, 32.5:25:5:20). The plates were dried, and phosphopeptides were visualized using an FX-Imager (Bio-Rad) or film autoradiography. If cold synthetic phosphopeptides were also run, these were visualized with ninhydrin staining. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by hydrolyzing 32P-labeled MEKK3 in 500 μl of 6 n HCl heated to 110 °C for 60 min. The HCl was removed under vacuum, and the phosphoamino acids were washed with diminishing volumes of water. Separation was performed on cellulose plates using buffer consisting of 0.5% pyridine and 5% acetic acid at 1500 V at 7 °C for 20 min in one direction, and then the plate was allowed to dry. Once dry, phosphoamino acids were separated in a second dimension using pH 3.5 buffer at 1600 V at 7 °C for 13 min. 32P-Labeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. In each of the samples, 1 μg of a mixture of phospho-l-serine, phospho-l-threonine, and phospho-l-tyrosine was also added that was visualized by ninhydrin staining. Peptide Competition Assay—The Thr294 peptide (DGGRTFPRIR) and phosphopeptide (DGGRpTFPRIR) corresponding to the sequence surrounding Thr294 were synthesized by Genscrip Corp. A scrambled phosphopeptide RFPFDpTGRRI was used as a negative control. Lysates containing FLAG-MEKK3 were incubated with 200 μm of peptide or phosphopeptide where indicated. Anti-FLAG M2 agarose was added, and the mixtures were incubated 4 °C. The beads were washed three times, and proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Co-immunoprecipitated 14-3-3 was detected using a pan-specific anti-14-3-3β antibody (Santa Cruz). In Vitro Kinase Assay—MEKK3 was immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cells and washed three times with solubilization buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 m NaCl, 250 mm β-glycerophosphate, 250 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 nm okadaic acid, protease inhibitor mixture, and twice with kinase assay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μg/ml microcystin LR). The reactions were initiated by adding [γ-32P]ATP and incubating for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× sample buffer and boiling. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG M2 antibody or anti-Ser(P)526 antibody. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by phosphorimaging. NF-κB Reporter Assay—HeLa cells were transfected with 500 ng of FLAG-MEKK3, T294A-MEKK3, or empty vector along with 500 ng of ELAM-Luciferase and 200 ng of pCMV-β-galactosidase. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with 10 ng TNFα for 4 h, and luciferase in the cell extracts was measured (Promega). All of the values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. MEKK3 Requires Autophosphorylation for Association with 14-3-3—To better understand how MEKK3 is regulated by association with 14-3-3, we monitored the co-immunoprecipitation of 14-3-3 with MEKK3 harboring various mutations. Consistent with others, we found that MEKK3 co-immunoprecipitated with one or more endogenous 14-3-3 isoforms (Fig. 1A). We detected the family of 14-3-3 proteins by immunoblotting with a pan-specific 14-3-3 antibody raised against a common sequence present in all family members. This interaction was specific for catalytically active MEKK3, because the kinase dead K391M mutant did not co-immunoprecipitate 14-3-3 (Fig. 1A). In addition, Ser526, located within the catalytic loop of MEKK3 and required for activity (15Fritz A. Brayer K.J. McCormick N. Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Vaillancourt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6236-6245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Zhang D. Facchinetti V. Wang X. Huang Q. Qin J. Su B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was also essential for 14-3-3 association because mutation to alanine prevented 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A). This suggested that MEKK3 activity was required for 14-3-3 association, possibly as a consequence of cis- or trans-autophosphorylation. Identification of Thr294 as a Novel Site of Phosphorylation—To identify the site of 14-3-3 interaction, we first began by substituting predicted serine-containing sites with alanine. This approach ruled out Ser166, Ser236, Ser250, Ser337, and Ser357, because mutation of all these residues to alanine did not abolish MEKK3 co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B). The profile of 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitation suggested that MEKK3 could be phosphorylated on residues that experience autophosphorylation. To identify these additional unknown site(s) of phosphorylation, we expressed WT MEKK3 and K391M MEKK3 in cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (Fig. 2A). We then digested 32P-labeled MEKK3 with trypsin and resolved the tryptic fragments by two-dimensional electrophoresis and cellulose chromatography (Fig. 2B). A major peptide, labeled A, was absent in the K391M MEKK3, suggesting that A was a peptide that undergoes autophosphorylation. To help identify peptide A, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis on 32P-labeled MEKK3 (Fig. 2C). This revealed a mixture of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, indicating that MEKK3 was phosphorylated in cells on both amino acids. We did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation. Serine phosphorylation was expected; however, threonine phosphorylation was surprising and novel. We examined the MEKK3 sequence to identify potential sites of threonine phosphorylation. The threonine residue at 294 within the sequence 291GRRTFPRI298 (of MEKK3 isoform 2; Thr345 of the longer MEKK3 isoform 1) was considered as a potential site of phosphorylation because of the arginine at -2, the phenylalanine at +1, and the proline at +2. This motif resembles the canonical phosphorylation motif for arginine/lysine-directed, basophilic kinases, and also resembles the Mode 1 site for 14-3-3 protein binding. To test whether this site was phosphorylated in cells, we included in the tryptic maps the synthetic peptide pTFPR, corresponding to the unique tryptic fragment generated from 291GRRTFPRI298. The synthetic peptide pTFPR co-migrated exactly with peptide A, revealing the identity of this tryptic spot as pTFPR (Fig. 2B). The other spots surrounding peptide A were likely partial digestion of the sequence flanking Thr294, DGRRpTFRIRR. Trypsin inefficiently cleaves between two arginine residues, which would result in tryptic peptides of various lengths and charges. Consistent with this, we noticed that the two-dimensional tryptic maps generated from T294A MEKK3 showed that many of these additional spots were abolished, including peptide A (data not shown). Generation of a Phosphospecific Thr294 Antibody—To further confirm that Thr294 was a site of phosphorylation, we generated a phosphospecific antibody to Thr294. With purified antibody from rabbits immunized with the synthetic peptide YNDGRRpTFPRIRR corresponding to Thr(P)294, we detected WT MEKK3 but not T294A MEKK3 (Fig. 2D). In addition, K391M MEKK3 was only weakly detected, consistent with a reduction in phosphorylation at Thr294 observed by phosphotryptic mapping. We also examined MEKK3 phosphorylation at Thr294 by immunofluorescence. Cells expressing MEKK3 were detected with anti-FLAG staining, whereas phosphorylation of Thr294 was detected by anti-Thr(P)294 staining (Fig. 2E). Cells expressing WT MEKK3 stained strongly for Thr(P)294 but were devoid in cells expressing T294A MEKK3 (Fig. 2E). Together, these results demonstrate that Thr294 was a site of threonine phosphorylation of MEKK3. Phosphorylated Thr294 Mediates 14-3-3 Interaction—We noticed that the loss of Thr294 phosphorylation of K391M MEKK3 coincided with the loss of 14-3-3 association. In addition, we noticed that the Thr294 residue resided within a potential Mode 1 14-3-3 binding site. Thus, we tested the interaction of 14-3-3 with MEKK3 in which Thr294 was replaced with alanine. Mutation of Thr294 to alanine completely abolished 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A), suggesting that this site plays an important role in stabilizing 14-3-3-MEKK3 interaction. To verify that Thr294 was the site of 14-3-3 binding, we incubated MEKK3 prior to immunoprecipitation with either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated peptide corresponding to the sequence surrounding Thr294, to see whether this peptide could compete with MEKK3 for 14-3-3 binding. The phosphorylated peptides abolished 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitation, whereas the nonphosphorylated peptides had no effect on co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B). A scrambled phosphorylated peptide served as an additional control and also did not disrupt 14-3-3-MEKK3 co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B). Together, these experiments established that Thr294 was a primary site of 14-3-3 protein interaction. Generation of a Phosphospecific Ser526 Antibody—Mutation of Ser526 to alanine also abolished 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A). Therefore, it remained possible that the dependence of Thr294 phosphorylation on 14-3-3 association could be a result of altered Ser526 phosphorylation. To monitor Ser526 phosphorylation, we generated a phosphospecific antibody to this site. Purified antibody from rabbits immunized with the synthetic peptide corresponding to Ser(P)526 detected WT MEKK3 but not S526A MEKK3 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, K391M MEKK3 was not detected by the anti-Ser(P)526 antibody, consistent with previous reports that phosphorylation of this site occurs by autophosphorylation (16Zhang D. Facchinetti V. Wang X. Huang Q. Qin J. Su B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For MEKK3 containing the T294A mutation, Ser526 remained phosphorylated to a level similar to WT MEKK3; however, 14-3-3 co-immunoprecipitation was completely abolished (Fig. 4A). Also, conversion of Ser526 to a phospho-mimetic aspartic acid (S526D) resulted in a partial rescue of Thr294 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding, consistent with previous reports that S526D partially rescues kinase activity (15Fritz A.

Wang X. Huang Q. Qin J. Su B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that Ser526 phosphorylation is constitutive and is likely required for autophosphorylation of Thr294 by maintaining MEKK3 activity but otherwise does not directly participate in 14-3-3 association. Previous work by Fritz et al. (15Fritz A. Brayer K.J. McCormick N. Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Vaillancourt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6236-6245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that Ser526 is sensitive to phosphatase activity, and 14-3-3 binding appears to protect this site in vitro from PP1 and PP2A phosphatase activity. We found that Ser526 of transiently expressed MEKK3 was similar between WT and T294A MEKK3 when cells were solubilized in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 4). To assess whether mutation of Thr294 to alanine rendered the Ser526 more sensitive to phosphatase activity, we lysed cells expressing T294A MEKK3 and WT MEKK3 in the presence or absence of okadaic acid. In the absence of okadaic acid, Ser526 phosphorylation of MEKK3 was reduced by almost 50% compared with MEKK3 lysed in the presence of okadaic acid, confirming that Ser526 is sensitive to PP1 and PP2A family phosphatases. In comparing WT to T294A MEKK3, we found that Ser526 phosphorylation was reduced equally when MEKK3 was solubilized in the absence of okadaic acid (Fig. 4B). Endogenous MEKK3 Is Phosphorylated at Thr294 and Is Decreased by TNFα and LPS Stimulation—So far, these experiments have examined the phosphorylation of ectopically expressed MEKK3. We wanted to know whether endogenous MEKK3 was phosphorylated at Thr294 and whether known stimuli of MEKK3 including TNFα and LPS regulate the phosphorylation of this site. Thus, we immunoprecipitated MEKK3 from RAW 264.7 cells and probed with the anti-Thr(P)294 antibody. The MEKK3 band was immunoreactive with the Thr(P)294 antibody, suggesting that endogenous MEKK3 was phosphorylated at Thr294 (Fig. 5B). Western blotting was performed using the Odyssey infrared scanner, and therefore we were able to directly quantify the level of total MEKK3 (800-nm channel) and Thr(P)294 (700-nm channel) on the same immunoblots (two-color Western blotting). This provided us with a highly accurate method for quantifying the level of Thr294 phosphorylation of endogenous MEKK3. The ratio of Thr(P)294 to total MEKK3 significantly decreased with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) treatment (Fig. 5B), suggesting that endogenous MEKK3 is phosphorylated at Thr294. The residual Thr(P)294 signal could represent either incomplete dephosphorylation by CIP or a low amount of antibody reactivity with nonphosphorylated MEKK3. Next, we treated RAW 264.7 cells with TNFα, which stimulates MEKK3 through activation TNF receptor 1. The cells were placed in fresh medium for 4 h (to remove secreted TNFα) and then stimulated with TNFα. Again, these experiments utilized two-color infrared Western blotting, and quantification of the Thr(P)294 signal to total MEKK3 revealed a decrease in phosphorylation, with a maximal decrease in Thr294 signal of 47% following 20 min of stimulation (Fig. 5C). A time course experiment showed that the reduction in Thr294 phosphorylation was transient following TNFα stimulation and had almost returned to unstimulated levels by 60 min (Fig. 5D). We also tested the Toll-like receptor 4 agonist LPS, which stimulates numerous signaling pathways including MEKK3 (17Huang Q. Yang J. Lin Y. Walker C. Cheng J. Liu Z.-G. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). LPS treatment also caused a reduction of Thr294 phosphorylation by 61% within 30 min (Fig. 5E). The decrease in phosphorylation of Thr294 occurred with similar kinetics compared with ERK1 and 2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5E). Endogenous 14-3-3-MEKK3 Interaction Is Disrupted by LPS—Next, we asked whether the dephosphorylation of Thr294 might affect the association of endogenous 14-3-3 with endogenous MEKK3. We used LPS stimulation for these experiments, because LPS caused the greatest apparent decrease in Thr294 phosphorylation. Following LPS treatment, co-immunoprecipitation of 14-3-3 was abolished, in parallel with the decrease in Thr294 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). We reasoned that the lower amount of residual Thr294 phosphorylation following LPS stimulation was insufficient to maintain 14-3-3 binding. Alternatively, as we speculate above based on the CIP experiment in Fig. 5, the anti-Thr(P)294 antibody could be reacting to some extent with nonphosphorylated MEKK3. Thus, to confirm that 14-3-3 was binding to endogenous MEKK3 at Thr294, we conducted peptide competition assays similar to Fig. 4. Incubation with the phospho-peptide corresponding to Thr294 disrupted the interaction of endogenous MEKK3 and endogenous 14-3-3, but not a nonphospho-peptide or a scrambled phospho-peptide control (Fig. 6B). Together these results show that endogenous 14-3-3 interacts with endogenous MEKK3 at Thr(P)294, and this is disrupted upon LPS-stimulated reduction of Thr294 phosphorylation. In this same set of experiments, we asked whether phosphorylation of Ser526 of endogenous MEKK3 was altered by LPS treatment. Previous work by Zhang et al. (16Zhang D. Facchinetti V. Wang X. Huang Q. Qin J. Su B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that Ser526 phosphorylation increases upon LPS treatment. Probing with our anti-Ser(P)526 antibody showed that Ser526 phosphorylation was elevated by about 60% following LPS stimulation (Fig. 6C). As before, these experiments utilized the LiCor Odyssey infrared scanner, and the ratio of Ser(P)526 signal to total endogenous MEKK3 was analyzed by two-color Western blotting on the same MEKK3 band. Probing with anti-14-3-3 showed that the loss of 14-3-3 binding correlated with the increase in Ser526 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). T294A MEKK3 Elevates NF-κB Response to TNFα—Taken together, our results with endogenous proteins demonstrate that MEKK3 is constitutively phosphorylated at Thr294, and this phosphorylation in reduced by TNFα or LPS stimulation. The reduction in Thr294 phosphorylation promoted the release of endogenous 14-3-3 interaction. Finally, the loss of 14-3-3 binding correlated with a small increase in activation loop phosphorylation at Ser526 for endogenous MEKK3. We therefore hypothesized that the loss of 14-3-3 binding could be involved in stimulation of MEKK3 signaling. When MEKK3 was expressed in cells, we found that both Thr294 and Ser526 phosphorylation were phosphorylated to a high level and were not altered significantly by either TNFα or LPS stimulation. This is different from endogenous MEKK3, where the levels of MEKK3 and the degree of regulation are likely to experience finer control. To evaluate how phosphorylation of Thr294 and binding to 14-3-3 might modulate MEKK3 signaling in cells, we first performed in vitro kinase assays comparing WT MEKK3, T294A MEKK3, and K391M MEKK3. As expected, the kinase dead K391M MEKK3 did not undergo autophosphorylation (Fig. 7A). Both the WT MEKK3 and T294A MEKK3 experienced very similar levels of autophosphorylation (Fig. 7A). This result shows that T294A MEKK3 does not significantly perturb the intrinsic activity of MEKK3. We next performed NF-κB reporter experiments to monitor the activation of NF-κB in cells expressing WT MEKK3 or T294A MEKK3 following exposure to TNFα. We used the luciferase reporter assay to provide quantifiable measurements that could distinguish small changes in pathway activation. Luciferase activity was low in cells expressing WT MEKK3 or T294A MEKK3 without stimulation but was stimulated by 4 h of TNFα treatment (Fig. 7B). TNFα increased the level of T294A MEKK3-mediated NF-κB activation significantly more than WT MEKK3 (Fig. 7B). The luciferase measurements were normalized to an internal β-galactosidase control, and the level of expression of MEKK3 was identical between WT and T294A MEKK3 (Fig. 7B). Thus, expression of the T294A MEKK3 elevated TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activation compared with WT MEKK3. The MEKK2 and MEKK3 protein kinases play important roles in the activation of numerous MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways following cellular stress and activation by pro-inflammatory cytokines. For example, MEKK3 is essential for inflammatory gene expression induced downstream of TNF receptor-1, IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor activation through the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB (1Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z.-G. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17Huang Q. Yang J. Lin Y. Walker C. Cheng J. Liu Z.-G. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that control MEKK2 and MEKK3 activation and their target specificity are thus a subject of intense interest. Specificity of signaling is coordinated through hierarchical phosphorylation cascades that are regulated through association between signaling proteins. The well known phosphoprotein-binding molecule 14-3-3 plays many roles in controlling the specificity, signal strength, and spatial localization of numerous pathways (18Jin J. Smith F.D. Stark C. Wells C.D. Fawcett J.P. Kulkarni S. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P. Taylor P. Taylor L. Zougman A. Woodgett J.R. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1436-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 has been shown to interact with MEKK3, but the site of interaction has not yet been determined. We performed tryptic mapping, phosphoamino acid analysis, and immunoblot analysis with a phosphospecific antibody to identify Thr294 as a novel site of MEKK3 phosphorylation. Mutation of this residue to alanine abolished 14-3-3 interaction, as did incubation of MEKK3 with a synthetic peptide containing phosphorylated but not the unphosphorylated Thr294 peptide or a scrambled phosphorylated peptide. Phosphorylation of Thr294 was dependent upon the catalytic activity of MEKK3, because mutation of the catalytic lysine at 391 significantly diminished phosphorylation of Thr294 and dramatically reduced the interaction between MEKK3 and 14-3-3. This suggested that phosphorylation of Thr294 occurred by autophosphorylation. However, it is also possible that a downstream kinase activated by MEKK3 phosphorylated Thr294. For endogenous MEKK3, Thr294 appeared to be constitutively phosphorylated and was reduced upon stimulation with TNFα and LPS. The residual phosphorylation of endogenous MEKK3 detected by the phospho-specific Thr294 antibody could be cross-reactivity to nonphosphorylated MEKK3, which is supported by the CIP experiment shown in Fig. 5. If this is the case, then the actual decrease in Thr294 phosphorylation of endogenous MEKK3 could be higher than our analysis suggests, in agreement with the observation that 14-3-3 binding is entirely lost upon LPS stimulation. Alternatively, reduced Thr294 phosphorylation could be sufficient to disengage 14-3-3 from endogenous MEKK3. Importantly, phosphopeptides mimicking Thr(P)294 competed with endogenous MEKK3 for endogenous 14-3-3 interaction. We found that in cells overexpressing MEKK3, Ser526 phosphorylation was similar between WT MEKK3 and T294A MEKK3. However, when we excluded okadaic acid from the solubilization buffer, we noticed that WT and T294A MEKK3 experienced a significant reduction of Ser526 phosphorylation. These observations are consistent with the recent report that Ser526 is sensitive to PP1/2A phosphatase activity in cells (15Fritz A. Brayer K.J. McCormick N. Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Vaillancourt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6236-6245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, in our experiments we could not discriminate a difference between WT and T294A MEKK3 in the sensitivity to dephosphorylation at Ser526. Interestingly, when we monitored Ser526 phosphorylation of endogenous MEKK3, we noted a small increase in Ser526 phosphorylation following stimulation with LPS, which was consistent with the work of Zhang et al. (16Zhang D. Facchinetti V. Wang X. Huang Q. Qin J. Su B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), who initially described the identity of this site. Thus, our work is in agreement with previous evidence that Ser526 phosphorylation increases upon LPS stimulation, and this increase parallels the drop in Thr294 phosphorylation and the loss of 14-3-3 binding. This suggests that dephosphorylation of MEKK3 at Thr294 and the subsequent loss of 14-3-3 binding might contribute to agonist-induced phosphorylation of Ser526 and could be one mechanism that might account for our observation that T294A MEKK3 stimulated more TNFα-induced NF-κB activity compared with WT MEKK3. The closely related MEKK2 protein kinase shares significant homology to MEKK3 but might have distinct signaling functions and may participate in the sustained activation of NF-κB by regulating the activation of IKK and degradation of IκBβ (2Schmidt C. Peng B. Li Z. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Niu J. Schmidt-Supprian M. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. Chiao P.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1287-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). MEKK2 is highly homologous to MEKK3 in amino acid sequence surrounding the equivalent site of Thr294, suggesting that MEKK2 might associate with 14-3-3 at Thr283, although this still needs to be demonstrated. Significantly, the sequence surrounding Thr283/Thr294 is not present to any degree of homology with any other protein kinase, suggesting that the 14-3-3-binding motif at Thr283/Thr294 is novel and unique to the MEKK2/3 family. The discovery of this novel site and role in mediating MEKK3 activity provides an important clue in how the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα and the endotoxin LPS regulate signals to control inflammatory gene expression.

Furthermore, they indicate that features built into the CpG island are not sufficient to direct CpG island maintenance during differentiation. Actins are abundant structural proteins important in maintaining cell shape and motility (1Small J.V. Resch G.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic β-actin is a major component of microfilaments and is present in virtually all cell types except differentiated skeletal muscle (2Erba H.P. Eddy R. Shows T. Kedes L. Gunning P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1775-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The promoter of the single-copy β-actin gene is expressed in a wide range of cell types in culture and is transiently induced at the transcriptional level by exposure of quiescent cells to serum growth factors (3Elder P.K. French C.L. Subramaniam M. Schmidt L.J. Getz M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In common with many other widely expressed genes in mammalian cells, β-actin gene is associated with a CpG island positioned over the promoter and first intron of the gene (4Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar). DNA methylation at the C-5 position of cytosine is a major form of DNA modification in vertebrate animals (5Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (3022) Google Scholar). The majority of methylated cytosines are found in the palindromic dinucleotide, CpG (6Gruenbaum Y. Stein R. Cedar H. Razin A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 124: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This dinucleotide is underrepresented ∼5-fold in the genome because of the increased mutation rate of 5-methylcytosine by deamination. The majority, but not all, of the CpG dinucleotides in vertebrate DNA are methylated. CpG islands are clusters of the of CpG dinucleotides that have maintained their CpG content as they are kept free from methylation (7Antequera F. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). These islands remain free from methylation in the germ line and in somatic cells (8Brandeis M. Ariel M. Cedar H. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A small proportion of these islands do become methylated, including the island associated with genes of the inactive X chromosome and imprinted genes (9Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Genome-wide analysis of CpG islands by restriction landmark genomic scanning has demonstrated that tissue specific CpG island methylation is relatively frequent and that embryonic stem (ES) 3The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; UTR, untranslated region; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. cells have a propensity to methylate CpG islands (10Hattori N. Abe T. Hattori N. Suzuki M. Matsuyama T. Yoshida S. Li E. Shiota K. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1733-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). DNA methylation can induce transcriptional repression in a sequence-independent manner by promoting condensation of chromatin (11Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Methyl-DNA-binding proteins such as MeCP2 recruit histone deacetylases through interaction with mSin3A (12Klose R.J. Bird A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 89-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). Inappropriate methylation of a CpG island is likely to be associated with a change in the chromatin structure of the locus and resultant silencing of the gene. Tissue culture and cancer cells frequently show a genome-wide increase in CpG island methylation (13Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aberrant de novo methylation of growth regulatory genes has been associated with tumorigenesis in humans; however, very little is known about the mechanisms governing the increases of de novo methylation of CpG islands in cancer cells (14Robertson K.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3139-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Although much is known about CpG islands, the relationship between transcriptional activity and methylation status remains to be established. Studies of both the mouse and hamster Aprt genes indicate that the transcription factor Sp1 may play an important role in preventing methylation of CpG islands (15Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 16Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Mutation of the Sp1 sites in the promoters of these genes leads to methylation of the CpG island in vivo. It has been proposed that Sp1 itself may exert a localized demethylating effect on the surrounding DNA, and therefore binding of Sp1 alone would be sufficient to protect the DNA (17Mummaneni P. Yates P. Simpson J. Rose J. Turker M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5163-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Alternatively, active transcription induced by binding of Sp1 to the promoter protects the CpG island from methylation. Subsequently, however, it was demonstrated that when a mutation was made in the Sp1 gene in the mouse germ line, CpG islands were still protected and remained methylation-free in homozygous mutant embryos (18Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the maintenance of methylation status of CpG islands is unclear. For example, the CpG island spanning the second exon of the mouse H2-Ab1 gene, and located some distance away from the promoter, is associated with a separate intronic promoter active only in embryonic and germ cells (19Macleod D. Ali R.R. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4433-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together these studies suggest that embryonic transcription is required to define a CpG island and that this state is copied to differentiated cells by maintenance methylation. We now demonstrate that an insertion in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the β-actin gene interferes with the maintenance of the CpG island associated with this gene in differentiated cells without preventing its transcription in embryonic stem cells. This suggests that maintenance of a CpG island requires a signal that may be dependent on embryonic transcription but must be maintained in differentiated cells to prevent CpG island methylation. Hence the cellular memory of early embryonic transcription may require an epigenetic mark to ensure that it is maintained throughout development and in adult cells. Plasmids and Construction of Targeting Vectors for the β-Actin Locus—The β-actin genomic locus was cloned from a 129Sv/J mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library (20Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A 7.5-kb fragment, corresponding to the entire coding region of the β-actin gene, was subcloned to use as homology arms for the targeting vector. The Actbm1 targeting vector was generated by subcloning an IRES-βgeo cassette (20Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) into the actin 3′-UTR, 55 bp downstream of the translational stop codon. The Actbm2 targeting vector was cloned by inserting an IRES-loxP-Neo-Poly(A)-loxP-lacZ cassette into the same site. The Actbhyg and Actbpur targeting vectors were generated by cloning an IRES-hygromycin (Clontech) or IRES-puromycin (Clontech) cassette, respectively, into the same site in the 3′-UTR. Cre recombinase was expressed by transfecting cells with the plasmid pSP-PGK-Cre (21Selbert S. Bentley D.J. Melton D.W. Rannie D. Lourenco P. Watson C.J. Clarke A.R. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Further details of the cloning strategy are described in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” ES Cell Culture and Transfection—ES cells were cultured as described previously (22Wallace H. Ansell R. Clark J. McWhir J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Details of the electroporation and generation of the series of targeted actin alleles (Actbm1, Actbm2, Actbm3, Actbhyg, and Actbpur) are given in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” Generation of Targeted Mouse Lines—ES cell clones heterozygous for the targeted insertions were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeras carrying modified actin alleles. Further details of breeding and genotyping of targeted mouse lines are given in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” Differentiation of ES Cells in Vitro—ES cells were lightly trypsinized to give clumps of cells and were induced to differentiate by culturing them as aggregates in suspension in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor. After 6 days, the aggregates were outgrown on gelatinized tissue culture plates in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor for a further 6 days until the appearance of morphologically differentiated cells. Differentiation was confirmed by staining cells with alkaline phosphatase as described previously (23Pease S. Braghetta P. Gearing D. Grail D. Williams R.L. Dev. Biol. 1990; 141: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Cultures used for analysis contained >95% alkaline phosphatase-negative cells. lacZ Staining—β-Galactosidase activity was determined in situ in cells or embryos by staining with X-gal as described previously (22Wallace H. Ansell R. Clark J. McWhir J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DNA Analysis—Genomic DNA was prepared from ES cells and mouse tissues as described previously (24Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Selection of probes and conditions for blotting and PCR genotyping are elaborated in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” RNA Analysis—Generation of probes for the RNase protection assay and reverse transcription-PCR analysis is described in detail in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” RNA was extracted from ES cells and mouse tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. RNase protection assays were performed using MAXIscript and RPA II kits (Ambion). Digestion products were electrophoresed on 8 m urea, 8% acrylamide gels. The relative abundance of the products was determined by densitometry using a PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Insertion of βgeo Cassette in the β-Actin 3′-UTR—A 12-kb fragment containing the whole β-actin locus was subcloned and used to generate a gene targeting vector. An IRES-βgeo cassette was inserted in the 3′-UTR of the β-actin gene, 55 bp downstream of the stop codon but upstream of the polyadenylation signal (Fig. 1A). HM1 ES cells (25Magin T.M. McWhir J. Melton D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3795-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) were electroporated with linearized targeting vector, and G418-resistant clones were analyzed by Southern blotting. Targeted clones were identified using both 5′ and 3′ probes for the sequences flanking the insertion (Fig. 1, B and C). During the course of this article, we have described this allele as the modified actin locus (Actbm1), as it does not make any mutation in the promoter or coding region of the β-actin gene. Embryos Homozygous for the Actbm1 Insertion Die around Implantation, although Homozygous ES Cells Are Viable—Two ES cell clones carrying the Actbm1 locus gave rise to germ line chimeras. The heterozygous mice showed no obvious abnormality and were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. Following intercrossing of these heterozygous mice, no liveborn homozygous mice were identified, indicating that the insertion of the lacZ gene cassette into the 3′-UTR of the actin gene resulted in prenatal lethality (Table 1). This result was unexpected, as the construct does not disrupt the coding sequence of the β-actin gene.TABLE 1Genotypes of newborn and embryonic mice from Actbm1 heterozygous crosses Homozygous Actbm1 mice are present at normal Mendelian ratios at the blastocyst stage but are absent by day 8.5 of gestation. This implies that homozygous embryos die around the time of implantation.StageLittersWild typeHeterozygousHomozygousResorbedPostnatal1024460Days 12.5–15.510203609Days 8.5–10.58163401Blastocyst8122810 Open table in a new tab To determine the timing of the embryonic lethality of the homozygous Actbm1 mice, timed matings were established. Genotyping of embryos from day 8.5 to 15.5 of gestation indicated that no homozygote Actbm1 embryos were detected among the 53 live embryos screened, and genotyping of blastocysts revealed that homozygote Actbm1 embryos were present at the expected frequency (Table 1). These results indicate that homozygote Actbm1 embryos died around the time of implantation. The lethality associated with the modified Actbm1 allele may have been caused by a lower amount of actin protein produced from the modified allele. To allow us to address this possibility, ES cells homozygous for the Actbm1 allele were generated. We pursued two strategies to achieve these homozygous cells. The first strategy involved sequential modification of the β-actin locus (Fig. 1A). HM1 cells were targeted with a second targeting vector in which loxP sites flanked the neo gene, an allele termed Actbm2. After removal of the neo gene by transient transfection of Cre recombinase, the second allele was then targeted by electroporating Actbm3 cells with the Actbm1 construct and selecting on G418 to generate Actbm1/Actbm3 cells with both β-actin alleles modified. Correctly targeted homozygous ES clones were identified by Southern blotting (Fig. 1, B and C). The second strategy involved insertion of IRES-puromycin or IRES-hygromycin resistance genes into the second allele (data not shown). All of the homozygous cell lines behaved similarly, and in each case the undifferentiated ES cells grew normally and at the same rate as wild-type cells. This indicates that sufficient β-actin protein was produced from the modified allele to allow the cells to grow normally. This suggests that, at least in vitro, the reduced β-actin levels are compatible with normal cell growth. When homozygous the ES cells were differentiated by withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor, they were able to differentiate as extensively as wild-type cells and give rise a similar range of cell types but grew more slowly upon induction of differentiation. This suggests that the modified allele has an effect on the ES cell growth but only after the onset of differentiation. Patchy Expression of lacZ Is Seen in Differentiated ES Cells and Adult Mice—Expression of the modified locus was assayed by lacZ staining in both Actbm1 ES cells and mouse embryos. In Actbm1 ES cells the expression of the β-galactosidase is widespread in undifferentiated cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Although there appears to be some variation in the level, all of the undifferentiated cells express the lacZ gene. In contrast, following differentiation of the cells in vitro lacZ expression in the cells becomes very patchy and was detected in only a small fraction of the differentiated cells (Fig. 2C). A similar phenomenon was observed when the cells differentiate in vivo. Widespread lacZ activity was seen in whole mount embryos and tissues examined from newborn mice (Fig. 2, D and E), and lacZ expression subsequently became progressively restricted to certain tissues as the mice aged; even in tissues showing continued expression of the lacZ gene the expression was patchy (Fig. 2, F and G, and supplemental Table S1). The expression profile of the transgene correlates well with the expression profile described for the endogenous gene (2Erba H.P. Eddy R. Shows T. Kedes L. Gunning P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1775-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the level of transgene expression does not vary significantly between different Actbm1 lines or between heterozygous littermates within a transgenic line. There is no substantial difference either in the level of lacZ expression in the tissues of a mouse at age 3 months and an 11-month-old mouse (data not shown). This implies that once a tissue has reached maturity, there is no further alteration of expression of the modified allele. Methylation of Targeted β-Actin CpG Island Correlates with Patchy Expression in Mice—The β-actin gene promoter is associated with a CpG island, which normally remains unmethylated in all tissues. In order to test whether aberrant methylation of the CpG island is involved in the silencing of the modified allele, Southern blot analysis of DNA isolated from mouse tissues was performed. Genomic DNA was restricted with EcoRV and either the methylation-sensitive enzyme HpaII or its methylation-insensitive isoschizomer, MspI, and probed with the 1.5-kb region of the actin locus including the promoter, first exon, and first intron of the actin gene (Fig. 3A). This probe spans the entire CpG island at the 5′-end of the actin gene. Methylation of the 5′-CpG island was apparent in all tissues analyzed from the heterozygous Actbm1 mouse, but no methylation was detected in DNA from tissues of wild-type mice (Fig. 3B). Although both the brain and small intestine still contained a significant percentage of cells expressing lacZ, methylation of the β-actin CpG island was still detectable in these tissues (Fig. 3B). In addition there was no firm correlation between the degree of methylation of the β-actin CpG island and the expression level of lacZ in a tissue (Fig. 3B and supplemental Table S1). The appearance of methylation does correlate with patchy expression of modified allele as judged by lacZ staining in tissues from adult mice. This result was confirmed by analyzing genomic DNA by a PCR assay (Fig. 3C). Additionally the PCR assay was used to demonstrate the presence of methylation at the CpG island in heterozygous embryos. By analysis of DNA from embryos at 9.5 days post-coitus, we detected CpG island methylation indicating a correlation between methylation status and survival of the embryo. Therefore, it is possible that silencing of the modified allele CpG island may underlie embryonic lethality of the Actbm1 homozygotes. Methylation Is Restricted to the Modified Allele—To determine whether aberrant methylation affected both wild-type and Actbm1 alleles or was confined to the modified allele, a Southern blot was performed using BamHI, which generated a polymorphism between the modified and endogenous allele (Fig. 4A). When this enzyme is used in combination with a CpG methylation-sensitive enzyme such as XhoI or SacII, only the 4-kb band corresponding to the modified allele remains (Fig. 4B). Hence only the Actbm1 allele becomes methylated whereas the endogenous allele remains free of methylation. This result makes it less likely that the Actbm1 allele RNA is involved in promoter silencing. As the modified allele expresses coding sequences for β-actin as well as lacZ, any sequence-specific silencing based on the RNA may target both the modified allele and the endogenous allele simultaneously. There is no apparent effect on either the methylation of the CpG island or the transcription of the endogenous RNA in the heterozygous cell lines. In addition, no methylation could be detected in CpG islands neighboring the Actb locus (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Methylation Is Detectable in ES Cells Only after Differentiation—As undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and early embryos still showed widespread expression of β-galactosidase, the methylation status of the CpG island was analyzed in targeted embryonic stem cells. No methylation of the CpG island was detected in wild-type or Actbm1 undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (Fig. 5A), correlating with the widespread lacZ expression seen in these cells (Fig. 2B). The modified β-actin allele CpG island in undifferentiated ES cells remained unmethylated despite prolonged culture without selection. Undifferentiated cells were kept growing continuously without selection for 8 weeks before analysis. However, following differentiation of ES cells in vitro, methylation of the CpG island was detectable (Fig. 5B). This correlates with the appearance of morphologically differentiated cells and with the onset of patchy expression (Fig. 2C). In contrast the undifferentiated cells remained unmethylated even after prolonged growth in culture. Both heterozygous and homozygous cells showed similar changes in methylation (Fig. 5B). Hence the results obtained from analysis of differentiating ES cells in vitro parallels those obtained from mouse tissues in vivo, because the β-actin CpG island starts to become methylated upon differentiation and this correlates with the appearance of silencing of expression. Cell lines targeted with hygromycin or puromycin also showed methylation following differentiation of ES cells in vitro (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the silencing was not caused by specific sequences in the lacZ or neo genes. Hence it is likely that it is the location of the insertion rather than the sequence of the inserted DNA that is most significant in contributing to the silencing of the modified allele. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that inserting the same sequences adjacent to CpG islands elsewhere in the genome does not result in methylation. 4D. Strathdee, unpublished data. We note that because all our insertions used bacterially derived transgenes, their base composition may have influenced methylation propensity. RNA Levels for the Targeted Allele Are Reduced—As active transcription has been hypothesized to help maintain CpG islands free from methylation (19Macleod D. Ali R.R. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4433-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the levels of RNA for the endogenous and targeted alleles were analyzed by a ribonuclease protection assay. This allowed the RNA levels for the two alleles to be distinguished by using allele-specific probes (Fig. 6A). The RNA corresponding to the modified allele is easily detectable in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (Fig. 6B). The level of steady state RNA from the Actbm1 allele was reduced to 17% of the level of the endogenous gene when calculated by densitometry. Differences in the relative RNA levels were identical using a probe corresponding to either the endogenous allele or the transgene (Fig. 6, B and C). Analysis of the transcription rate by run-on analysis showed no differences among wild-type, heterozygote, and homozygote ES cells (supplemental Fig. S2). This implies that the reduction of the RNA is more likely because of an alteration in RNA stability than a change of the transcription rate. The RNA level was subsequently further reduced upon differentiation of the ES in vitro to ∼1.5% of the endogenous gene. A similar reduction was also apparent in RNA isolated from tissues from adult mice (Fig. 6B). In undifferentiated ES cells, even though the RNA level of the modified allele was reduced in comparison with the unmodified allele, it remained robustly expressed. When cells differentiate, the RNA level is further down-regulated, which correlates with the onset of patchy expression and the appearance of methylation at the promoter CpG island. This occurs in both ES cells differentiated in vitro and differentiated cells in the tissues of transgenic mice. In contrast, the mRNA levels for genes surrounding the Actb locus are similar in both wild-type and homozygous targeted embryonic stem cells (supplemental Fig. S1C). Analysis of the five different modified alleles (Actbm1, Actbm2, Actbm3, Actbhyg, and Actbpur) demonstrated that although there is a slight variation between the individual clones of cells, they all show a reduction to 15–30% of the level of the endogenous gene (Fig. 6C). When measured by densitometry the increase in the modified allele expression in the homozygote cell lines was approximately double the level of a single copy of the gene. Taken together, these data indicate that all modified β-actin alleles have reduced mRNA levels but remain expressed prior to differentiation. β-Actin is found in virtually all cell types (2Erba H.P. Eddy R. Shows T. Kedes L. Gunning P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1775-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Ng S.Y. Gunning P. Eddy R. Ponte P. Leavitt J. Shows T. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2720-2732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Building on this broad expression profile, the β-actin locus was identified as a potential permissive site for marker gene expression (27Shmerling D. Danzer C.P. Mao X. Boisclair J. Haffner M. Lemaistre M. Schuler V. Kaeslin E. Korn R. Burki K. Ledermann B. Kinzel B. Muller M. Genesis. 2005; 42: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, our data indicate that transgene insertion into the 3′-UTR of the β-actin gene results in embryonic lethality in mice homozygous for the insertion. This phenotype is similar to targeted mutations that disrupt the actin gene (27Shmerling D. Danzer C.P. Mao X. Boisclair J. Haffner M. Lemaistre M. Schuler V. Kaeslin E. Korn R. Burki K. Ledermann B. Kinzel B. Muller M. Genesis. 2005; 42: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Shawlot W. Deng J.M. Fohn L.E. Behringer R.R. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is not clear what causes the lethality (possibly a reduction of actin protein or silencing of the actin gene upon differentiation). No effects were observed from genes neighboring the Actb locus (supplemental Fig. S1). During early embryogenesis, global methylation patterns are erased, and a wave of de novo methylation follows around implantation (29Morgan H.D. Santos F. Green K. Dean W. Reik W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R47-R58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). The timing of the inactivation of the modified β-actin CpG island appears to correlate with this wave of de novo methylation. This raises the possibility that silencing of the modified allele rather than the modification itself is responsible for lethality. This conclusion is also supported by the fact that homozygously modified β-actin ES cells are viable and grow normally. It remains possible, however, that ES cells and early embryonic tissues have different requirements for β-actin protein and that the reduction in levels of actin is responsible for the lethality or that lethality results from a combination of low actin levels and silencing. Silencing of the modified β-actin allele is associated with methylation of the CpG island encompassing the β-actin promoter. However triggered, methylation of the promoter occurred even though the transgene insertion was in the 3′-UTR and hence distal to the promoter. This indicates that maintenance of CpG island methylation status in differentiated cells is not governed autonomously by features built into the island itself. It is widely accepted that CpG islands are normally kept free from methylation in differentiated cells in the absence of transcription (30Cross S.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 31Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5448) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that CpG islands are often associated with promoters that are active in early embryonic cells (19Macleod D. Ali R.R. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4433-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The β-actin gene normally follows these rules, but the modified allele does not. The modified β-actin allele is actively expressed and remains unmethylated in embryonic cells, although mouse ES cells have high levels of de novo methylation (32Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is switched off upon differentiation, resulting in patchy expression in differentiated ES cells and mouse tissues, which correlates with the onset of methylation of the modified β-actin locus. This implies that the CpG island of the modified β-actin allele is recognized as normal in the undifferentiated cells, but its methylation-free status is not maintained in differentiated cells. These observations are compatible with a two-phase definition of a CpG island, an initial establishment phase in early embryonic cells followed by a maintenance phase in differentiated cells. From our modified β-actin data, we propose that these two stages are separable and independent and that there must be a persistent signal, which normally maintains CpG islands free from methylation in differentiated cells. In this scenario, embryonic transcription of the wild-type β-actin allele results in the production of a signal that identifies the promoter as a CpG island and prevents methylation from occurring in differentiated cells. Following modification of the gene, the promoter continues to function appropriately in ES cells, but the signal defining the CpG island is disrupted. Following differentiation the CpG island is now susceptible to mechanisms inducing gene silencing, as the protective signal has been lost. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that CpG islands become specifically demethylated in embryonal carcinoma cells, whereas differentiated cells such as fibroblasts do not demethylate these sequences or methylate CpG islands with inactive promoters (33Frank D. Keshet I. Shani M. Levine A. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1991; 351: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, inactive CpG island promoters remain hypomethylated in human primary fibroblasts and have higher levels of H3K4 dimethylation even in the absence of transcription, implying that chromatin structure has a role in maintaining CpG islands methylation-free (34Weber M. Hellmann I. Stadler M.B. Ramos L. Paabo S. Rebhan M. Schubeler D. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). We have not identified the mechanism of methylation in this study, but the trigger must be the presence of the transgene within the 3′-UTR. Although transgene silencing is a well described phenomenon, effects of gene targeting on endogenous gene promoters are less well characterized. Because we found methylation regardless of whether we inserted βgeo, puromycin, or hygromycin gene, the sequence inserted was not the stimulus for methylation; rather, it was where the transgene was inserted into the β-actin gene that triggered methylation. Inserting the same construct into other genes, such as Hras1, does not result in methylation of the endogenous allele CpG island.4 Once triggered, methylation of the promoter occurred even through the transgene insertion was in the 3′-UTR. Furthermore methylation occurred only after differentiation of ES cells in vitro and the embryo in vivo. We cannot exclude the possibility of RNA-mediated events; however, we consider this unlikely, as methylation did not occur in undifferentiated ES cells and only the modified allele was silenced with the endogenous allele remaining unaffected. Instead we favor a spreading methylation process (18Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), presumably nucleated from the transgene inserted into the 3′-UTR. It has been demonstrated that methylation can spread from B1 repetitive sequences into a CpG island of the Aprt gene (35Mummaneni P. Walker K.A. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 788-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36Yates P.A. Burman R.W. Mummaneni P. Krussel S. Turker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36357-36361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the targeted insertion of a transgene into a gene, even though distant from the gene promoter, may affect the activity of the promoter. The lacZ gene is used widely as a marker for gene expression following gene targeting and gene trapping (37Stanford W.L. Cohn J.B. Cordes S.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 756-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These results suggest that even when the lacZ gene is targeted to a locus as a single copy, it can disrupt the endogenous promoter. Our data indicate that the same is true for puromycin and hygromycin genes. It follows that care must be taken when interpreting data obtained from inserted marker genes.

Although tyrosine kinase activation of EphA1 was dispensable, binding of EphA1 to fibronectin through its type I repeat played an essential role in the angiogenesis. Recombinant proteins containing fibronectin 10th to 12th type I repeat (I 10–12) but not I 12 could inhibit the angiogenesis in vitro by competitively targeting EphA1 with the full-length fibronectin. However, I 12 acquired a higher affinity toward EphA2 with Kd 18 nm and inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor-dependent angiogenic invasion in a Matrigel plug assay. ATF3 stimulated promoter activity of EphA1 by 3.4-fold in ATF3-dependent angiogenesis in vitro. Although tyrosine kinase activation of EphA1 was dispensable, binding of EphA1 to fibronectin through its type I repeat played an essential role in the angiogenesis.

However, I 12 acquired a higher affinity toward EphA2 with Kd 18 nm and inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor-dependent angiogenic invasion in a Matrigel plug assay. The Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family consists of 16 members and is subdivided into group A (EphA) and B (EphB). They have nine ligands called ephrins that are also classified into A (ephrin-A) and B (ephrin-B) (1Cheng N. Brantley D.M. Chen J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 2Zhou R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 151-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because ephrin-A is anchored in the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage and ephrin-B has membrane-spanning domains, the Eph/ephrin system provides complicated bidirectional signaling between adjacent cells that individually express at least one of the family members. Experimentally, tyrosine kinase activity of EphA is activated to transmit forward signals by exogenously applied soluble ephrin-A-Fc fusion proteins (extracellular domain fused to Fc portion of immunoglobulin), whereas reverse signals can be transmitted by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ephrin-A when activated by exogenous EphA-Fc fusion proteins.The Eph/ephrin system has been demonstrated to play essential roles in many biological circumstances, including neuronal pathfinding, boundary formation, and angiogenesis in development and tumor progression (1Cheng N. Brantley D.M. Chen J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 2Zhou R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 151-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although EphA1 is the founding member of the Eph family, its biological functions remain to be elucidated. EphA1 is physiologically expressed in epithelial tissues, and pathological overexpression has been reported in a variety of tumors, including carcinomas of lung, liver, and prostate (2Zhou R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 151-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Artificial overexpression in fibroblasts could be tumorigenic in nude mice. The closest homology is found in EphA2. Breast cancer progression is dependent on both EphA2 activation and ephrin-A1 expression in tumor cells (3Fang W.B. Brantley-Sieders D.M. Parker M.A. Reith A.D. Chen J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Ephrin-A1 activates EphA2 that is also abundantly expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells, which eventually facilitates metastasis (4Brantley-Sieders D.M. Fang W.B. Hwang Y. Hicks D. Chen J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10315-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). All of this information suggests possible involvement of EphA1 in cancer.Cellular functions of Eph/ephrin include a proper balance between repulsion from and adhesion to other cells as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; DXR, doxorubicin hydrochloride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, short interfering RNA; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; Fn, fibronectin; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor. 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; DXR, doxorubicin hydrochloride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, short interfering RNA; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; Fn, fibronectin; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor. such as fibronectin by affecting integrin functions either positively or negatively, depending on different settings (5Miao H.

Fibronectin plays an essential role in cell adhesion and migration and is secreted as a soluble homodimeric protein of 250 kDa (plasma fibronectin) but forms insoluble fibrillar networks in ECM (cellular fibronectin). It is composed of three types of repeating modules, type I, II, and III. An angiogenic inhibitor anastellin is the first type III repeat sequence capable of binding to the amino-terminal type I repeat sequences (8Yi M. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Interestingly, genetic engineering studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and mice have shown that Eph has kinase-dependent and -independent functions (10George S.E.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 73-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For example, EphB3 catalytic activity is required for inhibition of integrin-mediated cell adhesion in colorectal epithelial cells. However, inhibition of directional cell migration is totally kinase-independent (12Miao H. Strebhardt K. Pasquale E.B. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Wang B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 923-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, both EphB6 and EphA10 appear to lack catalytic activity (13Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R.

We have recently shown endothelial tubulogenesis that depends on an ATF/CREB family transcription factor ATF3 (20Okamoto A. Iwamoto Y. Maru Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is an immediate early gene induced by a variety of stress signals in neither a tissue- nor stimulus-specific manner. Recent studies have demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide can activate p38, which in turn induces ATF3 (21Lu D. Chen J. Hai T. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Gilchrist M. Thorsson V. Li B. Rust A.G. Korb M. Kennedy K. Hai T. Bolouri H. Aderem A.

Biol. 2006; 26: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ATF3 forms a heterodimeric complex with another leucine zipper transcription factor AP-1 but not C/EBP family members. This enables activation of promoters that contain binding motifs for AP-1 but not ATF3 itself, as exemplified by the promoter for plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 we have shown previously (20Okamoto A. Iwamoto Y. Maru Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, ATF3 is induced by ischemia and hypoxic conditions that are frequently encountered by cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment (23Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J.

In this study, we show an ATF3-dependent expression of EphA1, which exerts a previously unrecognized function in tumor angiogenesis in a kinase-independent manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human EphA1 and all the Fc fusion proteins were purchased from R & D Systems; mouse mAb against glutathione S-transferase (GST), rabbit polyclonal antibody against EphA2 (C-20), ephrin-A1 (V-18), and ATF3 (H-90) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rat mAb against CD31 (MEC13.3) was from Pharmingen; rabbit polyclonal antibody against Fn was from LSL; mouse mAb against actin (mAb1501) was from Chemicon; pGEX-4T-1 and pGEX-5X-3, HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig, and HRP-conjugated protein A were from GE Healthcare; TRITC- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch; Matrigel™ Matrix was from BD Biosciences; human plasma fibronectin and cellular fibronectin were from Sigma; doxorubicin hydrochloride (DXR) was from Calbiochem.Protein Binding Assays on Microtiter Plates—Microtiter plates (Nunclon™; NUNC NS, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 60 mm of plasma fibronectin, cellular fibronectin, and recombinant fibronectin fragments (I 10–12, I 10–11, and I 12) in PBS and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The following steps were then performed at room temperature. The plates were washed with PBS and treated for 2 h with blocking buffer (4% bovine serum albumin in PBS). The plates were subsequently washed three times with PBS and incubated with various concentrations of Fc chimeras of EphA, EphB4, ephrin-A1, and ephrin-B2 diluted with PBS. The plates were again washed three times and then incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated protein A (1:1,000) in blocking buffer. After washing in PBS, the plates were allowed to react with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate reagent (BD Biosciences); color development was stopped by the addition of 1 n H2SO4. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined using a microplate reader. Competitive binding assay of Fn fragments and EphA1 to plasma Fn was performed as follows: microtiter plates coated with plasma fibronectin at 60 nm were washed with PBS, blocked with blocking buffer, and incubated EphA1-Fc (150 nm) with various concentrations of fibronectin fragments (234–7500 nm of I 10–12 and I 12) diluted with PBS.In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay in Matrigel—In vitro angiogenesis assay was performed as described previously (20Okamoto A. Iwamoto Y. Maru Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 3 × 104 per well onto Matrigel and then incubated with 1 μg/ml Fc chimeric proteins and 40 μm recombinant fibronectin fragments. Branching images were captured using an Olympus IX70 microscope and digital camera. Digital images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 J LE software. Quantification of the total length of cords in branching morphogenesis was performed using Scion Image software. Means of the results from six independent experiments were calculated.siRNA-mediated Knockdown Experiments—Based on rat EphA1 sequence, sense primer (5′-CCUGUGAGAAUGGACAUUATT-3′) and antisense primer (5′-UAAUGUCCAUUCUCACAGGTA-3′) were designed. Annealing reactions were performed with sense and antisense to give EphA1-specific siRNA duplexes, and with sense/sense as a control. We also used a nontargeting control siRNA against Nox1 that was previously shown to have no effect on the ATF3-dependent in vitro angiogenesis (20Okamoto A. Iwamoto Y. Maru Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 2 × 106 per well 24 h before transfection using TransIT-TKO (Mirus). After incubation for 24 h, cells were plated at 3 × 104 per well onto Matrigel.RNA Preparation and Southern Blotting—Total RNA was prepared from rat lung using ISOGEN (NIPPON GENE), following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were reverse-transcribed from 10 μg of rat lung total RNA using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR primers, 5′-CATGTACCAAGACTGCCCAA-3′ and 5′-CTGATCTGTGCATGGGAGAG-3′ were used to amplify the 254–775 region of rat EphA1 (GenBank™ accession number XM_231658), and PCR primers 5′-GTTTACCACCGAGATCCACC-3′ and 5′-AGCATTGCATCATGAGTTGG-3′ were used to amplify the 1505–1941 region of rat EphA2 (GenBank™ accession number XM_001072610) The specificity of the PCR-amplified products was further verified by Southern hybridization. Probe labeling, hybridization, and detection were performed by using ECL direct acid labeling and detection systems (GE healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions.Reporter Assay—PCR primers, 5′-GACTGTCTGCATAGCTCACACTG-3′ and 5′-CCAGGGGCCAGCGCCGCTCCAT-3′, were used to amplify the -1027 to +82 region of the rat EphA1 promoter (GenBank™ accession number NW_047690). The PCR product was subcloned into SmaI/HindIII sites of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) to generate pEphA1-Luc. The luciferase construct of the ephrin-A1 promoter was generated in a similar fashion with primers 5′-TGAGCCCAAGGGTCCTGTGAG-3′ and 5′-AAGCTCCGCAGTGTAAGGTTCC-3′. The PAI-1 promoter-luciferase fusion reporter construct pGL-3-PAI-1/full (-829 to +36) was described previously (20Okamoto A. Iwamoto Y. Maru Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). NP31/ATF3-Tet cells were seeded at 2 × 105 per well 24 h before ATF3 induction. In every case, 50 ng of pRL-SV40 (Promega) was added as an internal control. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection using DMRIE-C (Invitrogen), and luciferase activities were determined with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Means of the results from six independent experiments were calculated.Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as described previously (25Takeda N. Shibuya M. Maru Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).CHO Cell Culture and Transplantation—CHO cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For EphA1-Fc overexpresser constructs, the extracellular region (amino acids 1–1635, GenBank™ accession number NM_005232) and human IgG2 region (amino acids 1–696, GenBank™ accession number NM_001040070) were generated by PCR and cloned in-frame into the HindIII and XhoI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). CHO cells were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) and were cultured in 400 μg/ml of geneticin (Sigma). For transplantation experiments, 105 cells were suspended in 100 μl of PBS. The suspension was injected subcutaneously into mice using a 1-ml syringe and a 25-gauge needle. Tumors derived from these injected cells were surgically collected from the mice 14 days after implantation.Matrigel Plug Assay—Five- to 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were used. Matrigel was mixed with 100 ng/ml VEGF (Sigma). The Matrigel mixtures (500 μl) containing 16 μg/ml mock, EphA1-Fc, or I 12 were injected subcutaneously, and mice were sacrificed 7 days after transplantation, and the Matrigel plugs were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The plugs were either directly frozen for cryostat sections for anti-CD31 staining or embedded in paraffin for hematoxylin/eosin staining.Statistical Analysis and Analysis of the Binding Data—Data are expressed as means ± S.D. Comparisons between two groups were performed with the two-tailed, paired Student's t test and the Mann-Whitney U test. In all analyses, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The binding affinity constants were estimated following nonlinear regression analysis of the saturation curves using the software GraphPad Prism, version 4 (GraphPad Software).Purification of Recombinant Fibronectin Fragment Proteins— The fibronectin cDNAs 6280–7053 (I 10–12), 6280–6750 (I 10–11), and 6751–7053 (I 12) were cloned into pGEX-4T-1. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with a glutathione column. The purified GST fusion proteins were treated with thrombin to remove GST, dialyzed against PBS, and stored.RESULTSEphA1 Is Up-regulated in an ATF3-dependent Manner—We have established a biological system in which tetracycline-regulated expression of ATF3 in NP31 endothelial cells (NP31/ATF3-Tet) caused angiogenesis in vitro (20Okamoto A. Iwamoto Y. Maru Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Looking for ATF3-dependent angiogenesis-related proteins, we happened to find a 5-fold up-regulation of EphA1 (Fig. 1A) (26Hirai H. Maru Y. Hagiwara K. Nishida J. Takaku F. Science. 1987; 238: 1717-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). There was almost no change in expression levels of ephrin-A1 and EphA2 on which VEGF depends for angiogenesis (Fig. 1A) (18Cheng N. Brantley D.M. Liu H. Lin Q. Enriquez M. Gale N. Yancopoulos G. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Chen J. Mol. Cancer Res. 2002; 1: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Brantley-Sieders D.M. Fang W.B. Hicks D.J. Zhuang G. Shyr Y. Chen J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1884-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase (RT)-mediated PCR and subsequent Southern blot analysis revealed that EphA1 is up-regulated also at mRNA levels in an ATF3-dependent manner, whereas no change was observed in EphA2 (Fig. 1B). The putative rat EphA1 promoter region contains three AP-1 sites at -2501, -2079, and -1098 and five ATF3 sites at -3224, -3037, -1725, -1171, and -946 (supplemental Fig. 1). To confirm ATF3-dependent expression of the EphA1 gene, we performed promoter assays with 1109-bp genomic sequence of the EphA1 gene. We transfected reporter plasmids for EphA1 or PAI-I as a control in NP31/ATF3-Tet cells before and after induction of ATF3. The PAI-1 promoter, which also contains one AP-1 site at -157, was activated ∼4-fold as we reported previously (20Okamoto A. Iwamoto Y. Maru Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The EphA1 promoter was activated by 3.4-fold over the base line (Fig. 1C).To further ensure the promoter activity, we generated a set of promoter constructs, including ΔCREB with a subtle deletion of the -946 CREB site and large deletion mutants (supplemental Fig. 2). We also isolated 743-bp ephrin-A1 promoter region that contains a single AP-1 site at -288. Tetracycline withdrawal alone repeatedly induced ∼1.2- to ∼1.5-fold increase of luciferase activity in vector alone for unknown reasons. However, as shown in supplemental Fig. 2, a deletion of the -946 CREB site significantly reduced the promoter activity of EphA1. No significant increase in the ephrin-A1 promoter activity was found in this assay.EphA1 Is Required for in Vitro Angiogenesis—To investigate whether the Eph/ephrin system affects endothelial tubulogenesis that depends on ATF3, we performed in vitro angiogenesis assay with NP31/ATF3-Tet cells in the presence of recombinant Fc fusion proteins of the extracellular domain of Eph or anti-EphA1 siRNAs. Anti-EphA1 siRNA but not control RNAs efficiently knocked down EphA1 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The inhibition of ATF3-induced transactivation of EphA1 by the siRNA abrogated angiogenesis by roughly 70% at 80 nm as compared with control RNAs (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 3). Exogenously applied EphA1-Fc can bind ephrin-A1 that is endogenously expressed in cells to activate reverse signaling. However, ephrin-A1 occupied by EphA1-Fc can no longer bind endogenous EphA1 or EphA2 to exert forward signaling. Both EphA1-Fc and EphA2-Fc failed to inhibit angiogenesis, suggesting that none of their forward signaling is required (Fig. 2B). Although EphB4 and ephrin-B2 have also been shown to regulate angiogenesis (28Kertesz N. Krasnoperov V. Reddy R. Leshanski L. Kumar S.R. Zozulya S. Gill P.S. Blood. 2006; 107: 2330-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), Fc fusion proteins for either of these had almost no effect in our angiogenesis assay. These results suggest that the expression of EphA1 but not its forward signaling is required, underscoring the functional significance of the extracellular domain of EphA1. One such function is the EphA-to-ephrin-A1 signaling. Ephrin-A1-Fc can block the reverse signaling by occupying the endogenous EphA1 and EphA2. As shown in Fig. 2B, ephrin-A1-Fc inhibited the angiogenesis by 55%, which is seemingly consistent with the idea that the EphA1-to-ephrin-A1 reverse signaling may play a positive role in the angiogenesis. However, ephrin-A1-mediated reverse signaling could take place by the constantly expressed endogenous EphA2 even before ATF3-induced tubule formation. Therefore, EphA1-specific reverse ephrin-A1 signaling and/or a still unknown function of the extracellular domain of EphA1 might exist.FIGURE 2EphA1 is required for in vitro angiogenesis. A, total cell lysates from cells treated with anti-EphA1 siRNAs, including (sense/sense) SS at 40 nm (lane 1), (antisense/sense) AS at the indicated doses (lanes 2–4), or an irrelevant siRNA negative control (AS*, anti-Nox1 siRNAs, lane 5) (20Okamoto A. Iwamoto Y. Maru Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), were subjected to αEphA1 (upper panel) and α-actin (lower) Western blotting. Note a dose-dependent knockdown. B, in vitro angiogenesis assay in the presence of no treatment (mock), 1 μg/ml of the indicated Fc fusion proteins, or anti-EphA1 siRNAs at the indicated concentrations. Relative values to the mock were shown as mean ± S.D. from six independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Doxorubicin-induced ATF3 Activation Causes Endothelial Tubulogenesis—To show the involvement of ATF3 in angiogenesis in more physiological conditions, we treated the nontubulogenic endothelial cell line NP31 (29Maru Y. Yamaguchi S. Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with doxorubicin. Doxorubicin has been reported to induce ATF3 expression in MCF7 breast cancer cells (30Mallory J.C. Crudden G. Oliva A. Saunders C. Stromberg A. Craven R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). NP31 cells tolerated doxorubicin at a 62 nm to 1 μm concentration in the usual tissue culture conditions, and ATF3 activation was similarly observed at those doses, which was concomitant with increased expression of EphA1 (Fig. 3A). Although NP31 cells were unable to survive in Matrigel against 500 nm to 1 μm of doxorubicin, we could repeatedly observe the cells without apoptosis at 125 nm for 16–48 h. Although the level of cord formation was ∼25 to ∼30% of that in ATF3-induced tubulogenesis as reported previously (20Okamoto A. Iwamoto Y. Maru Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), ATF3-mediated expression of EphA1 by doxorubicin induced tubulogenesis appreciably (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Doxorubicin induces EphA1 expression. A, whole cell lysates from NP31 endothelial cells that were incubated with DXR at 1 μm for the indicated time (in hours) were subjected to anti-EphA1, anti-ATF3, and anti-actin Western blotting. B, quantification of NP31 endothelial tubulogenesis by DXR at 125 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fibronectin Type I Repeat Protein Binds EphA1—This prompted us to search for proteins capable of interacting with the extracellular domain. A bait designed to encode the extracellular domain was used to screen a human placenta yeast two-hybrid library (25Takeda N. Shibuya M. Maru Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found four independent clones that encode overlapping carboxyl-terminal fibronectin fragments. The shortest contained amino acids 2094–2351 including type I repeat numbers 10–12 (I 10–12) (Fig. 4A). Because the yeast two-hybrid system also gave a positive signal for binding of the bait to the amino-terminal I 3–5 but not III 14–15 or the spacing sequence between III-15 and I-10 (Fig. 4, A and B), we have decided to focus on I 10–12 in the subsequent experiments.FIGURE 4EphA1 binds fibronectin fragments. A, schematic structure of the full-length fibronectin. Note that I 3–5 is amino acids 225–360; III 14–15 is amino acids 1906–2073; spacer is amino acids 2082–2238; and I 10–12 is amino acids 2241–2421 (GenBank™ accession number NM_212475). B, yeast two-hybrid assay to test binding of prey (-, vector alone) and bait (E, extracellular domain of EphA1; B, BCR fragment (25Takeda N. Shibuya M. Maru Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A direct examination by enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assay revealed that the full-length fibronectin (Fn) was capable of binding to EphA1-Fc and surprisingly to ephrin-A1-Fc as well (Fig. 5A). We could repeatedly observe the binding of fibronectin to Fc alone. The binding affinity is low but appreciable with Kd 137 and 263 nm with plasma and cellular fibronectin, respectively, for EphA1-Fc.FIGURE 5Fibronectin type I repeat proteins bind EphA1. A, B, and D, increasing concentrations of EphA1-Fc, ephrin-A1-Fc, or Fc alone (150–1200 nm) were incubated with full-length plasma fibronectin (pFn) (A), cellular fibronectin (cFn) (B), or I 10–12-coated (60 nm) microtiter wells. C, Coomassie staining of the E. coli-expressed and purified recombinant type I repeat proteins, 2 μg each. E and F, binding of I 10–11 (E) or I 12 (F) to the indicated series of EphA (1 to 8)-Fc, EphB4-Fc, ephrin-B2-Fc, and ephrin-A1-Fc. Increasing concentrations of Fc fusion proteins or Fc alone (2.34–150 nm) were incubated with I 10–11-coated (60 nm) microtiter wells. Bound Fc fusion proteins were detected by incubation with HRP-conjugated protein A. Binding ability was found in only EphA1-Fc, EphA2-Fc, and EphA8-Fc but not in EphA(3 to 7)-Fc, EphB4-Fc, ephrin-A1-Fc, ephrin-B2-Fc, and Fc alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then expressed I 10–12, I 10–11, and I 12 in the form of GST fusion proteins in E. coli and purified them by removing GST by protease-mediated cleavage (Fig. 5C). Purified I 10–12 showed a decreased affinity toward EphA1 with Kd 417 nm, but it totally lost its ability to bind ephrin-A1 or Fc alone (Fig. 5D). To our surprise, both I 12 and I 10–11 showed a drastic enhancement of its affinity toward EphA1-Fc (Kd ∼96 and ∼80 nm, respectively) (Fig. 5, E and F). When a series of EphA (2–8)-Fc, EphB4-Fc, and ephrin-B2-Fc were included in the assays, the highest affinities were found with EphA2-Fc (Kd ∼ 18 and ∼19 nm, respectively). Although EphA8-Fc also showed appreciable affinities, the rest o"
