https://openalex.org/W1563821664,"Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) play a key role in inflammatory processes through production of precursors of eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor. Recently, we described the purification of a novel approximately 100-kDa cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) from human monoblast U937 cells that is activated by physiological (intracellular) concentrations of Ca2+ (Kramer, R. M., Roberts, E. F., Manetta, J., and Putnam, J. E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5268-5272). Here we report the isolation of the complementary DNA encoding human cPLA2 and confirm its identity by expression in bacteria and in hamster cells. The predicted 749-amino acid cPLA2 protein has no similarity to the well known secretory PLA2s, but contains a structural element homologous to the C2 region of protein kinase C. The molecular cloning of cPLA2 will allow further studies defining the structure, function, and regulation of this novel PLA2."
https://openalex.org/W1549235322,"Fibronectin contains at least two major domains that support cell adhesion. One is the central cell-binding domain that is recognized by a variety of cell types via the integrin alpha 5 beta 1. The second, originally identified by its ability to support melanoma cell adhesion, is located in the alternatively spliced type III connecting segment (IIICS). A dominant cell type-specific adhesion site within the IIICS has been localized to a peptide designated as CS1 comprising its amino-terminal 25 residues. The receptor for CS1 is the integrin alpha 4 beta 1. We have synthesized a variety of peptides with overlapping sequences in order to identify the minimum active amino acid sequence of this major cell adhesion site. A peptide comprising the carboxyl-terminal 8 amino acids of CS1, EILDVPST, was found to support melanoma cell spreading, while all peptides without this sequence had little or no activity. Two smaller overlapping pentapeptides, EILDV and LDVPS, were also active, whereas EILEV, containing a conservative substitution of Glu for Asp, was inactive. These data suggested that the minimum sequence for cell adhesion activity is Leu-Asp-Val, the tripeptide sequence common to both active peptides. This prediction was confirmed by the observed ability of the Leu-Asp-Val peptide itself to block spreading on fibronectin, whereas Leu-Glu-Val was inactive. Interspecies amino acid sequence comparison also supports the importance of the LDV sequence, since it is completely conserved in the IIICS regions of human, rat, bovine, and avian fibronectins."
https://openalex.org/W1528193286,"Abstract The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) specifically phosphorylates the agonist-occupied form of the beta-adrenergic and related G protein-coupled receptors. Structural features of this enzyme have been elucidated recently by the isolation of a cDNA that encodes bovine beta ARK. Utilizing a catalytic domain fragment of the beta ARK cDNA to screen a bovine brain cDNA library we have isolated a clone encoding a beta ARK-related enzyme which we have termed beta ARK2. Overall, this enzyme has 85% amino acid identity with beta ARK, with the protein kinase catalytic domain having 95% identity. The ability of beta ARK2 to phosphorylate various substrates was studied after expression in COS 7 cells. Although beta ARK2 is essentially equiactive with beta ARK in phosphorylating an acid-rich synthetic model peptide it was only approximately 50% as active when the substrate was the agonist-occupied beta 2-adrenergic receptor and only approximately 20% as active toward light-bleached rhodopsin. As with beta ARK, phosphorylation of the receptor substrates by beta ARK2 was completely stimulus dependent. RNA blot analysis with selected bovine tissues reveals an mRNA of 8 kilobases with a distribution similar to that of beta ARK. More detailed RNA analysis using a ribonuclease protection assay in various rat tissues suggests that the beta ARK2 message is present at much lower levels (typically 10-20%) than the beta ARK message. In the rat the beta ARK2 mRNA is localized predominantly in neuronal tissues although low levels are also observed in various peripheral tissues. The beta ARK2 gene has been localized to a region of mouse chromosome 5 whereas the beta ARK gene is localized on mouse chromosome 19. These data suggest the existence of a family of receptor kinases which may serve broadly to regulate receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1574445997,"It is demonstrated that the perhydroxyl radical (HOO., the conjugate acid of superoxide (O2-], initiates fatty acid peroxidation (a model for biological lipid peroxidation) by two parallel pathways: fatty acid hydroperoxide (LOOH)-independent and LOOH-dependent. Previous workers (Gebicki, J. M., and Bielski, B. H. J. (1981) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103, 7020-7025) demonstrated that HOO., generated by pulse radiolysis, initiates peroxidation in ethanol/water fatty acid dispersions by abstraction of the bis-allylic hydrogen atom from a polyunsaturated fatty acid. Addition of O2 to the fatty acid radicals forms peroxyl radicals (LOO.s), the chain-propagating species of lipid peroxidation. In this work it is demonstrated that HOO., generated either chemically (KO2) or enzymatically (xanthine oxidase), is a good initiator of fatty acid peroxidation in linoleic acid ethanol/water dispersions; O2- serves only as the source of HOO., and HOO. initiation can be observed at physiologically relevant pH values. In contrast to the previous results, the initiating effectiveness of HOO. is related directly to the initial concentrations of LOOHs in the lipids to be peroxidized. This defines a LOOH-dependent mechanism for fatty acid peroxidation initiation by HOO., which parallels the previously established LOOH-independent pathway. Since the LOOH-dependent pathway is much more facile than the LOOH-independent pathway, LOOH is the kinetically preferred site of HOO. attack in these systems. Experiments comparing HOO./LOOH-dependent fatty acid peroxidation with transition metal- and peroxyl radical-initiated peroxidation rule out the participation of the latter two species as initiators, which defines the HOO./LOOH initiation system as mechanistically unique. LOOH product studies are consistent with either a direct or indirect hydrogen atom transfer between LOOH and HOO. to yield LOO.s, which propagate peroxidation. The LOOH-dependent pathway of HOO.-initiated fatty acid peroxidation may be relevant to mechanisms of lipid peroxidation initiation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1559065150,"Erythropoietin mediates the rapid phosphorylation of Raf-1 in the murine cell lines HCD-57 and FDC-P1/ER, which proliferate in response to this cytokine. Phosphorylation occurs at both serine and tyrosine residues and as such is similar to the Raf-1 phosphorylation seen after interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-2 stimulation in other murine cell lines. Such data suggest that these growth factors may share a common mechanism(s) of Raf-1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, in association with Raf-1 phosphorylation, erythropoietin induces a 2-3-fold increase in Raf-1 kinase activity as measured in immune complex kinase assays in vitro. Finally, a c-raf antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide, which specifically decreases intracellular Raf-1 levels, also substantially inhibits both erythropoietin and IL-3-directed DNA synthesis. Together, these results provide evidence that activated Raf-1 is a necessary component of erythropoietin and IL-3 growth signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1671377823,"Photosynthetic reaction center protein D1 contains five membrane-spanning alpha-helices which form binding sites for pheophytin, chlorophyll, carotenoids, quinone, Fe2+, and probably Mn2+. D1 translation intermediates of 15 to 28 kD were detected when isolated chloroplasts were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine. The D1 translation intermediates were associated with membrane polysomes and can be chased into full length D1. The sites of translation pausing were determined by mapping the distribution of ribosomes on D1 mRNA using toeprint analysis. Clusters of toeprint signals were generated by D1 mRNA associated with membranes but not by D1 mRNA in nonpolysomal fractions of the soluble phase or phenol-extracted mRNA. The distribution of ribosomes on D1 mRNA determined by toeprint analysis was consistent with D1 translation intermediates observed with pulse-labeling. Ribosome pausing may facilitate co-translational binding of co-factors such as chlorophyll to D1 and aid the integration of D1 into thylakoid membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1512397531,"Variations in base mono- and dipoles result in variations in stacking energies for the 10 unique neighbor pairs in DNA. Stacking energies for pair M on N, expressed as TMN, were derived by matrix decomposition of a large set of linear algebraic expressions relating the measured Tm for subtransitions emanating from large polymeric DNAs, and the fractional neighbor frequencies, fMN, for the domains responsible for the transitions, Tm = sigma fMNTMN. Tm were determined for subtransitions that dissociate in approximately all-or-none fashion in high resolution melting profiles of partially deleted and recombinant forms of pBR322 DNA. Three different analytical maneuvers were undertaken to resolve subtransitions: site-specific cleavage of domains; deletion of domains; and addition of domains. Three dozen domains of widely divergent, quasi-random neighbor frequencies were identified and assigned, resulting in a unique set of values for TMN with standard deviation, sigma = +/- 0.23 degree C. The average difference between calculated and experimental Tm for domains is only +/- 0.17 degree C, indicating that the thermodynamic properties of these domains are not in any way unusual. Assuming delta S to be constant for all pairs, the corresponding delta HMN are found to have a precision of +/- 10 calories.mol-1 and an accuracy of +/- 606 calories.mol-1. TMN used to calculate melting curves by statistical mechanical analysis of sequences of the different plasmid specimens in this study were in quantitative agreement with observed curves for most sequences. These TMN differ significantly from those determined previously and also correlate poorly with values determined by quantum chemical analysis. Stabilities of neighbor pairs, expressed as the difference in free energy between that for a given pair (MN) and that for the average of like pairs (M, N), depend on the relationship of stacked purines and pyrimidines as follows. delta delta Gpu-py(-466 cal) greater than delta delta Gpu-pu(+52 cal) greater than delta delta Gpy-pu(+335 cal) Differences between experimental Tm and Tm calculated with TMN for the isolated neighbor pairs in the B-conformation are useful in the identification of altered structures and unusual modes of dissociation of helixes. A significantly higher Tm is observed for the highly biased repeated sequence synthetic helixes dA.dT, d(AGC).d(GCT), and d(GAT).d(ATC), reflecting auxiliary sources of stability such as bifurcated hydrogen bonds and/or altered structures for these helixes."
https://openalex.org/W2107820133,"The three-dimensional structure of wild-type CheY from Escherichia coli has been refined by stereochemically restrained least squares minimization to a crystallographic R-factor of 15.1% at 1.7-A resolution. The structure contains 1165 atoms, including all atoms of the protein, 147 water molecules, and three sulfate ions. The final model has root mean square deviations of 0.018 and 0.049 A from idealized bond lengths and angle distances, respectively. Seven amino acid side chains have been modeled in dual conformations. CheY folds as a compact (beta/alpha)5 globular protein, with the phosphorylation region contained in a cavity on one face of the molecule. This active site area is bordered by the carboxyl termini of the three central beta-strands, by alpha 1, and by the loop connecting beta 5 to alpha 5. The Lys-109 side chain of this loop extends into the active site by virtue of its cis peptide bond conformation preceding Pro-110. The epsilon-amino group of Lys-109 is in close bonding contact with the carboxyl group of Asp-57, the residue that is phosphorylated in the activation process of CheY. The details of the hydrogen bonding network in the phosphorylation region indicate that structural rearrangements must accompany the phosphorylation of Asp-57."

The gene encoding AC19 has been isolated from yeast genomic DNA using oligonucleotide probes deduced from peptide sequences of the isolated subunit. This gene (RPC19) contains an intron-free open reading frame of 143 amino acid residues. RPC19 is a single copy gene that maps on chromosome II and is essential for cell viability. The amino acid sequence contains a sequence motif common to the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase alpha subunit, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae AC40 and B44.5 subunits, the human hRPB33 product, and the CnjC conjugation-specific gene product of Tetrahymena.

https://openalex.org/W1573306131,"The paracrystalline surface protein array of the pathogenic bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida is a primary virulence factor with novel binding capabilities. The species-specific structural gene (vapA) for this array protein (A-protein) was cloned into lambda gt11 but was unstable when expressed in Escherichia coli, undergoing an 816-base pair deletion due to a 21-base pair direct repeat within the gene. However, the gene was stable in cosmid pLA2917 as long as expression was poor. A-protein was located in the cytoplasmic, inner membrane and periplasmic fractions in E. coli. The DNA sequence revealed a 1,506-base pair open reading frame encoding a protein consisting of a 21-amino acid signal peptide, and a 481-residue 50,778 molecular weight protein containing considerable secondary structure. When assembled into a paracrystalline protein array on Aeromonas the cell surface A-protein was totally refractile to cleavage by trypsin, but became trypsin sensitive when disassembled. Trypsin cleavage of the isolated protein provided evidence that both the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions form distinct structural domains, consistent with three-dimensional ultrastructural evidence. The NH2-terminal 274-residue domain remained refractile to trypsin activity. This segment connects by a trypsin and CNBr-sensitive 78-residue linker region to a COOH-terminal 129-residue fragment which could apparently refold into a partially trypsin-resistant structure after cleavage at residue 323."
https://openalex.org/W1520052348,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a major acute-phase protein synthesized and secreted mainly by the liver. During inflammation, its expression is increased by 1000-fold as the result of greatly increased gene transcription. In this study, we analyzed the cis-acting regulatory elements and trans-acting factors important for the expression of the rat SAA1 gene. A DNA fragment containing 304 base pairs (bp) of 5'-flanking sequences of the SAA1 gene was fused to a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), and the resulting construct, pSAA1/CAT (-304), was used to assess the function of the 5'-flanking sequences by transient transfection assay. pSAA1/CAT (-304) was not expressed or expressed at very low levels in both the liver- and nonliver-derived cells. However, when stimulated with conditioned medium prepared from mixed lymphocyte cultures, recombinant interleukin 1, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, expression of the pSAA1/CAT (-304) hybrid gene was induced 15-20-fold, but only in liver-derived cells. Further functional analysis demonstrated that a 66-bp DNA fragment conferred cytokine responsiveness onto a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter both in liver and nonliver cells. Footprint analysis with the Hep3B nuclear proteins revealed four protected regions in the 5'-flanking region of the SAA1 gene. The pattern of protection was identical with nuclear extracts prepared from either unstimulated or conditioned medium-treated Hep3B cells. Two of these footprint regions were identified as binding sites for C/EBP or C/EBP-related proteins, with the distal region having about 10-fold higher binding affinity than the proximal region. One additional cis-element formed a specific protein-DNA complex only with the nuclear proteins from TPA- or conditioned medium-treated Hep3B cells. This cis-element shares sequence identity with nuclear factor NF kappa B binding sites. The finding of a NF kappa B binding site within the 66-bp cytokine-responsive fragment further suggests its functional importance in the regulation of SAA1 gene expression. Our results suggest that C/EBP- and NF kappa B-related proteins may be important regulatory factors that contribute both to tissue specificity and to the high rate of SAA transcription in response to inflammatory mediators."
https://openalex.org/W1642470460,"To identify and characterize Schistosoma mansoni proteins that are recognized by infected hosts, we have used a pool of sera from infected humans to screen cDNA libraries constructed from poly(A)+ mRNA of adult S. mansoni. The deduced amino acid sequences of the three isolated clones showed a high degree of similarity to the large subunit of calcium-activated neutral proteinase (CANP) from humans and chicken. These overlapping clones, which include a nearly full-length clone with an open reading frame of 758 amino acid residues, together encode the entire large subunit of CANP. The deduced sequence of this S. mansoni protein can be divided into four domains (I-IV) that include the two domains characteristic of other large subunits of CANP: a thiol-protease domain (II) and a calcium-binding domain (IV) containing EF hand motifs. However, the schistosome protein is unique in having only three EF hand motifs in the calcium-binding domain and in having an additional EF hand motif that is shared between domains II and III. We have shown that these EF hand motifs are capable of binding 45Ca2+. Furthermore, the large subunit is S. mansoni contains an NH2-terminal sequence of 28 residues that is absent from the mammalian CANPs and has a high degree of similarity to the presumed receptor binding sequence of colicin Ia and Ib."
https://openalex.org/W1582816740,"Procathepsins L and D, the proenzyme forms of two proteases, are shown to bind to mouse fibroblast microsomal membranes at acidic pH. The propeptide of procathepsin L is necessary for membrane association because the mature forms of this protein did not bind to the membranes. Both proenzymes were eluted from the membranes by increasing either the pH or the ionic strength of the buffer, so they are peripheral proteins that interact ionically with the membranes. The proenzymes were not eluted from the membranes with 50 mM mannose or 10 mM mannose 6-phosphate, which suggests that carbohydrate does not mediate membrane binding. Membrane binding is probably a specific, protein-mediated interaction since treatment of the microsomes with trypsin reduced by half the amount of procathepsin L which bound to the membranes, and binding of procathepsin L to the membranes was saturable. One or more lysosomal proenzyme receptors capable of binding to proenzymes at acidic pH could complement the mannose 6-phosphate receptor system in prelysosomes and sort certain proenzymes to lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1482527712,"The noncollagenous (NC1) domain hexamer of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) collagen is composed of a multiplicity of monomeric and dimeric subunits, and specific subunits are the targets for anti-GBM autoantibodies of patients with Goodpasture (GP) syndrome. The identity of GBM monomers has been established and the alpha 3(IV)NC1 monomer identified as the one that binds GP antibodies (Gunwar, S., Saus, J., Noelken, M. E., and Hudson, B. G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5466-5469). In the present study, the chain origin of 25 dimeric components and the identity of those that bound the anti-GBM antibodies from two GP patients were determined. This was accomplished by NH2-terminal sequence analysis and immunoblotting analysis of dimeric components that were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis in combination with high pressure liquid chromatography. The results revealed that (a) the components are mainly homodimers of the NC1 domains of alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 4, and probably alpha 5 chains of collagen IV, reflecting a specificity of promoter-promoter association and (b) each homodimer had several size and charge isoforms. The GP antibodies bound exclusively to both alpha 3(IV)NC1 monomers and dimers and not to other basement membrane constituents. These findings provided new insights about the structure of GBM collagen and together with our previous findings firmly established the alpha 3(IV) chain as the target for the anti-GBM antibodies that mediate glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage in patients with Goodpasture syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1503784274,"Heparin depresses the second-order rate constant ka for the inhibition of neutrophil elastase by alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. High molecular mass heparin decreases ka from 1.3 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 to a limit of 4.6 x 10(4) M-1 s-1. Low molecular mass heparin is about 7-fold less effective. Dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate are less efficient. Heparin preparations used in clinical care also strongly depress ka when tested at concentrations corresponding to their clinical efficacy. Heparin also decreases the ka for the elastase/eglin c and the cathepsin G/alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor systems but not that for the alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor/pancreatic elastase or trypsin pairs. These results, together with Sepharose-heparin binding studies, indicate that the ka-depressing effect of the polymer is related to its ability to form a tight complex with elastase but not with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. One mol of high molecular mass heparin binds 3 mol of neutrophil elastase with a Kd of 3.3 nM. Low molecular mass heparin binds elastase with a 1:1 stoichiometry and a Kd of 89 nM. For both heparins ka is lowest when elastase is fully saturated with heparin. From this we conclude that heparin decreases ka, because the heparin-elastase complex is able to slowly react with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and not because the inhibitor slowly dissociates the heparin-elastase complex. These findings may have important pathophysiological bearing."

Depending on the molar ratios in which they are mixed, actobindin binds either one or two actin molecules. We cross-linked actobindin and actin in the 1:1 complex, using the zero-length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. The cross-linked peptides were purified after consecutive CNBr cleavage and trypsin and Staphylococcus protease V8 digestions, and the cross-linked side chains were identified by amino acid sequencing. Isopeptide linkages were formed between residues Glu-100 of actin and Lys-16 of actobindin. In addition, we found a connection between one or more of the acidic residues 1,2, or 3 of actin and Lys-16 and Lys-52 of actobindin. The cross-linked regions in actobindin contain Leu-Lys-His-Ala-Glu-Thr motifs, similar to sequences observed in several other actin-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1519445799,"We have investigated the transmembrane topology of the amino-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of the mouse muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor synthesized in vitro and in vivo. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis we introduced new glycosylation consensus sequences at alpha 154 and at alpha 200. For each novel site, additional constructs were made in which the original site at alpha N141 was eliminated. Glycosylation at the new sites, as exhibited in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomes and in a transient transfection system with COS cells, was taken as evidence of the transmembrane translocation of the new site. Each of the new sites was glycosylated in both systems. In separate experiments we found that an alpha subunit fragment terminating at alpha M207 could be extracted from microsomal membranes with sodium carbonate after in vitro translation, indicating that this fragment is not an integral membrane protein. Our results, taken together with previous experiments, indicate that the amino terminus of the alpha subunit up to at least residue alpha 207 is translocated across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. This topology probably represents the orientation of the amino terminus of the alpha subunit in the assembled receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1503070166,"Abstract Feeding rats diets containing 2% cholesterol markedly reduced hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase activity but had little effect on mRNA levels. Addition of mevalonolactone to the diet further decreased reductase activity independent of a change in mRNA levels. In contrast, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase mRNA levels and enzyme activity were decreased to similar degrees in response to dietary cholesterol. Addition of mevalonolactone to the diet did not further decrease farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase activity. Dietary cholesterol and mevalonolactone had no effect on mRNA levels for cellular nucleic acid-binding protein which has been demonstrated to bind the sterol regulatory elements in the HMG-CoA reductase and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase promoters. Dietary cholesterol increased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA levels as expected. These results suggest that cholesterol-mediated feed-back regulation of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase gene expression does not occur at the level of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2135668733,"The gene encoding rat class I alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is expressed primarily in the liver. Recent studies in our laboratories indicate that multiple cellular factors present in the rat liver interact with various regions of the promoter of this gene. One of the regions contains the sequence 5'-CACATG-3' that has an E box homology to which a number of transcription factors containing the basic helix-loop-helix motif bind. We now demonstrate that the human transcription factor, upstream stimulatory factor (USF), a basic helix-loop-helix-containing protein, binds to and activates the promoter of the rat class I ADH gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of labeled oligonucleotide containing the 5'-CACATG-3' sequence within the ADH promoter revealed the formation of multiple DNA-protein complexes when nuclear extracts obtained from adult rat liver were used. The binding of proteins to the DNA could be competed away with an oligonucleotide specifying a sequence within the adenovirus major late promoter (MLP) that had previously been shown to bind USF. Similar complexes were observed when electrophoretic mobility shift assays of labeled MLP oligonucleotide were performed with rat liver nuclear extracts. Conversely, nuclear extracts isolated from HeLa cells, cells known to have abundant USF, contain factors that interact with the sequence present in the ADH promoter. This interaction could be competed efficiently by the MLP oligonucleotide. USF synthesized in an in vitro transcription and translation system also binds to the ADH promoter as well as to the MLP. In addition, antiserum directed against USF recognizes factors present in the rat liver nuclear extracts that interact with the ADH promoter. Furthermore, transcription directed from both the ADH and the adenovirus major late promoters was inhibited by an oligonucleotide representing the USF-binding site within the ADH promoter in a cell-free in vitro transcription system. Lastly, an ADH promoter-reporter gene construct was transactivated by an eukaryotic expression vector containing USF in HepG2 cells co-transfected with the two constructs. These experiments demonstrate that USF is present in the rat liver and that it binds to and activates the promoter of the rat class I ADH gene in a sequence-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1594786901,"An increase in concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) is associated with an accelerated influx of 45Ca2+ when cultured RBL-2H3 cells are stimulated with either antigen or analogs of adenosine although these agents act via different receptors and coupling proteins (Ali, H., Cunha-Melo, J.R., Saul, W.F., and Beaven, M.A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 745-753). The same mechanism probably operates for basal Ca2+ influx in unstimulated cells and for the accelerated influx in stimulated cells. This influx had the following characteristics. 1) It was decreased when cells were depolarized with high external K+; 2) it was blocked by other cations (La3+ greater than Zn2+ greater than Cd2+ greater than Mn2 = Co2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Ni2+ greater than Sr2+) either by competing with Ca2+ at external sites (e.g. La3+ or Zn2+) or by co-passage into the cell (e.g. Mn2+ or Sr2+); and 3) the inhibition of influx by K+ and the metal ions had exactly the same characteristics whether cells were stimulated or unstimulated even though influx rates were different. The dependence of various cellular responses on influx of Ca2+ was demonstrated as follows. The stimulated influx of Ca2+, rise in [Ca2+]i, and secretion, could be blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by increasing the concentration of La3+, but concentrations of La3+ (greater than 20 microM) that suppressed influx to below basal rates of influx markedly suppressed the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids (levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were unaffected). Some metal ions, e.g. Mn2+ and Sr2+, however, supported the stimulated hydrolysis of inositol phospholipid and some secretion in the absence of Ca2+. Thus a basal rate of influx of Ca2+ was required for the full activation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, but in addition an accelerated influx was necessary for exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1537009330,"Protein synthesis is believed to be under control of the cell cycle during meiosis and mitosis. Any relationship between substrates for cdc2 kinase and components of the protein synthetic apparatus would therefore be of prime importance. During meiosis of Xenopus laevis oocytes one of the substrates for this kinase is a p47 protein, which is complexed to two other proteins, P36 and P30. Judged from partial amino acid sequence data on P47 and P30, the P30 and P47 proteins were reported to resemble the protein synthetic elongation factors (EF) 1 beta and 1 gamma from Artemia salina (Belle, R., Derancourt, J., Poulhe, R., Capony, J.P., Ozon, R., and Mulner-Lorillon, O. (1989) FEBS Lett. 255, 101-104). This paper shows that the complex composed of P30, P47, and P36 from Xenopus is identical to the complex of EF-1 beta, EF-1 gamma, and EF-1 delta from Artemia according to two criteria. 1) Both stimulate elongation factor 1 alpha-mediated transfer RNA binding to ribosomes and exchange of guanine nucleotides on elongation factor 1 alpha to a comparable degree. 2) Each of the three subunits of the protein complex P30.P47.P36 from Xenopus shows a structural homology with one of the corresponding subunits of EF-1 beta gamma delta from Artemia. Presumably the phosphorylation of EF-1 gamma, which associates with tubulin at least in vitro, is important in processes following the onset of meiosis which is accompanied by a rise of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1933775832,"The membrane-bound enzyme of microsomes obtained from sunflower embryos that catalyzes the bi-substrate transfer reaction whereby the methyl group of (S)-adenosyl-L-methionine is transferred to C-24 of the sterol side chain has been investigated. Optimal incubation conditions for assay of the microsomal (S)-adenosyl-L-methionine:sterol delta 24-methyl transferase (SMT) have been established for the first time. The microsomal preparation was found to catalyze the formation of a delta 24(28)-sterol and to be free of contaminating methyl transferase enzymes, e.g. those which form delta 23-24 methyl sterols (cyclosadol) and delta 25-24 beta-methyl sterols (cyclolaudenol) and other sterolic enzymes which might transform the acceptor molecule to metabolites which could compete in the assay with the test substrate. From a series of incubations with 27 sterol and sterol-like (triterpenoids) substrates of which 23 compounds possessed a 24,25-double bond, we observed a marked dependence on precise structural features and three-dimensional shape of the acceptor molecule in its ability to be transformed by the SMT. In contrast to the yeast SMT where cycloartenol fails to bind to the SMT and zymosterol is the best substrate for methylation, the sunflower SMT studied here utilizes cycloartenol preferentially to zymosterol and the other substrates. Of the chemical groups which distinguishes cycloartenol, a free 3 beta-OH,9 beta,19-cyclopropyl group, trimethylated saturated nucleus, and delta 24-double bond, only the nucleophilic centers at C-3 and C-24 were obligatory for substrate binding and methylation. Of the bent or flat conformations which cycloartenol may orient in the enzyme-substrate complex, our results indicate a selection for acceptor molecules which possess the shape that closely resembles the crystal state and solution orientation of cycloartenol which is now known to be flat rather than bent (Nes, W. D., Benson, M., Lundin, R. E., and Le, P. H. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 5759-5763)."

Structural analysis suggests that the squid NF60 and NF70 neurofilament genes and proteins are remarkably distinct from vertebrate neuronal intermediate filaments characterized previously. Both proteins are encoded on mRNAs generated by alternative RNA processing of the primary transcript of a single gene. Among the known intermediate filament proteins, NF60 and NF70 neurofilament proteins show highest similarity to an epithelial intermediate filament protein from Helix pomatia, a gastropod mollusk, and are less similar to vertebrate neurofilaments. The length of the alpha-helical rod domain in the NF60 and NF70 proteins was reminiscent of the vertebrate nuclear lamins, 6 heptads longer than is found in all known vertebrate cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, in particular the vertebrate neurofilaments. These distinct structural properties suggest that the vertebrate and invertebrate low molecular weight neurofilaments evolved independently from primordial intermediate filament proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1535591817,"Human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is expressed in activated monocytes as a 31-kDa precursor protein which is processed and secreted as a mature, unglycosylated 17-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment, despite the fact that it contains a potential N-linked glycosylation site near the NH2 terminus (-Asn7-Cys8-Thr9-). cDNA coding for authentic mature IL-1 beta was fused to the signal sequence from the Candida albicans glucoamylase gene, two amino acids downstream from the signal processing site. Upon expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, approximately equimolar amounts of N-glycosylated (22 kDa) and unglycosylated (17 kDa) IL-1 beta protein were secreted. The N-glycosylated yeast recombinant IL-1 beta exhibited a 5-7-fold lower specific activity compared to the unglycosylated species. The mechanism responsible for inefficient glycosylation was also studied. We found no differences in secretion kinetics or processing between the two extracellular forms of IL-1 beta. The 17-kDa protein, which was found to lack core sugars, does not result from deglycosylation of the 22-kDa protein in vivo and does not result from saturation of the glycosylation enzymatic machinery through overexpression. Alteration of the uncommon Cys8 residue in the -Asn-X-Ser/Thr-glycosylation site to Ser also had no effect. However, increasing the distance between Asn7 and the signal processing site increased the extent of core N-linked glycosylation, suggesting a reduction in glycosylation efficiency near the NH2 terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1486030469,"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), which participate in the post-translational conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins, are encoded by a multigene family in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E2s function in a variety of cellular activities including intracellular proteolysis, DNA repair, sporulation, and cell cycle traverse. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a new member of the yeast UBC gene family, UBC8. UBC8 encodes a 206-amino acid protein containing a highly acidic carboxyl terminus. The primary structure of the protein is similar to that of all other known E2s, with the highest homology being to the E2 (23 kDa) of wheat germ. Haploid strains in which the UBC8 gene is disrupted are viable, and the disruption does not produce any obvious phenotype. The UBC8 protein, produced in Escherichia coli, forms thiol ester adducts with ubiquitin and, apparently, diubiquitin, but does not transfer ubiquitin to histones."
https://openalex.org/W1679095207,"Pig heart NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase is inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (Colman, R. F., and Chu, R. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 601-607), and is completely protected against inactivation, but not against the incorporation of NEM, by isocitrate plus Mn2+. We have now treated the enzyme with [3H]NEM in the absence and presence of isocitrate plus Mn2+, digested it with trypsin, and isolated and sequenced the labeled Cys peptides. In the inactive enzyme, two major peptides, SSGGFVWACK and DLAGCIHGLSNVK, and two minor peptides, CATITPDEAR and EPIICK, were labeled at Cys. Upon reaction with [3H]NEM in the presence of isocitrate plus Mn2+, full catalytic activity was retained and only DLAGCIHGLSNVK was labeled; the Cys of this peptide is therefore not essential for catalysis. The modification of SSGGFVWACK appears to be the major cause of inactivation by NEM. The Cys in SSGGFVWACK may have a catalytic role, most likely in the strengthened binding of Mn2+ in the presence of isocitrate. Isocitrate dehydrogenase was carboxymethylated under denaturing conditions with [14C]iodoacetate and digested with trypsin; 6 unique labeled Cys peptides, containing 6 unique Cys residues, were purified and sequenced. Six corresponding peptides were isolated from enzyme treated under denaturing conditions with [3H]NEM. These results eliminate the previous uncertainty regarding the number of Cys residues in the enzyme. A comparison of the sequences of the NH2-terminal 30 residues and the 6 Cys peptides of the pig heart NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase with the Escherichia coli NADP enzyme provides evidence for great dissimilarity between the two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1532631382,"Vaccinia virus RNA polymerase requires the heterodimeric protein, vaccinia early transcription factor (VETF), for transcription of early gene templates in vitro. We have analyzed the vaccinia growth factor promoter sequences interacting with VETF at the nucleotide level and provide evidence that the factor contacts the DNA at two separate sites. DNase I protection analysis showed that VETF was found to nucleotides -12 to -29 relative to the transcription initiation site, and also to nucleotides +8 to +10 downstream of the initiation site. The importance of both binding sites for stable complex formation was supported by methylation interference analysis. Using synthetic oligonucleotides encoding different parts of the vaccinia growth factor promoter, it was shown that nucleotides down-stream of the transcription initiation site are required for stable complex formation. Competition binding experiments demonstrated that only the upstream binding site contributes significantly to binding specificity. Binding to two separated DNA sequences results in a bend in the promoter DNA as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of permuted DNA fragments. These findings suggest that VETF activates transcription by sequence specific binding and structural alteration of the promoter DNA helix."
https://openalex.org/W1562922570,"Rat-1 fibroblasts transformed with the v-src oncogene show a 6-fold increase in the apparent amount of an inositol polyphosphate which has a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) elution characteristic of the D/L-myo-inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate enantiomeric pair (Johnson, R.M., Wasilenko, W.J., Mattingly, R.R., Weber, M.J., and Garrison, J.C. (1989) Science 246, 121-124). By chemical and enzymatic analysis, the structure of this compound produced in both normal and v-src-transformed rat-1 fibroblasts has been determined to be principally D-myoinositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (D-Ins(1,4,5,6)P4). Chronic stimulation with endothelin-1 in the presence of Li+ significantly increased the amount of D/L-Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 only in the v-src-transformed rat-1 cells, suggesting that production of this compound may be remotely coupled to long term agonist-induced phosphatidylinositol turnover. Further evidence for such a link is provided by the progressive loss of D-Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 from the normal cells deprived of serum stimulation. To define a possible synthetic pathway for D-Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, cytosolic extracts of normal and v-src-transformed cells were incubated with [3H]inositol polyphosphates, and the reaction products were identified by HPLC elution and chemical analysis. Although inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 6-kinase activity was prominent in extracts of both normal and transformed cells, only the cytosol from v-src-transformed cells ultimately formed measurable amounts of D-Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 from [3H]inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. Approximately 6% of 0.1 microM inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate was converted to D-Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 during a 2-h incubation at 37 degrees C. Inositol pentakisphosphate was identified as a likely intermediate in this conversion, and extracts of both normal and transformed cells converted [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate to D-Ins(1,4,5,6)P4. The synthetic pathway described is consistent with the long term regulation of D/L-Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 levels in rat-1 fibroblasts seen in response to src transformation, serum withdrawal, and chronic endothelin treatment, and identifies several new potential interactions between the pathways of inositol polyphosphate metabolism and those of src transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1497454563,"Analyses of isolated intact diaphragm muscle show that at rest only about 30% of the total cellular Pi is metabolically reactive as indicated by 18O incorporation from [18O]water, whereas up to 90% becomes metabolically active incrementally with contractile frequency. Kinetics of [gamma-18O]ATP appearance show that about 90% of the cellular ATP is metabolically active and suggest slowly and rapidly metabolizing compartments of ATP in resting muscle and only rapidly metabolizing compartments in contracting muscle. Rates of [18O]creatine phosphate [( 18O]CrP) appearance are consistent with creatine kinase-catalyzed phosphoryl exchange functioning in an obligatory phosphoryl shuttle system. In noncontracting muscle, ATP turnover rate was 83 nmol.mg protein-1.min-1, and the P/O ratio was determined to be 3.2. ATP utilization increases in direct proportion to contractile frequency with each contracture consuming the equivalent of 0.96 nmol of ATP.mg protein-1 or 2.5-3.5 molecules of ATP/myosin active site. Basal concentrations of nucleotide polyphosphates are not altered when ATP utilization rates increase during contraction. At high contractile frequencies, decreases in CrP concentration occur, but this accounts for less than 4% of total high energy phosphoryls consumed. If metabolic intermediates are free in the aqueous cellular cytosol, each twitch contracture would result in a decrease in ATP concentration of no more than 2% and increases in ADP and AMP concentrations of less than 20 and 7%, respectively. Thus, changes in metabolite concentration must be highly localized or metabolic regulation can be accomplished by a nonallosteric mechanism."

ApoE also inhibits mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and gonadotropin-stimulated ovarian theca/interstitial cell androgen production. To address the mechanism(s) by which apoE is active and to understand its interaction with the target cells, we prepared and examined the inhibitory activity of a series of apoE synthetic peptides. ApoE peptides representing amino acid residues 93-112, 141-155, 161-171, 172-182, and 174-193 were not active in either bioassay. However, specific inhibition of both lymphocyte proliferation and ovarian androgen production was observed with a self-conjugate of peptide-(141-155). Furthermore, a synthesized dimeric peptide representing two repeats of sequence-(141-155) (i.e. (141-155)-(141-155] was active as well. In both bioassays, the inhibition observed was not a result of direct cell killing. Furthermore, these apoE peptides exhibited activities with characteristics that were shared with those of native apoE. The results indicate that amino acid residues 141-155 of apoE are responsible for the biological activity of apoE. Furthermore, the results suggest that dimers or multimers of native apoE may be a biologically important species."

We obtained 13-fold purification of retinol dehydrogenase with specific activity of 61.8 nmol/min/mg and 3.8% recovery. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that retinol dehydrogenase had a molecular mass of 37,000 daltons. The Km values of purified retinol dehydrogenase for all-trans retinol and all-trans retinal were 6.6 mM and 0.085 mM, respectively. The purified enzyme reacted with the all-trans retinal but not with 13-, 11-, and 9-cis compounds. In addition, we prepared antibody to retinol dehydrogenase using rat. The anti-retinol dehydrogenase antibody precipitated retinol dehydrogenase activity and was confirmed to bind to 37-kDa protein by Western blotting. We also found that anti-retinol dehydrogenase antibody bound to bovine rod outer segments specifically by immunohistochemical technique. The molar ratio of retinol dehydrogenase to opsin in rod outer segments estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 1:140."
https://openalex.org/W1512729682,"Fast skeletal troponin C (sTnC) has two low affinity Ca(2+)-binding sites (sites I and II), whereas in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) site I is inactive. By modifying the Ca2+ binding properties of sites I and II in cTnC it was demonstrated that binding of Ca2+ to an activated site I alone is not sufficient for triggering contraction in slow skeletal muscle fibers (Sweeney, H.L., Brito, R. M.M., Rosevear, P.R., and Putkey, J.A. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 9538-9542). However, a similar study using sTnC showed that Ca2+ binding to site I alone could partially activate force production in fast skeletal muscle fibers (Sheng, Z., Strauss, W.L., Francois, J.M., and Potter, J.D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21554-21560). The purpose of the current study was to examine the functional characteristics of modified cTnC derivatives in fast skeletal muscle fibers to assess whether or not either low affinity site can mediate force production when coupled to fast skeletal isoforms of troponin (Tn) I and TnT. Normal cTnC and sTnC were compared with engineered derivatives of cTnC having either both sites I and II active, or only site I active. In contrast to what is seen in slow muscle, binding of Ca2+ to site I alone recovered about 15-20% of the normal calcium-activated force and ATPase activity in skinned fast skeletal muscle fibers and myofibrils, respectively. This is most likely due to structural differences between TnI and/or TnT isoforms that allow for partial recognition and translation of the signal represented by binding Ca2+ to site I of TnC when associated with fast skeletal but not slow skeletal muscle."

Saxiphilin, the protein responsible for this activity, was purified approximately 440-fold from bullfrog plasma by column chromatography on heparin-Sepharose followed by chromatofocusing. The purified saxiphilin preparation exhibits a binding capacity of 9.6 nmol/mg protein and a Kd of 0.32 nM for [3H]saxitoxin. Analysis of the preparation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows a predominant band migrating with an apparent Mr of approximately 89,000 which is similar to the expected size of saxiphilin previously estimated by nondenaturing size exclusion chromatography. Amino-terminal sequencing of the approximately 89-kDa protein and sequencing of four different tryptic peptide fragments revealed that each of the partial saxiphilin sequences can be aligned by homology with members of the transferrin protein family with sequence identity as high as 69%. The available sequence corresponding to conserved residues that comprise part of the two Fe3+ binding sites in lacto-transferrin show several substitutions in saxiphilin, suggesting that saxiphilin is not an Fe(3+)-binding protein. Saxiphilin appears to be a monomeric approximately 89-kDa protein that is evolutionarily related to transferrin but which binds saxitoxin instead of Fe3+."

These bifunctional, dissociable probes were utilized for the single-step purification to homogeneity of two folate transport proteins (43 and 39 kDa) from L1210 cells. Treatment of the 39-kDa protein with peptide N-glycosidase F produced a smaller component (32 kDa); the 43-kDa protein, conversely, was unchanged by this procedure. When the 39-kDa transporter in intact cells was labeled with a fluorescein derivative of folate and then treated with phosphoinositol-specific phospholipase C, complete loss of fluorescence was observed. Alternatively, there was no change in fluorescence when the 43-kDa transporter was labeled with a fluorescein derivative of methotrexate and treated with the enzyme. These results indicate that the 43-kDa transporter is a nonglycosylated, integral membrane protein, whereas the 39-kDa counterpart is heavily glycosylated and anchored exofacially to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol component."

To determine the chemical nature of the autoantigen against which this antibody is directed on platelets, this platelet antigen was purified by the lipid extraction of sonicated platelets, DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography. The purified glycolipids, a trace component in platelets, demonstrated high reactivity with the HF2-1/17 antibody using a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system or immunostaining of thin layer chromatograms. The purified glycolipids co-migrated with bovine sulfatides by thin layer chromatography. The purified glycolipids contain sulfate and galactose but not sialic acid or phosphate. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry revealed these sulfatides to be sulfated monohexyl ceramides. The dominant species has a molecular weight of 794 while a minor form has a molecular weight of 812 due to an extra hydroxyl group and loss of a double bond. These results indicate that the platelet autoantigen against which the human monoclonal anti-DNA antibody is directed represents a family of novel monogalactosyl sulfatides."

The 270-6 deduced protein shows 38% identity and 58% similarity to an avocado (Persea americana) cellulase. During spore germination in Dictyostelium extracellular cellulase activity starts to accumulate coincident with the appearance of the 270-6 gene transcript. Amoebae transformed by a vector containing the 270-6 mRNA sequence express an extracellular cellulase during vegetative growth when there would otherwise be no cellulase activity. In addition, the expression of a truncated 270-6 polypeptide lacking the 270 gene family-defining tetrapeptide repeat and the C-terminal region, in suitably transformed amoebae, also produces an extracellular cellulase activity. Several differently sized cellulase activities are shown to accumulate during spore germination, and it is possible that the 270 gene family represents a coordinately expressed family of cellulases."
https://openalex.org/W1560856058,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-(2R)-acetylglycero-3-phosphocholine) is a potent inflammatory mediator whose actions on bone cells have not been investigated previously. In this study, we examined effects of PAF on osteoclast morphology and intracellular free calcium. Osteoclasts, the large multinucleated cells responsible for bone resorption, were isolated from neonatal rat long bones, and the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) of individual fura-2-loaded cells was monitored by microspectrofluorimetry. In one series of experiments, PAF was applied focally to single, isolated osteoclasts (1 nM to 1 microM racemic mixture, in an application micropipette). Within 10 s of PAF application, [Ca2+]i increased from basal levels of 74 +/- 6 nM to peak levels of 209 +/- 28 nM (mean +/- S.E. of 24 cells responding). These results indicate that PAF acted directly on osteoclasts. In more than 75% of cells tested, PAF, at concentrations greater than or equal to 10 pM (final concentration, in the bath), induced biphasic elevation of [Ca2+]i. This response was highly specific for PAF, in that vehicle, lyso-PAF (the biologically inactive precursor/metabolite of PAF), and (S)-PAF (the inactive enantiomer of PAF) all failed to change [Ca2+]i. Moreover, [Ca2+]i elevation was blocked by the specific PAF antagonist CV-3988. To determine the source of Ca2+, cells were bathed in Ca(2+)-free medium, where PAF still caused an increase in [Ca2+]i, establishing that the response to PAF arose, at least in part, by release of Ca2+ from internal stores. In addition to changes in [Ca2+]i, PAF caused retraction followed by respreading of peripheral pseudopods. These findings indicate that rat osteoclasts respond to PAF by release of internal calcium and alterations in cell morphology and suggest that PAF may regulate resorption in inflammatory bone diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1553363051,"Numerous studies of cell cycle control in dividing cells have pointed to the central role of a 34-kDa histone H1 kinase (p34cdc2) complexed with regulatory subunits known as cyclins. We now report that p34cdc2-cyclin may also participate in signal transduction in nonproliferating, terminally differentiated cells, in this instance during sheep platelet activation. Immunological evidence for the presence of a p34cdc2 cognant in sheep platelet cytosol was obtained with antipeptide antibodies raised against peptide sequences in the conserved PSTAIRE and C-terminus regions of murine cdc2. The immunoreactive 32-kDa protein was adsorbed onto p13suc1-Sepharose, which selectively binds p34cdc2. A 58-kDa protein that also bound to p13suc1-Sepharose was identified as cyclin A on the basis of its size and immunoreactivity with two different anticyclin peptide antibodies. The p34cdc2-cyclin A complex was regulated during platelet activation. Its histone H1 phosphorylating activity was stimulated 2-fold in p13suc1-Sepharose extracts from platelets that had been exposed to platelet-activating factor or thrombin for 1 min prior to harvesting. Our findings imply that the p34cdc2-cyclin complex may serve alternative functions besides control of cell division."

Four of these metabolites (1-4) were rigorously proven to be biosynthetic precursors to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol. Indeed, their deuteriated derivatives were shown to be incorporated very efficiently into 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol by 2H-NMR.

https://openalex.org/W1584503665,"The relationship between neuronal alpha-bungarotoxin binding proteins (alpha BGTBPs) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor function in the brain of higher vertebrates has remained controversial for over a decade. Recently, the cDNAs for two homologous putative ligand binding subunits, designated alpha BGTBP alpha 1 and alpha BGTBP alpha 2, have been isolated on the basis of their homology to the N terminus of an alpha BGTBP purified from chick brain. In the present study, a panel of overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to the complete chick brain alpha BGTBP alpha 1 subunit and residues 166-215 of the alpha BGTBP alpha 2 subunits were tested for their ability to bind 125I-alpha BGT. The sequence segments corresponding to alpha BGTBP alpha 1-(181-200) and alpha BGTBP alpha 2-(181-200) were found to consistently and specifically bind 125I-alpha BGT. The ability of these peptides to bind alpha BGT was significantly decreased by reduction and alkylation of the Cys residues at positions 190/191, whereas oxidation had little effect on alpha BGT binding activity. The relative affinities for alpha BGT of the peptide sequences alpha BGTBP alpha 1-(181-200) and alpha BGTBP alpha 2-(181-200) were compared with those of peptides corresponding to the sequence segments Torpedo alpha 1-(181-200) and chick muscle alpha 1-(179-198). In competition assays, the IC50 for alpha BGTBP alpha 1-(181-200) was 20-fold higher than that obtained for the other peptides (approximately 2 versus 40 microM). These results indicate that alpha BGTBP alpha 1 and alpha BGTBP alpha 2 are ligand binding subunits able to bind alpha BGT at sites homologous with nAChR alpha subunits and that these subunits may confer differential ligand binding properties on the two alpha BGTBP subtypes of which they are components."
https://openalex.org/W1573111998,"Vaccinia virus RNA polymerase requires the vaccinia early transcription factor, VETF, for the in vitro initiation of transcription at early gene promoters in a reaction requiring ATP hydrolysis. VETF binds specifically to early gene promoters and has an associated DNA-dependent ATPase activity. The effect of ATP on the interaction of VETF with the promoter for the vaccinia growth factor gene promoter has been examined. ATP had no marked effect on the steady-state level of promoter binding but dramatically affected the kinetics of dissociation of VETF from the promoter. The half-life of the VETF-promoter complex was greatly reduced in the presence of ATP. The destabilization of the complex was specific for ATP and dATP, consistent with the substrate specificity of the VETF-associated ATPase. ADP or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog adenylyl-imidodiphosphate did not destabilize the complex suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is obligatory for dissociation. These findings provide a link between the promoter binding and ATPase activities associated with VETF and suggest that the ATP-dependent dissociation of the VETF-promoter complex is an important event in the transcription of vaccinia virus early genes."
https://openalex.org/W1530278200,"[35S]Methionine-labeled porcine heart citrate synthase (used here as a positive control) and rat liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) were generated by in vitro transcription and translation of their cDNA constructs in appropriate Bluescript plasmids. Each product was imported into rat liver mitochondria in an energy-dependent manner to yield an immunoprecipitable protein of smaller size that comigrated with the corresponding purified enzyme. The size shift occurring with citrate synthase was consistent with the removal of the postulated 27-amino acid leader peptide. To determine the amino terminus of mature CPT II, [35S]methionine- or [3H]leucine-labeled material (after import and processing) was subjected to Edman degradation, followed by counting of the radioactivity released on each cycle. The results established that the precursor targeting peptide was cleaved between leucine 25 and serine 26 in the previously deduced amino acid sequence. Taken in conjunction with the recent report of Finocchiaro et al. (Finocchiaro, G., Taroni, F., Rocchi, M., Martin, A. L., Colombo, I., Tarelli, G. T., and DiDonato, S. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 661-665), the present results establish three key points concerning the rat and human forms of CPT II. First, it appears that in both species the initial translation product contains 658 amino acids and, upon mitochondrial import, is reduced in length by 25 residues through cleavage at an identical site. Second, the difference in electrophoretic mobility between the two mature proteins (documented earlier) presumably reflects either anomalous behavior of one of them on polyacrylamide gels or differential covalent modification. Finally, the recent suggestion by Brady et al. (Brady, P. S., Liu, J. S., Park, E. A., Hanson, R. W., and Brady, L. J. (1991) FASEB J. 5, A817) that our CPT II cDNA construct is incomplete in the 5'-coding region is refuted."
https://openalex.org/W1599777058,"Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and hyaluronate have been identified as the predominant glycoconjugates synthesized and secreted by mouse uterine stromal cells (USC) cultured in vitro. CSPGs in both the cell-associated and secreted fractions have identical characteristics with regard to anion exchange chromatographic behavior, sensitivity of the intact molecules and constituent glycosaminoglycans to a variety of chemical and enzymatic digestions, lack of interaction with hydrophobic affinity resins, and density (greater than 1.46 g/ml). Chase labeling studies indicated a metabolic half-life of cell-associated, [35S]sulfate-labeled macromolecules of 5-6 h. Once secreted, CSPGs did not appear to be degraded or endocytosed to a significant extent. In contrast, a large fraction (50%) of the cell-associated CSPGs were degraded to low Mr (less than 3000) products via a chloroquine-sensitive pathway. Studies of the kinetics of intracellular transport indicated that approximately 30 min were required for CSPG core proteins to move from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and 15-20 min to move from the Golgi to the cell surface, i.e. protease-accessible compartment. There was no significant lag period between the time CSPGs first arrived at the cell surface and the time at which they were first detectable in the medium. Examination of CSPG expression during USC differentiation in utero or in vitro demonstrated that these molecules were produced with similar efficiency by USC under both conditions. Collectively, these studies provide the first comprehensive description of proteoglycan production and metabolism in USC, a uterine cell type intimately involved with embryo implantation processes. Potential functions for CSPGs and hyaluronate as modulators of embryo invasive processes and uterine expansion are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1522140513,"The platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex is the receptor for adhesive proteins on activated platelets that mediates platelet aggregation. In the present study, factors affecting the structural stability of the purified GP IIb-IIIa complex and the dissociated subunits were investigated. Purified GP IIb-IIIa was incubated in various Ca2+ concentrations, and the percentage of dissociated subunits was quantitated by sucrose gradient sedimentation. Two Ca(2+)-dependent transitions were observed, one at about 60 microM Ca2+, where half of the complexes became dissociated, and the other at 0.1 microM Ca2+, where half of the dissociated subunits became incapable of reforming heterodimer complexes when higher Ca2+ concentrations were readded. This loss in ability to reform heterodimer complexes was caused primarily by a Ca(2+)-dependent transition in GP IIIa, leading to an apparent unfolding of this subunit, followed by the formation of high molecular weight aggregates. The formation of these aggregates was time- and temperature-dependent and could not be reversed by added Ca2+. Although Mg2+ prevented dissociation of GP IIb-IIIa, it failed to promote reassociation of the dissociated subunits. Based on these findings, conditions were developed for the preparation of dissociated GP IIb and GP IIIa such that 70% of the subunits remained functional in that they retained the ability to reform heterodimer complexes."

A lower affinity interaction with cis-PA (Ki = 4 +/- 1 microM) results in competitive inhibition. trans-PA also acts as a high affinity partial noncompetitive inhibitor of elastase with a Ki equal to that for cis-PA but has no low affinity competitive inhibitory action. The endogenous fluorescence from the 3 tryptophan residues in elastase is partially quenched on binding cis- or trans-PA. Dependence of quenching of tryptophan fluorescence on PA concentration is consistent with binding to a single site with an apparent Kd of 26 +/- 3 nM, which may be equivalent to the high affinity partial noncompetitive inhibitory binding mode. Analysis of quenching according to the modified Forster theory of energy transfer developed by Snyder and Freire (Snyder, B., and Freire, E. (1982) Biophys. J. 40, 137-148) leads to an estimate of apparent closest indole-PA distance of 13 +/- 3 A. Fluorescence of either cis- or trans-PA is apparently unperturbed upon binding in the high affinity mode to elastase, but at micromolar cis-PA concentrations, binding to elastase results in a blue shift and 20% increase in intensity of PA emission, suggesting that the lower affinity competitive inhibitory binding mode of binding to elastase provides a hydrophobic environment for cis-PA."
https://openalex.org/W1582311149,"Macrophages derived from phorbol ester-induced human leukemic (HL-60) cells exhibit a voltage-activated inward rectifying potassium conductance which was modulated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Wieland, S. J., Chou, R. H., and Gong, Q. H. (1990) J. Cell. Physiol. 142, 643-651). Roles of intracellular messengers in this regulatory mechanism were investigated. Intracellular dialysis with inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate during tight-seal whole cell recording produced a rapid increase in the inward rectifying conductance. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels alone did not reproduce the stimulatory effect of these modulators. Intracellular dialysis with guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) resulted in profound inhibition of this conductance. These data suggest a novel cellular function for inositol polyphosphates, particularly IP4, and show antagonistic modulation with GTP gamma S on a human macrophage inward rectifier."
https://openalex.org/W1539611473,"The insoluble residue from Tetrahymena mimbres cells that had been preincubated in vivo for 2 h with [3H]myristic acid and then exhaustively delipidated with organic solvents retained radioactivity, principally in material which migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular mass of 10-14 kDa. This material was extractable from the delipidated cell residue with organic solvents known to solubilize phosphatidylinositol glycans (PI glycans). The same material could also be labeled with [3H]inositol, [14C]glucosamine, and [3H] ethanolamine. When the delipidated residue of cells labeled for 2 h with [3H]myristate was treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C or nitrous acid, much of the associated radioactivity was released. A similar release was obtained using the putative PI glycan fraction extracted from the cell residue. After further purification by thin layer chromatography, this latter material was hydrolyzed with HCl and shown to contain fatty acids, alkylglyceryl ethers, phosphate, inositol, glucosamine, mannose, and ethanolamine. The findings indicate that T. mimbres contains PI glycans resembling in structure those recently characterized in trypanosomes and mammalian cells. As the time of incubation with the radiotracers enumerated above was increased to 6-24 h, increasing amounts of radioactivity appeared in the 22-27-kDa region of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. This higher molecular weight material is shown in the companion paper (Pak, Y., Ryals, P.E., and Thompson, G.A., Jr. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15054-15059) to be released by in vivo phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment. Thus T. mimbres contains a pool of free PI glycans and at least one phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein."
https://openalex.org/W1579292949,"We have previously demonstrated (Guan X.-P., Hromchak, R. A., and Bloch, A. (1989) Cancer Commun. 1, 111-115) that ML-1 human myeloblastic leukemia cells differentiate to monocyte/macrophage-like cells by the sequential action of competence and progression factors. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta, and the phorbol ester tetradecanoylphorbol acetate were found to induce competence, whereas a 77-kDa glycoprotein (DF77) isolated from mitogen-stimulated human leukocyte-conditioned medium initiated progression. In this communication we show DF77 to be an isoform of human transferrin. Hemin or soluble iron complexes did not induce differentiation progression, suggesting that the participation of transferrin in ML-1 cell differentiation may not be related to its iron-carrying capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1517882939,"The alpha-globin gene is expressed at a constitutively high level upon gene transfer into both erythroid and nonerythroid cells. The beta-globin gene, on the other hand, is dependent on the presence of a linked viral enhancer for its efficient expression upon transfer into heterologous cells. In this report, we describe a novel regulatory element within the structural alpha-globin gene which can activate its own promoter to result in a high level of expression in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells. This regulatory element does not appear to have the properties of a classical enhancer. While this element exerts a positive effect on its own promoter, we have demonstrated in a previous study that the same element exerts a negative effect on heterologous genes such as the beta- and gamma-globin genes. In this study, we localize this element to a 259 nucleotide fragment immediately downstream from the translation initiation codon which is partially overlapped by a DNase I hypersensitive domain only in erythroid cells. We propose that this element may activate the alpha-globin gene promoter in all cell types in vivo as it does in vitro. The specificity of erythroid expression of the alpha-globin gene in vivo is probably determined by a permissive chromatin configuration in erythroid cells and a nonpermissive configuration in non-erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1483918388,"Bovine and rat growth hormones (bGH and rGH, respectively) possess signal peptides that direct the hormone to the secretory pathway and are proteolytically cleaved prior to secretion. Previous in vitro translation studies indicated that incorporation of the polar leucine analog beta-hydroxyleucine into de novo synthesized polypeptides inhibits signal peptide function. To test the effects of this analog on GH secretion by cultured animal cells, transfections of mouse L-cells with a bGH expression plasmid or metabolic labeling of endogenous rGH in anterior pituitary cells was performed in the absence or presence of beta-hydroxyleucine. Transient expression of bGH in mouse L-cells or endogenous expression of rGH in anterior pituitary cells resulted in an accumulation of GH in the culture medium. Treatment with beta-hydroxyleucine resulted in a block in secretion as evidenced by an accumulation of GHs within these cells. Amino-terminal sequencing of the intracellular form of the analog-substituted GHs demonstrated accurate signal peptide cleavage. In contrast, in vitro translations of bGH RNA performed in the presence of beta-hydroxyleucine and microsomal membranes resulted in the inhibition of signal peptide cleavage. The results suggest that beta-hydroxyleucine can uncouple signal peptide processing and protein secretion in cultured cells."
