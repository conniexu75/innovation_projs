https://openalex.org/W2038419318,"There is now a new series of high-temperature superconductors that may be represented as (A(III)O)(2)A(2)(II)Can-1CunO2+2n where A(III) is Bi or Tl, A(II) is Ba or Sr, and n is the number of Cu-O sheets stacked consecutively. There is a general trend toward higher transition temperatures as n increases. The highest n value for a bulk phase is three and is found when A(III) is Tl. This compound, Tl(2)Ba(2)Ca(2)Cu(3)O(10), has the highest transition temperature( approximately 125 K) of any presently known bulk superconductor. The structure of Tl(2)Ba(2)Ca(2)Cu(3)O(10) has been determined from single-crystal x-ray diffraction data and is tetragonal, with a = 3.85 A and c = 35.9 A. No superstructure is observed, and the material is essentially twin-free. Electron microscopy in the Tl/Ba/Ca/Cu/O system has revealed intergrowths where n = 5; such regions may well be responsible for the superconducting onset behavior observed in this system at about 140 K."

To quantify this process, an instream injection of a conservative tracer was used to measure discharge at the time that each sample was collected. Daytime production of ferrous iron by photoreduction was almost four times as great as nighttime oxidation of ferrous iron. The photoreduction process probably involves dissolved or colloidal ferric iron species and limited interaction with organic species because concentrations of organic carbon are low in this stream."

On the basis of a 5-year study, it appears that these farmers have more in common with the majority of farmers in the region than with certain stereotypes of organic farmers. Their farming practices (other than chemical use), the size and labor requirements of their farms, and the production and profitability they achieve differ from those of conventional farmers by considerably less than might be expected on the basis of the fundamental importance of chemicals in modern agricultural production. Compared to conventional methods, organic methods consume less fossil energy and cause less soil erosion, but have mixed effects on soil nutrient status and grain protein content."
https://openalex.org/W2043649055,"The rapid growth of computing and applications has helped cross-fertilize the mathematical sciences, yielding an unprecedented abundance of new methods, theories, and models. Examples from statistical science, core mathematics, and applied mathematics illustrate these changes, which have both broadened and enriched the relation between mathematics and science. No longer just the study of number and space, mathematical science has become the science of patterns, with theory built on relations among patterns and on applications derived from the fit between pattern and observation."
https://openalex.org/W2147855314,"The stratospheric concentration of trace gases released in the atmosphere as a result of human activities is increasing at a rate of 5 to 8 percent per year in the case of the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 1 percent per year in the case of methane (CH(4)), and 0.25 percent per year in the case of nitrous oxide (N(2)O). The amount of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is expected to double before the end of the 21st century. Even if the production of the CFCs remains limited according to the protocol for the protection of the ozone layer signed in September 1987 in Montreal, the abundance of active chlorine (2 parts per billion by volume in the early 1980s) is expected to reach 6 to7 parts per billion by volume by 2050. The impact of these increases on stratospheric temperature and ozone was investigated with a two-dimensional numerical model. The model includes interactive radiation, wave and mean flow dynamics, and 40 trace species. An increase in CFCs caused ozone depletion in the model, with the largest losses near the stratopause and, in the vertical mean, at high latitudes. Increased CO(2) caused ozone amounts to increase through cooling, with the largest increases again near 45 kilometers and at high latitudes. This CO(2)-induced poleward increase reduced the CFC-induced poleward decrease. Poleward and downward ozone transport played a major role in determining the latitudinal variation in column ozone changes."

Unlike the sulfonamfide-albumin complex, the penicillin-albumin possesses antibiotic activity. Such a complex can be freed of unbound penicillin by repeated precipitation at 50 per cent. alcohol and obtained as a dried powder. Mouse excretion studies indicated that the penicillin-albumin complex was excreted more slowly than the sodium salt of penicillin."
https://openalex.org/W4213263021,"Water and oil can be made completely miscible by adding a sufficient amount of an amphiphilic compound, such as soap or a detergent. For historical reasons, such stable homogeneous solutions are called ""microemulsions."" In this article the term microemulsion is used in a more restrictive manner; at low concentrations of the amphiphile, mixtures of water, nonpolar solvents, and amphiphiles may separate into three coexisting liquid layers, namely, an aqueous phase, an amphiphile-rich phase, and an oil-rich phase. In the amphiphile-rich phase, which is the microemulsion in the narrower sense, one finds for thermodynamic reasons a maximum of the mutual solubility between water and oil, combined with a minimum of the interfacial tension between the aqueous and the oil-rich phase, properties that are of interest for both theory and application. The present state of art in this rapidly growing field of science is reviewed."

https://openalex.org/W2085928695,"Prospects for rural development in sub-Saharan Africa appear to be much poorer than in the rest of the developing world, especially since the oil price increases. If present trends continue, African dependence on food imports will increase. Despite the rhetorical acknowledgment of the importance of the agricultural and rural sector, most African countries are not giving that sector the needed priority in their policies and budgets. Indeed, the rural sector is heavily taxed for the support of urban modernization. Large investments by foreign donors in the rural sector have had little overall effect. Donors need to adopt a longer perspective on development and to make greater efforts to promote indigenous capacities for policy, planning, and administration. Their investments need to be geared more to broad-based higher education and training and to transport and communications."

https://openalex.org/W2004222848,"Two-dimensional seismic prospecting methods are inadequate to solve the three-dimensional geological problems that arise in petroleum exploration. The three-dimensional seismic technique is a data collection and processing system that samples the subsurface adequately. The structure and lithology of rocks are mapped accurately by imaging their acoustic reflectivity with the scalar wave equation. In oil industry economics, the expense of three-dimensional seismic methods is justified by their usefulness for discovering additional reserves and for reducing the growing costs of developing oil and gas fields."

https://openalex.org/W2063705670,"Year after year, physicists measure various quantities with increasing accuracy and see various objects in increasing detail. These advances are vital, because science's understanding of the physical world is necessarily limited by the accuracy with which science can measure that world. The Instrument and Measurement Science Topical Group of the American Physical Society sponsored several symposia at the recent APS March meeting in New Orleans that discussed recent advances in measurement and observation."
