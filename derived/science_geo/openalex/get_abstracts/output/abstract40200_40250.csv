https://openalex.org/W1536538430,"Camptothecin, a cytotoxic drug, is a strong inhibitor of nucleic acid synthesis in mammalian cells and a potent inducer of strand breaks in chromosomal DNA. Neither the equilibrium dialysis nor the unwinding measurement indicates any interaction between camptothecin and purified DNA. However, camptothecin induces extensive single strand DNA breaks in reactions containing purified mammalian DNA topoisomerase I. DNA breakage in vitro is immediate and reversible. Analyses of camptothecin-induced DNA breaks show that topoisomerase I is covalently linked to the 3' end of the broken DNA. In addition, camptothecin inhibits the catalytic activity of mammalian DNA topoisomerase I. We propose that camptothecin blocks the rejoining step of the breakage-reunion reaction of mammalian DNA topoisomerase I. This blockage results in the accumulation of a cleavable complex which resembles the transient intermediate proposed for eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I. The inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis and the induction of DNA strand breaks observed in vivo may be related to the formation of this drug-induced cleavable complex."
https://openalex.org/W2035208645,"As many as 40 distinct oncogenes of viral and cellular origin have been identified to date. Many of these genes can be grouped into functional classes on the basis of their effects on cellular phenotype. These groupings suggest a small number of mechanisms of action of the oncogene-encoded proteins. Some data suggest that, in the cytoplasm, these proteins may regulate levels of critical second messenger molecules; in the nucleus, these proteins may modulate the activity of the cell's transcriptional machinery. Many of the gene products can also be related to a signaling pathway that determines the cell's response to growth-stimulating factors. Because some of these genes are expressed in nongrowing, differentiated cells, the encoded proteins may in certain tissues mediate functions that are unrelated to cellular growth control."

https://openalex.org/W2062444650,"Hepatocyte-stimulating factor and interleukin-1 are proteins produced by monocytes in response to inflammatory challenge. Neither of these monokines had direct effects on steroid production by cultured adrenocortical cells. Both monokines stimulated pituitary cells (AtT-20) to release adrenocorticotropic hormone; interleukin-1 was equipotent with a combination of corticotropin-releasing factor and arginine vasopressin, and hepatocyte-stimulating factor was at least three times as effective. The synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, inhibited production of hepatocyte-stimulating factor by cultured monocytes. These results indicate an axis between monocytes and pituitary and adrenocortical cells which may play a role in regulating host defense."
https://openalex.org/W2030423815,"A polymorphic DNA marker has been found genetically linked, in a set of 39 human families, to an autosomal recessive gene that causes cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease affecting one in 2000 Caucasian children. The DNA marker (called D0CRI-917) is also linked to the PON locus, which by independent evidence is linked to the CF locus. The best estimates of the genetic distances are 5 centimorgans between the DNA marker and PON and 15 centimorgans between the DNA marker and the CF locus, meaning that the location of the disease gene has been narrowed to about 1 percent of the human genome (about 30 million base pairs). Although the data are consistent with the interpretation that a single locus causes cystic fibrosis, the possibility of genetic heterogeneity remains. The discovery of a linked DNA polymorphism is the first step in molecular analysis of the CF gene and its causative role in the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2004864695,"In situ hybridization was used to detect human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of some naturally infected (seropositive) individuals. A subpopulation of cells hybridized specifically to a portion of the HCMV genome that is heavily transcribed during the immediate-early period of infection. The hybridization signal was markedly reduced by base hydrolysis and ribonuclease, and therefore the probe appears to be detecting viral RNA. A fluorescence-activated cell sorter was used to select lymphocytes bearing the OKT4 and OKT8 markers. Hybridization with the HCMV probe revealed a higher proportion of positive cells in the OKT4 than in the OKT8 subset. This observation specifically identifies lymphocytes as a cell population involved in natural HCMV infection and suggests that lymphocytes may be a reservoir for maintaining infection and may also serve as a vehicle for its spread by blood transfusion."

https://openalex.org/W1531843401,"Hydroxyl radicals were generated in the presence of 1 mM dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine) at pH 7.2 (50 mM phosphate buffer) by the following two mechanisms: 1) a classic Fenton-type reaction between hydrogen peroxide and a ferrous chelate (ferrous diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) and 2) the cyclical redox reactions of iron-EDTA/ascorbate. Three ring-monohydroxylated products of dopamine were detected by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection: 2-hydroxydopamine, 5-hydroxydopamine, and 6-hydroxydopamine in an approximate ratio of 3:2:1. Scavengers of hydroxyl radicals (dimethyl sulfoxide, mannitol, ethanol) suppressed the yields of products in a concentration-dependent manner. The formation of nonphysiologic hydroxylated forms of dopamine can provide a probe for the formation of hydroxyl radicals in dopamine neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2063269692,"A newly identified protein from HTLV-III/LAV, the virus implicated as the etiologic agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, was studied. This protein, which has a molecular weight of 27,000 (p27), was shown by amino acid sequencing to have a coding origin 3â€² to the env gene on the HTLV-III genome. The presence of antibodies to p27 in virus-exposed individuals indicated that this gene is functional in the natural host."
https://openalex.org/W1966121423,"Nonhomologous DNA recombination is frequently observed in somatic cells upon the introduction of DNA into cells or in chromosomal events involving sequences already stably carried by the genome. In this report, the DNA sequences at the crossover points for excision of SV40 from chromosomes were shown to be associated with eukaryotic topoisomerase I cleavage sites in vitro. The precise location of the cleavage sites relative to the crossover points has suggested a general model for nonhomologous recombination mediated by topoisomerase I."

https://openalex.org/W2094492583,"Present evidence suggests that the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) emerged in Central Africa as a new disease in recent decades. This disease has recently approached epidemic proportions in many parts of the world. The etiologic agent of AIDS is believed to be the virus HTLV-III/LAV, which has been proposed as having originated from a recent simian-human transmission in Africa. This report describes the isolation of a designated STLV-IIIAGM retrovirus closely related to HTLV-III/LAV from seven healthy wild-caught African Green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) that showed the presence of antibodies designated STLV-IIIAGM. In vitro growth characteristics, ultrastructural morphology, and major proteins of 160,000 kilodaltons (kD), 120 kD, 55 kD, and 24 kD are similar to and cross-reactive with the analogous antigens of HTLV-III/LAV. The use of these serologic markers in the detection of STLV-IIIAGM-infected monkeys may be important in assuring the continued safety of a variety of biologic reagents that are derived from these primate species. The existence of a retrovirus closely related to HTLV-III/LAV that naturally infects an African nonhuman primate in the apparent absence of disease may provide a unique model for the study of human AIDS and the development of an effective vaccine."

https://openalex.org/W1585808802,"Thromboxane synthase from human platelets was purified to apparent homogeneity by conventional chromatographic techniques. A 423-fold enrichment over the specific content in the 100,000 X g sediment from platelet homogenates was obtained. The enzyme gave a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis corresponding to a monomeric molecular weight of 58,800. One heme per polypeptide chain was present, and by optical and EPR spectroscopy a close analogy to the group of cytochrome P-450 proteins was established. From its substrate prostaglandin H2, the stable end product thromboxane B2 is formed with a specific activity of 24.1 mumol min-1 mg of protein-1 which corresponds to a molecular activity of 1628 min-1. The enzyme formed 12L-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid together with thromboxane B2 in a 1:1 ratio. Both products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. As reported previously for platelet microsomes (Ullrich, V., and Haurand, M. (1983) Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 11, 105-110), the pure hemoprotein spectrally interacts with pyridine- or imidazole-based inhibitors and for the potent inhibitor imidazo-(1,5-a)pyridine-5-hexanoic acid a stoichiometric binding to the heme was shown. Substrate analogs with a methylene group replacing the oxygen in either the 9- or 11-position caused difference spectra showing spectral shifts towards 387 and 407 nm, respectively. The identification of thromboxane synthase as a P-450 protein suggests that the heme-thiolate group of the enzyme is required to split and activate the endoperoxide bond of prostaglandin H2."
https://openalex.org/W2061662018,"Recent advances in tumor immunology suggest that the expression of the histocompatibility antigens, encoded by the major histocompatibility complex, is important in controlling the metastatic growth of certain murine tumors. The anomalous expression of histocompatibility antigens in many neoplasms appears to be associated with the ability of these cells to evade the immune system and progress to metastasis. This review examines some of the underlying molecular and immunobiological interactions that might determine the metastatic outcome of cellular transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1582990288,"The Asn-linked oligosaccharides of the pituitary hormone lutropin (LH) contain both sulfate and GalNAc. Bovine pituitary explants incorporate [3H]glucosamine, [3H]mannose, [3H]fucose, and [35S]sulfate into the Asn-linked oligosaccharides of LH. Endoglycosidase F or N-glycanase releases the [3H]glucosamine- and [3H]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides from the protein, which resolve on anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography as neutral (S-0), mono- (S-1), and disulfated (S-2) species. Based on sequential enzyme digestion, methylation, periodate oxidation, and nuclear magnetic resonance studies, the proposed structure for S-2 is as follows: formula see text. Sulfate is confined to position 3 or 4 of GalNAc based on periodate and methylation data and can be removed by methanolysis. The presence of beta-linked GalNAc at a position typically occupied by Gal has not previously been observed."
https://openalex.org/W1529291306,"Horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of p-phenetidine in the presence of either glutathione (GSH), cysteine, or N-acetylcysteine led to the production of the appropriate thioyl radical which could be observed using EPR spectroscopy in conjunction with the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide. This confirms earlier work using acetaminophen (Ross, D., Albano, E., Nilsson, U., and Moldeus, P. (1984) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 125, 109-115). The further reactions of glutathionyl radicals (GS.), generated during horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of p-phenetidine and acetaminophen in the presence of GSH, were investigated by following kinetics of oxygen uptake and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) formation. Oxygen uptake and GSSG generation were dependent on the concentration of GSH but above that which was required for maximal interaction with the primary amine or phenoxy radical generated during peroxidatic oxidation of p-phenetidine or acetaminophen, suggesting that a secondary GSH-dependent process was responsible for oxygen uptake and GSSG production. GSSG was the only product of thiol oxidation detected during peroxidatic oxidation of p-phenetidine or acetaminophen in the presence of GSH, but under nitrogen saturation conditions its production was reduced to 8 and 33% of the corresponding amounts obtained under aerobic conditions in the cases of p-phenetidine and acetaminophen, respectively. Nitrogen saturation conditions did not affect horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed metabolism. This shows that the main route of GSSG generation in such reactions is not by dimerization of GS. but via mechanism(s) involving oxygen consumption such as via GSSG-. or via GSOOH."
https://openalex.org/W1526963923,"We have prepared a monoclonal antibody directed against human thrombomodulin. We used the antibody to measure thrombomodulin molecules in cultured human endothelial cells from umbilical vein and in a human lung cancer cell line (A549). Endothelial cells contain approximately 30,000-55,000 molecules of thrombomodulin/cell while the A549 cell has about 1/4 of this number. About 50-60% of thrombin binding sites on endothelial cells are thrombomodulin, while about 90% of thrombin binding sites on A549 cells are thrombomodulin. Exposure of these cells to thrombin decreased thrombomodulin on the cell surface suggesting that internalization of thrombin-thrombomodulin occurred. The internalized 125I-thrombin was degraded in the cells and thrombomodulin reappeared on the cell surface after 30 min, suggesting the recycling of thrombomodulin. The rate of protein C activation correlated with the presence of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on the cell surface. The binding of thrombin to cell-surface thrombomodulin accelerates protein C activation; the subsequent internalization of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex is associated with cessation of protein C activation. Therefore, endocytosis of thrombin-thrombomodulin may serve to control protein C activation. The uptake and degradation of thrombin bound to thrombomodulin may provide a mechanism for clearance of thrombin from the circulation."

https://openalex.org/W1544535766,"trans-2,5-Bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)tetrahydrofuran (L-652,731) is found to be a potent and orally active platelet activating factor (PAF)-specific and competitive receptor antagonist. It potently inhibits [3H]PAF (1 nM) binding to receptor sites on rabbit platelet membranes with an ED50 of 2 X 10(-8) M under the assay condition without the addition of mono- or divalent cations. In a comparative study, it is more potent than CV-3988, kadsurenone, and ginkgolide B as a receptor antagonist. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KB) of L-652,731 obtained either from the inhibition of receptor binding or from the inhibition of PAF-induced aggregation of gel-filtered rabbit platelet are 2.7 X 10(-8) and 2.1 X 10(-8) M, respectively. The agreement of these KB determinations based on receptor and cellular function suggests that L-652,731 does not inhibit other steps following PAF-receptor binding. L-652,731 does not antagonize the binding of several radioligands to their respective receptor. It shows no inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation induced by other aggregating agents including thrombin, collagen, A-23187, arachidonic acid, epinephrine, and ADP. L-652,731 is orally active; it inhibits PAF-induced rat cutaneous vascular permeability with an ED50 of 30 mg/kg orally. Significant inhibitory results of L-652,731 suggest that PAF may be partially involved in cutaneous vascular permeability induced by histamine and bradykinin."
https://openalex.org/W1660104588,"Gelsolin is a Ca2+-sensitive 90-kDa protein which regulates actin filament length. A molecular variant of gelsolin is present in plasma as a 93-kDa protein. Functional studies have shown that gelsolin contains two actin-binding sites which are distinct in that after Ca2+-mediated binding, removal of free Ca2+ releases actin from one site but not from the other. We have partially cleaved human plasma gelsolin with alpha-chymotrypsin and identified two distinct actin-binding domains. Peptides CT17 and CT15, which contain one of the actin-binding domains, bind to actin independently of Ca2+; peptides CT54 and CT47, which contain the other domain, bind to actin reversibly in response to changes in Ca2+ concentration. These peptides sequester actin monomers inhibiting polymerization. Unlike intact gelsolin, neither group of peptides nucleates actin assembly or forms stable filament end caps. CT17 and CT15 can however sever actin filaments. Amino acid sequence analyses place CT17 at the NH2 terminus of gelsolin and CT47 at the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of gelsolin. Circular dichroism measurements show that Ca2+ induces an increase in the alpha-helical content of CT47. These studies provide a structural basis for understanding the interaction of gelsolin with actin and allow comparison with other Ca2+-dependent actin filament severing proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1911473345,"Plasma gelsolin formed a very tight 1:2 complex with G-actin in the presence of Ca2+, but no interaction between gelsolin and G-actin was detected in the presence of excess EGTA. However, the 1:2 complex dissociated into a 1:1 gelsolin:actin complex and monomeric actin when excess EGTA was added. Plasma gelsolin bound tightly to the barbed ends of actin filaments and also severed filaments in the presence of Ca2+ and bound weakly to the filament barbed end in the presence of EGTA. The 1:2 gelsolin-actin complex bound to the barbed ends of filaments but did not sever them. By blocking the barbed end of filaments with plasma gelsolin, we determined the critical concentration at the pointed end in 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM ATP to be 4 microM. The dissociation rate constant for ADP-G-actin from the pointed end was estimated to be about 0.4 s-1 and the association rate constant to be about 5 X 10(4) M-1 s-1. Finally, we obtained evidence that plasma gelsolin accelerates but does not bypass the nucleation step and, therefore, that the concentration of gelsolin does not directly determine the concentration of filaments polymerized in its presence. Thus, gelsolin-capped filaments may not provide an absolutely reliable method for determining the rate constant for the association of ATP-G-actin at the pointed ends of filaments, but a reasonable estimate would be 1 X 10(5) M-1 s-1 in 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1542572705,"We report the purification to apparent homogeneity of an active opioid-binding protein solubilized from bovine striatal membranes. The purification was accomplished in two steps: affinity chromatography on beta-naltrexylethylenediamine (NED)-CH-Sepharose 4B followed by lectin affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. The ligand affinity-purified fraction exhibits stereospecific and saturable binding of opiates and is heat-sensitive. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate of the NED-purified material gave 6-8 bands by silver staining or autoradiography of radioiodinated material. Under nondenaturing conditions, the NED-purified material elutes in a molecular mass range between 300 and 350 kDa from gel exclusion chromatography on Ultrogel AcA-34. The specific activity of the affinity-purified fraction (800-1500 pmol/mg protein) is enriched 4000 to 7000-fold over that of the membrane-bound or unpurified soluble receptor. Further purification (10-20-fold) is achieved by chromatography of the NED eluate on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. The eluted fraction shows a single protein (65 kDa) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified material is an acidic glycoprotein with a pI of 6.0-6.3 and binds opiates with a specific activity (12,000-15,000 pmol/mg) that is 65,000 to 75,000-fold greater (theoretical, 77,000-fold) than that of the membrane-bound or crude soluble receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1977222214,"A biphasic plasmid vector was used to introduce the Escherichia coli K-12 lac operon into the unicellular cyanobacterium Agmenellum quadruplicatum PR-6. The PR-6 transformants expressed beta-galactosidase at nearly as high a level as did Escherichia coli transformants. In order to accomplish this, it was necessary to obtain PR-6 mutants that could be transformed by plasmids with unmodified recognition sites for the endogenous PR-6 restriction endonuclease Aqu I. These mutants were generated by a variation of the ectopic mutagenesis techniques that have been used in other naturally transforming bacteria. The ability to assay the expression of lacZ in PR-6 paves the way for the construction of gene fusions with various PR-6 promoters and quantitation of their expression under specific in vivo conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2102345343,"A structural gene of kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase cloned into a single-stranded bacteriophage M13 was subjected to mutagenesis with hydroxylamine. Having recloned the mutagenized gene of the enzyme in a vector plasmid pTB922, the recombinant plasmid was used to transform Bacillus stearothermophilus with a purpose of screening for the more thermostable enzyme than the wild type. Out of greater than 8 X 10(3) transformants, 12 clones that were suspected to harbor the mutant gene encoding the more thermostable enzyme were isolated by shifting from a permissive (55 degrees C) to a nonpermissive (61 degrees C) temperature that inactivates the wild-type enzyme. DNA sequence analysis of the mutant genes revealed two types of mutation of single base substitution and hence a single amino acid replacement. The first type was the replacement of an aspartate by a tyrosine at position 80 of the wild-type enzyme, while the second was that of a threonine by a lysine at position 130. Purified enzymes from the two mutant genes were confirmed to be substantially more thermostable than the wild type in vitro. The method of screening for a thermostable kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase presented here could be applied to any other enzyme, if a transformation system of a thermophile were available. Indeed, thermostable mutants with a subtle amino acid change would be of value for better understanding of forces and interactions that contribute to the stability of a protein."
https://openalex.org/W1528394002,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme was purified from human lung, kidney, testis, blood plasma, and seminal plasma using a facile two-step protocol which included affinity chromatography on Sepharose-bound lisinopril followed by either gel filtration or hydroxylapatite chromatography. Molecular mass for converting enzyme from all sources except testis was 140 kDa. That from testis consisted of both a 90- and a 140-kDa form in a 4:1 ratio. Detergent-extracted membrane-bound converting enzyme aggregated on gel filtration chromatography, while trypsin-extracted and soluble converting enzyme did not. Comparison of detergent-extracted and trypsin-extracted membrane-bound converting enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing indicated that the membrane binding sequence contributed minimally to the size and charge of the enzyme. Catalytic and kinetic properties assessed by interaction with substrates, inhibitors, and anti-converting enzyme immunoglobulin were similar for all forms and sources of converting enzyme. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed only partial homology between the 90- and 140-kDa forms of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1504893374,"The disposition of newly synthesized sterols in cultured human fibroblasts has been examined in this study. We began by demonstrating that cholesterol mass and exogenously added [3H]cholesterol both are markers for the plasma membrane, perhaps better than 5'-nucleotidase. Cells were incubated with radioactive acetate to label their endogenous sterols biosynthetically, treated with cholesterol oxidase to convert plasma membrane cholesterol to cholestenone, and then homogenized and spun to equilibrium on sucrose gradients. The density gradient profiles of the various organelles were monitored using these markers: plasma membrane, radioactive cholestenone; smooth endoplasmic reticulum, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase); and Golgi apparatus, galactosyltransferase. The buoyant density profiles of radioactive intracellular cholesterol and lanosterol both had a peak at 1.12 g/cm3, similar to 5'-nucleotidase and galactosyltransferase but not to HMG-CoA reductase. This result suggests that cholesterol biosynthesis is not taken to completion in the endoplasmic reticulum. Digitonin treatment shifted the profiles of both plasma membrane and intracellular cholesterol to higher densities. Pretreatment of intact cells with cholesterol oxidase abolished the digitonin shift of plasma membranes but not the intracellular cholesterol, indicating that these two membrane pools are not entirely physically associated. Because intracellular cholesterol was shifted more than any of the organelle markers, it must reside in a separate membrane. Since digitonin selectively shifts the density of membranes rich in cholesterol, we infer that newly synthesized cholesterol accumulates in such membranes prior to its delivery to the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that cholesterol may be concentrated for delivery to the plasma membrane by being synthesized from a sterol precursor such as lanosterol in a discrete but undefined intracellular membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2278851972,"The ability of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) to stimulate adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) synthesis in corticotrophs was assessed by measuring total cell content of ACTH and the levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA in a cloned tumor cell line of the mouse anterior pituitary (AtT-20/D16-16). CRF treatment caused a time-dependent increase in POMC mRNA levels (measured using a hybridization technique) as well as elevating total ACTH content in AtT-20 cells. The increase in POMC mRNA levels preceded changes in ACTH content and slowly returned toward control levels after CRF withdrawal. The rise in POMC mRNA levels following CRF stimulation appeared to be specific since beta-actin mRNA levels were not affected by CRF treatment. Both 8-bromo-cAMP and phorbol ester increased POMC mRNA levels in AtT-20 cells, suggesting that CRF may act through different protein kinases to regulate the POMC gene. CRF appears to activate the POMC gene since treatment of the AtT-20 cells with the peptide increased the levels of an RNA species in the nuclei having the expected molecular weight of the transcript of the POMC gene. The results indicate that continued exposure of corticotrophs to CRF induces long term increases in the ACTH synthetic capacity of those cells."
https://openalex.org/W1587039134,"Mutant yeast strains were constructed which carry insertion mutations in each of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase structural genes which have been designated TDH1, TDH2, and TDH3. Haploid strains carrying mutations in TDH1 and TDH2 as well as TDH1 and TDH3 were isolated from crosses between strains carrying the appropriate single mutations. The three single mutants as well as the two double mutants grow at wild type rates when ethanol is used as carbon source. Mutant strains lacking only a functional TDH2 allele or a TDH3 allele grow at 50 and 75% of the rate observed for wild type cells, respectively, when glucose is used as carbon source. No growth phenotype was observed for strains lacking only a functional TDH1 allele when either fermentable or nonfermentable carbon sources were used. Evidence is presented that strains lacking functional TDH2 and TDH3 alleles are not viable. These data demonstrate that the presence of a functional TDH2 or TDH3 allele is required for cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1595375154,"We have examined the mechanism by which hemin regulates the expression of the human transferrin receptor. Previous work led to the suggestion that the regulatory signal is provided by heme (Ward J. H., Jordan, I., Kushner, J. P., and Kaplan, J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13235-13240). We demonstrated that hemin regulates the expression of the receptor via alterations in the rate of receptor biosynthesis. However, this effect can be completely abolished by addition of desferrioxamine, an intracellular iron chelator. Competition curves demonstrate that desferrioxamine and hemin affect the same intracellular iron pool. Since the chelator cannot remove iron from heme, we propose that hemin acts simply by delivering iron to a chelatable iron pool and that levels of chelatable iron provide the regulatory signal for expression of the transferrin receptor gene."
https://openalex.org/W1836582633,"Binding experiments with 125I-atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) followed by covalent attachment with disuccimidyl suberate show that the peptide binds predominantly to a protein of apparent molecular mass of 66,000 daltons on the cell surface of cultured bovine aortic smooth muscle cells. A minor protein species of 180,000 Mr is also visualized after cross-linking. Endothelial cells, however, whose ANF binding parameters differ substantially from smooth muscle cells, also appear to have qualitatively identical 125I-ANF binding proteins. The identity of these putative proteins, as the ANF receptor, is confirmed by findings that covalent attachment of 125I-ANF is saturable, concentration-dependent, and competed by nanomolar concentrations of unlabeled ANF. Furthermore, other peptide hormones such as angiotensin II, glucagon, or insulin are ineffective in competing for 125I-ANF binding and cross-linking to the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1630596600,"The wild-type yeast nuclear gene MST1 complements mutants defective in mitochondrial protein synthesis. The gene has been sequenced and shown to code for a protein of 54,030 kDa. The predicted product of MST1 is 36% identical over its 462 residues to the Escherichia coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase. Amino-acylation of wild-type mitochondrial tRNAs with a mitochondrial extract from mst1 mutants fail to acylate tRNAThr1 (anticodon: 3'-GAU-5') but show normal acylation of tRNAThr2 (anticodon: 3'-UGU-5'). These data suggest the presence of two separate threonyl-tRNA synthetases in yeast mitochondria. Antibodies were prepared against a trpE/MST1 fusion protein containing the 321 residues from the amino-terminal region of the E. coli anthranilate synthetase and 118 residues of the mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase. Antibodies to the fusion protein detect a 50-55-kDa protein in wild type yeast mitochondria but not in mitochondria of a strain in which the chromosomal MST1 gene was replaced by a copy of the same gene disrupted by insertion of the yeast LEU2 gene. The ability of the mutant with the inactive MST1 gene to charge tRNAThr2 argues strongly for the existence of a second threonyl-tRNA synthetase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1611419319,"The gene which codes for isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase of Escherichia coli, aceK, has been cloned. Physical and functional mapping of this clone indicated that both the isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase and isocitrate dehydrogenase phosphatase activities are encoded by an 1800-base pair sequence. This sequence produced a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 66,000, which is identical to that of the purified protein. Since a protein of this size would require an 1800-base pair coding sequence, we conclude that isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase and isocitrate dehydrogenase phosphatase are expressed from a single gene. This strongly suggests that both activities reside on the same polypeptide chain. The cloning of aceK was made possible by the fortuitous addition of a second origin of replication to the expression vectors which were employed. These expression vectors were found to inhibit the growth of E. coli on the minimal acetate selective medium. The inclusion of a second origin of replication reduced the copy number and so reduced the inhibitory effects of these vectors. Control of the copy number through the addition of replication origins may have a general facility when manipulating plasmids which are potentially toxic to E. coli."

The wild type gene MSW capable of complementing the protein synthesis defect has been cloned by transformation of one of the mutants with a genomic library of wild type yeast nuclear DNA. The cloned gene has been sequenced and shown to code for a protein with a molecular weight of 42,414 which is 37 and 39% identical to the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases of Escherichia coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus, respectively. A strain containing an insertion in the chromosomal copy of MSW was constructed by in situ gene replacement. This mutant fails to charge mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA providing further evidence that MSW is the structural gene for mitochondrial tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase. The existence of another gene coding for the cytoplasmic tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase is inferred from the observation that mutations in MSW are not lethal but only result in a respiratory deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1515074819,"Abstract Na movement across the plasma membranes of confluent monolayers of monkey kidney epithelial cells (BSC-1) was studied using 22Na+ uptake and efflux techniques in the presence of 10(-4) M ouabain. In the presence of 28 mM bicarbonate, uptake was inhibited by both 10(-3) M amiloride and 10(-3) M 4,4'diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS). In DIDS-pretreated cells, 10(-3) M amiloride led to a further reduction of 22Na+ uptake, while 10(-5) furosemide was ineffective. DIDS also inhibited sodium efflux, indicating that the DIDS-sensitive pathway mediates both influx and efflux of 22Na+. DIDS-sensitive 22Na+ uptake, as studied in the presence of both 10(-4) M ouabain and 10(-3) M amiloride, was abolished by the absence of bicarbonate, which could not be substituted by other plasma membrane-permeable buffers. In 28 mM HCO3-, DIDS-sensitive uptake of 28 mM Na+ was cis-inhibited by 124 mM Na+, but no significant inhibition by K+ or Li+ was found. DIDS-sensitive 22Na+ uptake was a saturable function of both Na+ concentration (apparent Km between 20 and 40 mM at 28 mM HCO3-) and HCO3- concentration (apparent Km between 7 and 14 mM at 151 mM Na+). Intracellular microelectrode measurements showed that net Na+ transport in the presence of HCO3- is electrogenic, i.e. that there is anion cotransport with Na+. This effect is abolished by 1 mM DIDS. It is concluded that monkey kidney epithelial cells possess a stilbene-sensitive, electrogenic sodium bicarbonate symport, which may play an important role in bicarbonate reabsorption in the mammalian kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1558968590,"The mannose-permease complex of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotranferase system exhibits two apparently unrelated activities. It mediates active transport concomitant with phosphorylation of mannose, 2-deoxyglucose, and a number of other hexoses, and it is required for penetration of bacteriophage lambda DNA across the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli. A cloned fragment of E. coli chromosome restores mannose-fermentation in, and confers lambda sensitivity to, an E. coli strain with a mutation in the gene for the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent mannose uptake. Using complementation analysis of phosphotransferase activity and of lambda sensitivity, a 3.8-kilobase pair fragment was shown to carry two adjacent genes, ptsM and ptsL. Although each gene has a promoter of its own, transcription of ptsL has a positive polar effect on the transcription of ptsM. A complex of two proteins, IIMan and IIIMan, was purified to homogeneity from an overproducing strain. IIMan is encoded by gene ptsM, IIIMan by gene ptsL. IIMan, a 27-kDa protein, is the transmembrane component of the complex. IIIMan, a 35-kDa protein, exists as a dimer and is found both membrane-associated and free in the cytoplasm. IIIMan can be phosphorylated in a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent reaction, while phosphorylation of IIMan could not be detected. IIMan and IIIMan are both required for phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose in vitro, while IIMan alone is sufficient to confer lambda sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1597581984,"Glycosomes, purified from trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma brucei, contained all the enzymes necessary to convert glucose to alpha-glycerophosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate. The multienzyme reaction which produces 2 alpha-glycerophosphate, 2 ADP, and 2 NAD+ from 1 glucose, 2 ATP, and 2 NADH was studied spectrophotometrically. Intact glycosomes, suspended with 5.6 mM alpha-glycerophosphate and 2 mM ADP, produced ATP inside the glycosomes for glucose phosphorylation at a rate of 0.7 mumol/min/mg protein, so confirming the feasibility of producing ATP from alpha-glycerophosphate and ADP catalyzed by glycosomal glycerol kinase, and coupling this ATP production to the ATP-requiring stages of glycolysis. No evidence was found for direct channeling of the ATP generated by glycerol kinase and either hexokinase or phosphofructose kinase in glycosomal enzyme complexes cross-linked by dimethyl suberimidate treatment of intact glycosomes prior to solubilization of their membrane. Compartmentation of glycolytic intermediates, enzymes, and ATP inside isolated glycosomes was demonstrated by their inaccessibility to exogenous enzymes. We conclude that the compartmentation of the glycosome and the efficient production of ATP in the glycosome from whole cell concentrations of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and ADP account for the observed whole cell production of equimolar glycerol from glucose with net ATP synthesis by T. brucei under anaerobic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2116001354,"A sensitive assay method developed to examine the effects of subtle, physiologically relevant, changes in the levels of adenine and guanine mono-, di-, and triphosphorylated nucleotides specifically on the initiation of protein synthesis is described. Initiation rates are quantified by measuring the amount of protein synthesis resulting from the run-off of ribosomes which have initiated during defined intervals in a modified in vitro protein-synthesizing system developed from Ehrlich ascites tumor cell lysates (Henshaw, E.C., and Panniers, R. (1983) Methods Enzymol. 101, 616-629). The modifications include the attenuation of the ATP-regenerating system so that the relative nucleotide levels more nearly reflect actual intracellular conditions. With this system the rate of initiation is highly sensitive to changes in the ADP:ATP and GDP:GTP ratios, but indifferent to the absolute levels of either diphosphate. While the tight coupling of these two ratios by endogenous nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity prevents the independent manipulation of either ratio, the data do eliminate both AMP and GMP per se as inhibitory species. The close agreement of our data calculated in terms of energy charge to previously published results on overall rates of protein synthesis in rat thymocytes (Mendelsohn, S.K., Nordeen, S.K., and Young, D.A. (1977) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 79, 53-60) continues to suggest a physiologically relevant regulatory influence of subtle changes in nucleotides acting at the level of the initiation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1568220210,"Extensive spectroscopic investigations of chloroperoxidase and cytochrome P-450 have consistently revealed close similarities between these two functionally distinct enzymes. Although the CO-bound ferrous states were the first to display such resemblance, additional comparisons have focused on the native ferric and ferrous and the ligand-bound ferric derivatives of the enzymes. In order to test the extent to which the spectral properties of the two enzymes match each other, we have prepared the NO, alkyl isocyanide, and O2 adducts of ferrous chloroperoxidase, the latter two for the first time. As expected, the NO adducts of the two proteins have similar UV-visible absorption and magnetic circular dichroism spectra; the same behavior is observed for the alkyl isocyanide complexes. Unexpectedly, the dioxygen adduct of ferrous chloroperoxidase (i.e. Compound III), generated in cryogenic solvents at -30 degrees C by bubbling with O2, is spectrally distinct from oxy-P-450-CAM. Identification of this derivative as oxygenated chloroperoxidase is based on the following criteria: It is EPR-silent at 77 K. The bound O2 is dissociable as judged by the uniform conversion to the CO-bound form. Oxy-chloroperoxidase autoxidizes to form the native ferric enzyme without detectable intermediates at a rate comparable to that determined for oxy-P-450-CAM. Oxy-chloroperoxidase exhibits optical absorption (lambda nm (epsilon mM) = 354 (41), 430 (94), 554 (16.5), 587 (12.5)) and magnetic circular dichroism spectra that are clearly distinct from those of histidine-ligated heme proteins such as oxy-myoglobin or oxy-horseradish peroxidase. Surprisingly, several of its spectral properties, namely the red-shifted Soret peak and discrete alpha peak, are also unlike those of oxy-P-450-CAM. Since considerable evidence has accumulated supporting the ligation of an endogenous thiolate to the heme iron of chloroperoxidase, as has been established for the P-450 enzyme, the observed dissimilarities suggest that the electronic properties of the two dioxygen adducts are quite sensitive to differences in their active site heme environment. This, in turn may be related to the functional differences between the two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1479977535,"As a first step to approach the structural and functional analysis of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (EC 2.7.7.8), we have isolated genomic sequences for the large subunit of the human enzyme. The sequences homologous to Drosophila RNA polymerase II large subunit sequences are present in the genome as single copy genes, when assayed at high stringency. The polypeptide information is encoded in a mRNA of 7.35 kilobases, as determined by Northern blot analysis. In vitro translation reveals a polypeptide of 220 kDa, similar in electrophoretic mobility to the largest subunit of the enzyme. A fusion-polypeptide synthesized in bacteria contains a region that cross-reacts with anti-RNA polymerase II antiserum. Antiserum directed against the purified fusion protein reacts with the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, whether in the intact IIA (220 kDa) or in the degraded IIB (180 kDa) forms. Moreover, the antifusion protein antibody inhibits not only the purified calf thymus RNA polymerase II activity but also specific RNA polymerase II transcription in a HeLa cell extract. Thus, the DNA fragment isolated contains structural and functional domains of the human RNA polymerase II large subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1533330634,"Complex III of beef heart mitochondria was separated into the iron-sulfur protein and the complex devoid of it as described previously (Shimomura, Y., Nishikimi, M., and Ozawa, T. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14059-14063). From the latter preparation, cytochrome c1 was subsequently purified by detergent-exchange chromatography on a phenyl-Sepharose column and DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography. In the former chromatography, the resolution of the iron-sulfur protein-depleted complex was achieved by changes of detergents on the surface of the complex; nearly homogeneous cytochrome c1 was eluted from the column with dodecyl octaethylene glycol mono-ether after dissociation of core proteins and subunit VI with guanidine and cholate. The purified cytochrome c1 consists of a single polypeptide as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and contains 39 nmol of heme/mg of protein. The isolated iron-sulfur protein catalyzes reduction of cytochrome c by ubiquinol, which is insensitive to antimycin, at a rate of 0.03 mumol of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol of protein, while the purified cytochrome c1 has no such catalytic activity. When cytochrome c1 and the iron-sulfur protein form a complex, the rate of cytochrome c reduction increases to 0.12 mumol/min/nmol of the iron-sulfur protein. In this reaction, cytochrome c1 mediates antimycin-insensitive electron transfer from the iron-sulfur protein to cytochrome c, thereby constituting a pathway of electrons: ubiquinol----iron-sulfur protein----cytochrome c1----cytochrome c. The complex formation between the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1 was verified by binding of cytochrome c1 to a column of protein A-Sepharose to which the iron-sulfur protein was linked with immobilized anti-iron-sulfur protein antibody. The electron-transfer activity of the mixture is at a comparable level to that of antimycin-inhibited Complex III, and both activities are partially sensitive to superoxide dismutase. Thus, the above-described coupling of the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1 is considered as reconstitution of the antimycin-insensitive pathway of electrons in Complex III."
https://openalex.org/W1574159182,"Photoaffinity labeling experiments were performed with membranes from rat liver containing V1 vasopressin receptors. Photoreactive analogues of [1-beta-mercaptopropionic acid]vasopressin [( Mpa1], vasopressin, or deamino-vasopressin) retaining a high binding affinity (apparent dissociation constants: 5 X 10(-9) M-3 X 10(-8) M) and agonistic properties were used. The tritium-labeled analogue [Mpa1,Lys(N epsilon-4-azidobenzoyl)8]vasopressin preferentially and specifically labels a 30-kDa polypeptide and with lower efficiency a 38-kDa polypeptide. The analogue [Mpa1,Dab4(N gamma-(N-4-azido-2-nitrophenyl-beta-Ala4]arginine-vasopressin specifically labels the 38-kDa polypeptide. The labeling of these two membrane proteins is completely suppressed by an excess of arginine-vasopressin; bradykinin or angiotensin II do not inhibit the incorporation of the reactive vasopressin analogues into these proteins. The results suggest that the rat hepatic V1 receptor exists in the plasma membrane in an oligomeric form composed of two subunits with a molecular mass of 30 and 38 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W2123603322,"The catalytic properties of the HhaII restriction endonuclease were studied using plasmid pSK11 DNA containing a single 5'-G-A-N-T-C HhaII cleavage site as substrate. Reactions were followed by two methods: 1) gel electrophoretic analysis of nicked circular and linear DNA products, or 2) release of 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate from specifically labeled HhaII sites in a reaction coupled with bacterial alkaline phosphatase. The enzyme is optimally active at 37 degrees C in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.1) and 4-10 mM MgCl2 without added NaCl. Activity is stabilized by the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.2% Triton X-100 or 50 microgram/ml bovine serum albumin. At enzyme concentrations below 10 nM and using pSK11 as substrate, initial kinetic rates were dependent on the order of mixing of reactants. A lag of 3-4 min was observed if enzyme or substrate was added last. Preincubation of substrate and enzyme followed by initiation of the reaction with MgCl2 or preincubation of the enzyme with nonspecific DNA followed by initiation with substrate eliminated or reduced the lag, respectively, and speeded up the reactions. Under a wide range of reaction conditions, nicked pSK11 DNA accumulated early, while linear molecules appeared later, suggesting that HhaII cleaves one strand at a time in separate binding events. The apparent Km for covalently closed pSK11 DNA molecules was approximately 17 nM, and the turnover number for the conversion of covalent to nicked sites was 1.1 single strand scissions/min. Pre-steady state kinetic analysis indicated that cleavage of the first phosphodiester bond in a site is first order with a rate constant of about 0.8 min-1, while cleavage of the second phosphodiester bond is first order with a rate constant of about 0.2 min-1."
https://openalex.org/W1609153276,"An Escherichia coli K12 strain carrying the HhaII methylase and restriction genes on two separate compatible plasmids, pSK5 and pSK7, is used to overproduce the restriction endonuclease. Plasmid pSK5 expresses the methylase gene constitutively from its chloramphenicol resistance gene promoter, and plasmid pSK7 expresses the restriction endonuclease under control of the lacUV5 promoter. Induction of the two-plasmid clone with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside results in a 15-fold increase in HhaII endonuclease activity. The enzyme has been purified to apparent homogeneity. It migrates as a 23-kilodalton polypeptide on denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoretic gels and as a 52-kilo-dalton native protein dimer on a high pressure liquid chromatography sizing column."
https://openalex.org/W1520300276,"The cation specificity of dolichol kinase of mammalian brain and the potential involvement of a Ca2+-calmodulin system in regulation of this enzyme have been studied. Among 10 divalent cations examined, Zn2+ was found to be most effective for the activation of dolichol kinase of rat and calf brain and cultured C-6 glial cells. The activations with Ca2+, Co2+, and Mg2+ were 53%, 32%, and 18% of the full activation with Zn2+, respectively. No combinations of the cations could activate the enzyme as much as Zn2+ alone. A role for a Ca2+-calmodulin system in the regulation of brain dolichol kinase was not supported by our data. First, the concentration of free Ca2+ required for the maximum activation of dolichol kinase was two to three orders of magnitude greater than the concentration required by typical calmodulin-dependent enzymes. Second, neither the depletion of calmodulin from the microsomal fraction nor the addition of exogenous calmodulin caused an alteration in the activation of dolichol kinase by Ca2+ (or Zn2+). Third, antagonists of calmodulin failed to suppress the activation of the enzyme by Ca2+ (or Zn2+). The data raise the possibility that Zn2+ is involved in the regulation of dolichol kinase in brain."
https://openalex.org/W1564270377,"Upon photoirradiation under aerobic conditions, the porphyrin prosthetic group in Mg-substituted horseradish peroxidase was oxidized to a mixture of its pi-cation radical and an oxidized product with an absorption band at 448 nm. The 448 nm compound was then converted to a 489 nm compound in the dark and the activation energy for the conversion was 19.3 kcal/mol. About 1 mol of O2 was consumed per mol of the 448 nm compound formed and no O2 consumption was seen in the dark reaction. The substitution of ethyl groups (meso) and hydroxyethyl groups (hemato) for the vinyl groups in protoporphyrin IX did not have an effect on the result. Under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of a suitable electron acceptor, the only photooxidation product of porphyrin was its pi-cation radical. The formation of hydroxyl radicals during irradiation under aerobic conditions was confirmed by the spin-trapping method. The formation of the above two radicals could be followed by ESR spectroscopy separately at a fixed magnetic field which was set to maximize each ESR signal. The rate of hydroxyl radical formation depended linearly on the concentration of Mg peroxidase. The photooxidation of porphyrin was slow and gave nonspecific product(s) when Mg protoporphyrin IX was present in the heme crevice of apomyoglobin or free in solution."
