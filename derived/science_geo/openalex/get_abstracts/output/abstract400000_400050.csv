https://openalex.org/W2122478167,"We evaluated the metabolic impact of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation by administering a synthetic FXR agonist (GW4064) to mice in which obesity was induced by a high fat diet. Administration of GW4064 accentuated body weight gain and glucose intolerance induced by the high fat diet and led to a pronounced worsening of the changes in liver and adipose tissue. Mechanistically, treatment with GW4064 decreased bile acid (BA) biosynthesis, BA pool size, and energy expenditure, whereas reconstitution of the BA pool in these GW4064-treated animals by BA administration dose-dependently reverted the metabolic abnormalities. Our data therefore suggest that activation of FXR with synthetic agonists is not useful for long term management of the metabolic syndrome, as it reduces the BA pool size and subsequently decreases energy expenditure, translating as weight gain and insulin resistance. In contrast, expansion of the BA pool size, which can be achieved by BA administration, could be an interesting strategy to manage the metabolic syndrome.

Besides their well established roles in dietary lipid absorption and cholesterol homeostasis, BAs also function as biological signaling molecules, endowing them with an endocrine function (1Houten S.M.

FXR regulates the expression of the short heterodimer partner (Shp, NR0B2) that inhibits the activity of several other nuclear receptors and contributes to the negative feedback regulation of BA biosynthesis. SHP inhibits the activity of liver X receptor α and β (liver X receptor α, NR1H3; liver X receptor β, NR1H2) and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2), both necessary for transcriptional induction of the rate-limiting enzyme in BA biosynthesis, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) (8Brendel C.

The FXR-mediated induction of FGF19 (FGF15 in mouse) in intestinal epithelial cells also contributes to the feedback repression of BA biosynthesis. FGF15/19 passes via the portal vein to the hepatocytes and acts on FGFR4 (14Holt J.A. Luo G. Billin A.N. Bisi J. McNeill Y.Y. Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M. Wang D.Y. Mansfield T.A. Kliewer S.A. Goodwin B.

A final pathway through which BAs signal recently emerged and involves the binding and activation of G-protein-coupled receptors such as TGR5 (also named GPR131 or M-BAR) (18Kawamata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Harada M. Yoshida H. Miwa M. Fukusumi S. Habata Y. Itoh T. Shintani Y. Hinuma S. Fujisawa Y. Fujino M. J. Biol.

Through the activation of this G-protein-coupled receptor, BAs induce intracellular cAMP levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and skeletal muscle. This leads to activation of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2), the enzyme that converts inactive thyroxine into active 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (20Bianco A.C. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), which determines thyroid hormone receptor saturation, as well as the activation of the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Via this pathway, energy expenditure in BAT and skeletal muscle is stimulated, translating into weight loss and insulin sensitization (21Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Mataki C. Christoffolete M.A. Kim B.W. Sato H. Messaddeq N. Harney J.W. Ezaki O. Kodama T. Schoonjans K. Bianco A.C. Auwerx J. Nature. 2006; 439: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TGR5 was recently shown also to enhance insulin secretion through its stimulating effects on GLP-1 release in entero-endocrine L-cells (22Thomas C. Gioiello A. Noriega L. Strehle A. Oury J. Rizzo G. Macchiarulo A. Yamamoto H. Mataki C. Pruzanski M. Pellicciari R. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Cell Metab. 2009; 10: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations build a strong case that BAs have effects beyond the strict control of BA homeostasis and function as general metabolic integrators. In view of the complex signaling cascades induced by BAs, it is not all that surprising that the effects of BAs are not totally mimicked by those of synthetic FXR agonists. In fact, we previously reported that high fat fed mice treated with the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 have a tendency to increase body weight (21Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Mataki C. Christoffolete M.A. Kim B.W. Sato H. Messaddeq N. Harney J.W. Ezaki O. Kodama T. Schoonjans K. Bianco A.C. Auwerx J. Nature. 2006; 439: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide compelling evidence that FXR activation with a synthetic agonist, GW4064, induces obesity and diabetes in high fat fed C57BL/6J mice, an effect that is diametrically opposite to the beneficial impact of the natural BA, cholic acid (CA), in this mouse model. We trace the metabolic differences between natural and synthetic FXR agonists to their opposing actions on BA pool size. CA was obtained from Sigma. GW4064 was a generous gift of Mitsubishi Pharmaceuticals. Animal experiments were approved by the institutional review board at Keio University. Male C57BL/6J mice, 6–7 weeks of age, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (l'Arbresle, France) and CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). All mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled (23 °C) facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and were given free access to food and water. The control diet and high fat diet were obtained from Research Diets, Inc. The control diet (D12450D) contained 26.2% protein, 67.3% carbohydrate, and 4.3% fat, and the high fat diet (D12492) contained 26.2% protein, 26.3% carbohydrate, and 34.9% fat. For treatment with CA, mice were fed diets with 0.5% (w/w) CA. GW4064 (180 mg/kg w/w) was mixed with diets. Based on a daily food intake of 5 g, this resulted in a daily dose of 15 mg/kg GW4064. The mice were fasted 6 h before harvesting blood for subsequent blood measurements and tissues for RNA isolation and histology. Oxygen consumption was measured using the Oxymax apparatus (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) (23Picard F. Géhin M. Annicotte J. Rocchi S. Champy M.F. O'Malley B.W. Chambon P. Auwerx J.

Pieces of mouse tissues were fixed in Bouin's solution, dehydrated in ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and cut at a thickness of 5 μm. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Expression levels were analyzed in cDNA synthesized from total mRNA using real time PCR as described previously (21Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Mataki C. Christoffolete M.A. Kim B.W. Sato H. Messaddeq N.

Glucose was administered by gavage at a dose of 2 g/kg. An intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT) was done in 6-h fasted animals. Insulin was injected at a dose of 0.75 units/kg. Glucose quantification was done with the Maxi kit glucometer 4 (Bayer Diagnostic, Puteaux, France) or glucose RTU (bioMérieux Inc., Marcy l'Etoile, France). Plasma insulin and leptin concentrations were measured using ELISA (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove, IL). Serum total cholesterol, TG, and free fatty acids were measured as described previously (17Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Wang L. Moschetta A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Heyman R.A. Moore D.D. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1408-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). TG, free fatty acids, and total cholesterol in the 3T3-L1 cells and liver were extracted by the classical Folch method (24Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and measured as described previously (17Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Wang L. Moschetta A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Heyman R.A. Moore D.D.

Differentiation of preadipocytes 2 days after confluence was induced by exposing them to a differentiation medium containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM for 48 h (27Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then the culture medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 μg/ml insulin, and with or without 10 μm GW4064 or 20 μm chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). Culture medium was changed every day. Four days after the initiation of adipocyte differentiation, cells were stimulated with insulin (5 μg/ml), and the decrease of glucose in the medium was measured after 12 h. 3T3-L1 cells and frozen tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was determined. Antibodies to total Akt and phosphorylated-Akt (Ser-473) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to IRS-1 and phosphorylated-IRS-1 (Ser-307) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Values were reported as means ± S.E. Statistical differences were determined using analysis of variance (StatView software, Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Statistical significance is displayed as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus high fat diet and as #, p < 0.05, or ##, p < 0.01, versus high fat diet supplemented with GW4064. We first evaluated the metabolic effects of FXR activation with the synthetic agonist GW4064 in male C57BL/6J mice. These mice received either normal chow, a high fat diet, or a high fat diet supplemented with GW4064 or CA for 3 months. Food intake was not affected by any of these treatments (Fig. 1A). When compared with animals fed a normal chow, high fat fed animals gained more weight. The animals fed with the same high fat diet supplemented with CA gained weight at a rate comparable with mice fed the standard chow (Fig. 1A). GW4064 induced a rather spectacular increase in weight gain (Fig. 1A). At the end of the study, the weight of the liver, epididymal white adipose tissue (epWAT), and BAT of the high fat fed animals were all significantly increased (Fig. 1B). GW4064 administration induced a more pronounced increase in fat-induced changes in liver and adipose tissue mass. CA completely prevented these changes (Fig. 1B). FXR regulates BA homeostasis. Therefore, we analyzed BA composition in the enterohepatic organs of the mice subjected to the different treatments. In mice fed the high fat diet mixed with GW4064, BA pool size was reduced, and taurocholic acid and CA content were markedly decreased. The relative contribution of tauromuricholic acid increased upon GW4064 treatment (Fig. 1C). Conversely, BA pool size was increased in mice fed a high fat diet mixed with CA due to elevated taurocholic acid and CA content. Tauromuricholic acid was decreased, consistent with our previous report (Fig. 1C) (21Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Mataki C. Christoffolete M.A. Kim B.W. Sato H. Messaddeq N. Harney J.W. Ezaki O. Kodama T. Schoonjans K. Bianco A.C. Auwerx J. Nature. 2006; 439: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Fasting glucose and insulin levels were both increased by feeding a high fat diet and reflected the presence of insulin resistance. Although these parameters were improved by CA, GW4064 increased fasting glucose and insulin levels (Fig. 1D). During an OGTT, administration of CA to high fat fed animals normalized their glucose tolerance, whereas glucose tolerance was significantly poorer after GW4064 treatment (Fig. 1E). Moreover, the slope of the decrease in serum glucose during an IPITT was steeper in mice supplemented with CA than in control high fat fed mice. GW4064 treatment flattened this slope (Fig. 1E). In addition, serum-free fatty acid, TG, and leptin levels were all increased by the addition of GW40464 to the high fat diet, and they were normalized by CA supplementation (Table 2). These data indicate that in a model for diet-induced obesity, GW4064 aggravates and CA improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.TABLE 2Serum and liver lipid levels and serum leptin level in the four treatment groupsHigh fat dietHigh fat diet + GW4064High fat diet + CAControl dietSerumTG (mg/dl)62.89 ± 5.7583.04 ± 5.88ap < 0.05 versus high fat diet.40.16 ± 4.07ap < 0.05 versus high fat diet.45.77 ± 6.38Total cholesterol (mg/dl)177.01 ± 14.57200.91 ± 13.92125.88 ± 9.85ap < 0.05 versus high fat diet.113.87 ± 7.93bp < 0.01 versus high fat diet.Free fatty acids (μEq/liter)628.09 ± 22.19714.44 ± 82.58585.78 ± 31.47597.30 ± 22.27Leptin (pg/ml)6.79 ± 1.6313.04 ± 2.34bp < 0.01 versus high fat diet.2.79 ± 0.20ap < 0.05 versus high fat diet.3.22 ± 0.46ap < 0.05 versus high fat diet.LiverTG (mg/g liver)88.97 ± 7.22159.66 ± 16.36bp < 0.01 versus high fat diet.55.50 ± 5.90ap < 0.05 versus high fat diet.54.77 ± 5.87ap < 0.05 versus high fat diet.TC (mg/g liver)7.01 ± 0.5512.78 ± 1.62bp < 0.01 versus high fat diet.15.21 ± 1.73bp < 0.01 versus high fat diet.5.32 ± 0.76Free fatty acids (μEq/g liver)41.94 ± 6.8956.10 ± 6.6745.99 ± 6.7531.07 ± 1.47a p < 0.05 versus high fat diet.b p < 0.01 versus high fat diet. Open table in a new tab To identify the tissue(s) contributing to the changed metabolic profile after the various treatments of the C57BL/6J mice, we performed a detailed histological survey of the key metabolic tissues (Fig. 2A). This enabled us to compare the effects of GW4064 with those of CA, which we previously characterized in this model (17Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Wang L. Moschetta A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Heyman R.A. Moore D.D. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1408-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 21Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Mataki C. Christoffolete M.A. Kim B.W. Sato H. Messaddeq N. Harney J.W. Ezaki O. Kodama T. Schoonjans K. Bianco A.C. Auwerx J. Nature. 2006; 439: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Liver sections of high fat fed animals showed more unstained inclusions, indicating steatosis, which was even more pronounced in livers of GW4064-treated mice. Such inclusions were absent when the high fat diet was supplemented with CA (Fig. 2A) (17Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Wang L. Moschetta A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Heyman R.A. Moore D.D. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1408-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Indeed, analysis of hepatic lipid levels revealed that GW4064 increased the high fat diet-induced TG accumulation, whereas this was completely prevented by the supplementation of CA (Table 2). Both treatments increased hepatic cholesterol levels, consistent with the inhibition of BA biosynthesis. The high fat diet caused significant adipocyte hypertrophy in both WAT, characterized by a larger adipocyte volume, and BAT, typified by the presence of larger lipid vacuoles within the cells (Fig. 2A). Significantly higher amounts of lipids accumulated in the animals that received GW4064 (Fig. 2A). This adipocyte hypertrophy was decreased when the high fat diet was supplemented with CA (Fig. 2A). Indirect calorimetry was then performed to establish whether the facilitating effect of GW4064 on the development of obesity and lipid accumulation in the tissues was mediated by decreased energy expenditure. A higher CO2 production and O2 consumption was evident in animals fed a high fat diet supplemented with CA compared with animals on a high fat diet (Fig. 2B) (21Watanabe M. Houten S.M. Mataki C. Christoffolete M.A. Kim B.W. Sato H. Messaddeq N. Harney J.W. Ezaki O. Kodama T. Schoonjans K. Bianco A.C. Auwerx J. Nature. 2006; 439: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). GW4064, however, remarkably decreased both O2 consumption and CO2 production, indicating that GW4064 reduced energy expenditure. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the reduced energy expenditure induced by GW4064, we analyzed gene expression in different tissues using quantitative RT-PCR. We focused our attention on the liver, the main metabolic hub and tissue controlling BA biosynthesis, on the ileum, as the site of BA absorption, on the BAT, the tissue coordinating energy expenditure, and on the epWAT, which is a major site for fat storage (Fig. 2C). Hepatic gene expression reflected the changes in BA pool size and its consequences on BA production and cholesterol homeostasis. The mRNA level of Shp was increased, and consequently Cyp7A1 expression was decreased after treatment with either GW4064 or CA, consistent with previous reports (9Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol.

In contrast, mRNA levels of Fxr and Lxrα, which regulate Shp and Cyp7A1 expression, remained unchanged (Fig. 2C). In the ileum, mRNA levels of Ibabp, Shp, and Fgf15 were increased in mice treated with either GW4064 or CA. These three genes have established FXR-response elements in their promoters. In contrast to the parallel changes in liver and ileum, GW4064 and CA had opposing effects in BAT. The mRNA levels of D2 and Pgc-1α were decreased by GW4064, whereas expression of these genes was increased by CA treatment (Fig. 2C).

Consequently, the expression of the mRNAs for uncoupling protein (Ucp) 1 and muscle-type carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (mCPT-I) were significantly decreased after GW4064 treatment, whereas mRNA levels of these genes were increased by CA (Fig. 2C). In addition, expression of the adipogenesis markers, Pparγ and aP2, in epWAT was not changed in response to GW4064 or CA treatment. The expression of leptin and adiponectin reflected the degree of adipocyte hypertrophy in response to the different diets (Fig. 2C). In line with our previous observations (21Watanabe M. Houten S.M.

We therefore activated FXR by the addition of GW4064 or CDCA (a natural ligand of FXR) to the medium of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Glucose uptake into 3T3-L1 cells during 12 h, 5 days after the induction of adipocyte differentiation, is unchanged by either GW4064 or CDCA treatment (Fig. 3A). Both compounds did not increase TG accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3A) nor did they alter the mRNA expression of adipocyte marker genes, aP2, Pparγ, fatty-acid synthase (Fas), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc1) (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we investigated the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB on serine 473 and IRS-1 on serine 307 in 3T3-L1 cells as markers of insulin sensitivity and resistance, respectively (33Aguirre V.

Objectives To determine the magnitude of NCDs and their risk factors in Malawi. Methods Using the WHO STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance, a population-based, nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and September 2009 on participants aged 25–64 years. Socio-demographic and behaviour risk factors were collected in Step 1. Physical anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were documented in Step 2. Blood cholesterol and fasting blood glucose were measured in Step 3. Results and Conclusion A total of 5,206 adults (67% females) were surveyed. Tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking and raised blood pressure (BP) were more frequent in males than females, 25% vs 3%, 30% vs 4% and 37% vs 29%. Overweight, physical inactivity and raised cholesterol were more common in females than males, 28% vs 16%, 13% vs 6% and 11% vs 6%. Tobacco smoking was more common in rural than urban areas 11% vs 7%, and overweight and physical inactivity more common in urban than rural areas 39% vs 22% and 24% vs 9%, all with p<0.05. Overall (both sexes) prevalence of tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and physical inactivity was 14%, 17%, 22%, 10% and prevalence of raised BP, fasting blood sugar and cholesterol was 33%, 6% and 9% respectively. These data could be useful in the formulation and advocacy of NCD policy and action plan in Malawi."

However, the effect of diosgenin on cancer metastasis remains unclear. The aim of the study is to examine the effect of diosgenin on migration and invasion in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.Diosgenin inhibited proliferation of PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. When treated with non-toxic doses of diosgenin, cell migration and invasion were markedly suppressed by in vitro wound healing assay and Boyden chamber invasion assay, respectively. Furthermore, diosgenin reduced the activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 by gelatin zymography assay. The mRNA level of MMP-2, -9, -7 and extracellular inducer of matrix metalloproteinase (EMMPRIN) were also suppressed while tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) was increased by diosgenin. In addition, diosgenin abolished the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PC-3 cells and tube formation of endothelial cells. Our immunoblotting assays indicated that diosgenin potently suppressed the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), Akt, extracellular signal regulating kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In addition, diosgenin significantly decreased the nuclear level of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), suggesting that diosgenin inhibited NF-κB activity.The results suggested that diosgenin inhibited migration and invasion of PC-3 cells by reducing MMPs expression. It also inhibited ERK, JNK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways as well as NF-κB activity. These findings reveal new therapeutic potential for diosgenin in anti-metastatic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1999990093,"Background The impact of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) on reducing malaria incidence is shown mainly through data collection from health facilities. Routine evaluation of long-term epidemiological and entomological dynamics is currently unavailable. In Kenya, new policies supporting the provision of free ITNs were implemented nationwide in June 2006. To evaluate the impacts of ITNs on malaria transmission, we conducted monthly surveys in three sentinel sites with different transmission intensities in western Kenya from 2002 to 2010. Methods and Findings Longitudinal samplings of malaria parasite prevalence in asymptomatic school children and vector abundance in randomly selected houses were undertaken monthly from February 2002. ITN ownership and usage surveys were conducted annually from 2004 to 2010. Asymptomatic malaria parasite prevalence and vector abundances gradually decreased in all three sites from 2002 to 2006, and parasite prevalence reached its lowest level from late 2006 to early 2007. The abundance of the major malaria vectors, Anopheles funestus and An. gambiae, increased about 5–10 folds in all study sites after 2007. However, the resurgence of vectors was highly variable between sites and species. By 2010, asymptomatic parasite prevalence in Kombewa had resurged to levels recorded in 2004/2005, but the resurgence was smaller in magnitude in the other sites. Household ITN ownership was at 50–70% in 2009, but the functional and effective bed net coverage in the population was estimated at 40.3%, 49.4% and 28.2% in 2010 in Iguhu, Kombewa, and Marani, respectively. Conclusion The resurgence in parasite prevalence and malaria vectors has been observed in two out of three sentinel sites in western Kenya despite a high ownership of ITNs. The likely factors contributing to malaria resurgence include reduced efficacy of ITNs, insecticide resistance in mosquitoes and lack of proper use of ITNs. These factors should be targeted to avoid further resurgence of malaria transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2053490823,"Steroid hormones play essential roles in a wide variety of biological processes in multicellular organisms. The principal steroid hormones in nematodes and arthropods are dafachronic acids and ecdysteroids, respectively, both of which are synthesized from cholesterol as an indispensable precursor. The first critical catalytic step in the biosynthesis of these ecdysozoan steroids is the conversion of cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol. However, the enzymes responsible for cholesterol 7,8-dehydrogenation remain unclear at the molecular level. Here we report that the Rieske oxygenase DAF-36/Neverland (Nvd) is a cholesterol 7,8-dehydrogenase. The <i>daf-36/nvd</i> genes are evolutionarily conserved, not only in nematodes and insects but also in deuterostome species that do not produce dafachronic acids or ecdysteroids, including the sea urchin <i>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</i>, the sea squirt <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>, the fish <i>Danio rerio</i>, and the frog <i>Xenopus laevis</i>. An <i>in vitro</i> enzymatic assay system reveals that all DAF-36/Nvd proteins cloned so far have the ability to convert cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol. Moreover, the lethality of loss of <i>nvd</i> function in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is rescued by the expression of <i>daf-36/nvd</i> genes from the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the insect <i>Bombyx mori</i>, or the vertebrates <i>D. rerio</i> and <i>X. laevis</i>. These data suggest that <i>daf-36/nvd</i> genes are functionally orthologous across the bilaterian phylogeny. We propose that the <i>daf-36/nvd</i> family of proteins is a novel conserved player in cholesterol metabolism across the animal phyla."

We also found that miR-22 controls hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) expression in the HCT116 colon cancer cell line. Over-expression of miR-22 inhibits HIF-1α expression, repressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production during hypoxia. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous miR-22 enhances hypoxia induced expression of HIF-1α and VEGF. The conditioned media from cells over-expressing miR-22 contain less VEGF protein than control cells, and also induce less endothelial cell growth and invasion, suggesting miR-22 in adjacent cells influences endothelial cell function. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-22 might have an anti-angiogenic effect in colon cancer."

The disease is characterized by fever and debilitating encephalitis that can progress to chronic illness or fatal infection. In this study, changes in permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in two susceptible animal models (BALB/c, and C57Bl/6 mice) infected with TBE virus were investigated at various days after infection by measuring fluorescence in brain homogenates after intraperitoneal injection of sodium fluorescein, a compound that is normally excluded from the central nervous system. We demonstrate here that TBE virus infection, in addition to causing fatal encephalitis in mice, induces considerable breakdown of the BBB. The permeability of the BBB increased at later stages of TBE infection when high virus load was present in the brain (i.e., BBB breakdown was not necessary for TBE virus entry into the brain), and at the onset of the first severe clinical symptoms of the disease, which included neurological signs associated with sharp declines in body weight and temperature. The increased BBB permeability was in association with dramatic upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine mRNA expression in the brain. Breakdown of the BBB was also observed in mice deficient in CD8+ T-cells, indicating that these cells are not necessary for the increase in BBB permeability that occurs during TBE. These novel findings are highly relevant to the development of future therapies designed to control this important human infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W2061674188,"Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiments probe molecular distances via distance dependent energy transfer from an excited donor dye to an acceptor dye. Single molecule experiments not only probe average distances, but also distance distributions or even fluctuations, and thus provide a powerful tool to study biomolecular structure and dynamics. However, the measured energy transfer efficiency depends not only on the distance between the dyes, but also on their mutual orientation, which is typically inaccessible to experiments. Thus, assumptions on the orientation distributions and averages are usually made, limiting the accuracy of the distance distributions extracted from FRET experiments. Here, we demonstrate that by combining single molecule FRET experiments with the mutual dye orientation statistics obtained from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, improved estimates of distances and distributions are obtained. From the simulated time-dependent mutual orientations, FRET efficiencies are calculated and the full statistics of individual photon absorption, energy transfer, and photon emission events is obtained from subsequent Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the FRET kinetics. All recorded emission events are collected to bursts from which efficiency distributions are calculated in close resemblance to the actual FRET experiment, taking shot noise fully into account. Using polyproline chains with attached Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 dyes as a test system, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by direct comparison to experimental data. We identified cis-isomers and different static local environments as sources of the experimentally observed heterogeneity. Reconstructions of distance distributions from experimental data at different levels of theory demonstrate how the respective underlying assumptions and approximations affect the obtained accuracy. Our results show that dye fluctuations obtained from MD simulations, combined with MC single photon kinetics, provide a versatile tool to improve the accuracy of distance distributions that can be extracted from measured single molecule FRET efficiencies."

https://openalex.org/W2004875218,"Leishmaniasis is a major health problem that affects populations of ∼90 countries worldwide, with no vaccine and only a few moderately effective drugs. Here we report the structure/function characterization of sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) from Leishmania infantum. The enzyme catalyzes removal of the 14α-methyl group from sterol precursors. The reaction is essential for membrane biogenesis and therefore has great potential to become a target for antileishmanial chemotherapy. Although L. infantum CYP51 prefers C4-monomethylated sterol substrates such as C4-norlanosterol and obtusifoliol (Vmax of ∼10 and 8 min−1, respectively), it is also found to 14α-demethylate C4-dimethylated lanosterol (Vmax = 0.9 min−1) and C4-desmethylated 14α-methylzymosterol (Vmax = 1.9 min−1). Binding parameters with six sterols were tested, with Kd values ranging from 0.25 to 1.4 μm. Thus, L. infantum CYP51 is the first example of a plant-like sterol 14α-demethylase, where requirements toward the composition of the C4 atom substituents are not strict, indicative of possible branching in the postsqualene portion of sterol biosynthesis in the parasite. Comparative analysis of three CYP51 substrate binding cavities (Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and L. infantum) suggests that substrate preferences of plant- and fungal-like protozoan CYP51s largely depend on the differences in the enzyme active site topology.

Leishmaniasis is widespread on all populated continents: 12 million people in 88 countries are reported to be infected, with 1–2 million new cases and 60,000 deaths occurring each year. The infection is caused by unicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the genus Leishmania (family Trypanosomatidae, order Kinetoplastida). Similar to many other protozoan parasites, Leishmania has a complex life cycle, including two morphologically different stages and using insects (phlebotomine sand flies) as vector and a variety of mammals as hosts. The insect stage of Leishmania (promastigote) is extracellular: growing in the sand fly intestine. The infection is transmitted to mammals by the sand fly bite (1Bates P.A. Int. J. Parasitol. 2007; 37: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). One of the most remarkable features of Leishmania is that their mammalian stage (amastigotes) lives inside macrophages, the phagocytic mammalian cells that are responsible for killing invaders (2Rodríguez N.E. Gaur U. Wilson M.E. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1106-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). There are ∼25 species of Leishmania known to be pathogenic for humans (3Peacock C.S. Seeger K.

According to the World Health Organization taxonomic scheme, Leishmania species are currently grouped into several complexes, based on their genetic relations and disease manifestation (5Bañuls A.L. Hide M. Prugnolle F. Adv. Parasitol. 2007; 64: 1-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In humans, the disease occurs in at least four major forms: 1) cutaneous, in which parasites remain at the site of infection and cause localized long term ulceration (e.g. Leishmania major); 2) diffuse cutaneous, in which disseminated lesions are subject to relapse after treatment (Leishmania panamensis); 3) mucocutaneous, a chronic destruction of mucosal tissue (Leishmania braziliensis); and 4) visceral (systemic), also known as kala-azar, or black fever (Leishmania donovani complex). Visceral leishmaniasis is the most severe form of the disease, nearly always fatal if untreated. The symptoms include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, profound cachexia, anemia, bone marrow damage, and a sharp decrease of resistance to secondary infections (6Murray H.W. Berman J.D. Davies C.R. Saravia N.G. Lancet. 2005; 366: 1561-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis develops as a sequel to successful kala-azar treatment in 20–60% of patients depending on the geographic area (7Kedzierski L. J. Glob. Infect. Dis. 2010; 2: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The severity of all types of leishmaniases strongly depends on the patient's immune response (5Bañuls A.L. Hide M. Prugnolle F. Adv. Parasitol. 2007; 64: 1-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), HIV coinfection being an emerging problem of particular concern. There are currently no effective vaccines for leishmaniasis (7Kedzierski L. J. Glob. Infect. Dis. 2010; 2: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major clinical drugs used worldwide are two pentavalent antimonials (meglumine antimoniate and stibogluconate): pentamidine and amphotericin B (4Singh S. Sivakumar R. J. Infect. Chemother. 2004; 10: 307-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Except for amphotericin B, which depletes ergosterol from the parasite membranes, the mechanisms of their action remain unclear. It has been shown that inhibitors of fungal sterol biosynthesis, azoles, are often helpful against leishmaniasis (4Singh S. Sivakumar R. J. Infect.

The amino acid sequence identity of CYP51s from Leishmania species to sterol 14α-demethylases from fungi is very low (below 25%), and no data on direct characterization of a CYP51 from Leishmania have been reported. cytochrome P450 sterol 14α-demethylase obtusifoliol (4α,14α-dimethyl-5α-ergosta-8,24(24′)-dien-3β-ol) C4-norlanosterol (4α,14α-dimethylcholesta-8,24-dien-3β-ol) lanosterol (lanosta-8,24-dien-3β-ol) 24,25-dihydrolanosterol (lanosta-8-en-3β-ol) eburicol (24-methylenelanosta-8-en-3β-ol) 14α-methylzymosterol (14α-methylcholesta-8,24-dien-3β-ol) substrate recognition site.

Hide M. Prugnolle F. Adv. Parasitol. 2007; 64: 1-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The parasite belongs to the L. donovani complex and causes visceral leishmaniasis, predominantly in children in the Mediterranean region and in South America. As has been predicted from the CYP51 sequence analysis (14Lepesheva G.I. Hargrove T.Y. Ott R.D. Nes W.D. Waterman M.R. Biochem. Soc.

With lower efficiency, it binds and metabolizes C4-dimethylated sterols (such as eburicol (Ebr) and lanosterol (Lns)) and even C4-desmethylated 14α-methylzymosterol (Mzs). Therefore, in its substrate preferences, L. infantum CYP51 is more similar to the plant-like I105F mutant of Trypanosoma cruzi CYP51 (15Lepesheva G.I. Zaitseva N.G. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Arase M. Liu J.

Thus, L. infantum CYP51 is the first example of a natural plant-like sterol 14α-demethylase with much less strict structural requirements toward substrates. Comparative analysis of three Trypanosomatidae CYP51 x-ray structures suggests a possible connection between the relatively broader substrate specificity of the L. infantum CYP51 ortholog and the volume/topology of its substrate binding cavity. The data support the idea that in Leishmania species, sterol biosynthesis downstream of squalene formation is likely to bifurcate into more than one branch (9Beach D.H. Goad L.J. Holz Jr., G.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Haughan P.A. Goad L.J. Coombs G. North M. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor & Francis, London1991: 312-328Google Scholar) so that the subsequent 14α-demethylation, 4-demethylation, and C24 methylation reactions might vary in their order. This can extend the sterol flow as far as possible down the pathway if one of the enzyme activities is not sufficient at any moment and implies that the other post-squalene sterol biosynthetic enzymes in Leishmania, such as sterol 24C-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.41 or ERG6) and sterol C4-demethylase (EC 1.14.13.72 or ERG25) are also likely to have less strict substrate requirements. Sequence data for the L. infantum genome was from the GeneDB website. A tblastn homology search was carried out using T. cruzi CYP51 (NCBI accession number AY856083) as a template. Alignment was performed by Clustal W1.81 and analyzed in GeneDoc. The putative CYP51 gene (chromosome 11, gene number LinJ11.1100) was PCR-amplified from L. infantum genomic DNA using a FailSafe PCR premix selection kit (Epicenter). The upstream primer 5′-CGCCATATGGCTGGCGAGCTACTCC-3′ contained a unique NdeI cloning site (underlined) and modification of the second codon to alanine (bold) to optimize expression in E. coli as done previously for T. brucei CYP51 (16Lepesheva G.I. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10789-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The rest of the sequence corresponded to the L. infantum CYP51 cDNA. The downstream primer 5′-CGCAAGCTTCAGTGATGGTGATGAGCAGCCGCCTTCTTCTTC-3′ incorporated a unique HindIII cloning site (underlined) followed by a stop codon (bold) and the C-terminal four-histidine tag (italic), the remainder being complementary to the L. infantum CYP51 sequence. The PCR conditions are described in the supplemental materials. The products were purified from an agarose gel and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The correctness of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The L. infantum cDNA and protein sequences were deposited into the NCBI database (accession number EF192938). To obtain the expression construct, the L. infantum CYP51 gene insert was excised from pGEM-T by digestion with NdeI and HindIII (New England Biolabs) and subcloned into pCW (22Barnes H.J.

The expression plasmid was sequenced and transformed into E. coli strain HMS174 (DE3) (Novagen). For the purpose of crystallization, the full-length L. infantum CYP51 sequence was modified by replacing its N-terminal membrane anchor sequence upstream of P32 with MAKKTSSKGKL- (23Lepesheva G.I.

This N-terminal truncation increased the L. infantum CYP51 expression level from ∼70 to >1000 nmol/liter E. coli culture.

The molecular weight and purity of the protein were confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The average yields after the nickel column and CM-Sepharose were 93 and 75% of the P450 detected following membrane solubilization, respectively. UV-visible absorption spectra of L. infantum CYP51 (1.5–10 μm) were recorded at 25 °C on a dual-beam Shimadzu UV-240IPC spectrophotometer. Cytochrome P450 concentration was determined from the absolute absorbance of the Soret band, using ∈417 = 117 mm−1 cm−1 for the low spin ferric form of the protein (16Lepesheva G.I. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10789-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and then confirmed by reduced CO difference spectra taken in the presence of a ∼5-molar excess of sterol substrates (see “Results”), Δ∈450–490 = 91 mm−1 cm−1 (24Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heme content was calculated as the of ratio P450/total protein (15Lepesheva G.I. Zaitseva N.G. Nes W.D.

The spin state of the P450 samples was estimated from the absolute absorbance spectra as the ratio (ΔA393–470/ΔA417.5–470) (25Lepesheva G.I. Strushkevich N.V. Usanov S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); the values 0.4 and 2.0 correspond to 100% low and 100% high spin iron, respectively. In the difference spectra, the percentage of low to high spin transition was calculated using the extinction coefficient Δ∈390–420 = 110 mm−1 cm−1. Titration with sterols was carried out at ∼1.5 μm P450 concentration in a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm EDTA. Substrate binding was monitored as a difference type I spectral response reflecting low to high spin transition of the P450 heme iron (blue shift in the Soret band maximum from 417.5 to 393 nm).

The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of the enzyme-substrate complex were calculated by plotting the absorbance changes in the difference spectra (ΔA390–420) upon titration against free ligand concentration and fitting the data to a rectangular hyperbola in Sigma plot statistics. The concentrations of free substrate were calculated using the following equation, [Sfree]=[Stotal]-E⋅ΔA/ΔAmaxEq. 1 where [S] and [E] are the concentrations of the sterol substrates and the enzyme used for the titration, respectively; ΔA is the difference in the absorption observed at given sterol concentrations; and ΔAmax is the difference in the absorption at 100% low to high spin transition in the heme iron (26Lepesheva G.I. Virus C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9091-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Titration with fluconazole was carried out and quantified in a similar way. Fluconazole was added from a 1 mm stock solution in Me2SO, the inhibitor concentration range being 0.5–30 μm. Type II spectral response reflects absorbance difference between ligand-free and azole coordinated CYP51 (red shift in the Soret band maximum) producing a peak at ∼428 nm and a trough at 409 nm. The standard reaction mixture (16Lepesheva G.I. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10789-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) contained 1 μm L. infantum CYP51 and 3 μm T. brucei cytochrome P450 reductase. After the addition of the radiolabeled sterol substrates (15Lepesheva G.I. Zaitseva N.G. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Arase M. Liu J. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3577-3585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the mixture was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath (GCA Precision Scientific). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 100 μm NADPH and stopped by extraction of the sterols with ethyl acetate. The reaction products were dried, dissolved in methanol, and analyzed by a reverse phase HPLC system (Waters) equipped with a β-RAM detector (INUS Systems, Inc.) using a Nova Pak C18 column (particle size 4 μm, 3.9 × 150 mm) and linear gradient water:acetonitrile:methanol (1.0:4.5:4.5) (solvent A) methanol (solvent B) from 0 to 100% B for 30 min at a flow rate 1 ml/min. Retention times for Mzs, Nls, Obt, and Lns were 21, 23, 25, and 26 min, respectively. Retention time for the reaction intermediate (14α-aldehyde derivative (16Lepesheva G.I. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10789-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)) was ∼9–12 min, depending on the sterol substrate. Time course experiments were carried out at 50 μm concentration of sterol substrates, with 250-μl aliquots being taken over time. No loss of P450 CO spectra was observed under these conditions. For steady-state kinetic analysis, reactions were run for 5 min (except for Lns, for which a 10-min reaction was used), sterol concentration range being 6–75 μm. Michaelis-Menten parameters were calculated using Sigma Plot Statistics, with the reaction rates (nmol/nmol/min) being plotted against total substrate concentration. The initial screening of crystallization conditions was performed using Hampton Research crystallization kits. The crystals were obtained in hanging drops by vapor diffusion at 25 °C, from equal mixtures of a 400 μm P450 solution in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5.8 mm TCEP (Hampton Research) preincubated with 1.68 mm fluconazole and 9.2 mm 3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxatricosan-1-ol (C8E5) (Anatrace) against a well solution containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 9% PEG 6,000. Crystals were soaked briefly in a 30% glycerol cryo-buffer and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. The data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory (LS-CAT, Beamline 21ID-G) and processed with the HKL2000 software package. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using ligand-free T. brucei CYP51 (3g1q) as a search ensemble. Model building and refinement were performed with COOT (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr.

No operations on energy minimization were conducted to preserve experimentally derived atomic coordinates in the CYP51 active site cavities. Molecular volumes and surface areas were calculated in an Accelrys Discovery Studio Visualizer 2.5 (probe radius 1.4 Å). The figures were prepared with Accelrys and Chimera. CYP51 from L. infantum consists of 480 amino acid residues, has a molecular mass of ∼54 kDa, and has an isoelectric point of 7.7. Currently CYP51 sequences from five Leishmania species are available, and amino acid identities to that from L. infantum are: 95% in L. braziliensis, 96% in L. major, and 97% in L. mexicana and Leishmania amazonensis. The identity of L. infantum CYP51 to its orthologs in trypanosomes, T. brucei and T. cruzi, is also rather high, 76 and 75%, respectively. However, it drops to only 26% when compared with the human CYP51 and to 24–25% and 21–23% in comparison with the sequences of plant and fungal sterol 14α-demethylases, respectively. On the other hand, all 36 conserved residues, which we have predicted to play important roles in CYP51 structure/function, particularly the CYP51 B′ and I helix signatures (29Lepesheva G.I.

Strict structural conservation across phylogeny is seen for the length and location of the secondary structural elements (supplemental Fig. S2) as well as for the overall three-dimensional fold, so that the root mean square deviation for the Cα atoms between the L. infantum and human CYP51s is only ∼1.3 Å (supplemental Fig. S3). The heme iron in L. infantum CYP51 is ligated to Cys-422, and the porphyrin ring propionates are supported by six hydrogen bonds with five residues (Tyr-102 and Arg-360 with ring A and Tyr-115, Arg-123, and His-420 with ring D). As in all other (eukaryotic) CYP51s, the entrance into the substrate access channel is formed by helices A′ (which is a substrate recognition site (SRS) (31Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to date unique for CYP51), F″ (SRS2), and β4 hairpin (SRS6). The substrate binding cavity is located between the distal surface of the heme, helix B′, B′/C loop (SRS1), helix C (SRS unique for CYP51), helix I (upstream of SRS4), helix K/β1–4 loop, and β strand 1–4 (SRS5) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Quite interestingly, one C8E5 detergent molecule has been found in the asymmetric unit (supplemental Fig. S4). Surrounded by the structural elements that form the access channels entrances in all four L. infantum CYP51 molecules (helix A′ at both ends and helices F″/G′ in the middle part), the detergent appears to mimic the hydrophobic lipid environment around the substrate channel entrance.TABLE 1SRS in eukaryotic CYP51sResidues (L. infantum numbering)Secondary structural elementsaResidues from these elements can be seen on the L. infantum electron density map in supplemental Fig. S1.SRSSubstrate channel entranceSubstrate binding cavity45–52αA′Unique for CYP51101–115αB′-B′/C loopSRS1123–129αCUnique for CYP51207–213αF″SRS2283–294αISRS4354–360β1–4SRS5456–461β4 hairpinSRS6a Residues from these elements can be seen on the L. infantum electron density map in supplemental Fig. S1.

Alternatively, ECM stiffness can be modulated independently from protein concentration by mechanically loading the ECM. We have developed a novel device for generating stiffness gradients in naturally derived ECMs, where stiffness is tuned by inducing strain, while local mechanical properties are directly determined by laser tweezers based active microrheology (AMR). Hydrogel substrates polymerized within 35 mm diameter Petri dishes are strained non-uniformly by the precise rotation of an embedded cylindrical post, and exhibit a position-dependent stiffness with little to no modulation of local mesh geometry. Here we present the device in the context of fibrin hydrogels. First AMR is used to directly measure local micromechanics in unstrained hydrogels of increasing fibrin concentration. Changes in stiffness are then mapped within our device, where fibrin concentration is held constant. Fluorescence confocal imaging and orbital particle tracking are used to quantify structural changes in fibrin on the micro and nano levels respectively. The micromechanical strain stiffening measured by microrheology is not accompanied by ECM microstructural changes under our applied loads, as measured by confocal microscopy. However, super-resolution orbital tracking reveals nanostructural straightening, lengthening, and reduced movement of fibrin fibers. Furthermore, we show that aortic smooth muscle cells cultured within our device are morphologically sensitive to the induced mechanical gradient. Our results demonstrate a powerful cell culture tool that can be used in the study of mechanical effects on cellular physiology in naturally derived 3D ECM tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1994320541,"Winged-helix transcriptional factors play important roles in the control of gene expression in many organisms. In the plant pathogens Xylella fastidiosa and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the winged-helix protein BigR, a member of the ArsR/SmtB family of metal sensors, regulates transcription of the bigR operon involved in bacterial biofilm growth. Previous studies showed that BigR represses transcription of its own operon through the occupation of the RNA polymerase-binding site; however, the signals that modulate its activity and the biological function of its operon are still poorly understood. Here we show that although BigR is a homodimer similar to metal sensors, it functions as a novel redox switch that derepresses transcription upon oxidation. Crystal structures of reduced and oxidized BigR reveal that formation of a disulfide bridge involving two critical cysteines induces conformational changes in the dimer that remarkably alter the topography of the winged-helix DNA-binding interface, precluding DNA binding. This structural mechanism of DNA association-dissociation is novel among winged-helix factors. Moreover, we demonstrate that the bigR operon is required for hydrogen sulfide detoxification through the action of a sulfur dioxygenase (Blh) and sulfite exporter. As hydrogen sulfide strongly inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, it must be eliminated to allow aerobic growth under low oxygen tension, an environmental condition found in bacterial biofilms, xylem vessels, and root tissues. Accordingly, we show that the bigR operon is critical to sustain bacterial growth under hypoxia. These results suggest that BigR integrates the transcriptional regulation of a sulfur oxidation pathway to an oxidative signal through a thiol-based redox switch.

Using GFP fusion, AtGrxC5 isoform, present exclusively in Brassicaceae, was shown to be localized in chloroplasts. A comparison of the biochemical, structural, and spectroscopic properties of Arabidopsis GrxC5 (WCSYC active site) with poplar GrxS12 (WCSYS active site), a chloroplastic paralog, indicated that, contrary to the solely apomonomeric GrxS12 isoform, AtGrxC5 exists as two forms when expressed in Escherichia coli. The monomeric apoprotein possesses deglutathionylation activity mediating the recycling of plastidial methionine sulfoxide reductase B1 and peroxiredoxin IIE, whereas the dimeric holoprotein incorporates a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments and resolution of the x-ray crystal structure of AtGrxC5 in its holoform revealed that, although not involved in its ligation, the presence of the second active site cysteine (Cys(32)) is required for cluster formation. In addition, thiol titrations, fluorescence measurements, and mass spectrometry analyses showed that, despite the presence of a dithiol active site, AtGrxC5 does not form any inter- or intramolecular disulfide bond and that its activity exclusively relies on a monothiol mechanism."

The Gollum Channels and Whittard Canyon harboured high meiofauna abundances (1054-1426 ind. 10 cm(-2)) and high nematode diversity (total of 181 genera). Next to enhanced meiofauna abundance and nematode biomass, there were signs of high levels of organic matter deposition leading to reduced sedimentary conditions, which in turn structured the nematode community. Striking in this respect was the presence of large numbers of 'chemosynthetic' Astomonema nematodes (Astomonema southwardorum, Order Monhysterida, Family Siphonolaimidae). This genus lacks a mouth, buccal cavity and pharynx and possesses a rudimentary gut containing internal, symbiotic prokaryotes which have been recognised as sulphur-oxidising bacteria. Dominance of Astomonema may indicate the presence of reduced environments in the study areas, which is partially confirmed by the local biogeochemical environment. The nematode communities were mostly affected by sediment layer differences and concomitant trophic conditions rather than other spatial gradients related to study area, water depth or station differences, pointing to small-scale heterogeneity as the main source of variation in nematode structure and function. Furthermore, the positive relation between nematode standing stocks, and quantity and quality of the organic matter was stronger when hydrodynamic disturbance was greater. Analogically, this study also suggests that structural diversity can be positively correlated with trophic conditions and that this relation is tighter when hydrodynamic disturbance is greater."
https://openalex.org/W2032016978,"Genome analyses of marine microbial communities have revealed the widespread occurrence of genomic islands (GIs), many of which encode for protein secretion machineries described in the context of bacteria-eukaryote interactions. Yet experimental support for the specific roles of such GIs in aquatic community interactions remains scarce. Here, we test for the contribution of type III secretion systems (T3SS) to the environmental fitness of epidemic Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Comparisons of V. parahaemolyticus wild types and T3SS-defective mutants demonstrate that the T3SS encoded on genome island VPaI-7 (T3SS-2) promotes survival of V. parahaemolyticus in the interaction with diverse protist taxa. Enhanced persistence was found to be due to T3SS-2 mediated cytotoxicity and facultative parasitism of V. parahaemolyticus on coexisting protists. Growth in the presence of bacterivorous protists and the T3SS-2 genotype showed a strong correlation across environmental and clinical isolates of V. parahaemolyticus. Short-term microcosm experiments provide evidence that protistan hosts facilitate the invasion of T3SS-2 positive V. parahaemolyticus into a coastal plankton community, and that water temperature and productivity further promote enhanced survival of T3SS-2 positive V. parahaemolyticus. This study is the first to describe the fitness advantage of GI-encoded functions in a microbial food web, which may provide a mechanistic explanation for the global spread and the seasonal dynamics of V. parahaemolyticus pathotypes, including the pandemic serotype cluster O3:K6, in aquatic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2029272288,"Bacterial production of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), is constrained to a narrow subset of marine γ-proteobacteria. The genes responsible for de novo bacterial PUFA biosynthesis, designated pfaEABCD, encode large, multi-domain protein complexes akin to type I iterative fatty acid and polyketide synthases, herein referred to as “Pfa synthases”. In addition to the archetypal Pfa synthase gene products from marine bacteria, we have identified homologous type I FAS/PKS gene clusters in diverse microbial lineages spanning 45 genera representing 10 phyla, presumed to be involved in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis. In total, 20 distinct types of gene clusters were identified. Collectively, we propose the designation of “secondary lipids” to describe these biosynthetic pathways and products, a proposition consistent with the “secondary metabolite” vernacular. Phylogenomic analysis reveals a high degree of functional conservation within distinct biosynthetic pathways. Incongruence between secondary lipid synthase functional clades and taxonomic group membership combined with the lack of orthologous gene clusters in closely related strains suggests horizontal gene transfer has contributed to the dissemination of specialized lipid biosynthetic activities across disparate microbial lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2032671105,"In vivo non-linear optical microscopy has been essential to advance our knowledge of how intact biological systems work. It has been particularly enabling to decipher fast spatiotemporal cellular dynamics in neural networks. The power of the technique stems from its optical sectioning capability that in turn also limits its application to essentially immobile tissue. Only tissue not affected by movement or in which movement can be physically constrained can be imaged fast enough to conduct functional studies at high temporal resolution. Here, we show dynamic two-photon Ca(2+) imaging in the spinal cord of a living rat at millisecond time scale, free of motion artifacts using an optical stabilization system. We describe a fast, non-contact adaptive movement compensation approach, applicable to rough and weakly reflective surfaces, allowing real-time functional imaging from intrinsically moving tissue in live animals. The strategy involves enslaving the position of the microscope objective to that of the tissue surface in real-time through optical monitoring and a closed feedback loop. The performance of the system allows for efficient image locking even in conditions of random or irregular movements."
https://openalex.org/W2059476617,"Biodiesel is a renewable alternative to petroleum diesel fuel that can contribute to carbon dioxide emission reduction and energy supply. Biodiesel is composed of fatty acid alkyl esters, including fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), and is currently produced through the transesterification reaction of methanol (or ethanol) and triacylglycerols (TAGs). TAGs are mainly obtained from oilseed plants and microalgae. A sustainable supply of TAGs is a major bottleneck for current biodiesel production. Here we report the de novo biosynthesis of FAEEs from glucose, which can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass, in genetically engineered Escherichia coli by introduction of the ethanol-producing pathway from Zymomonas mobilis, genetic manipulation to increase the pool of fatty acyl-CoA, and heterologous expression of acyl-coenzyme A: diacylglycerol acyltransferase from Acinetobacter baylyi. An optimized fed-batch microbial fermentation of the modified E. coli strain yielded a titer of 922 mg L−1 FAEEs that consisted primarily of ethyl palmitate, -oleate, -myristate and -palmitoleate."
https://openalex.org/W2078089231,"Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) is an important regulator of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling within the cardiovascular system. In this study, we examined the role of PDE3A and PDE3B isoforms in regulation of growth of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and the mechanisms by which they may affect signaling pathways that mediate mitogen-induced VSMC proliferation. Serum- and PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in VSMCs grown from aortas of PDE3A-deficient (3A-KO) mice was markedly less than that in VSMCs from PDE3A wild type (3A-WT) and PDE3B-deficient (3B-KO) mice. The reduced growth response was accompanied by significantly less phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in 3A-KO VSMCs, most likely due to a combination of greater site-specific inhibitory phosphorylation of Raf-1Ser-259 by protein kinase A (PKA) and enhanced dephosphorylation of ERKs due to elevated mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1). Furthermore, 3A-KO VSMCs, compared with 3A-WT, exhibited higher basal PKA activity and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, higher levels of p53 and p53 phosphorylation, and elevated p21 protein together with lower levels of Cyclin-D1 and retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and Rb phosphorylation. Adenoviral overexpression of inactive CREB partially restored growth effects of serum in 3A-KO VSMCs. In contrast, exposure of 3A-WT VSMCs to VP16 CREB (active CREB) was associated with inhibition of serum-induced DNA synthesis similar to that in untreated 3A-KO VSMCs. Transfection of 3A-KO VSMCs with p53 siRNA reduced p21 and MKP-1 levels and completely restored growth without affecting amounts of Cyclin-D1 and Rb phosphorylation. We conclude that PDE3A regulates VSMC growth via two complementary pathways, i.e. PKA-catalyzed inhibitory phosphorylation of Raf-1 with resulting inhibition of MAPK signaling and PKA/CREB-mediated induction of p21, leading to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, as well as by increased accumulation of p53, which induces MKP-1, p21, and WIP1, leading to inhibition of G1 to S cell cycle progression.

Meller N. McNamara C.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Goormastic M. Cornhill J.F. Chisolm G.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 996-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In a normal artery, VSMCs are in a non-proliferative, quiescent state and exhibit a well differentiated, “contractile” phenotype. After vascular injury, this differentiated phenotype is lost with a shift to a “synthetic” phenotype that is accompanied by entry into the cell cycle and proliferation (4Cai X. Expert Rev. Cardiovasc. Ther. 2006; 4: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Evidence that pathological events in the vessel wall play an important role in atherosclerosis is increasing. Development of atherosclerosis may involve perturbation of the homeostatic balance between antiatherosclerotic signaling (nitric oxide (NO), atrial natriuretic peptide, and cyclic nucleotides) and proatherosclerotic signaling (tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and angiotensin II) (5Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6973) Google Scholar). Both endothelial cells and VSMCs are critical targets for inflammatory molecules, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, that are increased during progression of atherosclerosis (6Hansson G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1876-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), and are capable also of producing these molecules. In normal tissues with functional endothelium, NO and C-type natriuretic peptide produced by endothelial cells increase cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which together with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and prostaglandins, limits inflammation and proliferation, and decrease vascular remodeling and atherosclerosis (7Koyama H.

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which catalyze hydrolysis of cAMP/cGMP, belong to a complex and diverse superfamily of at least 11 structurally related, highly regulated, and functionally distinct gene families (PDE1–PDE11). These enzymes differ in their primary structures, affinities for cAMP and cGMP, responses to specific effectors, sensitivities to specific inhibitors, and mechanisms by which they are regulated (8Conti M. Beavo J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Most PDE families comprise more than one gene, which yield multiple protein products via alternative mRNA splicing or utilization of different promoters and/or transcription initiation sites. The two PDE3 subfamilies, PDE3A and PDE3B, are encoded by closely related genes (9Maurice D.H. Palmer D. Tilley D.G. Dunkerley H.A. Netherton S.J. Raymond D.R. Elbatarny H.S. Jimmo S.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). PDE3A and PDE3B isoforms are expressed in VSMCs, but their exact role(s) is unclear in large part due to the lack of availability of specific inhibitors of individual PDE3 isoforms. The goals of this study were to understand the role(s) of PDE3A and PDE3B isoforms in VSMC function and to define mechanisms by which PDE3 isoforms might affect signaling pathways that regulate VSMC growth. Yan et al. (10Yan C. Miller C.L. Abe J.I. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have shown that, in cultured cardiomyocytes, down-regulation of PDE3A with concomitant up-regulation of inducible cAMP early repressor was associated with increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Studies by Masciarelli et al. (11Masciarelli S. Horner K. Liu C. Park S.H. Hinckley M. Hockman S. Nedachi T. Jin C. Conti M. Manganiello V. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, in female mice, deletion of PDE3A resulted in infertility mainly due to arrest of oocyte meiosis via elevated cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, which inhibited maturation-promoting factor. Several earlier studies demonstrated that cilostamide (a PDE3 inhibitor) and rolipram (a PDE4 inhibitor) increased accumulation of cAMP and inhibited arterial, lung, and mesangial smooth muscle cell growth and migration (12Netherton S.J. Maurice D.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13Inoue Y. Toga K. Sudo T. Tachibana K. Tochizawa S. Kimura Y. Yoshida Y. Hidaka H. Br. J.

Thus, we reasoned that PDE3A-deficient (3A-KO) and PDE3B-deficient (3B-KO) mice might be valuable models in which to dissect and reconstitute signaling pathways downstream of cAMP that could elucidate mechanisms controlling cell division and mitogenesis in other types of cells, including VSMCs. Our results indicate that PDE3A depletion inhibited mitogen-induced VSMC proliferation via two complementary signaling pathways, i.e. PKA-catalyzed inhibitory phosphorylation of Raf-1, which interfered with activation of MAPK signaling, and PKA/CREB-induced elevation of p21, leading to cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, as well as by increased accumulation of p53, which induces mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), p21, and WIP1, leading to inhibition of G1 to S cell cycle progression. All materials and reagents used were commercially available as detailed in the supplemental Materials. 3A-KO mice were generated by targeted disruption of exon 13, which encodes a portion of the second putative metal-binding site in the PDE3A catalytic domain (11Masciarelli S. Horner K. Liu C. Park S.H. Hinckley M. Hockman S. Nedachi T. Jin C. Conti M. Manganiello V. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Generation of 3B-KO mice (MPDE3BSvJ129) was also described earlier (16Choi Y.H. Park S. Hockman S. Zmuda-Trzebiatowska E. Svennelid F. Haluzik M. Gavrilova O. Ahmad F. Pepin L. Napolitano M. Taira M. Sundler F. Stenson Holst L. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 3240-3251Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Mice were maintained and studies were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at NHLBI, National Institutes of Health. Male 3A-KO (PDE3A−/−C57BL/6J-129/SvJ) mice from the F1 generation, 3A-KO (PDE3A−/−C57BL/6J) backcrosses from the F8 generation, and 3B-KO mice (MPDE3BSvJ129) from the F8 generation at the age of 8–12 weeks were used for isolation of primary VSMCs. Similar results were obtained with F1 and F8 generations of 3A-KO mice with respect to VSMC growth inhibition and alterations in signaling proteins. However, VSMCs grown from male F1 generation 3A-KO mice were largely epithelioid in shape, whereas VSMCs grown from 3A-WT littermates were largely spindle-shaped (see supplemental Fig. 1). The epithelioid morphology of 3A-KO VSMCs grown from F1 generation 3A-KO mice reverted to a spindle shape upon eight backcrosses with C57BL/6J mice (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, differences in morphology were not causally related to differences in growth, MAPK, and cell signaling pathways between 3A-WT and 3A-KO VSMCs grown from F1 generation mice. VSMCs isolated by collagenase digestion of the aortic media layer as described (17Begum N. Sandu O.A. Duddy N. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2256-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were not contaminated with fibroblasts or endothelial cells as evidenced by >99% positive immunostaining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies against smooth muscle α-actin (Sigma). VSMCs maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic were grown to confluence and studied at passage 5 for all experiments. Confluent, serum-starved VSMCs were treated with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) or insulin (100 nm) alone or with insulin followed by PDGF and extracted with lysis buffer. Proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblot analysis and detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and imaging with a charge-coupled device camera (LAS 1000 Plus, Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). ECL signals in the linear range were quantitated by densitometry as described in the figure legends. Cell proliferation was quantified by using BrdU cell proliferation assay kits (Roche Applied Science). DNA synthesis was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described earlier (18Jacob A. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Begum N. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C1077-C1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For cell cycle analysis, VSMCs were incubated with PDGF for 24 h, harvested with trypsin, and stained (1 × 106 cells) with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide for 12 h in the dark at 4 °C. Fractions of cells present in each phase of the cell cycle (G0/G1, S, and G2/M) were determined by flow cytometry using a BD FACStar flow cytometer and ModiFit software. Cell cycle-specific gene expression was analyzed by Oligo GEArray mouse cell cycle arrays (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD) representing 112 genes critical to cell cycle regulation. RNA (1 μg) isolated from quiescent 3A-WT and 3A-KO VSMCs was used to synthesize biotin-16-UTP-labeled target cRNA probes, which were hybridized to array membranes, according to the manufacturer's directions. Chemiluminescent signals were detected, and the ECL images were analyzed using GEArray Expression Analysis suite software. Data were normalized to values for housekeeping genes. PKA activity was assayed in VSMC extracts using Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Upstate, NY) kits with Kemptide as substrate and [γ-32P]ATP without or with protein kinase inhibitor peptide. PKC and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activities were inhibited by including inhibitor peptide mixture in the assay mixture. PDE3 and PDE4 activities in VSMC extracts (5-μl samples) were measured in the presence and absence of cilostamide (PDE3 inhibitor) and rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor) using the SPA PDE assay kit (Amersham Biosciences) in accord with the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of cAMP was 1 μm with 0.05 μCi of [3H]cAMP/assay. Subconfluent VSMCs were transfected according to the manufacturer's protocol with 100 nm scrambled RNAi as a control or with 100 nm PDE3A siRNA (sc-41593, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), which is a pool of three target-specific 20–25-nucleotide siRNAs, or with 100 nm siGenome ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool mouse TRP53 (L-040642–00, Dharmacon), which is a pool of four target-specific siRNAs. After 48 h, VSMCs were serum-starved, incubated with PDGF, and examined for reductions in PDE3A or p53 protein by Western blotting. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was used to quantify DNA synthesis as described (17Begum N. Sandu O.A. Duddy N. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2256-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in cell homogenates were quantitated by the bicinchoninic acid method (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all data are reported as means ± S.E. of values from at least four or five experiments performed in duplicate. Analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test was used to compare mean values for different treatments or groups. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. As seen in supplemental Fig. 2A, Western blot analyses with isoform-specific antibodies confirmed the absence of PDE3A and PDE3B isoforms in primary VSMCs grown from aortas of 3A-KO and 3B-KO mice, respectively, and their presence in WT counterparts. Of note, there was a compensatory increase in PDE3A protein in 3B-KO VSMCs but no such increase in PDE3B in 3A-KO VSMCs. As seen in supplemental Fig. 2B, analysis of PDE enzymatic activities indicated that most of the cAMP PDE hydrolytic activity in VSMCs was due to PDE3 and PDE4 isoforms based on inhibition of PDE activity by cilostamide and rolipram (21Phillips P.G. Long L. Wilkins M.R. Morrell N.W. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2005; 288: L103-L115Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In 3A-KO VSMCs, PDE3A deletion resulted in an ∼70% decrease in PDE3 activity, whereas PDE4 remained unaffected. 3B-WT VSMCs exhibited ∼50 and ∼30% increases in total PDE and PDE3 activities, respectively, when compared with 3A-WT VSMCs. In 3B-KO VSMCs, PDE3B deletion resulted in an ∼43% decrease in PDE3 activity. The magnitude of decrease in PDE3 activity, ∼43% in 3B-KO VSMCs, was less than the corresponding decrease of ∼70% in 3A-KO VSMCs (supplemental Fig. 2B). This may be due to the observed increase in PDE3A protein in 3B-KO VSMCs. Cellular PKA activity in lysates of VSMCs from aortas of 3A-KO and 3B-KO mice was assayed as a measure of assessing altered cAMP signaling due to changed PDE3 expression. Basal PKA activity in 3A-KO VSMCs was more than twice that in 3A-WT cells (9.91 ± 1.5 versus 3.7 ± 0.59 pmol of phosphate incorporated into Kemptide/mg of protein/min; mean ± S.E., n = 4), whereas no such increase was observed in 3B-KO VSMCs (3.72 ± 0.68 versus 3.76 ± 0.47 pmol/mg of protein/min). This absence of increased PKA activity in 3B-KO VSMCs may also be due to, at least in part, the increased expression of PDE3A protein in 3B-KO VSMCs. Acute stimulation with PDGF for 5 min increased PKA activity in VSMCs by 60–70% over basal levels in all VSMCs (3A-WT, 6.3 ± 0.88; 3A-KO, 16.2 ± 1.83; 3B-WT, 6.5 ± 0.59; 3B-KO, 6.2 ± 0.59). PKA activity was completely inhibited when PKA peptide inhibitor was included in vitro during the enzyme assays and partially inhibited when VSMCs were incubated with (Rp)-8-bromo-cAMPS, a cAMP analog that inhibits PKA (data not shown). VSMC proliferation is known to play a crucial role in the development of restenosis after balloon angioplasty and in the progression of fatty streaks to atherosclerotic plaques (2Doran A.C. Meller N. McNamara C.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). To determine the role of PDE3 isoforms in regulation of VSMC proliferation and growth, we measured [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA after treatment of VSMCs with PDGF or serum. As seen in Fig. 1A, PDGF- or serum-induced DNA synthesis was increased 4–6-fold in 3A-WT, 3B-WT, and 3B-KO, but not in 3A-KO, VSMCs. Results were similar when growth rates were measured by colorimetric assays using anti-BrdU antibodies to mark proliferating cells (data not shown). Thus, in contrast to 3B-KO VSMCs, which were responsive to mitogenic stimuli, PDE3A depletion was accompanied by markedly less proliferation in response to mitogenic stimuli. To confirm a major role for PDE3A in regulation of VSMC proliferation, PDE3A was depleted in 3B-WT and 3B-KO VSMCs using murine PDE3A siRNA (sc-41593 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), which is a pool of three target-specific 20–25-nucleotide siRNAs). Transfection with PDE3A siRNA resulted in 65–70% depletion of cellular PDE3A (Fig. 1B) and significantly decreased basal and PDGF-induced DNA synthesis in 3B-WT and 3B-KO VSMCs when compared with VSMCs transfected with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 1C). Thus, PDE3A depletion in 3B-WT and 3B-KO VSMCs is accompanied by a marked reduction in VSMC proliferative capacity in response to mitogenic stimuli. The effect of PDE3A deletion on cell cycle progression was assessed by FACS analysis of propidium iodide-labeled VSMCs (Fig. 2). In the basal state, a large fraction of 3A-WT and 3A-KO VSMCs accumulated in G0/G1 phase with a small fraction of each in S phase (Fig. 2). Incubation of 3A-WT VSMCs with PDGF (24 h) induced cell cycle progression into S phase, significantly decreasing the percentage of cells in G0/G1 and concomitantly increasing the numbers of cells in S phase (2.5-fold) and in G2/M phase (6-fold) (Fig. 2, top right). In contrast, 3A-KO VSMCs exhibited markedly decreased percentages of cells in G1/S and G2/M in response to PDGF (Fig. 2, bottom right; 86.2 ± 3.1% in G0/G1, 9.4 ± 1.4% in S phase, and 4.4 ± 1.0% in G2/M phase). These effects strongly correlated with the inhibition of mitogen-induced DNA synthesis in 3A-KO VSMCs (Fig. 1). Overall, these findings suggested that PDE3A deletion increased PKA activity and inhibited VSMC proliferation by blocking mitogen-induced G1 → S phase and G2 → M phase progression. This observation prompted us to investigate potential alterations in upstream and downstream signaling pathways that regulate cell cycle proteins involved in VSMC growth and proliferation. In VSMCs, growth factors activate two major mitogenic signaling pathways in early G1, MAPK/ERK and PI 3-kinase signaling pathways (22Nelson P.R. Yamamura S. Mureebe L. Itoh H. Kent K.C. J. Vasc.

Phosphorylation/activation of upstream kinases (MEK and Raf-1) results in activation of MAPK, leading to phosphorylation of downstream kinases and enhanced expression of several immediate early gene products, which promote cell cycle progression through the restriction point of the cell cycle (25Ducommun B. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 233-241PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether growth inhibition in 3A-KO VSMCs might be related to alterations in MAPK/ERK signaling, immunoblot analyses were performed on cell extracts derived from VSMCs acutely stimulated for 5 min with PDGF, insulin, or a combination of both (Fig. 3, top). Insulin was included along with PDGF to determine whether it potentiated PDGF-induced MAPK/ERK phosphorylation/activation, which is required for proliferation of various cells, including VSMCs (22Nelson P.R.

In contrast, PDGF-induced ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylations were markedly reduced in 3A-KO VSMCs, reflecting deficient enzyme activation. Insulin treatment alone or in combination with PDGF did not increase ERK phosphorylation. Densitometric analyses revealed that these reductions in ERK phosphorylations were not due to reductions in ERK protein (Fig. 3, bottom). The time course of PDGF-induced ERK phosphorylation revealed persistent reductions in 3A-KO VSMCs at all times studied (data not shown). Incubation of 3B-KO and 3B-WT VSMCs with cAMP agonists ((Sp)-cAMPS; 100 μm) for 30 min also abrogated subsequent PDGF-induced ERK phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 3). p38 MAPK phosphorylation was also reduced in 3A-KO VSMCs (data not shown). Earlier studies with cilostamide (a PDE3 inhibitor) and cAMP agonists have shown similar reductions in ERK phosphorylation (12Netherton S.J. Maurice D.H. Mol.

Tochizawa S. Kimura Y. Yoshida Y. Hidaka H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have shown that cilostamide, which increased VSMC cAMP content, inhibited DNA synthesis stimulated by fetal calf serum but did not affect VSMC migration stimulated by PDGF. This earlier report (13Inoue Y. Toga K. Sudo T. Tachibana K. Tochizawa S. Kimura Y. Yoshida Y. Hidaka H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggested that cilostamide suppressed rat arterial intimal hyperplasia in single and double balloon injury models presumably by inhibiting proliferation rather than migration of VSMCs. PI 3-kinase signaling pathways are also essential for cell proliferation, cell survival, and differentiation (27Duan C. Bauchat J.R. Hsieh T. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 (top), insulin or PDGF rapidly increased phosphorylation of AktSer-473, a target of PI 3-kinase signaling. AktSer-473 phosphorylation was similar in 3A-KO, 3A-WT, 3B-WT, and 3B-KO VSMCs (Fig. 4, bottom). Thus, PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling appeared to be preserved in 3A-KO VSMCs. Additional studies indicated that pBad phosphorylation in 3A-KO VSMCs was comparable with that in WT cells (data not shown). Because Akt inhibits apoptosis by phosphorylation and inactivation of several proteins, including FoxO1, Bad, and caspase-9, preservation of PI3K/Akt signaling in 3A-KO VSMCs supported the hypothesis that the reduction in proliferation of 3A-KO VSMCs was not likely to be due to excessive apoptosis. cAMP/PKA signaling is known to increase phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser-259, which results in inhibition of Raf-1 kinase activity (28Dhillon A.S. Pollock C. Steen H. Shaw P.E. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and consequently inhibition of ERK phosphorylation/activation. As seen in Fig. 5 (top), basal Raf-1Ser-259 inhibitory site phosphorylation was elevated more than 3-fold in 3A-KO VSMCs compared with that in 3A-WT or 3B-KO VSMCs (Fig. 5, bottom, 3A-KO basal versus 3A-WT or 3B-KO basal) consistent with increased PKA activity in 3A-KO VSMCs. Treatment with insulin or PDGF for 5 min increased Raf-1 phosphorylation in all VSMCs. However, phosphorylation of Raf-1Ser-259 by insulin or PDGF was higher in 3A-KO VSMCs compared with that in 3A-WT or 3B-KO VSMCs. In all VSMCs, treatment with insulin for 5 min followed by incubation with PDGF for 5 min reverted the phosphorylation state to basal or near-basal levels. The observed transie"

However, these data create high-dimensional complex data sets that consist of a large proportion of zeros, non-negative skewed counts, and frequently, limited number of samples. These features distinguish sequence data from other forms of high-dimensional data, and are not adequately addressed by statistical approaches in common use. Ultimately, medical studies may identify targeted interventions or treatments, but lack of analytic tools for feature selection and identification of taxa responsible for differences between groups, is hindering advancement. The objective of this paper is to examine the application of a two-part statistic to identify taxa that differ between two groups. The advantages of the two-part statistic over common statistical tests applied to sequence count datasets are discussed. Results from the t-test, the Wilcoxon test, and the two-part test are compared using sequence counts from microbial ecology studies in cystic fibrosis and from cenote samples. We show superior performance of the two-part statistic for analysis of sequence data. The improved performance in microbial ecology studies was independent of study type and sequence technology used."
https://openalex.org/W2030240306,"Regardless of the achievable remissions with first line hormone therapy in patients with prostate cancer (CaP), the disease escapes the hormone dependent stage to a more aggressive status where chemotherapy is the only effective treatment and no treatment is curative. This makes it very important to identify new targets that can improve the outcome of treatment. ATM and DNA-PK are the two kinases responsible for signalling and repairing double strand breaks (DSB). Thus, both kinases are pertinent targets in CaP treatment to enhance the activity of the numerous DNA DSB inducing agents used in CaP treatment such as ionizing radiation (IR). Colony formation assay was used to assess the sensitivity of hormone dependent, p53 wt (LNCaP) and hormone independent p53 mutant (PC3) CaP cell lines to the cytotoxic effect of IR and Doxorubicin in the presence or absence of Ku55933 and NU7441 which are small molecule inhibitors of ATM and DNA-PK, respectively. Flow cytometry based methods were used to assess the effect of the two inhibitors on cell cycle, apoptosis and H2AX foci formation. Neutral comet assay was used to assess the induction of DNA DSBs. Ku55933 or NU7441 alone increased the sensitivity of CaP cell lines to the DNA damaging agents, however combining both inhibitors together resulted in further enhancement of sensitivity. The cell cycle profile of both cell lines was altered with increased cell death, DNA DSBs and H2AX foci formation. This study justifies further evaluation of the ATM and DNA-PK inhibitors for clinical application in CaP patients. Additionally, the augmented effect resulting from combining both inhibitors may have a significant implication for the treatment of CaP patients who have a defect in one of the two DSB repair pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2093142300,"Background The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) has been suggested to modulate lung injury in models of acute pulmonary inflammation. To study this further, model systems utilizing wild type and RAGE knockout (KO) mice were used to determine the role of RAGE signaling in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and E. coli induced acute pulmonary inflammation. The effect of intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intratracheal (i.t.) administration of mouse soluble RAGE on E. coli injury was also investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings C57BL/6 wild type and RAGE KO mice received an i.t. instillation of LPS, E. coli, or vehicle control. Some groups also received i.p. or i.t. administration of mouse soluble RAGE. After 24 hours, the role of RAGE expression on inflammation was assessed by comparing responses in wild type and RAGE KO. RAGE protein levels decreased in wild type lung homogenates after treatment with either LPS or bacteria. In addition, soluble RAGE and HMGB1 increased in the BALF after E. coli instillation. RAGE KO mice challenged with LPS had the same degree of inflammation as wild type mice. However, when challenged with E. coli, RAGE KO mice had significantly less inflammation when compared to wild type mice. Most cytokine levels were lower in the BALF of RAGE KO mice compared to wild type mice after E. coli injury, while only monocyte chemotactic protein-1, MCP-1, was lower after LPS challenge. Neither i.p. nor i.t. administration of mouse soluble RAGE attenuated the severity of E. coli injury in wild type mice. Conclusions/Significance Lack of RAGE in the lung does not protect against LPS induced acute pulmonary inflammation, but attenuates injury following live E. coli challenge. These findings suggest that RAGE mediates responses to E. coli-associated pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules other than LPS or other bacterial specific signaling responses. Soluble RAGE treatment had no effect on inflammation."

In this study, we found that such an odd Fe(III) reduction by an oxidant depends on the presence of l-Trp, which ultimately serves as the reductant for the enzyme. In the peroxide reaction with tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, a previously unknown catalase-like activity was detected. A ferryl species (δ = 0.055 mm/s and ΔEQ = 1.755 mm/s) and a protein-based free radical (g = 2.0028 and 1.72 millitesla linewidth) were characterized by Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopy, respectively. This is the first compound ES-type of ferryl intermediate from a heme-based dioxygenase characterized by EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations revealed the contribution of secondary ligand sphere to the spectroscopic properties of the ferryl species. In the presence of l-Trp, the reactivation was demonstrated by enzyme assays and by various spectroscopic techniques. A Trp-Trp dimer and a monooxygenated l-Trp were both observed as the enzyme reactivation by-products by mass spectrometry. Together, these results lead to the unraveling of an over 60-year old mystery of peroxide reactivation mechanism. These results may shed light on how a metalloenzyme maintains its catalytic activity in an oxidizing environment.

https://openalex.org/W1967420877,"Biological invasions are fundamentally biogeographic processes that occur over large spatial scales. Interactions with soil microbes can have strong impacts on plant invasions, but how these interactions vary among areas where introduced species are highly invasive vs. naturalized is still unknown. In this study, we examined biogeographic variation in plant-soil microbe interactions of a globally invasive weed, Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle). We addressed the following questions (1) Is Centaurea released from natural enemy pressure from soil microbes in introduced regions? and (2) Is variation in plant-soil feedbacks associated with variation in Centaurea's invasive success?We conducted greenhouse experiments using soils and seeds collected from native Eurasian populations and introduced populations spanning North and South America where Centaurea is highly invasive and noninvasive. Soil microbes had pervasive negative effects in all regions, although the magnitude of their effect varied among regions. These patterns were not unequivocally congruent with the enemy release hypothesis. Surprisingly, we also found that Centaurea generated strong negative feedbacks in regions where it is the most invasive, while it generated neutral plant-soil feedbacks where it is noninvasive.Recent studies have found reduced below-ground enemy attack and more positive plant-soil feedbacks in range-expanding plant populations, but we found increased negative effects of soil microbes in range-expanding Centaurea populations. While such negative feedbacks may limit the long-term persistence of invasive plants, such feedbacks may also contribute to the success of invasions, either by having disproportionately negative impacts on competing species, or by yielding relatively better growth in uncolonized areas that would encourage lateral spread. Enemy release from soil-borne pathogens is not sufficient to explain the success of this weed in such different regions. The biogeographic variation in soil-microbe effects indicates that different mechanisms may operate on this species in different regions, thus establishing geographic mosaics of species interactions that contribute to variation in invasion success."
https://openalex.org/W1981734421,"The genus Perkinsus occupies a precarious phylogenetic position. To gain a better understanding of the relationship between perkinsids, dinoflagellates and other alveolates, we analyzed the nuclear-encoded spliced-leader (SL) RNA and mitochondrial genes, intron prevalence, and multi-protein phylogenies. In contrast to the canonical 22-nt SL found in dinoflagellates (DinoSL), P. marinus has a shorter (21-nt) and a longer (22-nt) SL with slightly different sequences than DinoSL. The major SL RNA transcripts range in size between 80-83 nt in P. marinus, and ∼ 83 nt in P. chesapeaki, significantly larger than the typical ≤ 56-nt dinoflagellate SL RNA. In most of the phylogenetic trees based on 41 predicted protein sequences, P. marinus branched at the base of the dinoflagellate clade that included the ancient taxa Oxyrrhis and Amoebophrya, sister to the clade of apicomplexans, and in some cases clustered with apicomplexans as a sister to the dinoflagellate clade. Of 104 Perkinsus spp. genes examined 69.2% had introns, a higher intron prevalence than in dinoflagellates. Examination of Perkinsus spp. mitochondrial cytochrome B and cytochrome C oxidase subunit I genes and their cDNAs revealed no mRNA editing, but these transcripts can only be translated when frameshifts are introduced at every AGG and CCC codon as if AGGY codes for glycine and CCCCU for proline. These results, along with the presence of the numerous uncharacterized 'marine alveolate group I' and Perkinsus-like lineages separating perkinsids from core dinoflagellates, expand support for the affiliation of the genus Perkinsus with an independent lineage (Perkinsozoa) positioned between the phyla of Apicomplexa and Dinoflagellata."

Although several BoNT serotypes enter neurons through synaptic vesicle cycling utilizing dual receptors (a ganglioside and a synaptic vesicle-associated protein), the entry pathway of BoNT/D is less well understood. Although BoNT/D entry is ganglioside-dependent, alignment and structural studies show that BoNT/D lacks key residues within a conserved ganglioside binding pocket that are present in BoNT serotypes A, B, E, F, and G, which indicate that BoNT/D-ganglioside interactions may be unique. In this study BoNT/D is shown to have a unique association with ganglioside relative to the other BoNT serotypes, utilizing a ganglioside binding loop (GBL, residues Tyr-1235—Ala-1245) within the receptor binding domain of BoNT/D (HCR/D) via b-series gangliosides, including GT1b, GD1b, and GD2.

We recently reported that CCM3 contains an N-terminal dimerization domain (CCM3D) and a C-terminal focal adhesion targeting (FAT) homology domain. Intermolecular protein-protein interactions of CCM3 are mediated by a highly conserved surface on the FAT homology domain and are affected by CCM3 truncations in the human disease. Here we report the crystal structures of CCM3 in complex with three different leucine-aspartate repeat (LD) motifs (LD1, LD2, and LD4) from the scaffolding protein paxillin, at 2.8, 2.7, and 2.5 Å resolution. We show that CCM3 binds LD motifs using the highly conserved hydrophobic patch 1 (HP1) and that this binding is similar to the binding of focal adhesion kinase and Pyk2 FAT domains to paxillin LD motifs. We further show by surface plasmon resonance that CCM3 binds paxillin LD motifs with affinities in the micromolar range, similar to FAK family FAT domains. Finally, we show that endogenous CCM3 and paxillin co-localize in mouse cerebral pericytes. These studies provide a molecular-level framework to investigate the protein-protein interactions of CCM3."
https://openalex.org/W1979121821,"Clinical use of selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 appears associated with increased risk of thrombotic events. This is often hypothesised to reflect reduction in anti-thrombotic prostanoids, notably PGI(2), formed by COX-2 present within endothelial cells. However, whether COX-2 is actually expressed to any significant extent within endothelial cells is controversial. Here we have tested the effects of acute inhibition of COX on platelet reactivity using a functional in vivo approach in mice.A non-lethal model of platelet-driven thromboembolism in the mouse was used to assess the effects of aspirin (7 days orally as control) diclofenac (1 mg.kg(-1), i.v.) and parecoxib (0.5 mg.kg(-1), i.v.) on thrombus formation induced by collagen or the thromboxane (TX) A(2)-mimetic, U46619. The COX inhibitory profiles of the drugs were confirmed in mouse tissues ex vivo. Collagen and U46619 caused in vivo thrombus formation with the former, but not latter, sensitive to oral dosing with aspirin. Diclofenac inhibited COX-1 and COX-2 ex vivo and reduced thrombus formation in response to collagen, but not U46619. Parecoxib inhibited only COX-2 and had no effect upon thrombus formation caused by either agonist.Inhibition of COX-1 by diclofenac or aspirin reduced thrombus formation induced by collagen, which is partly dependent upon platelet-derived TXA(2), but not that induced by U46619, which is independent of platelet TXA(2). These results are consistent with the model demonstrating the effects of COX-1 inhibition in platelets, but provide no support for the hypothesis that acute inhibition of COX-2 in the circulation increases thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W2080493870,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control factor EDEM1 associates with a number of ER proteins and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates; however, an understanding of its role in ERAD is unclear. The early maturation events for EDEM1 including signal sequence cleavage and glycosylation were analyzed, and their relationship to the function of EDEM1 was determined. EDEM1 has five N-linked glycosylation sites with the most C-terminal site recognized poorly cotranslationally, resulting in the accumulation of EDEM1 containing four or five glycans. The fifth site was modified post-translationally when bypassed cotranslationally. Signal sequence cleavage of EDEM1 was found to be a slow and inefficient process. Signal sequence cleavage produced a soluble form of EDEM1 that efficiently associated with the oxidoreductase ERdj5 and most effectively accelerated the turnover of a soluble ERAD substrate. In contrast, a type-II membrane form of EDEM1 was generated when the signal sequence was uncleaved, creating an N-terminal transmembrane segment. The membrane form of EDEM1 efficiently associated with the ER membrane protein SEL1L and accelerated the turnover of a membrane-associated ERAD substrate. Together, these results demonstrated that signal sequence cleavage functionally regulated the association of EDEM1-soluble and membrane-integrated isoforms with distinct ERAD machinery and substrates."

https://openalex.org/W2026901798,"Prostate cancer exhibits tremendous variability in clinical behavior, ranging from indolent to lethal disease. Better prognostic markers are needed to stratify patients for appropriately aggressive therapy. By expression profiling, we can identify a proliferation signature variably expressed in prostate cancers. Here, we asked whether one or more tissue biomarkers might capture that information, and provide prognostic utility. We assayed three proliferation signature genes: MKI67 (Ki-67; also a classic proliferation biomarker), TOP2A (DNA topoisomerase II, alpha), and E2F1 (E2F transcription factor 1). Immunohistochemical staining was evaluable on 139 radical prostatectomy cases (in tissue microarray format), with a median clinical follow-up of eight years. Each of the three proliferation markers was by itself prognostic. Notably, combining the three markers together as a “proliferation index” (0 or 1, vs. 2 or 3 positive markers) provided superior prognostic performance (hazard ratio = 2.6 (95% CI: 1.4–4.9); P = 0.001). In a multivariate analysis that included preoperative serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, Gleason grade and pathologic tumor stage, the composite proliferation index remained a significant predictor (P = 0.005). Analysis of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed the improved prognostication afforded by incorporating the proliferation index (compared to the clinicopathologic data alone). Our findings highlight the potential value of a multi-gene signature-based diagnostic, and define a tri-marker proliferation index with possible utility for improved prognostication and treatment stratification in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2107717593,"There is an urgent need for an immunological correlate of protection against tuberculosis (TB) with which to evaluate candidate TB vaccines in clinical trials. Development of a human challenge model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) could facilitate the detection of such correlate(s). Here we propose a novel in vivo Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) challenge model using BCG immunization as a surrogate for M.tb infection. Culture and quantitative PCR methods have been developed to quantify BCG in the skin, using the mouse ear as a surrogate for human skin. Candidate TB vaccines have been evaluated for their ability to protect against a BCG skin challenge, using this model, and the results indicate that protection against a BCG skin challenge is predictive of BCG vaccine efficacy against aerosol M.tb challenge. Translation of these findings to a human BCG challenge model could enable more rapid assessment and down selection of candidate TB vaccines and ultimately the identification of an immune correlate of protection."

We characterized the key enzyme BoxB from Azoarcus evansii by structural and Mössbauer spectroscopic methods as a new member of class I diiron enzymes.

IntroductionThe metabolism of aromatic compounds has attracted broad attention due to its importance in the biogeochemical carbon cycle (includes 10–20% of the biomass) and because of the chemistry necessary to overcome the high resonance energy of the conjugated cyclic ring. A central intermediate of the aromatic metabolism is benzoate, which can be degraded by microorganisms using three different strategies. The first strategy in the presence of oxygen uses mono- and dioxygenases to hydroxylate benzoate to catechol or protocatechuate. Central ring-cleaving dioxygenases with mononuclear iron centers subsequently cleave the aromatic ring either between the two hydroxyl groups (ortho cleavage, β-ketoadipate pathway) or next to one of the hydroxyl groups (meta cleavage) (1Harwood C.S. Parales R.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 553-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The second strategy under anoxic conditions involves benzoyl-CoA, which is reduced by two electrons to a non-aromatic cyclic diene followed by hydrolytic ring opening. Benzoyl-CoA reduction is accomplished by two completely different enzyme systems that may catalyze a Birch-like reduction (2Kung J.W. Löffler C. Dörner K. Heintz D. Gallien S. Van Dorsselaer A. Friedrich T. Boll M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17687-17692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).The third, semi-aerobic strategy to metabolize benzoate shares characteristic features of both of these options (3Zaar A. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24997-25004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oxygen is still required for attacking the ring, as in the aerobic metabolism, whereas all metabolites are activated to CoA thioesters and ring cleavage is performed hydrolytically, as in the anaerobic pathway (Fig. 1). According to genome analysis, the pathway is present in 5% of all bacteria (4Rather L.J. Knapp B. Haehnel W. Fuchs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20615-20624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, this strategy not only applies to the metabolism of benzoate but also of phenylacetate (5Gescher J. Zaar A. Mohamed M. Schägger H. Fuchs G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6301-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).After benzoate is converted to benzoyl-CoA, the three enzymes BoxABC 3The abbreviations used are: Boxbenzoyl-CoA oxidizingPaaphenylacetic acidACPacyl carrier protein. (benzoyl-CoA oxidizing) catalyze the crucial dearomatization reaction by epoxidation and following ring hydrolysis (Fig. 1). The key enzyme is BoxB. This 55-kDa monomeric protein catalyzes the transformation of benzoyl-CoA and oxygen with two electrons and two protons to the non-aromatic 2,3-epoxybenzoyl-CoA and water (4Rather L.J. Knapp B. Haehnel W. Fuchs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20615-20624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). BoxB is found with a sequence identity higher than 53% mainly in α- and β-proteobacteria. Very low amino acid sequence identities are found to other proteins; the closest relative to BoxB in the database is subunit PaaA of phenylacetyl-CoA epoxidase. This 30-kDa PaaA subunit belongs to a related multicomponent epoxidase system PaaABCDE (6Teufel R. Mascaraque V. Ismail W. Voss M. Perera J. Eisenreich W. Haehnel W. Fuchs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14390-14395Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which was found in 16% of bacteria and converts phenylacetyl-CoA to 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA. The crystal structure of the inactive heterotetrameric PaaAC complex has been recently reported in complex with its substrate (PDB code 3PW1) but in absence of the diiron center (7Grishin A.M.

BoxB is considered as a member of the class I diiron protein family (8Nordlund P. Eklund H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) as they contain two characteristic EXXH motifs required for diiron ligation: E-X29-149EEGRH153 and D-X28-239EEAHH243.

Microbiol. 2004; 54: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which is embedded in a central, ferritin-like four-helix bundle. Class I diiron centers appear to share a common O2 activation mechanism (10Lippard S.J. Philos. Transact. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 2005; 363 (discussion 1035–1040): 861-877PubMed Google Scholar) but catalyze diverse oxygen-dependent reactions. Such reactions are hydroxylation (soluble methane diiron monooxygenase and toluene/o-xylene diiron monooxygenase), aryl amine oxidation (p-aminobenzoate N-oxygenase), radical cofactor generation (ribonucleotide reductase R2), double bond formation (stearyl-ACP Δ9 desaturase), and epoxidation.BoxA is a homodimeric reductase (46-kDa subunit), which hosts one FAD and two [4Fe-4S] clusters per subunit and transfers two electrons from NADPH to the diiron center of BoxB (9Zaar A. Gescher J. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Mohamed M.E. Zaar A. Ebenau-Jehle C. Fuchs G. J.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6301-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), BoxA does not copurify with BoxB and is present in the cell in much lower concentration than BoxB. Only substoichiometric amounts of BoxA are required for benzoyl-CoA epoxidation. These findings argue for a transient interaction between BoxA and BoxB and the existence of docking sites on both proteins to position the distal [4Fe-4S] center of BoxA in close vicinity to the diiron center of BoxB. Homodimeric BoxC (61-kDa subunit) is a dihydrolase. It catalyzes the transformation of 2,3-epoxybenzoyl-CoA with two molecules of water to the non-cyclic 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde and formic acid (Fig. 1) (4Rather L.J. Knapp B. Haehnel W. Fuchs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20615-20624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The BoxB-catalyzed epoxidation is slow and incomplete due to product inactivation. The addition of BoxC stimulates the epoxidation rate 7-fold and prevents inactivation of BoxB (12Gescher J. Eisenreich W. Wörth J. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1586-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This strong effect of BoxC on the catalytic performance of BoxB and copurification of BoxC with BoxB strongly suggest a BoxB-BoxC interaction in vivo.BoxB is a widespread bacterial enzyme in a new type of coenzyme A-linked aerobic aromatic metabolism. Our goal was to shed light onto the dearomatization and epoxidation reaction on an atomic basis. Here we describe the crystal structure of BoxB at high resolution including its diiron center and the binding of benzoyl-CoA. The observed redox- and substrate-dependent changes of the ligand pattern and the spatial arrangement of the substrate relative to the diiron center provide new insights into the reaction of BoxB and of diiron enzymes in general.

https://openalex.org/W2047204112,"Vuvuzelas, the plastic blowing horns used by sports fans, recently achieved international recognition during the FIFA World Cup soccer tournament in South Africa. We hypothesised that vuvuzelas might facilitate the generation and dissemination of respiratory aerosols. To investigate the quantity and size of aerosols emitted when the instrument is played, eight healthy volunteers were asked to blow a vuvuzela. For each individual the concentration of particles in expelled air was measured using a six channel laser particle counter and the duration of blowing and velocity of air leaving the vuvuzela were recorded. To allow comparison with other activities undertaken at sports events each individual was also asked to shout and the measurements were repeated while using a paper cone to confine the exhaled air. Triplicate measurements were taken for each individual. The mean peak particle counts were 658×103 per litre for the vuvuzela and 3.7×103 per litre for shouting, representing a mean log10 difference of 2.20 (95% CI: 2.03,2.36; p<0.001). The majority (>97%) of particles captured from either the vuvuzela or shouting were between 0.5 and 5 microns in diameter. Mean peak airflows recorded for the vuvuzela and shouting were 6.1 and 1.8 litres per second respectively. We conclude that plastic blowing horns (vuvuzelas) have the capacity to propel extremely large numbers of aerosols into the atmosphere of a size able to penetrate the lower lung. Some respiratory pathogens are spread via contaminated aerosols emitted by infected persons. Further investigation is required to assess the potential of the vuvuzela to contribute to the transmission of aerosol borne diseases. We recommend, as a precautionary measure, that people with respiratory infections should be advised not to blow their vuvuzela in enclosed spaces and where there is a risk of infecting others."

The aims of this study were to determine how they exist in two intestinal mucus layers.The intestinal mucosa was fixed with Carnoy solution and immunostained. Mucus from the loose layer, the firm layer was gently suctioned or scraped, respectively, lysed in SDS sample buffer with or without DTT, then subjected to the western blotting of rTFF3, rIgGFcγBP or rMuc2. The non-reduced or reduced soluble mucus samples in RIPA buffer were co-immunoprecipitated to investigate their possible interactions. Polyclonal antibodies for rTFF3, the rIgGFcγBP C-terminal domain and the rMuc2 C-terminal domain confirmed their localization in the mucus layer and in the mucus collected from the rat intestinal loose layer or firm layer in both western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments. A complex of rTFF3, which was approximately 250 kDa, and a monomer of 6 kDa were present in both layers of the intestinal mucus; rIgGFcγBP was present in the complex (250-280 kDa) under non-reducing conditions, but shifted to 164 kDa under reducing conditions in both of the layers. rMuc2 was found mainly in a complex of 214-270 kDa under non-reducing conditions, but it shifted to 140 kDa under reducing conditions. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that binding occurs among rTFF3, rIgGFcγBP and rMuc2 in the RIPA buffer soluble intestinal mucus. Blocking the covalent interaction by 100 mM DTT in the RIPA buffer soluble intestinal mucus disassociated their binding.Rat goblet cell-secreted TFF3, IgGFcγBP and Muc2, existing in the two intestinal mucus layers, are bound together by covalent interactions in the soluble fraction of intestinal mucus and form heteropolymers to be one of the biochemical mechanisms of composing the net-like structure of mucus."
https://openalex.org/W2094380855,"Background To detect soft sounds, the mammalian cochlea increases its sensitivity by amplifying incoming sounds up to one thousand times. Although the cochlear amplifier is thought to be a local cellular process at an area basal to the response peak on the spiral basilar membrane, its location has not been demonstrated experimentally. Methodology and Principal Findings Using a sensitive laser interferometer to measure sub-nanometer vibrations at two locations along the basilar membrane in sensitive gerbil cochleae, here we show that the cochlea can boost soft sound-induced vibrations as much as 50 dB/mm at an area proximal to the response peak on the basilar membrane. The observed amplification works maximally at low sound levels and at frequencies immediately below the peak-response frequency of the measured apical location. The amplification decreases more than 65 dB/mm as sound levels increases. Conclusions and Significance We conclude that the cochlea amplifier resides at a small longitudinal region basal to the response peak in the sensitive cochlea. These data provides critical information for advancing our knowledge on cochlear mechanisms responsible for the remarkable hearing sensitivity, frequency selectivity and dynamic range."
https://openalex.org/W2014190895,"Diacylglycerol (DAG)-mediated signaling pathways, such as those mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), are central in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. DAG-responsive C1 domains are therefore considered attractive drug targets. Our group has designed a novel class of compounds targeted to the DAG binding site within the C1 domain of PKC. We have previously shown that these 5-(hydroxymethyl)isophthalates modulate PKC activation in living cells. In this study we investigated their effects on HeLa human cervical cancer cell viability and proliferation by using standard cytotoxicity tests and an automated imaging platform with machine vision technology. Cellular effects and their mechanisms were further characterized with the most potent compound, HMI-1a3. Isophthalate derivatives with high affinity to the PKC C1 domain exhibited antiproliferative and non-necrotic cytotoxic effects on HeLa cells. The anti-proliferative effect was irreversible and accompanied by cell elongation. HMI-1a3 induced down-regulation of retinoblastoma protein and cyclins A, B1, D1, and E. Effects of isophthalates on cell morphology, cell proliferation and expression of cell cycle-related proteins were different from those induced by phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or bryostatin 1, but correlated closely to binding affinities. Therefore, the results strongly indicate that the effect is C1 domain-mediated."
https://openalex.org/W2150474208,"The pathogenesis of natural scrapie and other prion diseases remains unclear. Examining transcriptome variations in infected versus control animals may highlight new genes potentially involved in some of the molecular mechanisms of prion-induced pathology. The aim of this work was to identify disease-associated alterations in the gene expression profiles of the caudal medulla oblongata (MO) in sheep presenting the symptomatic phase of natural scrapie. The gene expression patterns in the MO from 7 sheep that had been naturally infected with scrapie were compared with 6 controls using a Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) custom designed 4×44K microarray. The microarray consisted of a probe set on the previously sequenced ovine tissue library by CVI and was supplemented with all of the Ovis aries transcripts that are currently publicly available. Over 350 probe sets displayed greater than 2-fold changes in expression. We identified 148 genes from these probes, many of which encode proteins that are involved in the immune response, ion transport, cell adhesion, and transcription. Our results confirm previously published gene expression changes that were observed in murine models with induced scrapie. Moreover, we have identified new genes that exhibit differential expression in scrapie and could be involved in prion neuropathology. Finally, we have investigated the relationship between gene expression profiles and the appearance of the main scrapie-related lesions, including prion protein deposition, gliosis and spongiosis. In this context, the potential impacts of these gene expression changes in the MO on scrapie development are discussed."

The ubiquitin (Ub) chain amputation activity removes the entire polyUb chain from the substrates. The Ub chain trimming activity progressively cleaves a polyUb chain from the distal end. The Ub chain amputation activity mediates degradation-coupled deubiquitination. The Ub chain trimming activity can play a supportive or an inhibitory role in degradation, likely depending on features of the substrates. How Ub chain trimming assists degradation is not clear. We find that inhibition of the chain trimming activity of the 26 S proteasome with Ub aldehyde significantly inhibits degradation of Ub4 (Lys-48)-UbcH10 and causes accumulation of free Ub4 (generated from chain amputation) that can be retained on the proteasome. Also, a non-trimmable Lys-48-mimic Ub4 efficiently targets UbcH10 to the 26 S proteasome, but it cannot support efficient degradation of UbcH10 compared with regular Lys-48 Ub4. These results indicate that polyUb chain trimming promotes proteasomal degradation of Lys-48-linked substrates. Mechanistically, we propose that Ub chain trimming cleaves the proteasome-bound Lys-48-linked polyUb chains, which vacates the Ub binding sites of the 26 S proteasome, thus allowing continuous substrate loading.

Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 2Finley D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 477-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Ub is a 76-amino acid protein that can be covalently conjugated onto proteins, mostly on lysine residues, as a monomer or a polyUb chain. Protein ubiquitination is carried out by a cascade of enzymatic reactions, including a Ub-activating enzyme E1, a Ub-conjugating enzyme E2, and a Ub ligase E3. The 26 S proteasome is a ∼2.5-MDa-large complex comprised of the 19 S regulatory complex (called PA700 in mammals) and the 20 S proteasome. PA700 has at least 19 subunits that have multiple activities, including gate opening of the 20 S proteasome, recruiting substrates to the proteasome, and processing substrates ready for degradation. The six AAA ATPase subunits of the PA700 form a ring abutting on either or both ends of the 20 S proteasome to form the 26 S proteasome (3Tomko Jr., R.J. Funakoshi M. Schneider K. Wang J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ubiquitin non-trimmable ubiquitin aldehyde. Interestingly, Ub is recycled during proteolysis, which is spared from the 26 S proteasome by the proteasome-residing deubiquitinating enzymes. The mammalian 26 S proteasome possesses two distinct deubiquitinating activities: the S13/Rpn11 subunit catalyzes chain amputation activity which cleaves the entire polyUb chain directly from the substrates (4Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). S13/Rpn11 is a Zn2+-dependent metalloprotease (4Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 5Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Its deubiquitinating activity is activated when assembled into the 26 S proteasome, and it is highly conserved in all eukaryotic proteasomes. It was found that the polyUb chain amputation activity is necessary to mediate degradation-coupled deubiquitination (4Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 5Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), likely by clearing the steric restriction of polyUb chains that otherwise could impede the substrate to enter the narrow substrate delivery channel of the 26 S proteasome. Moreover, when coupled with degradation, chain amputation is ATP hydrolysis-dependent. In addition to the chain amputation activity, the 26 S proteasome has a polyUb chain trimming activity, which progressively shortens a polyUb chain from the distal site (6Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 7Hu M. Li P. Song L. Jeffrey P.D. Chenova T.A. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3747-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Uch37 and Usp14 are the two deubiquitinating enzymes that have chain trimming activity in mammalian 26 S proteasomes (6Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 7Hu M. Li P. Song L. Jeffrey P.D. Chenova T.A. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3747-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which they perform Ub chain trimming are not fully understood. The chain trimming enzymes are not well conserved among eukaryotes, as budding yeast lacks a homologue of Uch37 but has a Usp14 homologue, Ubp6 (8Park K.C. Woo S.K. Yoo Y.J. Wyndham A.M. Baker R.T.

Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Also, Usp14/Ubp6 is a proteasome-associating enzyme. Its residence on the 26 S proteasome is highly salt concentration-sensitive (9Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 10Koulich E. Li X. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Currently, the Ub chain trimming was found to have double-edged effects on degradation. It was originally suggested that the chain trimming activity serves as a safeguard to rescue poorly ubiquitinated proteins from the proteasome by editing the conjugates (6Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We recently found that Lys-63 polyUb chains are highly susceptible to chain trimming, which renders Lys-63-linked polyUb conjugates to be rapidly deubiquitinated by the 26 S proteasome without efficient degradation (11Jacobson A.D. Zhang N.Y. Xu P. Han K.J. Noone S. Peng J. Liu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35485-35494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, Ub chain trimming could rescue Lys-63-linked substrates from proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this, Ubp6 and Usp14 were recently found to play a negative role in mediating proteolysis (12Lee B.H. Lee M.J. Park S. Oh D.C. Elsasser S. Chen P.C. Gartner C. Dimova N. Hanna J. Gygi S.P. Wilson S.M. King R.W. Finley D. Nature. 2010; 467: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ub chain trimming was also found to play a positive role in mediating degradation. In yeast cells, depletion of Ubp6 impairs degradation of some proteasomal substrates, including Ub-Pro-β-galactosidase (9Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Uch37, Usp14, Adrm1 (the Uch37 activator (13Qiu X.B. Ouyang S.Y. Li C.J. Miao S. Wang L. Goldberg A.L.

Li X. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 13Qiu X.B. Ouyang S.Y. Li C.J. Miao S. Wang L. Goldberg A.L.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13854-13859Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of the chain trimming activity abolishes efficient degradation of some Lys-48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins in in vitro reconstituted degradation assays (17Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The discrepancies in these studies might reflect the versatility of the chain trimming activity in mediating protein degradation in the context of specific features of the substrates, such as different Ub chain linkages and substrate stabilities (see “Discussion”). PolyUb chains can be linked through the internal Lys-6, Lys-11, Lys-27, Lys-29, Lys-33, Lys-48, or Lys-63, or through the α-amino group. Recent proteomic studies showed that all lysine-orientated polyUb linkages except Lys-63 could serve as proteolytic signals (11Jacobson A.D. Zhang N.Y. Xu P. Han K.J. Noone S. Peng J. Liu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35485-35494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Xu P. Duong D.M. Seyfried N.T. Cheng D. Xie Y. Robert J. Rush J. Hochstrasser M. Finley D. Peng J. Cell. 2009; 137: 133-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Lys-48-linked polyUb chains are one of the primary linkages that target proteins for proteolysis. Previous studies have shown that the chain trimming activity supports degradation of Lys-48-linked substrates (17Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Xu P. Duong D.M. Seyfried N.T. Cheng D. Xie Y. Robert J. Rush J. Hochstrasser M. Finley D. Peng J. Cell. 2009; 137: 133-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism is not clear. One hypothesis for explaining how the chain trimming activity can support degradation is that chain trimming cleaves polyUb chains into short forms that have low proteasomal binding affinity, by which it may vacate the Ub binding sites of the proteasome for the next round of substrate loading. In this study, we performed biochemical experiments using an in vitro reconstitution system to test this hypothesis. Antibodies were purchased against the following proteins: UbcH10 (Boston Biochem), Ub (P4D1), Myc (9E10), and Cdc27 (AF3.1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit antibody against the s7 subunit of the proteasome was a gift from Dr. G. N. DeMartino (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Ubal (Enzo Life) was prepared in a small volume of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6) with 3 m urea to break possible aggregates and then diluted with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6) to a final concentration of 100 μm Ubal with 0.5 m urea and stored at −80 °C. Lys-48 Ub4 was synthesized according to a previously reported method using yeast Ub variants (19Raasi S. Pickart C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 47-55PubMed Google Scholar). For synthesis of chemically cross-linked non-trimmable (NT) Ub4, we used E225K to catalyze the ligation of NT Lys-48Ub2 and Gly-76Ub2. NT Lys-48Ub2 was synthesized according to a method established in Dr. Wilkinson's group with minor changes (20Yin L. Krantz B. Russell N.S. Deshpande S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10001-10010Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Russell N.S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4844-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 mg of UbG76C (which donates Lys-48 for NT Ub4 synthesis) was reacted with 1.2× molar amounts of 1,3-dichloroacetone on ice for 30 min. Then 100 mg of UbK48C,Asp-77 was added for another 1-h incubation. 50 mm 2-Mercaptoethanol (βME) was then added into the reaction mixture to inactivate 1,3-dichloroacetone and break disulfide bonds. After a 30-min incubation, the reaction mixtures were then acidified to pH 5.2 using 2N acetic acid. The mixtures contained unreacted Ub monomers and three Ub2 forms (UbG76C-UbG76C, UbG76C-UbK48C,Asp-77, and UbK48C,Asp-77-UbK48C,Asp-77) by inter- or intra-Ub cross-linking. On the basis of their charge differences under acidic pH, these Ub2 were separated by an 8-ml SP-Sepharose column on an FPLC system using 0–300 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.2). UbG76C-UbK48C,Asp-77 (denoted as Lys-48Ub2) was eluted in the middle peak of the Ub2 fractions. Fractions containing pure Lys-48Ub2 were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm NH4HCO3 and then lyophilized. Mass spectroscopic analysis confirmed that the pooled fractions predominantly contained Lys-48Ub2 with small amounts of monoUb. A similar method was used to synthesize NT Gly-76Ub2 (UbK48C-UbK48R,G76C) using the UbK48C and UbK48R,G76C variants, in which UbK48C donates the C-terminal Gly-76 for NT Ub4 synthesis. For NT Ub4 synthesis, the reaction contained 100 nm human E1, 20 μm GST-E225K, 2 mg/ml Lys-48Ub2, 2 mg/ml Gly-76Ub2 in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, and 1 mm βME. After overnight incubation at 30 °C, E1 and GST-E225K were bound to 1 ml Q-Sepharose resin. The Q-Sepharose resin was then removed by a 10-ml open column, and NT Ub4 was present in the flowthrough. 20 μg/ml YUH1 was then added into the flowthrough for 1-h incubation at 37 °C to remove the Asp-77 residue in the NT Ub4, which activates the only available Gly-76 residue in the NT Ub4 and enables it to be conjugated to substrates. YUH1 was then removed by 0.5 ml of Q-Sepharose resin. NT Ub4 in the unbound fraction was further purified on an 8-ml SP column at pH 5.2 using a gradient from 0–380 mm NaCl. All purified polyUb chains were dialyzed into 20 mm NH4HCO3 and lyophilized. If necessary, redissolved polyUb chains were further purified by a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (120 ml) on an FPLC system. The purity of the final Lys-48 Ub4 or NT Ub4 was > 85%, as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. The bovine 26 S proteasome and PA700 were purified according to previously established methods (17Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol.

Conjugation of Ub4 onto UbcH10 and myc-cyclin B11-102, as well as in vitro proteasomal degradation, were performed according to our published methods (11Jacobson A.D. Zhang N.Y. Xu P. Han K.J.

The flowthrough was eluted directly into a 1.5-ml microtube with 20 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer. 30 μl of samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting assays. To determine the interaction between the 26 S proteasome (13.5 nm) and Ub4 (Lys-48 or NT)-UbcH10 (100 nm), we used homemade Sephadex G-100 spin columns (exclusion limit is 80 kDa). After centrifugation, all resulting mixtures (75 μl) were concentrated to ∼30 μl by heating and then loaded for separation by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting of UbcH10. We have previously established an in vitro system to assess proteasomal degradation using purified bovine 26 S proteasomes and synthesized Ub4 (Lys-48)-UbcH10 as the substrate (17Liu C.W. Li X.

This valuable reconstitution system has been utilized for elucidating the roles of ATP hydrolysis (17Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), substrate recognition (23Zhao M. Zhang N.Y. Zurawel A. Hansen K.C. Liu C.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 35485-35494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) in proteolysis. We previously found that degradation of Ub4 (Lys-48)-UbcH10 by purified bovine 26 S proteasomes was significantly blocked by deubiquitinase inhibitors: Ubal (inhibiting the chain trimming activity) or 1,10-phenanthroline (inhibiting the chain amputation activity) (17Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Ubal and 1,10-phenanthroline inhibit thio-proteases and the Rpn11 metalloprotease in the 26 S proteasome, respectively. Here, we further explored the inhibitory effect of Ubal on proteasomal degradation. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, degradation of Ub4 (Lys-48)-UbcH10 occurred at a much slower rate when Ubal was added in the reaction mixtures. This inhibitory effect is likely not caused by blocking the substrate binding to the 26 S proteasome because we have shown that neither Ubal nor 1,10-phenanthroline prevents Ub4 (Lys-48)-UbcH10 binding the 26 S proteasome (11Jacobson A.D. Zhang N.Y. Xu P. Han K.J. Noone S. Peng J. Liu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35485-35494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, immunoblotting of Ub showed that accumulation of Ub4 was obvious in reactions with Ubal (Fig. 1A, lower panel). In contrast, no free Ub4 was detected in reactions without Ubal treatment (Fig. 1B), in which the substrate was more rapidly degraded despite the 26 S proteasome concentration being only one half of that added in the reaction A. Not surprisingly, slow degradation of Lys-48 Ub4-UbcH10 in the presence of Ubal was further blocked when the chain amputation activity was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 1A, lane 5). These results indicate that the slow degradation of Ub4 (Lys-48)-UbcH10 in the presence of Ubal is mediated by the chain amputation activity. Of note, a portion of Ub4 chain could be degraded together with UbcH10 when the chain trimming activity was inhibited by Ubal because impairment of the chain trimming activity has been previously shown to cause Ub degradation (9Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine whether the degradation inhibitory effect of Ubal is attributed to the Ub moiety, which could bind to the 26 S proteasome subunit Adrm1 (24Husnjak K. Elsasser S. Zhang N. Chen X. Randles L. Shi Y. Hofmann K. Walters K.J. Finley D. Dikic I. Nature. 2008; 453: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 25Schreiner P. Chen X. Husnjak K. Randles L. Zhang N.

Cell. 2010; 38: 404-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We performed the degradation assay by addition of monoUb. Compared with the reaction shown in Fig. 1B, the presence of monoUb had no effect on degradation of Ub4 (Lys-48)-UbcH10 (C). This result suggests that the degradation inhibitory effect of Ubal is likely due to inhibition of the chain trimming activity. Next, we attempted to identify deubiquitinating enzymes of the 26 S proteasome that can be modified with Ubal. We used HA-tagged Ub vinyl sulfone to covalently modify the catalytic cysteine residue of the potential deubiquitinating enzymes. After incubating HA-Ub-vinyl sulfone with the 26 S proteasome, proteins were denatured with 6 m urea and resolved in SDS-PAGE. Two subunits with molecular weights corresponding to Uch37 and Usp14 were predominately modified with HA-Ub-vinyl sulfone, as revealed by immunoblotting of HA (supplemental Fig. S1A). Modification of Uch37 and Usp14 were further verified by immunoblotting with an anti-Uch37 or anti-Usp14 antibody (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Therefore, Ubal modifies both chain trimming enzymes of the 26 S proteasome. S5a and Adrm1 are the primary Ub receptors of the 26 S proteasome (24Husnjak K. Elsasser S. Zhang N. Chen X. Randles L.

Fushman D. Walters K.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 280-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). S5a binds polyUb chains with high affinity, whereas Adrm1 binds both monoUb and polyUb chains (24Husnjak K. Elsasser S. Zhang N. Chen X. Randles L. Shi Y. Hofmann K. Walters K.J. Finley D. Dikic I. Nature. 2008; 453: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Interestingly, efficient degradation of UbcH10 requires both a polyUb chain modification and its N-terminal unstructured region to bind the 26 S proteasome (23Zhao M. Zhang N.Y. Zurawel A. Hansen K.C. Liu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4771-4780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One possible interpretation for the requirement of two binding elements is that the high binding affinity of a polyUb chain targets the substrate to the 26 S proteasome, whereas a weaker interaction between an unstructured region in the substrate and the proteasome, presumably on the ATPase subunit(s), engages the substrate to the ATPase ring for unfolding and translocation. Apparently, blocking substrate binding can inhibit proteasomal degradation, which likely accounts for the degradation inhibitory effect of free polyUb chains (29Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 30Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). If the free Ub4 accumulated in degradation reactions containing Ubal is retained on the 26 S proteasome, it could inhibit degradation. To test this, we employed size-exclusion spin column assays to examine whether free Ub4 generated in degradation reactions with Ubal treatment binds the 26 S proteasome. As shown in Fig. 1D (lane 1), Ub4 and Ub4 (Lys-48)-UbcH10 alone were absent in the flowthrough after passing through a Sephadex G-100 (80 kDa exclusion limit) spin column, indicating that they were trapped in the resin. When degradation mixtures from a 12-min reaction without Ubal treatment (Fig. 1D, lane 2) or from a 36-min reaction with Ubal treatment (lane 3) were applied to the spin column assay, Ub4 (Lys-48)-UbcH10 was detected in the flowthrough, indicating that it binds the 26 S proteasome. Moreover, free Ub4 was found to coelute with the 26 S proteasome together with the substrate in the reaction with Ubal treatment (Fig. 1D, lane 3). Thus, when Ub chain trimming is inhibited, free polyUb chain generated from chain amputation can remain on the 26 S proteasome. If timely recycling of the Ub binding sites of the 26 S proteasome is necessary to promote degradation of Lys-48-linked polyUb conjugates, we would predict that a Lys-48-mimic polyUb chain resistant to chain trimming would inhibit protein degradation. To test this, we synthesized a Lys-48-mimic Ub4 in which both the proximal and the distal Lys-48-Gly-76 linkages in each Ub2 moiety were chemically cross-linked using cysteine mutants (Fig. 2A), according to a previously established method (20Yin L. Krantz B. Russell N.S. Deshpande S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10001-10010Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Russell N.S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4844-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ub4 was then formed by enzymatically conjugating the two cross-linked Ub2 chains with an authentic Lys-48-linked isopeptide bond (Fig. 2, A and B). Of note, the linkages in the cross-linked Ub dimers are one atom longer than the authentic Lys-48-linked isopeptide. Other than that, the polarity of the linkage is largely maintained (20Yin L. Krantz B. Russell N.S. Deshpande S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10001-10010Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). With the purified Lys-48-mimic Ub4, we first examined if it binds the 26 S proteasome. As shown in Fig. 2C, the size exclusion spin column assay revealed that similar amounts of Lys-48 Ub4 and chemically cross-linked Ub4 were detected in the flowthrough with the 26 S proteasome after centrifugation, indicating that they have comparable binding to the 26 S proteasome. Thus, the chemically cross-linked bonds do not interfere with proteasomal binding. Next, we examined if the chemically cross-linked proximal and distal bonds in this Ub4 are resistant to proteasome-mediated deubiquitination. As assayed with immunoblotting and Coomassie-staining, cross-linked Ub4 was resistant to deubiquitination by purified 26 S proteasomes even in a four-hour incubation (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast, regular Lys-48 Ub4 was rapidly deubiquitinated (Fig. 2D). Thereafter, we referred the cross-linked Ub4 as non-trimmable (NT) Ub4. It is interesting that the authentic isopeptide bond in NT Ub4 is quite resistant to proteasomal cleavage. We then asked if this bond is accessible to other deubiquitinating enzymes. A20 contains both an E3 Ub ligase domain and an OTU domain that catalyzes deubiquitination (31Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). The OTU domain of A20 can deubiquitinate Lys-48-linked polyUb chains (32Komander D. Reyes-Turcu F. Licchesi J.D. Odenwaelder P. Wilkinson K.D. Barford D. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Incubation of the recombinant OTU domain of A20 with regular Lys-48 Ub4 or NT Ub4 resulted in deubiquitination (Fig. 2E). A20-mediated deubiquitination of NT Ub4 only generated Ub2. In contrast, deubiquitination of regular Lys-48 Ub4 produced Ub3, Ub2, and Ub (Fig. 2E). Together, these results indicate that, compared with regular Lys-48 Ub4, NT Ub4 binds the 26 S proteasome efficiently. However, the chemically cross-linked distal and proximal linkages block the proteasome-mediated progressive chain trimming. NT Ub4 binds the 26 S proteasome but it is not deubiquitinated into short forms as seen with regular Lys-48 Ub4. Accordingly, we expect NT Ub4 to be a potent competitor for substrate binding and to inhibit proteasomal degradation more efficiently than regular Lys-48 Ub4. To test this, we first examined if NT Ub4 c"

This model also accounts for earlier observations showing the origin of carbon atoms in the products, as well as the absence of detection of any covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate.

Kce is the first representative of a large family of prokaryotic hypothetical proteins, currently annotated as the “domain of unknown function” DUF849. One of the most striking outputs of genome sequencing is the high proportion of proteins without pertinent functional annotation. Predicted genes have been mainly annotated on the basis of sequence homology to already characterized proteins from other genomes, resulting, on average, in a fraction as high as 30–50% of predicted gene products that, in a given genome, have no accurate functional assignments. These hundreds of proteins without known function within a single organism prevent a deeper understanding of the cell as a biological system because it might be expected that some of these proteins of yet undiscovered functionalities may end up revealing significant novelty in chemical reactions. The increasing numbers of proteins of unknown function from newly sequenced genomes have been grouped into families and classified within the Pfam database as “domain of unknown function” (DUF) 6The abbreviations used are: DUFdomain of unknown functionKAH3-keto-5-aminohexanoateKce3-keto-5-aminohexanoate cleavage enzymeTIMtriose phosphate isomeraser.m.s.root mean squareMADmultiwavelength anomalous diffraction.

To narrow down the possible functions of each family and to achieve a better perception of the protein universe, the NIH Protein Structure Initiative (PSI; www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/PSI) has made a systematic effort to produce representative structures of most DUF families (6Jaroszewski L.

Our attention was drawn by DUF849, a family restricted to prokaryotes and found in ∼850 bacterial proteins belonging to several different phyla where, according to gene predictions, it accounts in most (albeit not all) cases for the whole protein chain. Despite the fact that a few crystallographic structures of proteins associated with DUF849 have been recently deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), no mechanistic or biochemical investigation is at present available. In a previous work, we identified a gene associated with DUF849 as coding for the 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate cleavage enzyme (Kce) involved in the lysine fermentation pathway (7Kreimeyer A. Perret A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 7191-7197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), an intriguing enzyme whose catalytic mechanism has remained so far enigmatic. The reaction catalyzed by Kce involves the reversible condensation of a six-carbon molecule, 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate (KAH), derived from l-lysine, through three different reactions with acetyl-CoA to produce two four-carbon species, of which one still esterified to CoA, i.e. acetoacetate and a 3-aminobutyryl-CoA (8Barker H.A.

Here, we investigated the catalytic mechanism of Kce from Candidatus Cloacamonas acidaminovorans by structural and biochemical means. We determined the crystal structures of the enzyme in its native state, as well as complexed with either one of its natural substrates ((S)-KAH) or one of the products (acetoacetate). Additionally, we modeled the assumed intermediates of the reaction into the binding pocket, resulting in poses that agree with the proposed catalytic mechanism. The ensemble of our results suggests that the enzyme, although structurally similar to class II aldolases, proceeds through a Claisen-like condensation with the peculiarity that CoA moiety is transferred in an intramolecular fashion to the keto group of the KAH moiety.

Oligonucleotide sequences are provided in supplemental Table S1. X-ray diffraction data were collected either at Synchrotron Soleil (Saint-Aubin, France) or at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble, France) from single crystals at 100 K. Diffraction frames were processed with XDS (11Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The structure was solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing from Se-Met-labeled protein crystals. A total of 27 selenium sites in the asymmetric unit were located with the program SHELXD (13Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr.

Acetyl-CoA and 3-aminobutyryl-CoA chemical depictions were retrieved from the PubChem Compound database (pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Intermediates of reaction were built with ChemDraw, whereas docking simulations were run with Autodock Vina (22Trott O. Olson A.J. J. Comput.

Energy minimization of intermediate I1 (the deprotonated form of KAH) and acetyl-CoA in the binding pocket proceeded using MMTK (23Hinsen K. J. Comput.

The structure of Kce was solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction on selenomethionyl-labeled protein crystals diffracting at 3.2 Å resolution (supplemental Table S2). The non-isomorphous structures of the native enzyme at higher resolution (1.6 Å), as well as the complexes with substrates and products, were solved by molecular replacement; a total of four separate models were refined at resolutions ranging from 1.75 to 1.28 Å (Table 1). In all the crystal structures determined, the enzyme is assembled as a homotetramer with point symmetry 222 (Fig. 1B), consistent with the observed tetrameric state of the recombinant enzyme in solution (7Kreimeyer A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 7191-7197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and with earlier observations on purified bacterial homologs from other species (8Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Chew S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Hedrick L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 201-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yorifuji T. Jeng I.M. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 20-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit, made of 276 residues, shows the canonical (β/α)8 TIM barrel fold, with a short additional C-terminal α-helix (α9) protruding at the N-terminal face of the barrel and three β-turn extensions coming out from the barrel core, inserted in between β2 and α2 (residues 49–58), β4 and α4 (residues 112–119), and β8 and α8 (residues 234–240) (Fig. 1C). The only missing part in the model is the loop connecting β3 to α3 (residues 85–92), due to the lack of supporting electron density in two out of the four monomers, as a consequence of its high conformational flexibility (Fig. 1B). Each protomer buries a total of ∼2100 Å2 (18%) of the monomer surface in intersubunit contacts, which mainly involve helices α5 and α6, as well as the β-turn β4a-β4b, for one dyad, and α7 and α8 for the other dyad. As observed in the vast majority of TIM barrel enzymes, the active site is situated in each monomer at the C-terminal face of the central β-barrel and could be identified by the presence of a metal ion coordinated by His-46, His-48, and Glu-230 (Fig. 1D). This ion was modeled as Zn2+ according to its coordination geometry, and its nature was then confirmed by the analysis of double difference anomalous maps calculated from data collected around the zinc K-edge (supplemental Fig. S1A and supplemental Table S3). The metal ion is situated at the bottom of a crevice accessible from two opposite openings, one of which is delimited by the mobile β3-α3 loop (Fig. 1D). A structural similarity search showed significant matches (Cα r.m.s. deviation ∼1.2 Å) to seven structures of proteins of unknown function, all composed of the Pfam database DUF849 domain (PDB entries 3NO5, 3CHV, 3FA5, 3LOT, 3E02, 3E49, and 3C6C) and showing a conserved divalent metal ion and its coordinating environment. However, no complexes with substrates or products, nor biochemical data about these enzymes, were available, and no mechanistic clues on catalysis could thus be inferred from a simple structural comparison. To get insights into the catalytic mechanism, we crystallized Kce in complex with either the substrate (S)-3-keto-5-aminohexanoate ((S)-KAH) or the product acetoacetate in two different space groups (Table 1). Both molecules were found to bind at full occupancy and could be modeled unambiguously in the active site (Fig. 2). The binding of KAH did not promote significant overall structural changes (Cα r.m.s. deviation ∼0.9 Å) as the main chain displacements are essentially limited to the β3-α3 loop and the α3 helix (residues 82–100). In particular, the β3-α3 loop, floppy in the native enzyme, is well structured upon the bound KAH closing one of the two entrances to the active site and leaving only one access to the Zn2+ crevice for the second substrate acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1D). Further, the side chains of most residues surrounding the active site pocket adopt different rotamers with respect to the unliganded enzyme, reorienting toward the bound KAH. The β-keto acid binds as a bidentate chelator of Zn2+, with a carboxylate oxygen as well as the keto group coordinating the divalent ion at distances of 2.0 and 2.2 Å, respectively (Fig. 2A). The binding of the substrate is further stabilized by the hydrogen bonds of the carboxylate of KAH with the hydroxyl groups of Ser-82 and Thr-106 and the amide group of Asn-108, therefore preventing the decarboxylative formation of enolate as observed in decarboxylating condensing enzymes of fatty acid and polyketide synthesis (25Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The δ-amino group of KAH interacts with the main chain carbonyl of Gly-85 and the carboxyl of Glu-14 (Fig. 2A). These interactions play a key role in the proper positioning of the S-ligand, suggesting a S-stereopreference of the enzyme. Indeed, the kinetic data show a moderate stereospecificity, the relative activity with (R)-KAH being 40% of the activity obtained with (S)-KAH (initial rates obtained with 600 μm KAH at a saturating concentration of acetyl-CoA). In addition to Gly-85, the β3-α3 loop also contributes to the binding of the substrate through Val-87, whose side chain makes hydrophobic interactions with the terminal methyl group of KAH. The side chains of Val-87, Phe-114, and Phe-119 define a small hydrophobic cleft in which the methyl group of KAH is inserted (Fig. 2A). A well ordered water molecule could be placed approximately halfway between the NH2 of the fully conserved Arg-226 and the carbon 2 of KAH, the predicted site of C–C cleavage in the course of the reaction, to which it positioned at an average distance of 2.9 Å, suggesting a possible role in catalysis (see below). The structure of Kce in complex with the reaction product acetoacetate, although obtained from crystals belonging to a different space group, shows a virtually identical enzyme fold (Cα r.m.s. deviation = 0.3 Å) when compared with the complex with KAH. Acetoacetate also binds to the Zn2+ ion as a bidentate ligand, with the carboxylate group superimposable to that of KAH, making the same interactions with Ser-82, Thr-106, and Asn-108 (Fig. 2B). However, the orientation of the molecule is approximately perpendicular to the six-carbon chain of KAH because the ketonyl oxygen of acetoacetate coordinates the metal from the Arg-226 side, with which it interacts firmly (Fig. 2B). This oxygen atom actually displaces the water molecule observed, in both the native enzyme and the KAH complex, to make a hydrogen bond with the guanidinium group of Arg-226 (see above), whereas the methyl group of acetoacetate makes van der Waals contacts with Val-172. Another water molecule now completes the Zn2+ coordination sphere in the position otherwise occupied by the β-keto oxygen of KAH. From the two snapshot structures, (S)-KAH-Kce and acetoacetate-Kce, and considering the primary results on the origin of carbon atoms of reaction products through tracer experiments (10Yorifuji T. Jeng I.M. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 20-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we suggest a potential reaction mechanism, depicted in Fig. 3. We hypothesize that the condensation catalyzed by Kce is a Zn2+-dependent, Claisen-like mechanism (25Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) that proceeds through the formation of four intermediates: an enolate derived from (S)-KAH (here named I1), a first tetrahedral high-energy intermediate (I2), a second tetrahedral high-energy intermediate (I3), and eventually an enolate form of acetoacetate (I4). Computational modeling of the predicted reaction intermediates shows compatible positioning in the active site for all of them (Fig. 4), in agreement with our hypothesis. Indeed, it has been reported that high-energy intermediates are more likely to adopt catalytically competent poses in molecular docking than ground-state intermediates (26Hermann J.C. Ghanem E. Li Y.

Shoichet B.K. Raushel F.M. Nature. 2007; 448: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Moreover, this kind of Claisen-like mechanism is fully compatible with the catalyzed reaction being reversible, as reported earlier from other Kce homologs (8Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Chew S. J.

Hedstrom L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 266-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We propose that the condensation starts by the abstraction of the pro-S proton from C2 of KAH, mediated by a catalytic water molecule activated by the Asp-231-Arg-226 charge relay dyad. The key role of this Asp-Arg dyad in catalysis is strengthened by the observation that its disruption, illustrated by the Arg-226 or Asp-231 to glycine variants, leads to a catalytically inactive enzyme (Table 2). According to our hypothesis, the stability of the resulting negatively charged KAH enolate (I1) is ensured by interactions with the Zn2+ cation and through hydrogen bonds with Thr-106 and Ser-82, as observed in the crystal structure of the Kce-KAH complex and further supported by the docking model (Fig. 4, I1). Steady-state kinetic data are also consistent with this scheme as the replacement of Ser-82 by a glycine significantly increases the Km for KAH and decreases the kcat (Table 2). Although initial attempts of docking acetyl-CoA onto the crystallographic structure of the KAH-Kce complex failed, suggesting that either KAH adopts a different conformation in the presence of acetyl-CoA or the active site undergoes further conformational changes to accommodate both substrates, a perfect match could be obtained with the two reactive entities, i.e. I1 and acetyl-CoA, in the binding pocket (Fig. 4). According to this model, the orientation of the pantetheine chain of acetyl-CoA is parallel to (S)-KAH (supplemental Fig. S2A). The carbonyl carbon of acetyl-CoA is within van der Waals contact range to both C1 and C2 of KAH (respective distances are 3.4 and 3.1 Å) and is therefore well placed to react with the deprotonated carbon C2 of KAH (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, I1). Nucleophilic addition of enolate I1 to the thioester carbon of the acetyl-CoA would lead to a tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate I2 strongly coordinated to the Zn2+ ion (Fig. 3). As suggested by docking calculations, the KAH-derived part of I2 is perfectly superimposed on the position of the substrate in the KAH-Kce crystallographic structure (Fig. 4, I2). The oxyanion from the acetyl moiety from acetyl-CoA takes exactly the same position as the oxygen atom of the well ordered water molecule and is stabilized by a hydrogen bond with Arg-226, whereas the three oxygen atoms (i.e. the oxyanion from acetyl-CoA and the carboxylic and the β-keto oxygens from KAH) form a tripod-like structure with the peak being the Zn2+ ion (Fig. 3, I2). In this conformation, the sulfur atom of acetyl-CoA makes polar interactions with Tyr-145 and van der Waals contacts with Phe-114, Val-172, and Arg-226, whereas the methyl group of the acetyl moiety is stabilized through van der Waals contacts with Glu-143 and Val-172. The short distance between the sulfur atom of the CoA moiety and the C3 keto atom of the former KAH (3.2 Å in the docking model), as well as the angle between the two reactive centers (∼100°, close to the Bürgi-Dunitz trajectory (29Burgi H.B. Dunitz J.D. Lehn J.M. Wipff G. Tetrahedron. 1974; 30: 1563-1572Crossref Scopus (696) Google Scholar)), suggest that the intermediate may collapse through an intramolecular SCoA nucleophilic addition to the C3 β-keto group (Fig. 3). According to molecular docking, the newly obtained tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate I3 is also expected to coordinate the Zn2+ ion in a similar fashion as I2 (Fig. 4). However, the sulfur atom of acetyl-CoA is here less strongly stabilized by Tyr-145 (d = 3.5 Å) and is mainly held by weak van der Waals contact with Phe-114. This conformation is consistent with an intramolecular retro-Claisen reaction that would release 3-aminobutyryl-CoA as the leaving group and lead to the formation of acetoacetate in the enolate form, bound to Zn2+ ion by a bidentate interaction mediated by the carboxyl and β-keto groups, as well as by hydrogen bonds to Ser-82 and Thr-106 (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). It is worth noting that the predicted conformation of acetoacetate at the end of the catalytic process coincides with the binding mode observed in the high-resolution crystal structure of the enzyme-product complex (Fig. 2B) and is consistent with the origin of carbon atoms in acetoacetate as determined by tracer experiments with 14C made by Barker and co-workers (8Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Chew S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Hedrick L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 201-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yorifuji T. Jeng I.M. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 20-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protonation of the enolic form of acetoacetate, possibly by the action of another water molecule taking part in a proton relay with the Asp-231-Arg-226 dyad (in a reverted process with respect to the deprotonation of KAH), would finally release the acetoacetate (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4).TABLE 2Steady-state kinetic analysis of Kce and point mutantsMutantKm (S)-KAHKm AcCoAkcatkcat/Km ((S)-KAH)kcat/Km (AcCoA)mmmms−1mm−1 · s−1mm−1 · s−1S82G1.181 ± 0.2090.046 ± 0.0100.13 ± 0.030.12.8E143G0.921 ± 0.1000.024 ± 0.0020.37 ± 0.010.415.4E143Q0.442 ± 0.0610.012 ± 0.0020.32 ± 0.050.726.7R226GNDNDND−−D231GNDNDND−−Wild type0.208 ± 0.0320.012 ± 0.0032.69 ± 0.1512.9224.2ND, not determined.

In all docking models (I1, I2, I3, and I4), the adenosine moiety from the CoA ester is situated inside or near the shallow pocket flanked by the side chains of Arg-209 and Lys-237 (supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast, it should be noted that the pantetheine chain is modeled differently in the different intermediates. Indeed, CoA can adopt widely varying conformations in different enzymes (30Anstrom D.M. Kallio K. Remington S.J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), making its mode of binding difficult to predict (31Koon N. Squire C.J. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8295-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the first attempts at modeling acetyl-CoA onto the crystallographic structure of KAH-Kce suggested a role of Glu-143 in stabilizing this substrate in the active site, activity measurements of the Glu-143 to Gly and Gln mutants invalidated this hypothesis as none of these mutations notably altered the Km of the enzyme for acetyl-CoA. Rather, their main effect is to affect the kcat, and to a lesser extent, the Km for KAH (Table 2). Although unexpected, this effect may be explained by the interactions that, in the apo enzyme, Glu-143 makes with Arg-226 (d = 3.0 Å), Asn-108 (d = 3.4 Å), and Glu-141 (d = 2.5 Å) (supplemental Fig. S3A). As crystallographic data revealed that Asn-108 interacts with (S)-KAH (Fig. 2A), Glu-143 variants may alter or suppress the hydrogen bond with the carbamide group of Asn-108, and in turn, slightly lower the stabilization of KAH in the active site, leading to an increased Km. Moreover, Glu-143 is involved in the network of interactions that hold the catalytic water molecule in position, as observed in both the apo Kce structure and the complex with KAH (supplemental Fig. S3), in which it adopts a different rotamer upon substrate binding and structuring of the β3-α3 loop (see above). Substitutions of this residue are thus likely to alter the network that holds the key water molecule, decreasing the overall catalytic efficiency. The wide functional diversity of TIM barrel domains, which at present account for almost 9% of the whole PDB, is well known. The vast majority of these proteins are enzymes, spread ubiquitously in all kingdoms of life and most often involved in metabolic pathways (32Nagano N. Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 741-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). However, despite the already known large chemical variety of reactions catalyzed by this fold, new types of reactions or novel catalytic mechanisms performed by TIM barrel enzymes could still have escaped identification. Indeed, we provide here strong evidence pointing to Kce as the first representative of a new subclass of TIM barrel Zn2+-dependent condensing enzymes. Similarly to canonical class II aldolases, which share with Kce both the presence of the zinc cation and the same (β/α)8 barrel fold, Zn2+ is crucial to chelate both the substrate and the nascent acetoacetate product, as well as to stabilize their enolic forms, but the overall reaction course is mechanistically closer to a carbon-carbon Claisen condensation. Our model is fully consistent with earlier literature reports about the origin of carbon atoms in the products and the fact that no covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate could ever be observed (8Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Chew S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Barker H.A. Kahn J.M. Hedrick L. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 201-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yorifuji T. Jeng I.M. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 20-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further research would reveal whether or not Kce represents a member of a whole new class of enzymes catalyzing carbon-carbon condensations involving CoA esters and small organic β-keto acids.

https://openalex.org/W2009840379,"The neural correlates of binocular rivalry have been actively debated in recent years, and are of considerable interest as they may shed light on mechanisms of conscious awareness. In a related phenomenon, monocular rivalry, a composite image is shown to both eyes. The subject experiences perceptual alternations in which the two stimulus components alternate in clarity or salience. The experience is similar to perceptual alternations in binocular rivalry, although the reduction in visibility of the suppressed component is greater for binocular rivalry, especially at higher stimulus contrasts. We used fMRI at 3T to image activity in visual cortex while subjects perceived either monocular or binocular rivalry, or a matched non-rivalrous control condition. The stimulus patterns were left/right oblique gratings with the luminance contrast set at 9%, 18% or 36%. Compared to a blank screen, both binocular and monocular rivalry showed a U-shaped function of activation as a function of stimulus contrast, i.e. higher activity for most areas at 9% and 36%. The sites of cortical activation for monocular rivalry included occipital pole (V1, V2, V3), ventral temporal, and superior parietal cortex. The additional areas for binocular rivalry included lateral occipital regions, as well as inferior parietal cortex close to the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). In particular, higher-tier areas MT+ and V3A were more active for binocular than monocular rivalry for all contrasts. In comparison, activation in V2 and V3 was reduced for binocular compared to monocular rivalry at the higher contrasts that evoked stronger binocular perceptual suppression, indicating that the effects of suppression are not limited to interocular suppression in V1."
https://openalex.org/W2129118686,"The Drosophila egg chamber provides an excellent system in which to study the specification and differentiation of epithelial cell fates because all of the steps, starting with the division of the corresponding stem cells, called follicle stem cells, have been well described and occur many times over in a single ovary.Here we investigate the role of the small Rab11 GTPase in follicle stem cells (FSCs) and in their differentiating daughters, which include main body epithelial cells, stalk cells and polar cells. We show that rab11-null FSCs maintain their ability to self renew, even though previous studies have shown that FSC self renewal is dependent on maintenance of E-cadherin-based intercellular junctions, which in many cell types, including Drosophila germline stem cells, requires Rab11. We also show that rab11-null FSCs give rise to normal numbers of cells that enter polar, stalk, and epithelial cell differentiation pathways, but that none of the cells complete their differentiation programs and that the epithelial cells undergo premature programmed cell death. Finally we show, through the induction of rab11-null clones at later points in the differentiation program, that Rab11 suppresses tumor-like growth of epithelial cells. Thus, rab11-null epithelial cells arrest differentiation early, assume an aberrant cell morphology, delaminate from the epithelium, and invade the neighboring germline cyst. These phenotypes are associated with defects in E-cadherin localization and a general loss of cell polarity.While previous studies have revealed tumor suppressor or tumor suppressor-like activity for regulators of endocytosis, our study is the first to identify such activity for regulators of endocytic recycling. Our studies also support the recently emerging view that distinct mechanisms regulate junction stability and plasticity in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2000500286,"The vertebrate Lhx2 is a member of the LIM homeobox family of transcription factors. It is essential for the normal development of the forebrain, eye, olfactory system and liver as well for the differentiation of lymphoid cells. However, despite the highly restricted spatio-temporal expression pattern of Lhx2, nothing is known about its transcriptional regulation. In mammals and chicken, Crb2, Dennd1a and Lhx2 constitute a conserved linkage block, while the intervening Dennd1a is lost in the fugu Lhx2 locus. To identify functional enhancers of Lhx2, we predicted conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the human, mouse and fugu Crb2-Lhx2 loci and assayed their function in transgenic mouse at E11.5. Four of the eight CNE constructs tested functioned as tissue-specific enhancers in specific regions of the central nervous system and the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), recapitulating partial and overlapping expression patterns of Lhx2 and Crb2 genes. There was considerable overlap in the expression domains of the CNEs, which suggests that the CNEs are either redundant enhancers or regulating different genes in the locus. Using a large set of CNEs (810 CNEs) associated with transcription factor-encoding genes that express predominantly in the central nervous system, we predicted four over-represented 8-mer motifs that are likely to be associated with expression in the central nervous system. Mutation of one of them in a CNE that drove reporter expression in the neural tube and DRG abolished expression in both domains indicating that this motif is essential for expression in these domains. The failure of the four functional enhancers to recapitulate the complete expression pattern of Lhx2 at E11.5 indicates that there must be other Lhx2 enhancers that are either located outside the region investigated or divergent in mammals and fishes. Other approaches such as sequence comparison between multiple mammals are required to identify and characterize such enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W2051814433,"Objective To assess the sensitivity to change of the McMaster Toronto Arthritis Patient Preference Disability Questionnaire (MACTAR) in chronic low back pain (CLBP) and shifts in patients' priorities of disabling activities over time. Methods A prospective longitudinal survey of 100 patients (38 males) with CLBP in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Evaluation at baseline and 6 months by the MACTAR, Quebec Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (QUEBEC), Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), and pain and handicap visual analogue scales (VASs). Patients' perceived improvement or worsening of condition was assessed at 6 months. Effect size (ES) and Standardized response mean (SRM) and effect size (ES) were used to evaluate sensitivity to change of the MACTAR. Results The MACTAR SRM and ES values (SRM = 0.25; ES = 0.37) were among the highest for the instruments evaluated. For patients considering their condition as improved, the SRM was 0.66 and the ES 1. The 3 disability domains, classified by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), most often cited as priorities at baseline remained the most cited at follow-up: mobility (40.9% of patients); community, social and civic life (22.7%); and domestic life (22.4%). At 6 months, 48 patients shifted their priorities, for a decrease in MACTAR SRM and ES values for patients considering their condition improved and an increase in these values for those considering their condition deteriorated. Conclusions Although the MACTAR has similar sensitivity to change as other outcome measures widely used in CLBP, shifts in patient priorities over time are common and influence scores and sensitivity to change."
https://openalex.org/W2164575428,"Although the ecological importance of coinfection is increasingly recognized, analyses of microbial pathogen dynamics in wildlife usually focus on an ad hoc subset of the species present due to technological limitations on detection. Here we demonstrate the use of expression profiles for immunological genes (pattern recognition receptors, cytokines and transcription factors) as a means to identify, without preconception, the likelihood of important acute microbial infections in wildlife. Using a wood mouse population in the UK as a model we identified significant temporal clusters of individuals with extreme expression of immunological mediators across multiple loci, typical of an acute microbial infection. These clusters were circumstantially associated with demographic perturbation in the summertime wood mouse population. Animals in one cluster also had significantly higher individual macroparasite burdens than contemporaries with ""normal"" expression patterns. If the extreme transcriptional profiles observed are induced by an infectious agent then this implicates macroparasites as a possible player in mediating individual susceptibility or resilience to infection. The form of survey described here, combined with next generation nucleic acids sequencing methods for the broad detection of microbial infectious agents in individuals with anomalous immunological transcriptional profiles, could be a powerful tool for revealing unrecognized, ecologically important infectious agents circulating in wildlife populations."
https://openalex.org/W2066903832,"Activation of an acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) leading to a biosynthesis of GD3 disialoganglioside has been associated with Fas-induced apoptosis of lymphoid cells. The present study was undertaken to clarify the role of this enzyme in the generation of gangliosides during apoptosis triggered by Fas ligation. The issue was addressed by using aSMase-deficient and aSMase-corrected cell lines derived from Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) patients. Fas cross-linking elicited a rapid production of large amounts of complex a- and b-series species of gangliosides with a pattern and a chromatographic behavior as single bands reminiscent of brain gangliosides. The gangliosides were synthesized within the first ten minutes and completely disappeared within thirty minutes after stimulation. Noteworthy is the observation that GD3 was not the only ganglioside produced. The production of gangliosides and the onset of apoptotic hallmarks occurred similarly in both aSMase-deficient and aSMase-corrected NPD lymphoid cells, indicating that aSMase activation is not accountable for ganglioside generation. Hampering ganglioside production by inhibiting the key enzyme glucosylceramide synthase did not abrogate the apoptotic process. In addition, GM3 synthase-deficient lymphoid cells underwent Fas-induced apoptosis, suggesting that gangliosides are unlikely to play an indispensable role in transducing Fas-induced apoptosis of lymphoid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2037903127,"A promising direction in drug development is to exploit the ability of natural killer cells to kill antibody-labeled target cells. Monoclonal antibodies and drugs designed to elicit this effect typically bind cell-surface epitopes that are overexpressed on target cells but also present on other cells. Thus it is important to understand adhesion of cells by antibodies and similar molecules. We present an equilibrium model of such adhesion, incorporating heterogeneity in target cell epitope density, nonspecific adhesion forces, and epitope immobility. We compare with experiments on the adhesion of Jurkat T cells to bilayers containing the relevant natural killer cell receptor, with adhesion mediated by the drug alefacept. We show that a model in which all target cell epitopes are mobile and available is inconsistent with the data, suggesting that more complex mechanisms are at work. We hypothesize that the immobile epitope fraction may change with cell adhesion, and we find that such a model is more consistent with the data, although discrepancies remain. We also quantitatively describe the parameter space in which binding occurs. Our model elaborates substantially on previous work, and our results offer guidance for the refinement of therapeutic immunoadhesins. Furthermore, our comparison with data from Jurkat T cells also points toward mechanisms relating epitope immobility to cell adhesion."
