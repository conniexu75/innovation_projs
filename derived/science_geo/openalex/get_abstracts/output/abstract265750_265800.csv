https://openalex.org/W2025797665,Two parallel metallic rods were used as a wave guide to measure the dielectric constant and electrical conductivity of soils having different electrical conductivities but the same water content. Measurements showed that the two parameters were sufficiently independent to permit simultaneous determinations of water content and bulk electrical conductivity.

https://openalex.org/W2117070013,"Study of Nautilus belauensis i its natural habitat in Palau, West Caroline Islands, shows that growth is slow (0.1 millimeter of shell per day on the average) and decreases as maturity is approached and that individuals may live at least 4 years beyond maturity. Age estimates for seven animals marked and recaptured between 45 and 355 days after release range from 14.5 to 17.2 years. These data indicate that the life-span of Nautilus may exceed 20 years and that its life strategy is very different from that of other living cephalopods."
https://openalex.org/W2045149468,"The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) science team has discovered a shell of particulate material around the star Vega. At the mean distance and temperature of the shell, the expected condensation products from a protostellar nebula would be dominated by frozen volatiles, in particular water ice. It is not possible to discriminate between dirty ice and silicate materials in the Vega shell on the basis of the IRAS data. The Vega shell is probably a ring of cometary bodies with an estimated minimum mass of 15 earth masses, analogous to one that has been hypothesized for the solar system. A possible hot inner shell around Vega may be an asteroid-like belt of material a few astronomical units from the star."

Each line carried a different heat shock protein 22 allele, distinguishable by electrophoresis of the protein. The transfected gene was not expressed at 25 degrees C but could be induced at 36 degrees C. In one line, two heat shock protein 22 electromorphs were synthesized."
