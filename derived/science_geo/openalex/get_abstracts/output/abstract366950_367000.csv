https://openalex.org/W2099340107,"Hyperphosphorylated tau makes up the filamentous intracellular inclusions of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In the disease process, neuronal tau inclusions first appear in the transentorhinal cortex from where they seem to spread to the hippocampal formation and neocortex. Cognitive impairment becomes manifest when inclusions reach the hippocampus, with abundant neocortical tau inclusions and extracellular beta-amyloid deposits being the defining pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. An abundance of tau inclusions, in the absence of beta-amyloid deposits, defines Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and other diseases. Tau mutations cause familial forms of frontotemporal dementia, establishing that tau protein dysfunction is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and dementia. Thus, transgenic mice expressing mutant (for example, P301S) human tau in nerve cells show the essential features of tauopathies, including neurodegeneration and abundant filaments made of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. By contrast, mouse lines expressing single isoforms of wild-type human tau do not produce tau filaments or show neurodegeneration. Here we have used tau-expressing lines to investigate whether experimental tauopathy can be transmitted. We show that injection of brain extract from mutant P301S tau-expressing mice into the brain of transgenic wild-type tau-expressing animals induces assembly of wild-type human tau into filaments and spreading of pathology from the site of injection to neighbouring brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2113020843,"Understanding of colloidal nanocrystal growth mechanisms is essential for the syntheses of nanocrystals with desired physical properties. The classical model for the growth of monodisperse nanocrystals assumes a discrete nucleation stage followed by growth via monomer attachment, but has overlooked particle-particle interactions. Recent studies have suggested that interactions between particles play an important role. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we show that platinum nanocrystals can grow either by monomer attachment from solution or by particle coalescence. Through the combination of these two processes, an initially broad size distribution can spontaneously narrow into a nearly monodisperse distribution. We suggest that colloidal nanocrystals take different pathways of growth based on their size- and morphology-dependent internal energies."
https://openalex.org/W2123453097,"Oligodendrocyte development is regulated by the interaction of repressors and activators in a complex transcriptional network. We found that two histone-modifying enzymes, HDAC1 and HDAC2, were required for oligodendrocyte formation. Genetic deletion of both Hdac1 and Hdac2 in oligodendrocyte lineage cells resulted in stabilization and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, which negatively regulates oligodendrocyte development by repressing Olig2 expression. We further identified the oligodendrocyte-restricted transcription factor TCF7L2/TCF4 as a bipartite co-effector of beta-catenin for regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation. Targeted disruption of Tcf7l2 in mice led to severe defects in oligodendrocyte maturation, whereas expression of its dominant-repressive form promoted precocious oligodendrocyte specification in developing chick neural tube. Transcriptional co-repressors HDAC1 and HDAC2 compete with beta-catenin for TCF7L2 interaction to regulate downstream genes involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation. Thus, crosstalk between HDAC1/2 and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway mediated by TCF7L2 serves as a regulatory mechanism for oligodendrocyte differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2133569747,"Neuronal NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation leads to the formation of superoxide, which normally acts in cell signaling. With extensive NMDAR activation, the resulting superoxide production leads to neuronal death. It is widely held that NMDA-induced superoxide production originates from the mitochondria, but definitive evidence for this is lacking. We evaluated the role of the cytoplasmic enzyme NADPH oxidase in NMDA-induced superoxide production. Neurons in culture and in mouse hippocampus responded to NMDA with a rapid increase in superoxide production, followed by neuronal death. These events were blocked by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin and in neurons lacking the p47(phox) subunit, which is required for NADPH oxidase assembly. Superoxide production was also blocked by inhibiting the hexose monophosphate shunt, which regenerates the NADPH substrate, and by inhibiting protein kinase C zeta, which activates the NADPH oxidase complex. These findings identify NADPH oxidase as the primary source of NMDA-induced superoxide production."
https://openalex.org/W2028171714,Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. We created a LRRK2 transgenic mouse model that recapitulates cardinal features of the disease: an age-dependent and levodopa-responsive slowness of movement associated with diminished dopamine release and axonal pathology of nigrostriatal dopaminergic projection. These mice provide a valid model of Parkinson's disease and are a resource for the investigation of pathogenesis and therapeutics.
https://openalex.org/W2151187602,"Dissecting VWF's Thrombogenic Potential Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is secreted from cells in an ultralarge form (ULVWF) in response to thrombogenic stimuli. Shear forces expose a binding site for platelets, enabling formation of a hemostatic plug. The thrombogenic potential of VWF correlates with its length and is regulated by proteolytic cleavage of the A2 domain. Zhang et al. (p. 1330 ; see the Perspective by Gebhardt and Rief ) now combine single molecule data and polymer dynamics theory to show that shear forces in the circulation are sufficient to unfold the A2 domain and allow cleavage of multimers with more than about 200 monomers. The A2 domain may thus represent the “shear bolt” of VWF, unfolding when multimers experience high forces to allow cleavage and down-regulation of thrombogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2039033342,"Central nervous system nutrient sensing and afferent endocrine signaling have been established as parallel systems communicating metabolic status and energy availability in vertebrates. The only afferent endocrine signal known to require modification with a fatty acid side chain is the orexigenic hormone ghrelin. We find that the ghrelin O-acyl transferase (GOAT), which is essential for ghrelin acylation, is regulated by nutrient availability, depends on specific dietary lipids as acylation substrates and links ingested lipids to energy expenditure and body fat mass. These data implicate the ghrelin-GOAT system as a signaling pathway that alerts the central nervous system to the presence of dietary calories, rather than to their absence as is commonly accepted."
https://openalex.org/W2116289946,"Starving T Cells The T H 17 lineage of CD4 + helper T cells, characterized by the ability to secrete IL-17, is an important mediator of inflammation and autoimmunity. Dampening the responses of these cells or inhibiting their differentiation is of great therapeutic interest. Sundrud et al. (p. 1334 ; see the Perspective by Blander and Amsen ) now show that the small molecule halofuginone inhibits the differentiation of T H 17 cells but not other CD4 + T cell helper lineages both in vitro and in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. This selective inhibition was mediated by activation of the amino acid starvation response. Amino acid depletion mimicked the effects of halofuginone, whereas excess amino acids rescued T H 17 differentiation. The results highlight the importance of amino acid metabolism in regulating inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2034502353,"The insertion of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) into the plasma membrane is an important step in the synaptic delivery of AMPARs during the expression of synaptic plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating AMPAR insertion remain elusive. By directly visualizing individual insertion events of the AMPAR subunit GluR1 in rodents, we found that the protein 4.1N was required for activity-dependent GluR1 insertion. Protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of the serine 816 (S816) and S818 residues of GluR1 enhanced 4.1N binding to GluR1 and facilitated GluR1 insertion. In addition, palmitoylation of GluR1 C811 residue modulated PKC phosphorylation and GluR1 insertion. Finally, disrupting 4.1N-dependent GluR1 insertion decreased surface expression of GluR1 and the expression of long-term potentiation. Our study uncovers a previously unknown mechanism that governs activity-dependent GluR1 trafficking, reveals an interaction between AMPAR palmitoylation and phosphorylation, and underscores the functional importance of 4.1N in AMPAR trafficking and synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2026615227,"We conducted a genome-wide association study of rheumatoid arthritis in 2,418 cases and 4,504 controls from North America and identified an association at the REL locus, encoding c-Rel, on chromosome 2p13 (rs13031237, P = 6.01 x 10(-10)). Replication in independent case-control datasets comprising 2,604 cases and 2,882 controls confirmed this association, yielding an allelic OR = 1.25 (P = 3.08 x 10(-14)) for marker rs13031237 and an allelic OR = 1.21 (P = 2.60 x 10(-11)) for marker rs13017599 in the combined dataset. The combined dataset also provides definitive support for associations at both CTLA4 (rs231735; OR = 0.85; P = 6.25 x 10(-9)) and BLK (rs2736340; OR = 1.19; P = 5.69 x 10(-9)). c-Rel is an NF-kappaB family member with distinct functional properties in hematopoietic cells, and its association with rheumatoid arthritis suggests disease pathways that involve other recently identified rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility genes including CD40, TRAF1, TNFAIP3 and PRKCQ."
https://openalex.org/W2077886237,"Rhes-olving Huntington's Disease? Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a single dominant mutation of huntingtin (Htt), a protein that occurs in all tissues of the body and that is uniformly distributed throughout the brain. How mutant Htt (mHtt) selectively damages striatal neurons with negligible alterations elsewhere has been a mystery. Subramaniam et al. (p. 1327 ) show that Rhes, a small G protein very highly localized to the striatum, binds mHtt and augments its neurotoxicity. Rhes promotes sumoylation of mHtt, leading to its disaggregation and augmented cytotoxicity. The findings establish how mHtt selectively kills cells in the striatum and suggest that Rhes-Htt binding might provide a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2013225336,"Targeting of cancer stem cells is believed to be essential for curative therapy of cancers, but supporting evidence is limited. Few selective target genes in cancer stem cells have been identified. Here we identify the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) gene (Alox5) as a critical regulator for leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In the absence of Alox5, BCR-ABL failed to induce CML in mice. This Alox5 deficiency caused impairment of the function of LSCs but not normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through affecting differentiation, cell division and survival of long-term LSCs (LT-LSCs), consequently causing a depletion of LSCs and a failure of CML development. Treatment of CML mice with a 5-LO inhibitor also impaired the function of LSCs similarly by affecting LT-LSCs, and prolonged survival. These results demonstrate that a specific target gene can be found in cancer stem cells and its inhibition can completely inhibit the function of these stem cells."

https://openalex.org/W1974484497,"Hox Clocks Homeobox or Hox genes are historically significant for demonstrating evolutionary conservation and homology in developmentally important genes. In addition, in many species, the Hox genes are fundamental to the organization of the embryo. Modifications in the regulation of their colinear, temporal activation may represent a way of altering their expression patterns and to elaborate body plans during evolution. Soshnikova and Duboule (p. 1320 ) now report highly dynamic modifications of chromatin marks along with progressive Hox gene activation during axial extension in the mouse. This work supports the proposal that the “ Hox clock” may be controlled, at least in part, by epigenetic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2076011171,"Replication has become the gold standard for assessing statistical results from genome-wide association studies. Unfortunately this replication requirement may cause real genetic effects to be missed. A real result can fail to replicate for numerous reasons including inadequate sample size or variability in phenotype definitions across independent samples. In genome-wide association studies the allele frequencies of polymorphisms may differ due to sampling error or population differences. We hypothesize that some statistically significant independent genetic effects may fail to replicate in an independent dataset when allele frequencies differ and the functional polymorphism interacts with one or more other functional polymorphisms. To test this hypothesis, we designed a simulation study in which case-control status was determined by two interacting polymorphisms with heritabilities ranging from 0.025 to 0.4 with replication sample sizes ranging from 400 to 1600 individuals. We show that the power to replicate the statistically significant independent main effect of one polymorphism can drop dramatically with a change of allele frequency of less than 0.1 at a second interacting polymorphism. We also show that differences in allele frequency can result in a reversal of allelic effects where a protective allele becomes a risk factor in replication studies. These results suggest that failure to replicate an independent genetic effect may provide important clues about the complexity of the underlying genetic architecture. We recommend that polymorphisms that fail to replicate be checked for interactions with other polymorphisms, particularly when samples are collected from groups with distinct ethnic backgrounds or different geographic regions."

In order to fully fill space, only certain rotational symmetries are allowed. Quasicrystals contain aperiodic tilings of two or more basic shapes that allow these forbidden rotation symmetries. A number of quasicrystalline materials have been synthesized in the lab, including a number of aluminum alloys. Bindi et al. (p. 1306 ) examined samples of the mineral khatyrkite, with a nominal composition of (Cu,Zn)Al 2 . A number of quasicrystalline grains with composition similar to synthetically formed materials were observed. Thus, quasicrystals can form in nature under geological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1976888700,"Epigenetic therapy using DNA methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors has clinical promise for the treatment of human malignancies. To investigate roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) on epigenetic therapy of gastric cancer, the miRNA expression profile was analysed in human gastric cancer cells treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) and 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA). miRNA microarray analysis shows that most of miRNAs activated by 5-Aza-CdR and PBA in gastric cancer cells are located at Alu repeats on chromosome 19. Analyses of chromatin modification show that DNA demethylation and HDAC inhibition at Alu repeats activates silenced miR-512-5p by RNA polymerase II. In addition, activation of miR-512-5p by epigenetic treatment induces suppression of Mcl-1, resulting in apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. These results suggest that chromatin remodeling at Alu repeats plays critical roles in the regulation of miRNA expression and that epigenetic activation of silenced Alu-associated miRNAs could be a novel therapeutic approach for gastric cancer."

In the model organism Bacillus subtilis , the transcriptional repressor CtsR controls the expression of genes that are key to the heat-shock response. CtsR is activated by the kinase McsB to allow transcription of stress response genes, however, the mechanism of activation is unclear. Fuhrmann et al. (p. 1323 ) now describe structural and biochemical studies showing that McsB inhibits DNA binding of CtsR by specifically phosphorylating arginine residues in its DNA binding domain. This study provides a basis for exploring a potential wider role of arginine phosphorylation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2171071049,"William Talbot and colleagues show that a kinesin motor protein, Kif1b, is required for the specific localization of mRNAs that encode myelin proteins in central nervous system glia and mediates the development of myelinated axons. Kif1b has previously been linked to the susceptibility of multiple sclerosis, and damage to myelinated axons is central to the symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. This suggests mechanisms by which defects in Kif1b may contribute to the disease. The kinesin motor protein Kif1b has previously been implicated in the axonal transport of mitochondria and synaptic vesicles1,2. More recently, KIF1B has been associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS)3. Here we show that Kif1b is required for the localization of mbp (myelin basic protein) mRNA to processes of myelinating oligodendrocytes in zebrafish. We observe the ectopic appearance of myelin-like membrane in kif1b mutants, coincident with the ectopic localization of myelin proteins in kif1b mutant oligodendrocyte cell bodies. These observations suggest that oligodendrocytes localize certain mRNA molecules, namely those encoding small basic proteins such as MBP, to prevent aberrant effects of these proteins elsewhere in the cell. We also find that Kif1b is required for outgrowth of some of the longest axons in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Our data demonstrate previously unknown functions of kif1b in vivo and provide insights into its possible roles in MS."

What mediates rapid behavioral changes that do not reflect genetic change? Davies and Welbergen (p. 1318 ) show that reed warblers learn from their neighbors to behave aggressively toward models of the parasitic common cuckoo. Furthermore, reed warblers seem to be predisposed to learn to respond to cuckoos as enemies: Hosts that witnessed neighbors mobbing a harmless parrot model did not increase their aggression toward a cuckoo model. Thus, birds have templates for threats, and relevant antithreat behaviors can be turned on or off depending on social experience."

https://openalex.org/W2069019375,"The function of the class III histone deacetylase, Sir2, in promoting lifespan extension is well established in small model organisms. By analogy, SirT1, the mammalian orthologue of Sir2, is a candidate gene to slow down aging and forestall the onset of age-associated diseases. We have used SirT1-null mice to study the function of SirT1 in susceptibility to tumorigenesis. The number of intestinal polyps induced in mice carrying the Apc(min) mutation was unaffected by the SirT1 genotype although the average polyp size was slightly smaller in the SirT1-null animals. Similarly, the presence or absence of SirT1 had no effect on incidence and tumor load of skin papillomas induced by the classical two-stage carcinogenesis protocol. We found that resveratrol topically applied to the skin profoundly reduced tumorigenesis. This chemoprotective effect was significantly reduced but not ablated in SirT1-null mice, suggesting that part of the protection afforded by resveratrol requires the SirT1-encoded protein. Thus, our results suggest that SirT1 does not behave like a classical tumor-suppressor gene but the antitumor activity of resveratrol is mediated at least in part by SirT1."
https://openalex.org/W2080219921,"Thoroughbred horses have been selected for exceptional racing performance resulting in system-wide structural and functional adaptations contributing to elite athletic phenotypes. Because selection has been recent and intense in a closed population that stems from a small number of founder animals Thoroughbreds represent a unique population within which to identify genomic contributions to exercise-related traits. Employing a population genetics-based hitchhiking mapping approach we performed a genome scan using 394 autosomal and X chromosome microsatellite loci and identified positively selected loci in the extreme tail-ends of the empirical distributions for (1) deviations from expected heterozygosity (Ewens-Watterson test) in Thoroughbred (n = 112) and (2) global differentiation among four geographically diverse horse populations (F(ST)). We found positively selected genomic regions in Thoroughbred enriched for phosphoinositide-mediated signalling (3.2-fold enrichment; P<0.01), insulin receptor signalling (5.0-fold enrichment; P<0.01) and lipid transport (2.2-fold enrichment; P<0.05) genes. We found a significant overrepresentation of sarcoglycan complex (11.1-fold enrichment; P<0.05) and focal adhesion pathway (1.9-fold enrichment; P<0.01) genes highlighting the role for muscle strength and integrity in the Thoroughbred athletic phenotype. We report for the first time candidate athletic-performance genes within regions targeted by selection in Thoroughbred horses that are principally responsible for fatty acid oxidation, increased insulin sensitivity and muscle strength: ACSS1 (acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 1), ACTA1 (actin, alpha 1, skeletal muscle), ACTN2 (actinin, alpha 2), ADHFE1 (alcohol dehydrogenase, iron containing, 1), MTFR1 (mitochondrial fission regulator 1), PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4) and TNC (tenascin C). Understanding the genetic basis for exercise adaptation will be crucial for the identification of genes within the complex molecular networks underlying obesity and its consequential pathologies, such as type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we propose Thoroughbred as a novel in vivo large animal model for understanding molecular protection against metabolic disease."

https://openalex.org/W1998713702,"Background VE-cadherin is an endothelial specific, transmembrane protein, that clusters at adherens junctions where it promotes homotypic cell-cell adhesion. VE-cadherin null mutation in the mouse results in early fetal lethality due to altered vascular development. However, the mechanism of action of VE-cadherin is complex and, in the mouse embryo, it is difficult to define the specific steps of vascular development in which this protein is involved. Methodology and Principal Findings In order to study the role VE-cadherin in the development of the vascular system in a more suitable model, we knocked down the expression of the coding gene in zebrafish. The novel findings reported here are: 1) partial reduction of VE-cadherin expression using low doses of morpholinos causes vascular fragility, head hemorrhages and increase in permeability; this has not been described before and suggests that the total amount of the protein expressed is an important determinant of vascular stability; 2) concentrations of morpholinos which abrogate VE-cadherin expression prevent vessels to establish successful reciprocal contacts and, as a consequence, vascular sprouting activity is not inhibited. This likely explains the observed vascular hyper-sprouting and the presence of several small, collapsing vessels; 3) the common cardinal vein lacks a correct connection with the endocardium leaving the heart separated from the rest of the circulatory system. The lack of closure of the circulatory loop has never been described before and may explain some downstream defects of the phenotype such as the lack of a correct vascular remodeling. Conclusions and Significance Our observations identify several steps of vascular development in which VE-cadherin plays an essential role. While it does not appear to regulate vascular patterning it is implicated in vascular connection and inhibition of sprouting activity. These processes require stable cell-cell junctions which are defective in absence of VE-cadherin. Notably, also partial modifications in VE-cadherin expression prevent the formation of a stable vasculature. This suggests that partial internalization or change of function of this protein may strongly affect vascular stability and organization."

The ECD can be divided into two structurally and functionally distinct regions: a neck region involved in the tetramerization of the receptor and a calcium-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), which is at the heart of the molecular recognition processes mediated by DC-SIGN. The cytoplasmic region contains recycling and internalization motifs important for targeting receptors, together with their associated ligands, to subcellular compartments as shown for DEC 205 and DC-SIGN itself (18Mahnke K.

Littman D.R. Immunity. 2002; 16: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Indeed, in some conditions, combined deletion of the triacidic cluster (EEE), the dileucine (LL), and the tyrosine-based (YXXL) internalization motifs induces the loss of DC capacity to enhance T-cell HIV-1 infection (19Kwon D.S. Gregorio G. Bitton N. Hendrickson W.A. Littman D.R. Immunity. 2002; 16: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The ability of DC-SIGN to promote T-cell infection by HIV-1 involves different pathways depending on the kinetics of the infection process. HIV transfers from DCs to T cells have been described to occur in two phases: a short-term phase (up to 24 h after viral exposure) and a long-term phase (from 24 to 72 h) (20Turville S.G. Santos J.J. Frank I. Cameron P.U. Wilkinson J. Miranda-Saksena M. Dable J. Stössel H. Romani N. Piatak Jr., M. Lifson J.D. Pope M. Cunningham A.L.

The long-term phase is proposed to involve membrane fusion and subsequent DC infection and does not need to concern us further in this study. In contrast, short-term phase transfer involves virion internalization into DCs through vesicles. A pH dependence of HIV transfer has been suggested, based on the abrogation of the trans-enhancement of T-cell infection upon intracellular pH neutralization by concanamycin A (19Kwon D.S. Gregorio G. Bitton N. Hendrickson W.A. Littman D.R. Immunity. 2002; 16: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Indeed, internalization of HIV particles into low pH non-lysosomal compartments has been described in DC-SIGN-expressing cells (19Kwon D.S. Gregorio G. Bitton N. Hendrickson W.A. Littman D.R. Immunity. 2002; 16: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, a pH dependence of DC-SIGN binding to gp120 has been reported (22Snyder G.A. Ford J. Torabi-Parizi P. Arthos J.A. Schuck P. Colonna M. Sun P.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4589-4598Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as well as ligand release from DC-SIGN in pH conditions mimicking the acidic luminal environment of endosomes/lysosomes (23Gramberg T. Soilleux E. Fisch T. Lalor P.F. Hofmann H. Wheeldon S. Cotterill A. Wegele A. Winkler T. Adams D.H. Pöhlmann S. Virology. 2008; 373: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, no molecular explanation has yet been proposed for this phenomenon that might play a key role in the initiation mechanisms of DC-SIGN-mediated infectious processes. An effect of pH on the CRD binding properties has been reported (22Snyder G.A. Ford J. Torabi-Parizi P. Arthos J.A. Schuck P. Colonna M. Sun P.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4589-4598Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) but no detailed molecular study of the pH dependence of the oligomerization properties of the neck domain, essential for the integrity of ECD, has yet been reported. The neck region comprises seven complete and one incomplete 23-amino acid long repeat. These repeats exhibit a distinct pattern of hydrophobic residues, positioned at regular intervals along an α-helical stretch that could favor coiled-coil interaction between helices from the four chains within a tetramer (24McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 25Stetefeld J. Jenny M. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Engel J. Kammerer R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Comparison of circular dichroism spectra from the entire ECD and the CRD fragment led to a similar suggestion (26Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The neck domain, which is responsible for tetramer formation and stability of the whole ECD, is thereby at the onset of the avidity mechanism that endows the DC-SIGN receptor with a very high affinity toward its target as compared with the weak affinity of isolated CRD. Indeed, the dissociation constant of the complex with the HIV gp120 envelope protein is in the nanomolar range with the whole ECD, whereas it is in the millimolar range when using monomeric CRD (22Snyder G.A. Ford J. Torabi-Parizi P. Arthos J.A. Schuck P. Colonna M. Sun P.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4589-4598Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, DC-SIGN neck region variants, resulting from alternative splicing and genomic polymorphism, exhibit altered sugar binding (27Serrano-Gómez D. Sierra-Filardi E. Martínez-Nuñez R.T. Caparrós E. Delgado R. Muñoz-Fernández M.A. Abad M.A. Jimenez-Barbero J. Leal M. Corbí A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3889-3903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN neck polymorphism has recently been correlated with differential susceptibility to HIV-1 and other pathogens as a result of modified DC-SIGN multimerization on the cell surface (27Serrano-Gómez D. Sierra-Filardi E. Martínez-Nuñez R.T. Caparrós E. Delgado R. Muñoz-Fernández M.A. Abad M.A. Jimenez-Barbero J. Leal M. Corbí A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3889-3903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Beyond the avidity mechanism already mentioned, the association of the four chains within the neck largely constraints the CRD spatial arrangement that must bear on the ligand interaction and recognition properties. However, despite the importance of the DC-SIGN tetrameric state in molecular recognitions, structural information is scarce and mostly restricted to the CRD moiety. High-resolution structures of the CRD in complex with various carbohydrate ligands are available (28Feinberg H. Castelli R. Drickamer K. Seeberger P.H. Weis W.I. J. Biol.

However, structural information on the tetramer is still lacking although it is a prerequisite to a precise understanding of CRD presentation, pathogen recognition, and to rationalize emerging strategies for the design of DC-SIGN multivalent inhibitors (33Tabarani G.

Our study of the ECD, and more particularly of the neck domain, addresses two issues. First of all, we investigate the role of the neck domain in the structural organization of DC-SIGN ECD. We analyze its stability and dynamic as a function of pH conditions encountered in the various cell compartments. Our studies involve various constructs (CRD, ECD, and neck region) using several techniques: analytical ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and circular dichroism (CD). We show that physiologically encountered pH variations significantly affect the protein oligomerization and structure. Slightly acidic pH destabilizes the tetramer as well as the CRD structure with possible consequences on the strength of ligand binding, which is strongly dependent on the multiplicity of interactions. In parallel, a molecular envelope of DC-SIGN ECD derived from small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements in solution highlights the extended organization of DC-SIGN and suggests a tighter arrangement of the four CRDs than hereto proposed. The cDNA coding for the DC-SIGN CRD (amino acids 254–404) was obtained by PCR and cloned into pET15b (Novagen). The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as previously described (37Halary F. Amara A. Lortat-Jacob H. Messerle M. Delaunay T. Houlès C. Fieschi F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Moreau J.F. Déchanet-Merville J. Immunity. 2002; 17: 653-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding DC-SIGN ECD (amino acids 66–404) was cloned into a pET30b plasmid (Novagen) resulting in expression vector pET30b-DC-SIGN ECD. Expression was carried out in E. coli as previously described (35Reina J.J. Sattin S. Invernizzi D. Mari S. Martínez-Prats L. Tabarani G. Fieschi F. Delgado R. Nieto P.M. Rojo J. Bernardi A. Chem. Med. Chem. 2007; 2: 1030-1036Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The construct allowing DC-SIGN S-Neck expression has been generated in two steps. In a first step, the sequence encoding the whole DC-SIGN ECD region was obtained by PCR using pET30b-DC-SIGN ECD vector as DNA matrix and the primers EC5′ (5′-GCA TTA GGT CTC TGC GCT CCA TAA GTC AGG AAC AAT C-3′) and EC3′ (5′-GCA GCA GGT CTC TTA TCA CTA CGC AGG AGG GGG G-3′). Addition of a Strep-Tag II at the N terminus of the construct was achieved by cloning the PCR product into a pASK6 vector (IBA GmbH). The vector and the PCR product were both digested by BsaI before ligation using the DNA Rapid Ligation Kit (Roche) to lead to the pASK6-DC-SIGN ECD plasmid. In a second step, the Strep-tagged DC-SIGN Neck encoding fragment was obtained by changing, within the pASK6-DC-SIGN ECD plasmid, the His254 codon by a stop codon immediately downstream of the neck sequence. This site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using the following primers: Neck forward (5′-GTG GAA CGC CTG TGA CAC CCC TGT CC-3′, underlined: stop codon) and Neck reverse (5′-GG ACA GGG GTG TCA CAG GCG TTC CAC-3′, underlined, stop codon). This PCR product and the pET20b plasmid (Novagen) were digested with XbaI and HindIII before ligation. The resulting plasmid was termed pET20b-DC-SIGN S-Neck. Upon expression, DC-SIGN CRD and ECD formed inclusion bodies and were refolded as previously described (26Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Purification of functional proteins was achieved by affinity chromatography on a mannan-agarose column (Sigma) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2 (buffer A). After loading, DC-SIGN CRD was purified as a delayed fraction, whereas in the case of DC-SIGN ECD the protein was tightly bound to the column and eluted in the same buffer without CaCl2 but supplemented with 10 mm EDTA (buffer B). This step was followed by SEC, using a Superose 6 column equilibrated with buffer A. DC-SIGN-S-Neck was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) in 1 liter of LB culture supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-Β-d-galactopyranoside when the culture had reached an A600 of 0.6 and maintained for 4 h. The protein was expressed in the cytoplasm in a soluble form. Cells were harvested by a 20-min centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of a solution containing 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, DNase I, and one anti-protease mixture tablet (Complete EDTA free, Roche). Cells were disrupted by sonication and cell debris eliminated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a Strep-Tactin Superflow column (IBA GmbH) at 20 °C. Unbound proteins were washed away with buffer C (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) before DC-SIGN S-Neck was eluted with buffer D (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm desthiobiotine). Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%) and the DC-SIGN S-Neck containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 4 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (YM10 membrane from Amicon). The Strep-Tag II was cleaved off using restriction grade factor Xa (Qiagen) at a ratio of 0.1 units/mg of Strep-tagged protein for a 30-min incubation at 4 °C. Elimination of the cleaved off Strep-Tag II was performed by SEC. The factor Xa-cleaved sample was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated. The resulting protein, after tag cleavage, was termed DC-SIGN Neck. The molecular mass of each construct was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Each construct was also checked by N-terminal sequencing. We used a calibrated Superdex 200 column to study the pH and salt effects on the protein oligomerization state. The column, kept at a constant temperature of 20 °C was first equilibrated with the appropriate buffer at varying pH (pH range 5.1 to 8.9). For pH variation studies, all buffers were used at a 25 mm concentration (acetate for pH 5.1, potassium phosphate for pH 5.9–7.5, and Tris for pH 8.9), supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. For experiments based on ionic strength variations, a 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was supplemented with an increasing amount of NaCl yielding the final concentrations series: 0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 m. DC-SIGN EC and DC-SIGN Neck stock solutions (32 mg/ml) were diluted to 2.5 mg/ml in the appropriate buffer and then centrifuged to eliminate potential aggregates. Each sample (250 μl) was then loaded onto the previously equilibrated column and eluted in the same buffer. The collected fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Analysis of the oligomerization state distribution was performed in parallel to the analytical ultracentrifugation. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using an AN-60 TI rotor (Beckman instruments), at 20 °C. Samples were handled in a buffer with appropriate pH. The molar mass and partial specific volume of DC-SIGN Neck and ECD chains were estimated from the amino acid composition using the SEDNTREP software: 38706 Da and 0.733 ml/g for the whole ECD, and 21228 Da and 0.748 ml/g for the neck. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 42,000 rpm, using 400-μl protein samples, loaded into the two channel 1.2-cm path length centerpieces equipped with sapphire windows, and monitored at 5-min intervals using absorbance and interference optics. Absorbance scans were recorded overnight at 279 nm with a radial step size of 30 μm. Sedimentation velocity profiles were analyzed using the size distribution analysis from the program SEDFIT that provides a continuous distribution of sedimentation coefficients, c(s) (38Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). Typically, 20 regularly spaced experimental profiles obtained over a total 6-h sedimentation were globally modeled. The continuous distribution of sedimentation coefficients (c(s)) analysis was performed considering 200 particles on a grid of 300 radial points, and fitting the value of the frictional ratio f/f0. For the regularization procedure a confidence level of 0.7 was used. The interpretation in terms of oligomer use the following formula, S=n⋅M(1-ΡV¯)6πη⋅f/fo⋅RoEq. 1 with s the sedimentation coefficient, n the number of monomers per complex, M the monomer molecular mass, R0 the radius of a spherical particle of density 1/v̄ and mass n.M, f/f0 the frictional ratio, v̄ the partial specific volume of the protein, η and ρ the viscosity and the density of the solvent, respectively. All s values have been corrected for solvent density and viscosity and are therefore given as s20,w values. The value of the sedimentation coefficient was calculated from the model of DC-SIGN using the program HYDROPRO (39García De La Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The solvent viscosity was 0.010 poise, the solvent density was 0.998 g/ml, and the temperature was 293 K. The effect of hydration is included in an effective atomic radius of 3.2 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms in the primary hydrodynamic model. Circular dichroism spectra were measured on a Jobin Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter operating at room temperature. Quartz cells with a 1-mm path length were used for recording spectra in the UV region (180–260 nm). DC-SIGN Neck and DC-SIGN ECD were diluted to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in the buffered solutions at each pH value and centrifuged to eliminate aggregates. These buffered solutions were prepared by mixing the required amounts of acidic and basic potassium phosphate at a final concentration of 25 mm with 150 mm NaCl. SAXS data were collected at the X33 beamline at EMBL/DESY, Hamburg (40Roessle M.W. Klaering R. Ristau U. Robrahn B. Jahn D. Gehrmann T. Konarev P. Round A. Fiedler S. Hermes C. Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: s190-194Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The sample to detector distance was 2.3 m covering the range of scattering vector (q) from 0.008 to 0.47 Å−1 (q = 4πsinθ/λ, with 2θ being the scattering angle and λ = 1.5 Å the wavelength of the x-rays. The detector used was the online image plate reader MAR345 from MarResearch. The samples were prepared at concentrations of 1 and 2 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 60 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol. Two successive frames of 3 min each were recorded for proteins and buffers. No radiation damage was detected. SAXS data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam, averaged, and background subtracted using the program package PRIMUS (41Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). The curves recorded at 1 and 2 mg/ml were identical and therefore free from intermolecular interactions. A few test patterns were also recorded during commissioning time on the Swing SAXS beamline at the SOLEIL storage ring and were found essentially identical to the EMBL data. In the case of a very elongated particle the Guinier range is very narrow and, in the case of DC-SIGN, restricted to such small angles as to be mostly inaccessible (42Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-Rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar). Consequently, the radius of gyration (Rg) and the intensity at the origin I(0) were derived from the distance distribution function P(r) computed using the program GNOM (43Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). The conformation in solution of DC-SIGN was determined ab initio from the scattering curve using the programs DAMMIN (44Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar) and GASBOR (45Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). The two programs generate a volume filled with beads or a compact chain of dummy residues, respectively, whose scattering pattern fits the experimental scattering curve as measured by the discrepancy χ, χ2=1n-1∑j[lexp(qj)-clcalc(qj)σ(qj)]2Eq. 2 where n is the number of experimental points, c is a scaling factor, and Icalc(qj) and σ(qj) are the calculated intensity and experimental error, respectively. Models obtained from repeated calculations are superimposed and compared using the program suite DAMAVER (46Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Their similarity is quantified using a normalized spatial discrepancy (47Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Similar DAMMIN models for globular objects have normalized spatial discrepancy values of the order of 0.7, whereas corresponding GASBOR derived models exhibit values in the range of 1.0–1.4. The truncated forms of DC-SIGN used in this study are presented in Fig. 1. DC-SIGN CRD and DC-SIGN ECD were overexpressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The two protein purification schemes started with the refolding procedure previously described (30Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN CRD and ECD were produced without affinity tag and we used the physiological interaction of DC-SIGN with carbohydrate ligands for purification purposes. Oligome"

Although several endothelial cell surface molecules have been reported to interact with endostatin, its molecular mechanism of action is not fully elucidated. We used surface plasmon resonance assays to characterize interactions between endostatin, integrins, and heparin/heparan sulfate. α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins form stable complexes with immobilized endostatin (KD = ∼1.8 × 10−8m, two-state model). Two arginine residues (Arg27 and Arg139) are crucial for the binding of endostatin to integrins and to heparin/heparan sulfate, suggesting that endostatin would not bind simultaneously to integrins and to heparan sulfate. Experimental data and molecular modeling support endostatin binding to the headpiece of the αvβ3 integrin at the interface between the β-propeller domain of the αv subunit and the βA domain of the β3 subunit. In addition, we report that α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins bind to heparin/heparan sulfate. The ectodomain of the α5β1 integrin binds to haparin with high affinity (KD = 15.5 nm). The direct binding between integrins and heparin/heparan sulfate might explain why both heparan sulfate and α5β1 integrin are required for the localization of endostatin in endothelial cell lipid rafts.

Commun. 2005; 329: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The effect of endostatin depends on its concentration and on the type of endothelial cells (8Schmidt A. Wenzel D. Ferring I. Kazemi S. Sasaki T. Hescheler J. Timpl R. Addicks K. Fleischmann B.K. Bloch W. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 230: 468-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It exerts the opposite effects on human umbilical vein endothelial cells and on endothelial cells derived from differentiated embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, two different mechanisms (heparin-dependent and heparin-independent) may exist for the anti-proliferative activity of endostatin depending on the growth factor used to induce cell proliferation (fibroblast growth factor 2 or vascular endothelial growth factor). Its anti-proliferative effect on endothelial cells stimulated by fibroblast growth factor 2 is mediated by the binding of endostatin to heparan sulfate (9Ricard-Blum S. Féraud O. Lortat-Jacob H. Rencurosi A. Fukai N. Dkhissi F. Vittet D. Imberty A. Olsen B.R. van der Rest M. J. Biol.

The broad range of molecular targets of endostatin suggests that multiple signaling systems are involved in mediating its anti-angiogenic action (11Cao Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2008; 100: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and although several endothelial cell surface molecules have been reported to interact with endostatin, its molecular mechanisms of action are not as fully elucidated as they are for other endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors (11Cao Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2008; 100: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Endostatin binds with relatively low affinity to several membrane proteins including α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins (12Rehn M.

The identification of molecular interactions established by endostatin at the cell surface is a first step toward the understanding of the mechanisms by which endostatin regulates angiogenesis. We have previously characterized the binding of endostatin to heparan sulfate chains (9Ricard-Blum S. Féraud O. Lortat-Jacob H. Rencurosi A. Fukai N. Dkhissi F. Vittet D. Imberty A. Olsen B.R. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2927-2936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the present study we have focused on characterizing the interactions between endostatin, α5β1, αvβ3, and αvβ5 integrins and heparan sulfate. Although interactions between several integrins and endostatin have been studied previously in solid phase assays (12Rehn M. Veikkola T. Kukk-Valdre E. Nakamura H. Ilmonen M. Lombardo C.

We found that two arginine residues of endostatin (Arg27 and Arg139) participate in binding to integrins and to heparan sulfate, suggesting that endostatin is not able to bind simultaneously to these molecules displayed at the cell surface. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that α5β1, αvβ3, and αvβ5 integrins bind to heparan sulfate. This may explain why both heparan sulfate and α5β1 integrins are required for the localization of endostatin in lipid rafts, in support of the model proposed by Wickström et al. (15Wickström S.A.

Recombinant human endostatin, the trimeric C-terminal domain of collagen XVIII called NC1 (noncollagenous 1) and several mutants (D104N and the double mutant R27A/R139A) were produced by human embryonic kidney cells expressing Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (293-EBNA cells) according to established protocols (9Ricard-Blum S. Féraud O. Lortat-Jacob H. Rencurosi A. Fukai N. Dkhissi F. Vittet D. Imberty A. Olsen B.R. van der Rest M. J. Biol.

Amino acids residues were numbered starting from the first amino acid residue of endostatin (His1, also referred to as His132 when numbering starts from the first amino acid of the entire C-terminal domain NC1 of collagen XVIII). Wild type and mutant proteins were tagged by the peptide FLAG at the N-terminal end for endostatin and at the C-terminal end for the NC1 domain. The conditioned culture media were filtered through 0.22-μm filters and applied to an anti-FLAG M2 column (3.5 ml; Sigma) equilibrated in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.138 m NaCl, 0.0027 m KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (P3563; Sigma). The recombinant proteins were eluted by soluble FLAG peptide (150 μg/ml). Endostatin and the NC1 domain were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex S75 column (2.6 × 60 cm; GE Healthcare) and on a Sephacryl S200 column (2.6 × 60 cm; GE Healthcare), respectively. The purity of recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and by Western blot. The purified proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at −80 °C. Chondroitin sulfate from bovine trachea (C8529), heparin (HP) (H3393), and dermatan sulfate (C3788) from porcine intestinal mucosa, human fibronectin (F2006), GRADSPK peptide (G4144), and GRGDSPK (G1269) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Heparan sulfate from porcine intestinal mucosa was from Celsus (Cincinnati, OH) and full-length human α5β1, αvβ3, and αvβ5 integrins were from Chemicon (Millipore). The full-length (α5E951 β1D708) and truncated (α5D613 β1P455) ectodomains of α5β1 integrin were expressed as Fc fusion proteins as previously described. The Fc domain was utilized to drive heterodimer formation (17Coe A.P. Askari J.A. Kline A.D. Robinson M.K. Kirby H. Stephens P.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35854-35866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). SPR binding assays were performed to characterize the interactions of αvβ3, α5β1 integrins with endostatin and heparin/heparan sulfate. They were carried out in a Biacore 3000 system (GE Healthcare, Facility of IFR 128 Gerland, Lyon Sud, France). Interactions between integrins and endostatin were characterized either with immobilized integrins or with immobilized endostatin. Full-length integrins (150–200 μg/ml in 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 50 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 2 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) and endostatin (50 μg/ml in 10 mm maleate buffer, pH 6.2) were immobilized onto a CM5 or CM3 sensor chip via amine coupling at a flow rate of 5 μl/min according to the manufacturer舗s instructions (GE Healthcare). An immobilization level ranging between 800 and 900 resonance units was obtained for endostatin. The running buffer was 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2. A control flow cell was submitted to the coupling steps, the protein being omitted. Injections were performed at 30 μl/min and 25 °C for endostatin (50–1416 nm for D104N mutant and 119–1904 nm for endostatin) and integrins (15–240 nm for α5β1 and 12.5–200 nm for αvβ3). The kinetic parameters ka and kd (association and dissociation rate constants, respectively) were analyzed simultaneously using the BIAeval 4.1 software. This software also fitted simultaneously the sensorgrams obtained for different concentrations of analyte, constraining the kinetic rate constants and the dissociation constant (KD) to a single value for each set of curves. Inhibition experiments were performed by preincubating a RGD-containing peptide (GRGDSPK; Sigma) diluted at 50 μg/ml in the running buffer with αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins (30 μg/ml) at room temperature for 1 h before injection over immobilized endostatin. The GRADSPK peptide (Sigma) was used as a control. Inhibition assays were also performed with an endostatin peptide at 50 and 150 μg/ml (ES-2) (16Wickström S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20178-20185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The binding of α5β1, αvβ3, and αvβ5 integrins to heparin/heparan sulfate was investigated using biotinylated heparin/heparan sulfate captured onto a streptavidin sensor chip as previously described (9Ricard-Blum S. Féraud O. Lortat-Jacob H. Rencurosi A. Fukai N. Dkhissi F. Vittet D. Imberty A. Olsen B.R. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2927-2936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An immobilization level ranging between 70 and 200 resonance units was obtained. A control flow cell was prepared by immobilizing only streptavidin. Full-length α5β1, αvβ3, and αvβ5 integrins (30 μg/ml) were injected at 20 μl/min for 4 min over immobilized glycosaminoglycans with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.005% P20 as running buffer. Kinetic parameters were calculated from a set of sensorgrams collected by injection over immobilized heparin and heparan sulfate of several concentrations of α5β1 integrin (6–160 and 6–200 nm, respectively). Some experiments were carried out in the presence of several cation chelators (10 mm BAPTA, 3The abbreviations used are: BAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidABTS2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acidCHOChinese hamster ovaryESendostatinSPRsurface plasmon resonance. 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm EGTA) to determine the influence of divalent cations on integrin binding. Inhibition experiments were performed by preincubating several glycosaminoglycans (heparin, heparan, dermatan, and chondroitin sulfate) at 5 μg/ml with integrins (30 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature before injection over immobilized heparin/heparan sulfate. Another set of inhibition experiments was carried out with heparin and heparan sulfate oligosaccharides of defined size (5 μg/ml, generous gift from Dr. Rabia Sadir, Institut de Biologie Structurale, UMR 5075, Grenoble, France) and the full-length and truncated ectodomains of α5β1 integrin (40 μg/ml). 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid Chinese hamster ovary endostatin surface plasmon resonance. The full-length (α5E951 β1D708, 2–78 nm) and truncated (α5D613 β1P455, 20–480 nm) ectodomains of α5β1 integrin were injected over immobilized heparin at 20 μl/min for 4 min to calculate kinetics and affinity parameters. The running buffer was 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% P20, 1 mm MnCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2. To check whether some interactions took place in a cellular context, we injected three Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines over immobilized integrins or heparin/heparan sulfate. We used the CHO-K1 cell line (ATCC CCL-61), one mutant CHO cell line defective in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis (CHO-745 cells ATCC: CRL-2242 (18Kaesberg P.R. Ershler W.B. Esko J.D. Mosher D.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the CHO B2 cell line lacking the α5 subunit (19Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M.M. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), a generous gift from Dr. R. Juliano (Chapel Hill, NC). The cells were harvested by treatment with 1% EDTA at ∼80–90% confluence and were suspended (3 × 105 cells/ml) in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and P20 0.005%. They were stored in a water bath at 37 °C without shaking until injection and were examined under an optical microscope to check cell viability before injection at 30 μl/min for 5 min over immobilized heparin or heparan sulfate in a Biacore 3000. The sensor chip surface was regenerated with a pulse (30–60 s) of 0.025–0.033% SDS and 1.5–2 m NaCl. This experimental design did not mimic cell adhesion because the cells were injected in a buffer flow. Control sensorgrams were automatically subtracted from the sensorgrams obtained with immobilized proteins or glycosaminoglycans to yield true binding responses. Soluble full-length α5β1, αvβ3, and αvβ5 integrins (4, 8, and 16 μg/ml) were coated into wells of a 96-well microplate (Immulon 4HBX) in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at room temperature. Casein was used as a negative control. The coating solution (100 μl) was removed and replaced with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm MnCl2) and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Biotinylated heparin was used as a ligand, diluted to the required concentration (25 μg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline, and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The plate was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline before addition of extravidin-peroxidase (1:500 dilution in Tris-buffered saline) and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. 100 μl of 0.1% (w/v) ABTS in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.05 m NaH2PO4, pH 5.0, 0.01% H2O2 (v/v) was added. Absorbance readings were measured at 405 nm on a Dynex MRX 96-well microplate reader. Absorbance reading was taken 30 min after addition of the reagent. Each sample was assayed in triplicate, and binding to casein was subtracted from all measurements. Docking experiments were performed using the ZDOCK program (20Chen R. Li L. Weng Z. Proteins. 2003; 52: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The following structures were extracted from the Protein Data Bank: endostatin (1BNL) and the extracellular domain of the αvβ3 integrin either in the free (1JV2) or the RGD-bound form (1L5G). Because of the limited size of protein structure handled by the ZDOCK program, only part of the extracellular domain of the αvβ3 integrin was used for docking experiments. This included the β-propeller and thigh domains of the αv subunit (Phe1–Leu594), and the βA hybrid and plexin-semaphorin-integrin domains of the β3 subunit (Glu55–Asp434) were used. The integrin was kept fixed, and endostatin was rotated and translated using a 6° sampling density in the rotational space. The top ZDOCK predictions were reranked with an optimized energy function using ZRANK (21Pierce B. Weng Z. Proteins. 2007; 67: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Minimization was run with Sybyl® software (Tripos) using the Amber 7 FF99 force field and Powell minimization method (gradient 0.5 Å, 500 iterations). The refined conformations were used to identify the amino acids participating in the interaction. Energetically important amino acid residues in endostatin-integrin interface were predicted using computational alanine scanning (22Kortemme T. Baker D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14116-14121Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The input consists of a three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex; output is a list of “hot spots” or amino acid side chains that are predicted to significantly destabilize the interface when mutated to alanine, analogous to the results of experimental alanine-scanning mutagenesis (23Kortemme T. Kim D.E. Baker D. Sci. STKE. 2004; 219: pl2Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary wild type cells CHO-K1 (ATCC CCL-61), CHO-745 (ATCC CRL-2242), and CHO-677 (ATCC CRL-2244) cell lines defective in glycosaminoglycans were used for cell adhesion assays. CHO-745 cells have less than 6% of the amount of sulfated glycosaminoglycans present on the wild type cell line, and the CHO-677 cell line has 50% of cell sulfated glycosaminoglycan with decreased heparan sulfate but increased chondroitin sulfate compared with the wild type cell line (18Kaesberg P.R. Ershler W.B. Esko J.D. Mosher D.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CHO-K1, CHO-677, and CHO-745 were grown in Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, and gentamycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Prior to adhesion assays, the cells were harvested with 1% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in serum free Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium. Colorimetric cell adhesion assays were performed as previously described (24Perret S. Merle C. Bernocco S. Berland P. Garrone R. Hulmes D.J. Theisen M. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43693-43698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 96-Well plates (Costar, France) were coated overnight at 4 °C with α5β1 integrin (Chemicon, CC1027) at a concentration range of 0–40 μg/ml (0.1 ml/well). Fibronectin was used as a positive control for cell adhesion assays. After saturation with 1% bovine serum albumin, freshly suspended cells in serum-free Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium (5 × 105 cells/ml) were plated onto wells (0.1 ml/well) and allowed to attach at 37 °C for 40 min. Then the nonadherent cells were gently rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in water. After extensive washing, the dye fixed to the cells was solubilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and the absorbance was read at 570 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Dynex MRX). Each assay was performed in triplicate. The morphology of the adherent cells was observed with a Nikon TE300 microscope. The images were collected and processed digitally with Photoshop 8.0 (Adobe). Cell morphology was analyzed with Image J software on 100 cells (CHO-K1, CHO-677, and CHO-745; n = 4), and the circularity index was measured. As the circularity index approaches 0, it indicates an increasingly elongated shape, whereas a value of 1 indicates a perfect circle. Endostatin has been reported to bind to purified α5β1 integrin in a specific manner in a solid phase binding assay (12Rehn M. Veikkola T. Kukk-Valdre E. Nakamura H. Ilmonen M. Lombardo C. Pihlajaniemi T. Alitalo K. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In SPR binding assays, endostatin bound to immobilized α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins (Fig. 1, A and B) and to αvβ5 integrin (data not shown). Fibronectin, used as a positive control, bound to α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1C). The association and dissociation rates were very fast, indicating that the binding of endostatin to immobilized integrins was transient. The sensorgrams were best fitted to a heterogeneous ligand model, suggesting that endostatin might bind to two independent sites on immobilized integrins. This might be due to a possible heterogeneity in integrins immobilized on the sensor chip surface via distinct lysine residues and/or to the fact that the integrin preparations containing a mixture of conformers. Affinity, but not kinetic, constants governing the binding of endostatin to immobilized α5β1 or to αvβ3 integrins were similar. The two equilibrium affinity constants were 12.0 × 10−7 versus 9.75 × 10−7 M for one site and 5.01 × 10−7 versus 4.51 × 10−7 M for the other (Table 1). The affinity constant ratio was 1.23 and 1.11, respectively, the highest KD values being obtained for the αvβ3 integrin.TABLE 1SPR binding assaysLigandAnalyteModelχ2ka1kd1ka2kd2KDm−1s−1s−1s−1mα5β1Wt ESHeterogeneous ligand0.7931.18 × 10+41.15 × 10−21.55 × 10+5aUnit of measure, m−1s−1.6.99 × 10−29.75 × 10−7 and 4.51 × 10−7αvβ3Wt ESHeterogeneous ligand2.891.35 × 10+56.77 × 10−26.82 × 10+3aUnit of measure, m−1s−1.8.19 × 10−312.0 × 10−7 and 5.01 × 10−7α5β1D104N mutantTwo-state reaction1.389.51 × 10+25.75 × 10−23.22 × 10−3bUnit of measure, s−1.4.47 × 10−33.51 × 10−5αvβ3D104N mutantTwo-state reaction3.294.99 × 10+34.48 × 10−22.03 × 10−3bUnit of measure, s−1.2.98 × 10−35.35 × 10−6Wt ESα5β1Two-state reaction0.6071.00 × 10+51.70 × 10−21.42 × 10−2bUnit of measure, s−1.1.72 × 10−31.83 × 10−8Wt ESαvβ3Two-state reaction0.8071.06 × 10+51.71 × 10−21.26 × 10−2bUnit of measure, s−1.1.54 × 10−31.75 × 10−8D104N mutantα5β1Two-state reaction0.5266.95 × 10+41.14 × 10−21.05 × 10−2bUnit of measure, s−1.1.60 × 10−32.17 × 10−8D104N mutantαvβ3Two-state reaction0.5178.18 × 10+41.38 × 10−21.06 × 10−2bUnit of measure, s−1.1.57 × 10−32.18 × 10−8a Unit of measure, m−1s−1.b Unit of measure, s−1. Open table in a new tab In contrast, the complexes formed by immobilized endostatin with soluble α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins were much more stable (Fig. 1, D and E). The affinity, calculated with a two-state reaction model, is higher when endostatin is immobilized (Table 1). The binding properties of the D104N mutant were investigated because individuals homozygous for the D104N polymorphism in the COL18A1 gene have a high risk of occurrence of sporadic breast cancer (25Lourenço G.J. Cardoso-Filho C. Gonçales N.S. Shinzato J.Y. Zeferino L.C. Nascimento H. Costa F.F. Gurgel M.S. Lima C.S. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2006; 100: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, this polymorphism may influence the age of onset of acute myeloid leukemia (26Nascimento H. Lourenço G.J. Ortega M.M. Yamaguti G.G. Costa F.F. Lima C.S. Leuk. Res. 2007; 31: 1158-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The D104N mutation did not alter endostatin folding as assessed by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra (data not shown). The D104N mutant retained its ability to bind to α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins in SPR binding assays (data not shown). The best interaction model was the two-state model in both orientations (soluble or immobilized D104N mutant) (Table 1). The apparent affinity was higher when the D104N mutant is immobilized (Table 1). The affinity was similar to that calculated with wild type endostatin, although the D104N mutant bound to immobilized α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins to a greater extent than the wild type endostatin. The binding level was increased by 201% for α5β1 integrin and 188% for αvβ3 integrin. These results show that the D104N mutation does not affect the binding affinity of endostatin to integrins, although it does affect the binding level. Endostatin is released in vivo as a monomeric protein. Proteolytic release of the C-terminal trimeric domain of collagen XVIII, NC1(XVIII), containing three endostatin monomers (Fig. 2A), also occurs in cell cultures and tissues (27Sasaki T. Fukai N. Mann K. Göhring W. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4249-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and we investigated its ability to bind integrins. The NC1(XVIII) bound to immobilized α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins (Fig. 2, B and C). The dissociation rates were lower than those observed for monomeric endostatin, suggesting that the trimerization and/or the N-terminal part of the NC1 domain increases the stability of the interaction. The binding was also observed in the reverse orientation when soluble α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins were injected over immobilized NC1 domain (data not shown). The D104N mutant of the NC1 domain bound to immobilized α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins to a greater extent than the wild type NC1, the binding level being increased by 149 and 151%, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). Because the double R27A/R139A monomeric endostatin mutant has lost its capacity to bind heparin (28Sasaki T. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. Lindahl U. Hohenester E. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6240-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), it was interesting to determine whether these two arginine residues are also involved in the binding to other endostatin or NC1(XVIII) partners. The double mutation R27A/R139A of the NC1 domain strongly decreased the binding to α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins by 80.5 and 80.6%, respectively. Fluore"

We investigated DNA copy number aberrations in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray and found a homozygous deletion of PARD3 (the gene encoding PAR-3). Exogenous expression of PARD3 in ESCC cells lacking this gene enhanced the recruitment of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), a marker of tight junctions, to sites of cell-cell contact. Conversely, knockdown of PARD3 in ESCC cells expressing this gene caused a disruption of ZO-1 localization at cell-cell borders. A copy number loss of PARD3 was observed in 15% of primary ESCC cells. Expression of PARD3 was significantly reduced in primary ESCC tumors compared with their nontumorous counterparts, and this reduced expression was associated with positive lymph node metastasis and poor differentiation. Our results suggest that deletion and reduced expression of PARD3 may be a novel mechanism that drives the progression of ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W2060691965,"In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the CCAAT-binding factor is a multisubunit complex that contains the proteins Php2, Php3, Php4, and Php5. Under low iron conditions, Php4 acts as a negative regulatory subunit of the CCAAT-binding factor and fosters repression of genes encoding iron-using proteins. Under conditions of iron excess, Php4 expression is turned off by the iron-dependent transcriptional repressor Fep1. In this study, we developed a biological system that allows us to unlink iron-dependent behavior of Php4 protein from its transcriptional regulation by Fep1. Microscopic analyses revealed that a functional GFP-Php4 protein accumulates in the nucleus under conditions of iron starvation. Conversely, in cells undergoing a transition from low to high iron, GFP-Php4 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We mapped a leucine-rich nuclear export signal that is necessary for nuclear exclusion of Php4. This latter process was blocked by leptomycin B. By using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, we showed that Php4 and Crm1 physically interact with each other. Although we determined that nuclear retention of Php4 per se is not sufficient to cause a constitutive repression of iron-using genes, we found that deletion of the grx4+-encoded glutaredoxin-4 renders Php4 constitutively active and invariably localized in the nucleus. Further analysis by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay and by two-hybrid assays showed that Php4 and Grx4 are physically associated in vivo. Taken together, our findings indicate that Grx4 and Crm1 are novel components involved in the mechanism by which Php4 is inactivated by iron in a Fep1-independent manner.

Iron is essential to the growth of the vast majority of organisms. Because of its capacity to act as both an electron acceptor and donor, iron has become an indispensable catalytic cofactor for a multitude of enzymes involved in several biological processes ranging from respiration, to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, to DNA synthesis (1Haas H. Eisendle M. Turgeon B.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2008; 46: 149-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, excess iron is toxic because of its ability to generate hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton chemistry reaction (2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). High levels of hydroxyl radicals can produce cellular damage, including direct protein or enzyme inactivation, membrane impairment because of lipid peroxidation, and oxidative DNA damage (3Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). These two facets of iron require that cells must establish fine-tuned mechanisms to maintain sufficient but not excessive concentrations of iron, thereby keeping the delicate balance between essential and toxic levels of iron. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, iron homeostasis is controlled by two iron-regulated proteins, the GATA-type transcription factor Fep1 and the CCAAT-binding factor Php4 (4Labbé S. Pelletier B. Mercier A. Biometals. 2007; 20: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Bird A.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2008; 53: 231-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When iron levels are high, Fep1 binds to GATA cis-acting elements found in the promoter regions of genes involved in iron acquisition (e.g. fip1+, fio1+, frp1+, and str1+/2+/3+) and shuts down their expression to avoid deleterious consequences of iron overload (6Pelletier B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4332-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). When iron levels are low, Fep1 is unable to bind DNA, resulting in the transcriptional induction of genes involved in iron acquisition (6Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Mukai Y. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22950-22958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Pelletier B. Mercier A. Durand M. Peter C. Jbel M. Beaudoin J. Labbé S.

Analogous to S. pombe, other fungi use Fep1 orthologs to repress transcription of target genes in response to high iron. Examples include Urbs1 in Ustilago maydis (10An Z. Mei B. Yuan W.M. Leong S.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11An Z. Zhao Q. McEvoy J. Yuan W.M. Markley J.L. Leong S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e410Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the fission yeast S. pombe, one gene that is regulated in a Fep1-dependent manner is php4+. php4+ encodes a subunit of the CCAAT-binding protein complex, which includes three other subunits, denoted Php2, Php3, and Php5 (17McNabb D.S. Tseng K.A. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7008-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Mercier A. Pelletier B. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1866-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Genes encoding Php2, Php3, and Php5 are constitutively expressed, whereas transcript levels of php4+ are induced under conditions of iron starvation and repressed under iron-replete conditions (18Mercier A. Pelletier B. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1866-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Php4 is responsible for the transcriptional repression capability of the Php complex and is not required for the DNA binding activity of the complex. A genome-wide microarray analysis revealed that Php4 is capable of coordinating the repression of 86 genes in response to iron starvation (19Mercier A. Watt S. Bähler J. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Among these genes, several encode proteins involved in iron-dependent metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial respiration, heme biosynthesis, and iron-sulfur cluster assembly. DNA microarray analysis also showed that the gene encoding the iron-responsive transcriptional repressor Fep1 is down-regulated in response to iron deficiency in a Php4-dependent fashion. Based on these data, we proposed a model wherein tight regulation of intracellular iron levels is controlled by the interplay between Php4 and Fep1 through mutual control of each other's expression (19Mercier A. Watt S. Bähler J. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of iron-dependent pathways to optimize the utilization of limited available iron has previously been described in other organisms. When iron is limiting in Escherichia coli, the transcriptional repressor Fur is inactivated, leading to increased levels of RyhB, a small noncoding RNA (20Massé E. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4620-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). RyhB hybridizes to mRNAs encoding iron-using proteins and triggers their degradation through an RNase E-dependent process (21Massé E. Escorcia F.E. Gottesman S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2374-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, iron deprivation leads to the activation of the iron-responsive transcription factors Aft1 and Aft2 (22Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 23Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27636-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Once activated, these two regulators induce the expression of several genes, including those encoding proteins that function in iron uptake. Additional genes are also positively regulated by Aft1 and Aft2, including CTH1 and CTH2, which encode two CCCH-type zinc finger mRNA-binding proteins that bind AU-rich elements within the 3′-untranslated region of transcripts (28Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 29Puig S. Vergara S.V. Thiele D.J. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Among the transcripts that Cth1 and Cth2 can bind and down-regulate in response to iron starvation, several encode iron-using proteins or enzymes that participate in biochemical pathways that use iron as cofactor (29Puig S. Vergara S.V. Thiele D.J. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As for Aft1 and Aft2, iron-responsive Cth1- and Cth2-like proteins are found mainly in Saccharomycotina fungal species (1Haas H. Eisendle M. Turgeon B.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2008; 46: 149-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The other fungal species such as Pezizomycotina, Taphrinomycotina, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota appear to have a distinct pair of iron-responsive regulatory proteins that include a negative GATA-type transcriptional regulator (e.g. Fep1 and SreA) and a negative regulatory subunit of the CCAAT-binding complex (e.g. Php4 and HapX) (1Haas H. Eisendle M. Turgeon B.G. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2008; 46: 149-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In A. nidulans, a Php4 ortholog, denoted HapX, can trigger down-regulation of genes encoding iron-using proteins during iron deficiency (30Hortschansky P. Eisendle M. Al-Abdallah Q. Schmidt A.D. Bergmann S. Thön M. Kniemeyer O. Abt B. Seeber B. Werner E.R. Kato M. Brakhage A.A. Haas H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3157-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both Php4 and HapX have been shown to be regulated post-translationally by iron (19Mercier A. Watt S. Bähler J. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Hortschansky P. Eisendle M. Al-Abdallah Q. Schmidt A.D. Bergmann S. Thön M. Kniemeyer O. Abt B. Seeber B. Werner E.R. Kato M. Brakhage A.A. Haas H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3157-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Experiments have shown that HapX dissociates from the HapE subunit of the CCAAT-binding complex (HapB-C-E) when iron is abundant (30Hortschansky P. Eisendle M. Al-Abdallah Q. Schmidt A.D. Bergmann S. Thön M. Kniemeyer O. Abt B. Seeber B. Werner E.R. Kato M. Brakhage A.A. Haas H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3157-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Using a one-hybrid approach in fission yeast, a constitutively expressed Gal4-Php4 fusion protein was shown to repress transcription as a function of iron availability when brought to a DNA promoter, revealing that Php4 has the ability to sense iron at the protein level (19Mercier A. Watt S. Bähler J. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recent data have provided additional clues with respect to iron sensing. One aspect is the requirement of GSH to allow Php4 to sense iron excess (19Mercier A. Watt S. Bähler J. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, mutant cells defective in GSH biogenesis show markedly decreased transcription of genes encoding iron-using proteins as a result of constitutively active Php4. GSH has also been associated with cellular iron sensing in S. cerevisiae (31Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As for Php4, Aft1 is constitutively active during GSH deficiency (31Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Elegant studies have also determined that S. cerevisiae monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3 and Grx4 are key regulators of Aft1 (32Ojeda L. Keller G. Muhlenhoff U. Rutherford J.C. Lill R. Winge D.R. J.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4554-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). When cells undergo a transition from iron-limiting to iron-sufficient conditions, it has been proposed that Grx3 and Grx4, with the aid of Fra1 and Fra2, transmit an as-yet-unidentified mitochondrial inhibitory signal, which contributes to inactivate Aft1 (32Ojeda L.

In this study, we first expressed a functional GFP-php4+ allele under the control of a constitutive GATA-less php4+ promoter. By use of this system, we ensured that any effects of iron on GFP-Php4 were independent of potential changes in GFP-php4+ expression. Under low iron conditions, GFP-Php4 accumulated in the nucleus, whereas the protein was exported to the cytoplasm within 60 min of the addition of iron. We identified a functional leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) 3The abbreviations used are: NESnuclear export signalBiFCbimolecular fluorescence complementationDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleDip2, 2′-dipyridylGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSHglutathioneLMBleptomycin BORFopen reading frameWTwild typeMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigen. 3The abbreviations used are: NESnuclear export signalBiFCbimolecular fluorescence complementationDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleDip2, 2′-dipyridylGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSHglutathioneLMBleptomycin BORFopen reading frameWTwild typeMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigen. within the region of amino acids 93–100 of Php4. We showed that Php4 binds to Crm1 and is sensitive to leptomycin B (LMB), abolishing its nuclear export behavior. In the presence of LMB, although the GFP-Php4 fusion protein was localized in the nucleus under conditions of both low and high levels of iron, we observed that the protein can still be inactivated by iron, resulting in the derepression of isa1+ transcription in response to iron. Deletion of grx4+, on the other hand, led to permanent Php4 nuclear accumulation and constitutive repression of isa1+. Further analysis by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay and by two-hybrid assays revealed that Grx4 is a binding partner of Php4. In summary, these results demonstrate that the Php4 subunit of the S. pombe CCAAT-binding complex translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in an iron-, Grx4-, and Crm1-dependent manner. nuclear export signal bimolecular fluorescence complementation 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 2, 2′-dipyridyl green fluorescent protein glutathione leptomycin B open reading frame wild type 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid proliferating cell nuclear antigen. nuclear export signal bimolecular fluorescence complementation 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 2, 2′-dipyridyl green fluorescent protein glutathione leptomycin B open reading frame wild type 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The S. pombe strains used in this study were the wild-type FY435 (h+ his7-366 leu1-32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210) and four isogenic mutant strains, fep1Δ (h+ his7-366 leu1-32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210 fep1Δ::ura4+), php4Δ (h+ his7-366 leu1-32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210 php4Δ::KANr), grx4Δ (h+ his7-366 leu1-32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210 grx4Δ::KANr), and php4Δ grx4Δ (h+ his7-366 leu1-32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210 php4Δ::loxP grx4Δ::KANr). All five strains were grown in yeast extract medium containing 0.5% yeast extract and 3% glucose that was further supplemented with 225 mg/liter of adenine, histidine, leucine, uracil, and lysine, unless otherwise stated. Strains for which plasmid transformation was required were grown in synthetic Edinburgh minimal medium lacking specific nutrients required for plasmid selection and maintenance. Cells were seeded to an A600 of 0.5, grown to exponential phase (A600 of ∼1.0), and then treated with 250 μm 2,2′-dipyridyl (Dip) or 100 μm FeSO4, or left untreated for 90 min, unless otherwise indicated. S. pombe grx4Δ and php4Δ grx4Δ disruption strains, as well as control strains, were cultivated in culture jars under microaerobic conditions using the GazPack EZ system (BD Biosciences). For two-hybrid experiments, S. cerevisiae strain L40 (Mata his3Δ200 trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ) (35Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Hollenberg S.M. Bartel P. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 29-42Google Scholar) was grown in synthetic minimal medium containing 83 mg/liter histidine, adenine, uracil, and lysine, 2% dextrose, 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.1), and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base minus copper and iron (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). The pJK-194*promphp4+ plasmid contains a 194-bp DNA segment of the php4+ promoter harboring multiple point mutations in the two iron-responsive GATA sequences (positions −188 to −133 and −165 to −160) found in the php4+ promoter (19Mercier A. Watt S. Bähler J. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The open reading frame (ORF) encoding GFP was PCR-amplified from the pSF-GP1 plasmid (36Kim J. Hirsch J.P. Genetics. 1998; 149: 795-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the SalI and Asp718 restriction sites of pJK-194*promphp4+ to create pJK-194*promphp4+-GFP. pJK-194*promphp4+-GFP-php4+ was constructed through a three-piece ligation by simultaneously introducing a BamHI-SalI PCR-amplified fragment containing the GFP gene and a SalI-Asp718 PCR-amplified fragment bearing the php4+ ORF into a BamHI-Asp718-digested pJK-194*promphp4+ plasmid. The nmt1+ promoter up to position −1178 from the start codon of the nmt1+ gene was amplified by PCR from pREP-41X (37Forsburg S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2955-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Once generated, the promoter DNA fragment was inserted into the integrative vector pJK148 (38Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the SacII and BamHI sites. The construct was denoted pJKnmt41X. A DNA fragment encoding the GFP-php4+ allele was isolated from pJK-194*promphp4+-GFP-php4+ and then inserted into the BamHI and Asp718 restriction sites of pJKnmt41X to create pJKnmt41X-GFP-php4+. To generate the php4 NES mutant allele (L93A, L94A, L97A, and L100A), the plasmid pJK-194*promphp4+-GFP-php4+ was used in conjunction with the overlap extension method (39Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotides 5′- CGAGGCAGCTGAGCAGGCAGAGATGGCTCAGGCTCAGTTGAAGAATTCTACTTTGG-3′ and 5′-GCCTGAGCCATCTCTGCCTGCTCAGCTGCCTCGTTGTTCTCCTTCTGTAACTTTCCG-3′ (underlined letters represent nucleotide substitutions that gave rise to mutations) and two oligonucleotides corresponding to the start and stop codons of the ORF of php4+. The resulting PCR-amplified fragment was digested with SalI and Asp718 and cloned into pJKnmt41X-GFP, which was previously engineered by inserting the GFP gene into pJKnmt41X. The resulting construct was designated pJK-nmt41X-GFP-php4NESmut. All nucleotide changes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids pSP-1178nmt-GST-GFP and pSP-1178nmt-GST-GFP-Pap1515NES533 were constructed by a strategy described previously (40Beaudoin J. Labbé S. Eukaryot.

Plasmid pSP-1178nmt-GST-GFP was digested with SpeI and SstI restriction enzymes and used to receive annealed synthetic DNA fragments encoding wild-type and mutant versions of Php4 NES. Resulting plasmids were denoted pSP-1178nmt-GST-GFP-Php473NES122 and pSP-1178nmt-GST-GFP-Php473NES122mut, respectively. Plasmid pJK-194*promphp4+-TAP-php4+ was constructed by replacing the GFP ORF in pJK-194*promphp4+-GFP-php4+ by a PCR-amplified TAP fragment isolated from pREP1-NTAP (41Tasto J.J. Carnahan R.H. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L. Yeast. 2001; 18: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The purified TAP fragment was also cloned into pJK-194*promphp4+ to create pJK-194*promphp4+-TAP. Both pJK-194*promphp4+-TAP-php4+ and pJK-194*promphp4+-TAP were subsequently used as templates to subclone their DNA inserts into the pEA500 plasmid (42Apolinario E. Nocero M. Jin M. Hoffman C.S. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), creating pEA500-194*promphp4+-TAP-php4+ and pEA500-194*promphp4+-TAP, respectively. The S. pombe crm1+ promoter up to −1000 from the start codon of the crm1+ gene was isolated by PCR and then inserted into the pSP1 vector (43Cottarel G. Beach D. Deuschle U. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) at the ApaI and PstI sites. The resulting plasmid was denoted pSP1-1000crm1+prom. The full-length coding region of crm1+ was isolated by PCR, using primers that corresponded to the initiator and stop codons of the ORF. Because the primers contained PstI and XmaI restriction sites, the purified DNA fragment was digested with these enzymes and cloned into the corresponding sites of pSP1-1000crm1+prom. The resulting plasmid was named pSP1crm1+. The Myc12 epitope, obtained from the pctr4+-X-myc12 plasmid (44Bellemare D.R. Sanschagrin M. Beaudoin J. Labbé S. Gene. 2001; 273: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using XmaI and SstI restriction enzymes, was subsequently inserted 3′ to the crm1+ gene in pSP1crm1+. For two-hybrid interaction assay, the complete or truncated versions of the php4+ gene were inserted downstream of and in-frame to the VP16 coding sequence using BamHI and Asp718 restriction sites found in pVP16 (35Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Hollenberg S.M. Bartel P. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 29-42Google Scholar). The bait plasmid pLexA-grx4+ was created by cloning a 747-bp BamHI-PstI DNA fragment containing the full-length coding region of grx4+ into the same sites of pLexNA (35Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Hollenberg S.M. Bartel P. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 29-42Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted by a hot phenol method as described previously (45Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Bähler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). RNA samples were quantified spectrophotometrically, and 15 μg of RNA per sample were used for the RNase protection assay, which was carried out as described previously (19Mercier A. Watt S. Bähler J. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To detect grx4+ mRNA levels, plasmid pSKgrx4+ was created by inserting a 191-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragment from the grx4+ gene into the same restriction sites of pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The antisense RNA hybridizes to the region between positions +327 and +518 downstream from the A of the initiator codon of grx4+. To generate pSKVP16, a 201-bp fragment from the VP16 gene was amplified and cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pBluescript SK. Plasmids pSKisa1+, pSKphp4+, and pSKact1+ (18Mercier A. Pelletier B. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1866-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were used to produce antisense RNA probes, allowing the detection of steady-state levels of isa1+, php4+, and act1+ mRNAs, respectively. A riboprobe derived from the plasmid pKSACT1 (46Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) was used to monitor the steady-state levels of ACT1 mRNAs in experiments using the bakers' yeast strain L40. Total cell lysates were prepared as described previously (18Mercier A. Pelletier B. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1866-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were quantitated using the Bradford assay (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of each sample were subjected to electrophoresis on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, protein samples were electroblotted as described previously (9Jbel M. Mercier A. Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 649-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The following primary antisera were used for immunodetection: monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (B-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and monoclonal anti-PCNA antibody (PC10; Sigma). After incubation with the primary antibodies, membranes were washed, then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized by chemiluminescence. To analyze the cellular localization of GFP-Php4, an integrative plasmid expressing its corresponding allele under the control of the php4+ promoter was transformed into a php4Δ strain. Liquid cultures were seeded to an A600 of 0.5 and then grown to exponential phase. At log phase (A600 of ∼1.0), cells were treated with either 250 μm Dip or 100 μm FeSO4. After treatment, direct fluorescence microscopy was conducted as described previously (48Pelletier B. Trott A. Morano K.A. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25146-25161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). php4Δ or php4Δ grx4Δ cells expressing the wild-type or mutant version of Php4 NES under the control of the nmt1+ promoter were precultivated in the presence of thiamine (15 μm) to an A600 of ∼1.0. At this growth point, cells were washed twice to remove thiamine and seeded to an A600 of 0.1 prior to a 16-h incubation at 30 °C. After this growth period, cells (A600 of ∼0.75) were treated 3 h with 250 μm Dip, thereby allowing nuclear targeting of GFP-Php4. At log phase (A600 of ∼1.0), cells were washed twice to remove Dip and then grown in the presence of 15 μm thiamine to stop nmt1+-dependent gene expression. At this point, the nuclear pool of GFP-Php4 was analyzed under conditions of low or high iron for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. For treatment with LMB (L-2913; Sigma), ce"

We analyze the dispersal of maize transgenes via seeds in Mexico, the crop's cradle. Methods We use immunoassays (ELISA) to screen for the activity of recombinant proteins in a nationwide sample of farmer seed stocks. We estimate critical parameters of seed population dynamics using household survey data and combine these estimates with analytical results to examine presumed sources and mechanisms of dispersal. Results Recombinant proteins Cry1Ab/Ac and CP4/EPSPS were found in 3.1% and 1.8% of samples, respectively. They are most abundant in southeast Mexico but also present in the west-central region. Diffusion of seed and grain imported from the United States might explain the frequency and distribution of transgenes in west-central Mexico but not in the southeast. Conclusions Understanding the potential for transgene survival and dispersal should help design methods to regulate the diffusion of germplasm into local seed stocks. Further research is needed on the interactions between formal and informal seed systems and grain markets in centers of crop origin and diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2024519277,"Pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats provide a widely animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Some evidences reported in the literature suggest that at least 1 h of status epilepticus (SE) is required to produce subsequent chronic phase, due to the SE-related acute neuronal damage. However, recent data seems to indicate that neuro-inflammation plays a crucial role in epileptogenesis, modulating secondarily a neuronal insult. For this reason, we decided to test the following hypotheses: a) whether pilocarpine-injected rats that did not develop SE can exhibit long-term chronic spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and b) whether acute neurodegeneration is mandatory to obtain chronic epilepsy. Therefore, we compared animals injected with the same dose of pilocarpine that developed or did not SE, and saline treated rats. We used telemetric acquisition of EEG as long-term monitoring system to evaluate the occurrence of seizures in non-SE pilocarpineinjected animals. Furthermore, histology and MRI analysis were applied in order to detect neuronal injury and neuropathological signs. Our observations indicate that non-SE rats exhibit SRS almost 8 (+/22) months after pilocarpine-injection, independently to the absence of initial acute neuronal injury. This is the first time reported that pilocarpine injected rats without developing SE, can experience SRS after a long latency period resembling human pathology. Thus, we strongly emphasize the important meaning of including these animals to model human epileptogenesis in pilocarpine induced epilepsy."

https://openalex.org/W1973126977,"C17orf37/MGC14832, a novel gene located on human chromosome 17q12 in the ERBB2 amplicon, is abundantly expressed in breast cancer. C17orf37 expression has been reported to positively correlate with grade and stage of cancer progression; however the functional significance of C17orf37 overexpression in cancer biology is not known. Here, we show that C17orf37 is highly expressed in prostate cancer cell lines and tumors, compared to minimal expression in normal prostate cells and tissues. Cellular localization studies by confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy revealed predominant expression of C17orf37 in the cytosol with intense staining in the membrane of prostate cancer cells. RNA-interference-mediated downregulation of C17orf37 resulted in decreased migration and invasion of DU-145 prostate cancer cells, and suppressed the DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factor resulting in reduced expression of downstream target genes matrix metalloproteinase 9, urokinase plasminogen activator and vascular endothelial growth factor. Phosphorylation of PKB/Akt was also reduced upon C17orf37 downregulation, suggesting C17orf37 acts as a signaling molecule that increases invasive potential of prostate cancer cells by NF-κB-mediated downstream target genes. Our data strongly suggest C17orf37 overexpression in prostate cancer functionally enhances migration and invasion of tumor cells, and is an important target for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1974020521,"BubR1 is a critical component of the mitotic checkpoint that delays the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes have established bipolar attachment to the microtubules. We previously reported that mutations of the BUB1B gene (encoding BubR1) caused premature chromatid separation (PCS) syndrome, a condition characterized by constitutional aneuploidy and a high risk of childhood cancer. We here report that the cells from PCS syndrome patients have loss of regulation of the centrosome duplication machinery, resulting in centrosome amplification and multipolar mitosis. PCS syndrome cells show increased activity of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), whose knockdown suppresses centrosome amplification. BubR1 localizes to centrosomes, physically interacts with Plk1 and inhibits Plk1 phosphorylation and its kinase activity during interphase. These results unravel a crucial role of BubR1 in preventing centrosome reduplication through negative regulation of Plk1 in interphase cells."
https://openalex.org/W2025518617,"Knowing when and where a given protein is activated within intact animals assists in elucidating its in vivo function. With the use of a genetically encoded A-probe (activation bioprobe), we revealed that Cdc42 guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) remains inactive within Drosophila embryos during the first two-thirds of embryogenesis. Within the central nervous system where Cdc42 activity first becomes up-regulated, individual neurons display patterns restricted to specific subcellular compartments. At both organismal and cellular levels, Cdc42's endogenous activation patterns in the wild type allow predictions of where loss-of-function phenotypes will emerge in cdc42/cdc42 mutants. Genetic tests support the importance of suppressing endogenous Cdc42 activities until needed. Thus, bioprobe-assisted analysis uncovers how ubiquitously expressed signaling proteins control cellular events through continual regulation of their activities within animals."
https://openalex.org/W2001157528,"Cystatin E/M (CST6) is a natural inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases. Recent studies have shown that experimental manipulation of CST6 expression alters the metastatic behavior of human breast cancer cells. However, the association of CST6 with prostate cancer invasion and progression remains unclear. Here, we show that CST6 is robustly expressed in normal human prostate epithelium, whereas its expression is downregulated in metastatic prostate cell lines and prostate tumor tissues. Treatment of metastatic prostate cell lines with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A resulted in significant induction of CST6 mRNA levels and increased CST6 protein expression, indicating that epigenetic silencing may play a role in the loss of CST6 expression observed in prostate cancer. CST6 overexpression in human prostate cancer cells significantly reduced in vitro cell proliferation and matrigel invasion. Furthermore, the results from a bioluminescence tumor/metastasis model showed that the overexpression of CST6 significantly inhibits tumor growth and the incidence of lung metastasis. These results suggest that the downregulation of the CST6 gene is associated with promoter histone modifications and that this association plays an important role in prostate cancer progression during the invasive and metastatic stages of the disease."

To generate diverse surface antigen receptor molecules, developing lymphocytes undergo a series of site-specific DNA rearrangements to assemble functional antigen receptor genes from component gene segments (1Bassing C.H. Swat W. Alt F.W. Cell. 2002; 109: S45-S55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). This DNA rearrangement process, known as V(D)J recombination, is initiated when two lymphoid cell-specific proteins, called RAG1 and RAG2, assemble a multiprotein synaptic complex with a pair of antigen receptor gene segments and subsequently introduce a DNA double strand break at the end of each gene segment (2Hesslein D.G.

Each RSS contains conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences that are separated by either 12 or 23 bp of DNA of more varied sequence (12RSS and 23RSS, respectively); efficient V(D)J recombination generally only occurs between two RSSs in which the lengths of DNA separating the heptamer and nonamer differ (the 12/23 rule). The RAG proteins mediate DNA cleavage via a nick-hairpin mechanism, breaking the DNA between the RSS heptamer and the coding segment; these reaction products are subsequently processed and repaired by the non-homologous end-joining pathway (1Bassing C.H.

Previous studies suggest that RAG synaptic complexes are assembled through the stepwise binding of a 12RSS followed by the capture of a 23RSS (4Curry J.D. Geier J.K. Schlissel M.S. Nat.

Rev. 2004; 200: 90-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques have recently been applied to examine the orientation of DNA strands within the synaptic complex. The data obtained from these experiments led the authors to favor a model in which the RSSs adopt a bent and crossed configuration in the synaptic complex, although an alternative model in which synaptic complexes containing RSSs in parallel and antiparallel configurations assemble with similar frequency could not be formally excluded (8Ciubotaru M. Kriatchko A.N. Swanson P.C. Bright F.V. Schatz D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4745-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For most in vitro biochemical studies, the synaptic complex has been assembled by incubating the RAG proteins with a pair of oligonucleotide substrates, one containing a 12RSS, and one containing a 23RSS. Whether the RAG proteins and the RSSs adopt the same configuration in synaptic complexes assembled with oligonucleotide substrates as those assembled with longer, more physiological substrates remains to be verified, but some studies suggest there are DNA length-dependent differences in RAG-mediated RSS binding and cleavage activity (9Kumar S.

We report here the first successful visualization of RAG-RSS synaptic complexes by AFM, and describe their characterization with respect to DNA arrangement and the protein stoichiometry within the complexes. These data provide new and important insight into how RAG-RSS synaptic complexes are assembled and organized. Murine core RAG1 and RAG2, fused at the amino terminus to maltose-binding protein (MBP), were coexpressed in HEK293 cells and purified as described previously (17Bergeron S. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Human high mobility group B1 protein (HMGB1) appended with an amino-terminal His6 tag, and lacking the carboxyl-terminal basic motif and acidic tail, was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography as previously described (18Bergeron S.

Amplification reactions (100 μl) were assembled containing pJH200 template (20 ng), appropriate primer pairs (5 pmol each), and native Taq polymerase (2.5 units; Invitrogen) in PCR buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 200 μm each dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2). PCR were subjected to initial denaturation (95 °C, 5 min), 25 cycles of amplification (95 °C × 15 s, 50 °C × 30 s, and 72 °C × 20 s), and a final extension (72 °C × 5 min) using a PTC-100 Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). PCR products were fractionated on a 2% agarose gel and gel purified using the QIAQuick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Unlabeled DNA fragments of various lengths were similarly amplified by PCR from pJH299 or its derivative lacking the 23RSS (20Kriatchko A.N. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4712-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and purified using a QIAQuick PCR Cleanup kit. Binding reactions to assemble RAG pre-synaptic or synaptic complexes on oligonucleotide substrates were assembled as previously described (17Bergeron S. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). RAG binding reactions containing PCR-generated fragments were similarly prepared. Protein-DNA complexes assembled with the RAG proteins and the 12RSS and 23RSS substrates were prepared in two different ways. In the first method, all components were added to the initial reaction. Binding reactions (10 μl) contained 400 ng of purified RAG proteins, 150 ng of HMGB1, 14 nm 23RSS fragment, and 1.3 nm 12RSS fragment in binding buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 8.0, and 5 mm CaCl2 or MgCl2). The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Protein-DNA complexes were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, quenched with 2 m Tris, pH 7.4 (3.5 μl), and diluted 10–20 times for deposition onto APS-mica. These reactions contained an 11-fold excess of the 23RSS fragment compared with the 12RSS fragment. The protein:DNA ratio of each RAG protein to the 23RSS fragment is 12:1, a ratio found by mobility shift assays to yield optimum complex formation. In the second method, the RAG proteins were incubated with the 12RSS and 23RSS fragments separately in half-reactions. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and then combined and incubated for another 10 min. These complexes were prepared for sample deposition as described above. Freshly cleaved muscovite ruby mica was incubated in a mixture of 1-(3-aminopropyl)silatrane (APS) solution for 30 min to prepare APS-mica, as described previously for the preparation of various protein-DNA complexes (12Lushnikov A.Y.

The sample droplets (5 μl) were deposited on APS-mica for 2 min, then washed with deionized water, and dried with argon. The mica was attached to a metal disc with double stick tape for imaging. Images were acquired in tapping mode in air using the Multimode SPM Nanoscope IV system (Veeco/Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA). Silicon-etched tapping mode probes (TESP; Veeco/Digital Instruments, Inc.) were used. They had nominal spring constants of ∼42 N/m and a resonant frequency of ∼320 Hz. Image processing, the cross-section, and contour length measurements were performed using Femtoscan (Advanced Technologies Center, Moscow, Russia). The volume of the RAG proteins in RAG-RSS complexes was approximated as a segment of a sphere with a diameter measured at half-maximal height of the protein as described (23Henderson R.M. Schneider S. Li Q. Hornby D. White S.J. Oberleithner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 8756-8760Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To estimate the mass of the RAG proteins in the RAG-RSS complexes, a volume-to-mass conversion factor was derived from AFM studies of the SfiI tetramer bound to DNA (12Lushnikov A.Y. Potaman V.N. Oussatcheva E.A. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This factor, 1.92, was obtained by dividing the average volume calculated for the SfiI-DNA complexes analyzed by AFM (238 nm3) by the expected molecular mass of SfiI tetramer (124 kDa). Crystallographic analysis of the Sfi-DNA complex (15Vanamee E.S. Viadiu H. Kucera R. Dorner L. Picone S. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4198-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) has recently corroborated the data obtained using AFM (12Lushnikov A.Y. Potaman V.N. Oussatcheva E.A. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The lengths of 12RSS and 23RSS fragments were used for assigning the fragments in the RAG-RSS complexes. The fragment length was obtained by drawing a line over the middle of the DNA fragment. The position of the protein complex on the DNA fragment was obtained by dividing the distance between the end of the fragment and the middle of the protein molecule sitting on the fragment by the whole length of the fragment. The mean values and the mean ± S.E. shown in the histograms were obtained by using Origin 6.0 Software. In preparation for our analysis of RAG-RSS complexes by AFM, we coexpressed wild-type truncated catalytically active “core” forms of RAG1 (residues 384–1040; full-length RAG1 contains 1040 amino acids) and RAG2 (residues 1–387; full-length RAG2 contains 527 amino acids) fused at the amino terminus with maltose-binding protein in HEK293 cells, and purified them by amylose affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A). We chose to use truncated RAG proteins for this study due to their relative ease of purification and better behavior in DNA binding assays compared with their full-length counterparts (24Swanson P.C. Volkmer D. Wang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4034-4044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The DNA substrates we prepared for AFM experiments are PCR-generated fragments containing a single 12RSS (409 bp) or 23RSS (551 bp) amplified from the plasmid V(D)J recombination substrate pJH200 (19Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1987; 49: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). These substrates were designed such that the DNA ends on either side of RSSs were all of different lengths, so that, based on our previous analysis of the SfiI-DNA synaptic complex (12Lushnikov A.Y. Potaman V.N. Oussatcheva E.A. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the ends can be distinguished by AFM in RAG-RSS synaptic complexes. Lengths of the two free RSS substrates imaged with AFM were 139 ± 1 and 191 ± 3 nm (data not shown) both of which are very close to expected values (139 and 187 nm, respectively). In initial studies, we sought to determine whether the PCR-generated DNA substrates support assembly of RAG-RSS complexes detectable by EMSA under conditions suitable for the analysis of these RAG-RSS complexes using AFM. Toward this end, we prepared a radiolabeled PCR-generated 23RSS substrate and incubated the substrate with purified RAG proteins in binding reactions containing Ca2+ or Mg2+ in the absence or presence of purified HMGB1 and cold partner 12RSS. HMGB1 is an architectural DNA binding and bending factor that when added with partner RSS provide conditions known to promote formation of functional RAG synaptic complexes in vitro (25Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26van Gent D.C. Hiom K. Paull T.T. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2665-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As controls, synaptic complexes were also assembled using oligonucleotide substrates in the presence of Ca2+. Binding reactions were then fractionated by EMSA to visualize discrete protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 1C). As expected from previous studies, when purified RAG proteins are incubated with an oligonucleotide 23RSS substrate alone in a binding reaction containing Ca2+, two protein-DNA complexes are observed, called stable complexes 1 and 2 (SC1 and SC2, respectively). Both the SC1 and SC2 complexes were earlier shown by our laboratory to contain a RAG1 dimer, but the RAG2 stoichiometry differed between the two complexes, with SC1 containing monomeric RAG2, and SC2 containing two RAG2 molecules (27Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In previous results with short oligonucleotide substrates, the addition of HMGB1 to the binding reaction is found to supershift both SC1 and SC2, forming HSC1 and HSC2, respectively. Adding cold 12RSS partner supershifted HSC2 slightly to form a paired complex (PC), but reduced the abundance of HSC1. In contrast to results obtained with oligonucleotide substrates, the RAG proteins or HMGB1 alone do not form discrete protein-DNA complexes on the long PCR-generated 23RSS substrate in the absence of HMGB1 (Fig. 1C). However, when both the RAG and HMGB1 proteins were incubated together with the long 23RSS substrate, a single discrete protein-DNA complex was observed. The abundance of this complex was increased in the presence of low concentrations of cold partner RSS, but reduced when the concentration of partner RSS was increased, likely due to competitive inhibition of RAG binding. Moreover, both Ca2+ and Mg2+ support formation of this stable protein-DNA complex, although the abundance of the complex is slightly lower in Mg2+ than in Ca2+. Notably, the protein-DNA complex assembled with the long 23RSS substrate exhibits much slower mobility in the EMSA than the PC assembled using the oligonucleotide 23RSS substrate. We examined the effect of the DNA length more carefully. We generated a panel of unlabeled PCR-generated substrates lacking or containing a 23RSS. In these substrates, the length of DNA flanking the nonamer is constant, whereas the coding flank is incrementally lengthened (Fig. 2A). The amplification and recovery of the nonspecific and specific DNA fragments was comparable (Fig. 2B). Next, we incubated the RAG proteins with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide 12RSS substrate in binding reactions containing Mg2+ and HMGB1 in the absence or presence of cold nonspecific or specific partner DNA of different lengths and separated the RAG-RSS complexes by EMSA (Fig. 2C). We find that in the presence of cold nonspecific partner DNA, only RAG-RSS complexes comigrating with those formed in the absence of partner RSS were detected (Fig. 2C, compare lane 1 to lanes 2–5). In the presence of a cold oligonucleotide 23RSS partner, which contains 16 bp of coding sequence, the mobility of the RAG-RSS complex was not shifted significantly (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 6), consistent with data shown in Fig. 1C. Similar results were obtained when the coding flank of the 23RSS partner is lengthened from 16 to 32 or 67 bp (Fig. 2C, compare lane 6 to lanes 7–8). Interestingly, however, a higher-order protein-DNA complex becomes apparent when the coding flank was lengthened to 137 bp and beyond (Fig. 2C, lane 9); the mobility of this complex becomes progressively slower as the length of the coding flank is increased (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 9–12). These data together argue that the higher-order RAG protein complex represents a synaptic complex, and that its formation depends on 23RSS partner length. Because EMSA provides evidence that assembly of RAG synaptic complexes on long PCR-generated substrates is feasible, and that visualized complexes may be larger than their counterparts assembled on oligonucleotide substrates, we wished to determine whether RAG synaptic complexes could be directly visualized by AFM and, if so, whether analysis of these complexes could provide information on RAG protein stoichiometry. Toward this end, samples from binding reactions were deposited on mica surface functionalized with 3-aminopropylsilatrane (APS-mica) and imaged by AFM as described previously (e.g. Refs. 12Lushnikov A.Y.

Two notable changes to the binding reactions were made to facilitate visualization of RAG-RSS complexes by AFM. First, we found that full-length HMGB1 impaired RAG-RSS complex deposition, 4L. Shlyakhtenko and Y. Lyubchenko, unpublished observations. necessitating the use of a truncated form of HMGB1 lacking the carboxyl-terminal 48 residues that includes a basic motif and the acidic tail (Fig. 1A) (18Bergeron S. Madathiparambil T. Swanson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31314-31324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Second, RAG-RSS complexes were subjected to glutaraldehyde cross-linking before AFM because it was necessary for maintaining the integrity of the protein-DNA complex during sample dilution and deposition onto APS-mica. Glutaraldehyde has been used previously to stabilize RAG-RSS complexes for visualization by EMSA (28Hiom K. Gellert M. Cell. 1997; 88: 65-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 29Akamatsu Y. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4256-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, glutaraldehyde has been successfully used in various EM studies and recently in AFM imaging of various nucleoprotein complexes including synaptic complexes of DNA with SfiI (12Lushnikov A.Y. Potaman V.N. Oussatcheva E.A. Sinden R.R. Lyubchenko Y.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and EcoRII (13Shlyakhtenko L.S. Gilmore J. Portillo A. Tamulaitis G. Siksnys V. Lyubchenko Y.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11128-11136Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Importantly, studies of glutaraldehyde cross-linked SfiI-DNA complexes by AFM and uncross-linked SfiI-DNA complexes by crystallography suggest that AFM can provide information on the organization of protein-DNA complexes that is accurately reflected in complexes analyzed by crystallography (15Vanamee E.S. Viadiu H. Kucera R. Dorner L. Picone S. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4198-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Evidence from several laboratories provide experimental support for a model of RAG synaptic complex formation in which the RAG proteins first bind to one RSS and then “capture” an appropriate RSS partner (the “capture model”) (4Curry J.D. Geier J.K. Schlissel M.S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Jones J.M. Gellert M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4162-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Mundy C.L. Patenge N. Matthews A.G. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In an alternative model of synapsis, the RAG proteins may first assemble partial (presynaptic) complexes on individual RSSs that subsequently associate with one another through RAG protein-protein interactions (the “association model”). To avoid biasing our experiments to favor one model of assembly over the other, we tried different methods of complex assembly. In the first method, all components were mixed simultaneously and the sample was prepared for AFM. Such an approach should not exhibit a bias for either model of assembly. In the second method, the RAG proteins were incubated with the 12RSS and 23RSS fragments separately in identical solutions before the reactions with each fragment were combined, an approach that likely favors the association model over the capture model of synaptic complex assembly (see “Experimental Procedures” for specifics). In both cases, samples were prepared at room temperature in the presence of Mg2+, a condition known to support 12/23-regulated synapsis and cleavage in vitro (26van Gent D.C. Hiom K. Paull T.T. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2665-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 32Eastman Q.M. Leu T.M. Schatz D.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The samples prepared by both approaches were comparable in terms of the yield of different types of complexes visualized in AFM images. A representative example of a large scale image on which various complexes appear is shown in Fig. 3. Free protein and DNA molecules, as well as various protein-DNA complexes were observed. Typically, about 30% of the DNA was associated with protein in these images. We first investigated the structure of RAG synaptic complexes containing both 12RSS and 23RSS. Synaptic complexes were selected from dozens of images, one of which is represented by Fig. 3. The yield of such complexes among other protein-DNA complexes was quite low (10%), and they were analyzed without bias to the shape of the complex. Two frames of selected rather typical images of synaptic complexes are shown in Fig. 4, A and B. Due to the large size of the protein complexes, the identification of individual DNA fragments within the complexes was not unequivocal. For each complex, length measurements for various combinations of DNA fragments were performed. Those fragment lengths that corresponded most closely to the fragment lengths of the original 12RSS and 23RSS substrates were identified and the DNA traces corresponding to these pairwise combinations are shown as dotted lines in plates i and ii of Fig. 4, A and B. It is clear even visually that other possible combinations provide pairwise values for DNA fragment sizes that differ considerably fro"

In this study, NK92 cells were used to investigate synapse formation and subsequent signaling after binding to the target cell. The binding rate of the NK92-target cell was associated with NK92 cell cytotoxicity. Confocal results showed that adhesion molecules, LFA-1 (CD11a) and CD2, accumulated at the interface of the NK92-K562 contact. Ligation with K562 cells activated the Erk1/2 signal pathway of NK92 cells. The blocking of the NK-target conjugate by EDTA or anti-CD11a or/and anti-CD2 antibody decreased the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and NK cell cytotoxicity. Inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation by the chemical inhibitor U0126 suppressed the cytolytic activity of NK92 cells, but had no effect on NK-target conjugate formation. Thus, conjugate formation of the NK92-target cell was prerequisite to NK cell activation, and subsequent signal transduction was also required for NK cell cytotoxicity."

Relative rotation of the single copy Fo a subunit was also shown in F0F1, which was immobilized through the ring of ∼10 c subunits, suggesting that the rotor and stator are interchangeable mechanical units (14Nishio K.

ATP synthesis by F-ATPase is believed to follow the reverse mechanism of ATP hydrolysis because mechanically induced rotation of the γ subunit in immobilized F1 in the presence of ADP and Pi results in net ATP synthesis (15Itoh H.

Takeuchi S. Noji H. Nature. 2005; 433: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). There remain many questions about the mechanism of coupling between catalysis and transport via mechanical rotation. In particular, the mechanism of coupling H+ transport to rotation of the subunit c10 ring is still not well understood (4Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is considerably more information on the mechanism of coupling catalysis to γ and ϵ subunit rotation. Observations of γ subunit rotation in the catalytic F1 sector are consistent with Boyer舗s binding change model (17Boyer P.D. Lee C.P. Schatz G. Ernster L. Membrane Bioenergetics. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, MA1979: 461-479Google Scholar); thus coupling between the chemistry and rotation can be assessed by studies of the soluble F1, and these findings relate to the mechanism of the entire ATP synthase complex. The γ subunit rotates relative to the α3β3 hexamer in distinct 120° steps. A 120° rotation step consisting of pause and rotation substeps appears to correspond to the hydrolysis of one ATP, assuming that three ATP molecules are hydrolyzed per 360° revolution (18Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Additional pauses observed at low ATP concentrations are attributed to the “ATP waiting” dwell (19Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Yasuda et al. (19Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) further resolved that each 120° step occurred in two substeps: an 80° substep whose onset was dependent upon the Mg·ATP concentration, and a 40° substep, which was not affected by substrate concentration (19Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The pause before the 80° substep, the ATP waiting dwell became shorter with increasing [Mg·ATP]. In contrast, the pause duration before the 40° rotation step was modulated by the slow hydrolysis rate of ATPγS 2The abbreviations used are: ATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. or by the catalytic site mutant βE190D (in the Bacillus PS3 F1), which was found to significantly increase the length of the catalytic dwell (20Shimabukuro K.

These data together indicate that the dwell before the 40° step is the “catalytic dwell” (20Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and defines the order of the substeps during the 120° rotation step observed in high Mg·ATP concentrations (21Nakanishi-Matsui M.

In this paper, we address the question of when the rate-limiting step of steady state catalysis occurs, with respect to the rotational behavior. Pre-steady state analysis of the burst kinetics of ATP hydrolysis at nearly Vmax conditions demonstrated that the rate-limiting transition state occurs after the reversible hydrolysis/synthesis step and before release of phosphate (Pi) (22Scanlon J.A. Al-Shawi M.K. Le N.P. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8785-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Scanlon J.A. Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26228-26240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step is likely associated with a rotation step because a γ-β cross-linked enzyme is still able to undergo the initial ATP hydrolysis, but the rotation-impeded enzyme is unable to release Pi (23Scanlon J.A. Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26228-26240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Significantly, the kinetics of steady state hydrolysis can only be assessed when the Mg·ATP concentration is high enough to fill all three catalytic sites. The only model consistent with these data is one that involves all three catalytic sites. During each 120° catalytic cycle, one site binds ATP, a different site carries out reversible hydrolysis/synthesis, and the third site releases product Pi and ADP (22Scanlon J.A. Al-Shawi M.K. Le N.P. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8785-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Scanlon J.A. Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol.

Nakamoto R.K. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20835-20839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are consistent with this model. Replacement of the conserved γMet-23 with lysine causes an uncoupling between catalysis and γ subunit rotation caused by altered interactions between γ and β subunits (25Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Importantly, Al-Shawi and Nakamoto (26Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12954-12960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Al-Shawi et al. (25Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12961-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) found that the γM23K mutation strongly affected the rate-limiting transition state of steady state ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis. The slope of the Arrhenius plots and thus the energy of activation were significantly increased in the mutant enzyme. Several second site suppressor mutations, mostly in the γ subunit (28Nakamoto R.K. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 867-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nakamoto R.K. al-Shawi M.K. Futai M. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 330: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), were genetically identified because they restored coupled ATP synthesis. Significantly, all were in the γ-β interface. Thermodynamic analyses found that the second site suppressors generally compensated for the primary γM23K mutations by reducing the increased activation energy (25Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K.

Although most of the second site mutations were found distant from the γM23K site, the x-ray crystal structures (7Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) suggested that γM23K may directly interact with conserved βGlu-381. As expected, replacement of βGlu-381 with aspartate also suppressed the uncoupling effects of γM23K (31Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To identify the rate-limiting transition state step in the rotational behavior, we analyzed the temperature dependence of the γM23K mutant in Vmax conditions observed in single molecule experiments. Interestingly, direct observation of this mutant using the micron-length actin filaments did not detect differences in the rotation behavior at room temperature (9Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7780-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find in the data presented here that there is dramatic effect of the mutation on the temperature dependence of the length of the catalytic dwell or pause between the 120° rotation steps. This is likely because of two factors: first, we used a bead small enough not to invoke a drag on the rotation (32Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and second, the temperature dependence of the rate of the rotation steps is critical for the analyses of the mechanism. γM23K (γ subunit methionine 23 changed to lysine), βE381D (β subunit glutamate 381 changed to aspartate), and the γM23K/βE381D double mutation were introduced into the atp operon on a derivative of plasmid pBWU13 (33Moriyama Y. Iwamoto A. Hanada H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22141-22146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type or mutant FoF1 complexes were expressed in the atp-deleted Escherichia coli strain DK8 (ΔatpB-C) (34Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown with glycerol as the sole carbon source and disrupted in a French pressure cell, the membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation, and the F1 sector was dissociated and purified as described previously (32Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mutant and wild-type F1 were more than 95% pure and contained α, β, γ, and ϵ subunits as judged from gel electrophoresis. Pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were obtained from Roche Applied Science. The other materials used were the highest grade commercially available. Wild-type and mutant ATPase activities were assayed under the conditions used for the rotation assay (32Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, ATP hydrolysis was followed at the indicated temperatures for ∼10 min using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase enzyme-coupled system by following the decrease in NADH absorbance at 340 nm as previously described (35Sun-Wada G.H. Imai-Senga Y. Yamamoto A. Murata Y. Hirata T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18098-18105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The F1 concentration used for the assay was ∼0.1 nm, the ϵ subunit is largely dissociated from F1, and the pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were used at sufficient levels so that they were not limiting the reaction rates at any of the assay temperatures. Concentrations of protein (32Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Mg·ATP (36Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) were determined as previously described. Rotational behavior was tracked using a 60-nm diameter gold bead (British Biocell International, Cardiff) connected to the γ subunit of E. coli F1 complex immobilized in a flow cell (30 μm deep). We used the same experimental set-up as that previously described (32Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 37Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, 50 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at pH 7.0. Images of beads illuminated with laser light were obtained on a dark field microscope (BX51WI CDEVA-F; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and recorded with a C-MOS camera at 4,000 or 8,000 frames/s. The data were analyzed using Image J (National Institutes of Health) (37Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). The assay temperature was controlled by Thermoplate (Tokai Hit Co. Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan) attached to the objective. In addition, the room temperature was adjusted to help obtain steady sample temperatures. Actual temperatures were measured by a thermister placed in the immersion oil between the objective and flow cell (Anritu Co. Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan). Unless otherwise specified, bead rotation was monitored for 2 s, which is the maximum data collection period for our experimental set-up. The detection frequency of rotating beads was ∼20% of those observed. The rotation rate was determined by taking the reciprocal of the geometric means of the full 360° rotation time (single revolution time). The rates were also estimated from the arithmetic mean simply by calculating the number of revolutions/s. In this case, we did not include any long pauses lasting longer than 0.1 s (see “Results”). Continuous high speed rotation was followed using a 60-nm gold bead attached to the γ subunit of F1 complex bound to a glass substrate. Certainly, the small bead exhibited much faster rates than the actin filaments used previously. The ∼1-μm actin filament rotated at ∼10 revolutions/s compared with ∼400 revolutions/s of a 40-nm-diameter bead attached to the same point on the γ subunit (32Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The 60-nm bead size was previously found to be small enough not to impart a significant drag and thus does not slow the rate of ATP hydrolysis-driven rotation (32Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In tests with a range of beads from 40 to 200 nm in diameter, the rates of 40- and 60-nm beads were similar, suggesting that the observed rates were close to that of the γ subunit without the probe attached. The rotations rates were slower in the presence of the ϵ subunit, which is consistent with its ATPase inhibitory activity (32Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, the reaction conditions include 2 mm ATP plus 2 mm MgCl2, which gives a Mg·ATP concentration of ∼1.6 mm, ∼30–60-fold higher concentration than the Km for Mg·ATP in steady state hydrolysis determined in bulk phase assay conditions (32Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Sun-Wada G.H. Imai-Senga Y. Yamamoto A. Murata Y. Hirata T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18098-18105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the free Mg2+ concentration is relatively low (<0.4 mm) to reduce its inhibitory effects (38Kanazawa H. Horiuchi Y. Takagi M. Ishino Y. Futai M. J. Biochem. 1980; 88: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The beads occasionally exhibited long pauses (>0.1 s), which play a role in the bulk steady state ATPase activity (21Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Ubukata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20698-20704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (also see below). They were not considered in the present study because we are only analyzing the partial reactions of continuous rotational catalysis, which includes the rate-limiting step. With our optimized single molecule assay in Vmax conditions, we determined the temperature dependence of the ATP-driven rotation to assess the rate-limiting step of the rotational behavior. As can be observed in the positional traces (time courses) shown in Fig. 1A, the beads rotate at slower rates with decreasing temperature. First, we collected data recording the time required for full 360° revolutions and reported these data as single revolution times in the frequency plot in Fig. 1B. All of the rotation events include the short pauses and 120° steps. Because the frequency plots for records of individual beads and those of multiple beads are very similar as was previously observed (21Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Ubukata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20698-20704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we use the data from ∼10 randomly selected beads to calculate the single revolution time in a given condition. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, the single revolution time clearly becomes longer and the distribution becomes broader with decreasing temperature. The frequency plots also show the stochastic nature of the rotation behavior, which we have previously concluded is an intrinsic characteristic of the F1-ATPase mechanism (21Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Ubukata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20698-20704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We used the reciprocal of the geometric mean of the single revolution time to give the rotation rate, which is plotted in the Arrhenius plots in Fig. 1C (closed squares). We also determined the rotation rates by taking the arithmetic mean by simply averaging the number of rotations over a period of time for randomly selected beads (Fig. 1C, open circles). Again, these averages do not include the long pauses that last longer than 0.1 s. Note that the rotation rates are plotted in terms of the expected rates of ATP hydrolysis. Assuming that the hydrolysis of three ATP drives each 360° revolution and the ATPase is efficiently coupled to rotation, three times the rotation rate should correspond to the rate of ATP hydrolysis for a single molecule. We also point out that the plots of the rotation rates obtained from reciprocal single revolution time are essentially the same as those from arithmetic means, indicating that the data are internally self-consistent. It is not possible as yet to directly measure ATP hydrolysis in a single molecule. Thus, we must compare the rotation rates to the bulk phase ATP hydrolysis rates measured in the same conditions as the rotation experiments. We previously found (32Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Hosokawa H. Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4126-4131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that the ATPase turnover calculated from the rotation experiments was three to five times faster than that from bulk steady state hydrolysis measurements (Fig. 1C, closed squares and open circles representing the ATP hydrolysis rate based on the rotation rates compared with the bulk steady state ATPase determinations, shown by open triangles). We note that ∼20% of the beads in a given 2-s observation window were rotating (Fig. 1A), and the frequency of rotating beads increased with longer observation time. As shown in Fig. 1A, some beads initiate rotation in the middle of the 2-s observation (those that arise from “0” during the 2-s observation window), whereas other beads rotated for significant time but then paused. We note that the behavior of such beads is missed in the rotation data if the observation window is limited to 1 s. Thus, approximately a third to a fifth of F1 molecules rotate at any one time, whereas the other molecules are in pauses, which can last longer than 2 s (21Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Ubukata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20698-20704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have observed pauses longer than 2 s when an observation window of 10 s was used (data not shown.) The prolonged pauses of the beads probably account for the bulk phase ATPase rates that are lower than what is expected based on the observed rotation rates (21Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Ubukata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20698-20704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The slope of the Arrhenius plots gives the activation energy, EA, for the reaction. Significantly, the Arrhenius plot of the bulk phase steady state ATP hydrolysis rates has a slightly steeper slope than the ATPase rates based on the rotation rates (Fig. 1C). Because the rotation rates do not consider the long pauses, it is not surprising that the activation energy for the rotational behavior is slightly lower. On the other hand, we also note that the rate-limiting step appears to be the same kinetic step for both rotation and for bulk steady state ATPase. The linear free energy relationship (Fig. 1D) for steady state ATPase activity of a wide range of wild-type and mutant F1 and FoF1 enzymes clearly shows that these enzymes share the same rate-limiting step and a common transition state structure (27Al-Shawi M.K. Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12961-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 39Peskova Y.B. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11830-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Importantly, the rotation rates also fall on the same line, showing that the rotation behavior has the same rate-limiting step as the steady state ATP hydrolysis cycle. Using a data collection rate of 4,000–8,000 frames/s allows us to detect the intervening short pauses between 120° rotation steps during continuous rotation behavior (Fig. 2A). We previously concluded that ATP hydrolysis occurs during the short pause and is thus called the catalytic dwell (21Nakanishi-Matsui M. Kashiwagi S. Ubukata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20698-20704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This dwell corresponds to the pause between the 80° and 40° substeps as observed by Yasuda et al. (19Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The duration of the catalytic dwell became slightly shorter with increasing temperature; for example, the average dwell lengths at 17 and 31 °C were 0.22 ± 0.014 and 0.15 ± 0.016 ms, respectively (Fig. 2B, black bars). The time length for a 120° rotation step was longer than the pause duration and also became shorter with increasing temperature: 0.84 ± 0.055 ms at 17 °C and 0.53 ± 0.037 ms at 31 °C (Fig. 2B, open bars). The reciprocal of the step time is used to calculate the speed of the 120° step, which increased with increasing temperature: 1206 ± 80 s−1 at 17 °C and 1"
https://openalex.org/W2038237188,"Available instances of inheritance of epigenetic transgenerational phenotype are limited to environmental exposures during embryonic and adult gonadal development. Adult exposures can also affect gametogenesis and thereby potentially result in reprogramming of the germline. Although examples of epigenetic effects on gametogenesis exist, it is notable that transgenerational inheritance of environment-induced adult phenotype has not yet been reported. Epigenetic codes are considered to be critical in neural plasticity. A Drosophila systems model of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced long-term brain plasticity has recently been described. In this model, chronic PTZ treatment of adult males causes alterations in CNS transcriptome. Here, we describe our search for transgenerational spermatogenic inheritance of PTZ induced gene expression phenotype acquired by adult Drosophila males. We generated CNS transcriptomic profiles of F1 adults after treating F0 adult males with PTZ and of F2 adults resulting from a cross between F1 males and normal females. Surprisingly, microarray clustering showed F1 male profile as closest to F1 female and F0 male profile closest to F2 male. Differentially expressed genes in F1 males, F1 females and F2 males showed significant overlap with those caused by PTZ. Interestingly, microarray evidence also led to the identification of upregulated rRNA in F2 males. Next, we generated microarray expression profiles of adult testis from F0 and F1 males. Further surprising, clustering of CNS and testis profiles and matching of differentially expressed genes in them provided evidence of a spermatogenic mechanism in the transgenerational effect observed. To our knowledge, we report for the first time detection of transgenerational spermatogenic inheritance of adult acquired somatic gene expression characteristic. The Drosophila systems model offers an excellent opportunity to understand the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. The finding that adult acquired transcriptomic alteration in soma is spermatogenically inherited across generations has potential implications in human health and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2041086320,"Our understanding of the post-translational processes involved in regulating the interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) tumor suppressor protein is limited. The introduction of mutations within the C-terminal Mf1 domain (amino acids 301-325) impacts on IRF-1-mediated gene repression and growth suppression as well as the rate of IRF-1 degradation. However, nothing is known about the proteins that interact with this region to modulate IRF-1 function. A biochemical screen for Mf1-interacting proteins has identified an LXXLL motif that is required for binding of Hsp70 family members and cooperation with Hsp90 to regulate IRF-1 turnover and activity. These conclusions are supported by the finding that Hsp90 inhibitors suppress IRF-1-dependent transcription shortly after treatment, although at later time points inhibition of Hsp90 leads to an Hsp70-dependent depletion of nuclear IRF-1. Conversely, the half-life of IRF-1 is increased by Hsp90 in an ATPase-dependent manner leading to the accumulation of nuclear but not cytoplasmic IRF-1. This study begins to elucidate the role of the Mf1 domain of IRF-1 in orchestrating the recruitment of regulatory factors that can impact on both its turnover and transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1986494305,"The chimera nucleophosmin–anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM–ALK), the tyrosine kinase activity of which is constitutively upregulated, is the causative agent of 75% of the anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs). We have demonstrated that NPM–ALK induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a pathway involving the arachidonic acid-metabolizing enzymes of the lipoxygenase (LOX) family. The use of the LOX inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and of the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) demonstrated that ROS are important in maintaining the ALK kinase active. Consistent with this, NDGA treatment resulted in the inhibition of key pathways, such as Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which are involved in NPM–ALK antiapoptotic and pro-mitogenic functions. Conversely, the stress-activated kinase p38, described in some instances as a mediator of apoptosis, was activated. Interestingly, 5-LOX, an isoform involved in many cancers, was found to be activated in NPM–ALK(+) cells. Functional studies have shown that transforming properties, namely proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, were abrogated by treatment with either NDGA or the 5-LOX inhibitor (N-(3-phenoxycinnamyl)-acetohydroxamic acid) (BW A4C). Together, these data point to the ROS/LOX pathway as a potential new target for therapy in NPM—ALK-positive tumors."

We illustrate our methodology using a coronal slice-based atlas of the Rhesus Monkey cortex.
