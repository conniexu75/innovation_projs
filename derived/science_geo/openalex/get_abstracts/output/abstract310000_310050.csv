https://openalex.org/W2084273225,"The use of a combination of the stable isotopes of sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen allows the flow of organic matter and trophic relations in salt marshes and estuaries to be traced while eliminating many ambiguities that accompany the use of a single isotopic tracer. Salt-marsh grasses take up the isotopically light sulfides formed during sulfate reduction, and the transfer of this light sulfur through the marsh food web is illustrated with data on the ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa) from various locations in a New England marsh. The multiple isotope approach shows that this filter feeder consumes both marsh grass ( Spartina) detritus and plankton, with the relative proportions of each determined by the location of the mussels in the marsh."
https://openalex.org/W2075828903,"Zooplankton excretion and algal alkaline phosphatase are presumed to be responsible for phosphorus recycling in aquatic ecosystems; the role of bacteria has been unclear. High levels of bacterial cell-surface 5-nucleotidase were discovered in samples of picoplankton from California coastal waters. 5-Nucleotidase rapidly generated orthophosphate from 5-nucleotide added in nanomolar amounts and could supply half the orthophosphate required by plankton. Unlike alkaline phosphatase, 5-nucleotidase was not inhibited by orthophosphate at any concentration found in aquatic environments. Initial results indicate even greater 5-nucleotidase activity in fresh water (Lake Hodges, California) and brackish water (Baltic). Release and uptake of orthophosphate were tightly coupled."
https://openalex.org/W1991527081,"In near-surface waters of the neritic zone, the fragile aggregate material called ""marine snow"" is enriched by a variety of planktonic organisms and detrital products of plankton. Here marine snow is a source of patchiness and taxonomic diversity for microplankton populations and is a likely food resource and recycling agent for fecal particles."
https://openalex.org/W2056282502,The ciliate Euplotes octocarinatus and some close relatives of it are triggered by predator-released substances to undergo morphogenetic changes that inhibit their engulfment. The changes occur within a few hours and do not require cell division. They are perpetuated during reproduction so long as the concentration of the morphogen is maintained. The ability of Euplotes to respond to predator-produced signals by a defensive change in cell architecture probably provides an effective mechanism for damping population oscillations ofboth prey and predators andfosters coexistence. The signal-induced cell transformation merits study for its own sake because of its developmental implications.
https://openalex.org/W1964398226,"The TIT FOR TAT model of reciprocity, which is based on a successful program for the game known as the Prisoner's Dilemma, was experimentally tested on a population of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). Parent and nonbreeding tree swallows have conflicts of interests that resemble those in the Prisoner's Dilemma. TIT FOR TAT predicts restraint of conflict before a competitor's act of defection, retaliation after defection, and a resumption of restraint following retaliation. After a simulated act of defection by nonbreeders, parents behaved as predicted by the model."
https://openalex.org/W2061354466,"A new method for calculating the stress field in bounded ice shelves is used to compare strain rate and deviatoric stress on the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica. The analysis shows that strain rate (per second) increases as the third power of deviatoric stress (in newtons per square meter), with a constant of proportionality equal to 2.3 x 10-25."
https://openalex.org/W2058563482,"Each of the following ions with spin S = 3/2, octahedral chromium(III), five-coordinate iron(III), and tetrahedral cobalt(II), possesses a (4)A(2) ground state. The theory describing their paramagnetic properties is therefore the same, though some of the parameters change appreciably from ion to ion. This theory is described along with examples of experimental data. The implications of the paramagnetic properties for the magnetic ordering phenomena exhibited by complexes of these ions are also described."
https://openalex.org/W2045219297,"Extensive data on the trajectories of icebergs located off the coast of Labrador has yielded information on tidal currents, the effect of wind on iceberg motion, and the properties of the low-frequency eddies. Statistical properties of the data were shown to be related to theoretical ideas on two-dimensional turbulence and to the connection between Eulerian and Lagrangian velocity statistics. The results have led to an estimate of the cross-shelf mixing rate and a statistical prediction scheme for iceberg trajectories."
