https://openalex.org/W2014134050,"The limiting diameter of pores in the walls of living plant cells through which molecules can freely pass has been determined by a solute exclusion technique to be 35 to 38 angstroms for hair cells of Raphanus sativus roots and fibers of Gossypium hirsutum, 38 to 40 angstroms for cultured cells of Acer pseudoplatanus, and 45 to 52 angstroms for isolated palisade parenchyma cells of the leaves of Xanthium strumarium and Commelina communis. These results indicate that molecules with diameters larger than these pores would be restricted in their ability to penetrate such a cell wall, and that such a wall may represent a more significant barrier to cellular communication than has been previously assumed."

A comparison of mutant and normal development reveals that this deficit is caused by the cell-specific transformation of the cell normally fated to produce R7 into a lens-secreting accessory cell, a cone cell."
https://openalex.org/W1972124561,"In this article we examine the economic benefits of the long history of public research in agriculture. Agricultural productivity continues to grow. Annual rates of return on research expenditure are of the order of 50 percent. Research oriented to science is profitable when associated with technological research. Decentralization, as in the system of state agricultural experiment stations and substations, has allowed close association of research oriented to science with that oriented to technology and to farming. The high rate of return shows that investment in public research in agriculture is too low. This is at least partially because research benefits spill over to other regions and to consumers, reducing the incentives for local support."
https://openalex.org/W1979599393,"In the zebrafish, cells of a clone derived from a single blastomere migrate away from one another during gastrulation. Later in development their descendants are usually found scattered within several different types of tissues of embryo. The divisions and migrations of individual cells were monitored during early development, revealing that in most cases the lineal descendants of single cells present at gastrula stage exclusively populate only single tissues, and may have stereotyped positional relationships within these tissues. Thus the gastrula stage is the first stage when heritable restrictions in cell type might arise in the zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W1988334717,"Convergent archeological, geological, palynological, dendrochronological, and radiometric data provide a paleoenvironmental record for the American Southwest at a level of detail and time resolution not previously achieved. Many prehistoric cultural and demographic changes on the Colorado Plateaus coincided with environmental fluctuations defined by precisely dated geoclimatic and bioclimatic indicators. These coincidences support the interpretation that socioeconomic changes and population displacements were commonly triggered by environmental stress."
https://openalex.org/W1985352485,"The gravitational field of the sun acts as a spherical lens to magnify the intensity of radiation from a distant source along a semi-infinite focal line. A spacecraft anywhere on that line in principle could observe, eavesdrop, and communicate over interstellar distances, using equipment comparable in size and power with what is now used for interplanetary distances. If one neglects coronal effects, the maximum magnification factor for coherent radiation is inversely proportional to the wavelength, being 100 million at 1 millimeter. The principal difficulties are that the nearest point on the focal half-line is about 550 times the sun-earth distance, separate spacecraft would be needed to work with each stellar system of interest, and the solar corona would severely limit the intensity of coherent radiation while also restricting operations to relatively short wavelengths."
https://openalex.org/W2051887824,A 0.6-centimeter-thick sublayer was found in horizontal flow profiles obtained by traversing a heated thermistor from 19 centimeters above to 2 centimeters below the water-sediment interface in 200-meter-deep water on the Oregon continental shelf. In this sublayer the speed of the current varies linearly with distance above the sediment. Estimates of viscous stress from this sublayer and turbulent stress from the profile agree within 5 percent. Stress calculated from a current-meter spectrum agrees within its 95 percent confidence limits.
https://openalex.org/W2078491937,"During the 1978 growing season, nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions from a typical well-managed northern Colorado field of corn (Zea mays L.) totaled approximately 2.6 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare, or about 1.3 percent of the applied fertilizer nitrogen. Thirty percent of the loss occurred during the 3 weeks following fertilization while ammonia was being rapidly nitrified, and 59 percent was emitted during the week after the field's first irrigation, when restricted oxygen diffusion favored denitrification. Considering the large spatial and temporal variability of N(2)O emissions from soil, micrometeorological estimates of vertical N(2)O flux density compared favorably with estimates based on a simple soil cover method."
https://openalex.org/W1971585480,"Some liquid-crystalline phases of optically active materials are themselves optically active and have dissymmetric structures. The cholesteric phase and smectics C,I, and F have a helical order of their molecules. Plane-polarized light is rotated by the helix, and when the pitch of the helix is comparable to the wavelength of visible light, these phases will reflect irridescent light of a single color. The smectics phases can exhibit ferroelectricity and have been utilized recently in fast-switching light valves. A relation between the microscopic property of molecular configuration and the macroscopic properties of ferroelectricity and the rotation of plane-polarized light is developed."
https://openalex.org/W2088018581,"Analyses by means of high-speed, light cinematography at 800 and 1000 frames per second have shown that members of the shallow-water anglerfish genus Antennarius are capable of producing an enormous suction pressure for prey capture by means of an extraordinarily rapid expansion of the buccal and opercular cavities. Prey is totally engulfed at speeds considerably greater than those recorded for any other fish. The structural adaptations responsible for this rapid prey engulfment provide anglerfishes with one of the fastest known vertebrate feeding mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2039462335,"Two North American fossil species of large felids, hitherto regarded as Late Cenozoic pumas (mountain lion), are in fact closely related to the living cheetah, Acinonyx, of Africa and Eurasia. A new subgenus (Miracinonyx) is proposed for the American species. Cheetahs and pumas may have had a common ancestor in the Miocene of North America."
https://openalex.org/W2059747240,"The introduction, manipulation, and ultimate removal of selenium-containing functional groups allow a variety of synthetically useful processes to be accomplished in high overall yields under mild conditions. In particular, transformations such as allylic oxidations, nucleophile-induced cleavage reactions, regiospecific alkylations, and olefin cofunctionalizations can be readily achieved by taking advantage of selenium's unique properties."
https://openalex.org/W2094305432,The stealing behavior of Argyrodes elevatus suggests that this kleptoparasitic spider monitors the movements and the hunting success of its web-building host. Wrapping of prey by the host regularly elicits raids from the kleptoparasite. The prey-catching activities of the host generate vibrations that were recorded with a position-sensing photodiode. The recordings indicated that wrapping movements produce a characteristic pattern of vibrations.
https://openalex.org/W2171129677,"The abundance of large, previously unknown larvacean feeding structures in the deep ocean is a striking contrast to the rarity of such forms taken in net hauls. In some areas, abandoned houses and their disintegrated parts provide a substrate for other organisms and contribute to organic aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2166105031,"The ingestion by seabirds of fossil fuel hydrocarbons and other pollutants has been of great interest. This paper reports that storm-petrels ingest petroleum at sea and that residues can be detected in their stomach oil. The incidence of gut samples containing fossil fuel hydrocarbons (dirty samples) increased significantly after oil spills, and significantly more birds regurgitated dirty samples after large nearby spills than small distant ones. This appears to be one of the first reported instances where individuals of a natural population of marine birds have been shown to ingest sublethal doses of oil from sources of low-level, long-term pollution or from oil spills. Because of certain natural traits, Procellariiformes could serve as monitors of pollutants in the marine environment."
https://openalex.org/W1972046271,"Silicon microstructures only a few hundred atoms wide can be fabricated and used to study electron transport in narrow channels. Spatially localized voltage probes as close together as 0.1 micrometer can be used to investigate a variety of physical phenomena, including velocity saturation due to phonon emission, the local potentials caused by scattering from a single trapped electron, and quantum tunneling or hopping among very few electron states."
https://openalex.org/W2035934949,"The origin of the moon is considered within the theory of formation of the terrestrial planets by accumulation of planetesimals. The theory predicts the occurrence of giant impacts, suggesting that the moon formed after a roughly Mars-sized body impacted on the protoearth. The impact blasted portions of the protoearth and the impacting body into geocentric orbit, forming a prelunar disk from which the moon later accreted. Although other mechanisms for formation of the moon appear to be dynamically impossible or implausible, fundamental questions must be answered before a giant impact origin can be considered both possible and probable."

https://openalex.org/W2046948697,"When the correct values for the temperature coefficient of carbon dioxide solubility in seawater are used, theoretical calculations show that no measurable carbon-isotope redistribution occurs between sea and air for any plausible change in the sea-surface temperature. Although this fact invalidates one possible paleothermometer, it somewhat simplifies the interpretation of carbon-13 data in terrestrial biological samples."
