https://openalex.org/W2060906577,Animal and human subjects readily develop strong preferences for objects that have become familiar through repeated exposures. Experimental evidence is presented that these preferences can develop even when the exposures are so degraded that recognition is precluded.
https://openalex.org/W2084374224,"Nerve fibers transmitting information from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex may be classified according to their major cortical layers of termination. (i) One class consists of inputs from thalamic relay nuclei for vision, audition, and somesthesis to layer IV, layer III, or both. In contrast, autoradiographic studies of projections from other thalamic nuclei reveal strikingly different patterns of termination: (ii) layer VI (or layer V, or both) is the target of fibers from the intralaminar nuclei, and (iii) layer I is the target for fibers from the ventromedial and magnocellular medial geniculate nuclei. (iv) The remaining class is typified by termination both in layer I and in additional layers that depend on the cortical area in which the terminations are found. The data demonstrate that convergent thalamic inputs to a given cortical area are usually not confluent within a layer and provide a new frame-work for categorizing thalamic nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1982346511,"Red blood cells may have a physical and chemical effect on the interaction between platelets and blood vessel surfaces. Under flow conditions in which primarily physical effects prevail, platelet adhesion increases fivefold as hematocrit values increase from 10 to 40 percent but undergoes no further increase from 40 to 70 percent, implying a saturation of the transport-enhancing capabilities of red cells. For flow conditions in which platelet-surface reactivity is more dominant, platelet adhesion and thrombus formation increase monotonically as hematocrit values increase from 10 to 70 percent. Thus red cells may have a significant influence on hemostasis and thrombosis; the nature of the effect is apparently related to the flow conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2035860618,"Heroin-dependent men were given buprenorphine (a partial opiate agonist-antagonist) or a placebo under double-blind conditions on a clinical research ward where they could acquire heroin (21 to 40.5 milligrams per day, intravenously). Buprenorphine significantly (P < .001) suppressed the self-administration of heroin over 10 days. Control subjects took between 93 and 100 percent of the available heroin. The effects of buprenorphine were dose-dependent; a dose of 8 milligrams per day reduced heroin use by 69 to 98 percent; a dose of 4 milligrams per day reduced heroin use by 45 percent. Termination of buprenorphine maintenance did not result in opiate withdrawal signs or symptoms. The subjects liked buprenorphine and indicated that it was preferable to methadone or naltrexone. Buprenorphine should be a safe and effective new pharmacotherapy for heroin dependence."

https://openalex.org/W2018692840,"Guinea pigs were allowed to investigate urine that contained rhodamine, a nonvolatile fluorescent dye. Guinea pigs given free access to dyed urine exhibited fluorescence in their vomeronasal and septal organs but not on their olfactory epithelium. Fluorescence was not seen when unadulterated urine was presented. Thus compounds of low volatility, which do not reach the olfactory epithelium, may stimulate the vomeronasal system and provide information that is normally not provided by gustation or olfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2050970154,"Cell death, inflammation, and repair in rabbits' aortas and pulmonary arteries were observed at 3-, 7-, and 10-day periods after the intravenous injection of oxygenated sterols. Thus, oxygenated sterols, not cholesterol, may play the primary role in arterial wall injury and lesion development."
https://openalex.org/W2086260934,"Three species of hummingbird (Archilochus alexandri, Lampornis clemenciae, and Eugenes fulgens) were trained to make visual discriminations between lights of different spectral content. On the basis of initial choices of feeders following a period of conditioning, birds of all three species were able to distinguish near ultraviolet (370 nanometers, 20-nanometer half bandwidth) from darkness (unilluminated viewing screen) or from the small amount of far red light that leaked through the ultraviolet-transmitting glass filter. A human observer was unable to make either discrimination. The birds were also able to distinguish white lights lacking wavelengths shorter than 400 nanometers from the full spectrum of the quartz-halogen bulbs. One can infer that the cone oil droplets, which have been lost from the retinas of most mammals, provide a potentially more flexible system for restricting the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum than does the filtering action of lens and macula that serves this function in the human eye."
https://openalex.org/W2152385435,The purification of human fibroblast interferon has been simplified to a two-step procedure consisting of affinity chromatography on Blue Sepharose and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A preliminary amino acid composition and the sequence of the 13 amino-terminal residues of homogeneous interferon prepared by this method is reported.
https://openalex.org/W1994106109,"Mate calling by South African clawed frogs, Xenopus laevis, is under the control of androgens. Autoradiographic studies demonstrate androgen-concentrating neurons in a motor nucleus that controls mate calling and a midbrain nucleus that is stimulated by sound. Hormone concentration by laryngeal motor neurons suggests that steroids regulate the final common path for vocal behavior. Modulation of auditory sensitivity by hormones could explain seasonal variations in behavioral responsiveness to conspecific vocalizations."
https://openalex.org/W2048688511,New developments in automated amino acid sequence analysis permit a 104-fold increase in sensitivity (to ∼ 10-picomole level) over that initially described by Per Edman in 1967.
https://openalex.org/W1985834884,"Homogeneous human lymphoblastoid interferon with an apparent molecular size of 18,500 daltons was characterized by its amino acid composition. Analysis of the amino terminal sequence by Edman degradation indicates that the sequence is unique."
https://openalex.org/W1984343011,"A group of 50 smokers experienced greater sleep difficulty than a group of 50 nonsmokers matched by age and sex. The two groups did not differ in personality patterns or drug consumption. Also, sleep patterns significantly improved in a group of eight chronic smokers when they abstained from cigarette smoking. These findings are consistent with reports on the stimulant effects of nicotine."

https://openalex.org/W2079817373,"Free (approximately 1600 daltons) somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was identified in arterial plasma of dogs that had received a test meal. Neutralization of circulating somatostatin while the dogs were consuming a fatty meal increased the plasma concentrations of triglycerides, gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide, and insulin after the meal. It is concluded that, in the dog, somatostatin is a true hormone that regulates the movement of nutrients from the gut to the internal environment."

https://openalex.org/W2058098438,"The olfactory tracts in the cod (Gadus morhua L.) consist of four bundlets. Three were cut symmetrically in both sides leaving only one of the four bundlets intact. Weak electrical pulses given to the uncut bundlets elicited, for each, a different behavior pattern in free-swimming cod. The results support a spatial basis for olfactory discrimination and open new experimental possibilities linking the neuroanatomical substrate and fish behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1963896234,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons adsorbed onto coal fly ash were found to be stabilized against photochemical decomposition. However, a number of adsorbed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons will spontaneously oxidize in the absence of light, with those compounds containing a benzylic carbon being particularly susceptible. The decomposition rate appears to be fly ash-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W2074553329,"An abnormal extra band was found on the short arm of the X chromosome in a 46,XY female and in her 46,XY female fetal sibling. Despite presence of the intact Y chromosome, there was no evidence of testicular differentiation in either subject. Production of H-Y antigen was suppressed in both subjects. The data suggest that development of the mammalian testis requires a normal function of the X chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W2002380333,"It has been demonstrated that the Xenopus oocyte can translate rabbit haemoglobin messenger RNA (mRNA) following microinjection of the message into the cell. The Xenopus oocyte has since been shown to be capable of translating a variety of messenger RNAs from different species. This system has proved useful in un-erstanding the mechanism of message translation and has also provided information about the translation capability of the Xenopus oocyte. Several other cell types, including HeLa cells and fibroblasts, can also translate exogenous message injected into the cell. However, there have been no reports of injection of mRNA into oocytes or fertilised one-cell ova of mammalian species. Nevertheless, the latter system could be of considerable use in studying the processing of exogenous messages in a mammalian system undergoing development, as well as providing insight into the way the early embryo processes injected messages and the protein products of such messages. We report here the results of injecting message into the fertilised one-cell mouse ovum and show that both mouse and rabbit globin mRNA are translated in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2041515266,"Studies of the human hemoglobin system have provided new insights into the regulation of expression of a group of linked human genes, the γ-δ-β-globin gene complex in man. In particular, the thalassemia syndromes and related disorders of man are inherited anemias that provide mutations for the study of the regulation of globin gene expression. New methods, including restriction enzyme analysis and cloning of cellular DNA, have made it feasible to define more precisely the structure and organization of the globin genes in cellular DNA. Deletions of specific globin gene fragments have already been found in certain of these disorders and have been applied in prenatal diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2057519235,"Asymmetric membrane junctions were formed in culture by pairing two cell types which, in their respective homologous junctions, have cell-cell channels of different permselectivities. The channels in the asymmetric junction, presumably made of unequal channel precursors, displayed directional permselectivity; fluorescent labeled glutamic acid (700 daltons), but not smaller and less polar permeant molecules, traversed the junction more readily in one direction than in the other. The favored direction was the one where the permeant passed first through the cell membrane that would have the less restrictive channels in a homologous junction. This directional selectivity requires no electric field across the junction and is thus distinct from a rectifying junction. The physiological potential of such directional molecular sieving for partitioning communication between tissue cells of different function and developmental fate are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1999224987,"When young adults detected auditory stimuli at split-second intervals, different components of the event-related brain potentials showed markedly different speeds of recovery. The P3 component (latency 300 to 350 milliseconds) was fully recovered at intervals of less than 1.0 second, while the N1—P2 components (latencies 100 to 180 milliseconds) were markedly attenuated with stimulus repetition even at longer interstimulus intervals. Thus, the N1—P2 recovers much more slowly than a subject's ability to evaluate signals, whereas the P3 appears to be generated at the same high rates as the decision processes with which it is associated."

https://openalex.org/W2028529759,Isozymes of lactate dehydrogenase from heart and muscle of Atlantic hagfish show less functional divergence than those from other fishes and higher vertebrates. The enzyme from hagfish heart (B4) displays a higher Michaelis constant for pyruvate and lower substrate inhibition at moderate pyruvate concentrations than heart isozymes from other species. These properties support the hypothesis that the ancestral vertebrate lactate dehydrogenase was a muscle (A4)-type enzyme and also suggest a role for the B4 enzyme in the unusual physiology of hagfish cardiac tissue which functions under sustained hypoxic conditions.
https://openalex.org/W2026068701,"Biochemical studies have shown that the ability of erythrosine to inhibit dopamine uptake into brain synaptosomal preparations is dependent on the concentration of tissue present in the assay mixture. Thus, the finding that erythrosine inhibits dopamine uptake (which, if true, would provide a plausible explanation of the Feingold hypothesis of childhood hyperactivity) may simply be an artifact that results from nonspecific interactions with brain membranes. In addition, although erythrosine given parenterally (50 milligrams per kilogram) did not alter locomotor activity of control of 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rats, erythrosine (50 to 300 milligrams per kilogram) attenuated the effect of punishment in a ""conflict"" paradigm."

Because the quails' initial approach choices are also readily modifiable by experience, these results point the way to studying the mediation of gene effects, environment effects, and gene-environment interactions in visually guided behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W2070095614,"The distribution of active polyadenylate-messenger RNA sequences in fractionated chicken liver chromatin was examined. A portion of these active gene sequences is concentrated in a DNA fraction retained by tightly bound nonhistone chromosomal proteins, while the nonretained DNA fraction is substantially depleted of a portion of these sequences. These findings suggest that the tightly bound nonhistones are physically associated with a subset of active gene sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1965374101,"The transit of an air mass containing radioactive gas released from the Three Mile Island reactor was recorded in Albany, New York, by measuring xenon-133. These measurements provide an evaluation of Three Mile Island effluents to distances greater than 100 kilometers. Two independent techniques identified xenon-133 in ambient air at concentrations as high as 3900 picocuries per cubic meter. The local gamma-ray whole-body dose from the passing radioactivity amounted to 0.004 millirem, or 0.004 percent of the annual dose from natural sources."
https://openalex.org/W1968820579,"Behavioral and neurophysiological experiments and anatomical work indicate that the ampullar structures on the head of fish of the subclass Holocephali are sense organs responsive to weak electric fields and are functionally and structurally homologous to the ampullae of Lorenzini in elasmobranchs. It is concluded that, as in elasmobranchs, these organs are used to detect bioelectric and other natural electric phenomena in the environment."

https://openalex.org/W1969754072,"Color-selective spatial adaptation of the short-wavelength, or blue-sensitive, pathway was demonstrated. The adaptation was orientation selective and strongly monocular. Adaptation was assessed by measuring visibility thresholds for monochromatic gratings in subjects adapted to high-contrast violet gratings designed to stimulate only blue-sensitive cones. The results showed spatially selective, adaptable channels within the short-wavelength pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2083785690,"The compound eye of the grasshopper Phlaeoba has alternating bands that appear clear or brown. Electroretinograms recorded from the individual bands have different action spectra: The spectrum of the clear band peaks at 525 nanometers and that of the brown band at 545 nanometers. Spectrally selective whole-eye adaptation with light of eight long of short wavelength yields identical action spectra. This evidence suggests that this eye has only one visual pigment, whose spectrum is altered in the brown bands by a screening pigment. In behavioral tests of spontaneous choices between stimuli that appear green to the normal human and those that appear red, the green stimuli are preferred even when the relative intensity is varied by 0.9 log units around the equal-brightness level (determined by the electroretinogram). When some red light is mixed with the green light, the preference for the mixture is less than for the green light alone, even though the mixture is more intense. True color vision therefore seems to exist. Painting the bands shows that behavioral color vision requires the presence of both types. These data suggest that Phlaeoba has true color vision mediated by one visual pigment and suitable optical filters."

This intermodal effect is similar to intramodal changes in the critical flicker frequency of the nonoccluded eye during monocular deprivation; a single mechanism appears to underlie both phenomena."
