This material seems indistinguishable on the basis of physical properties from native ribonuclease (RNase) . These observations suggest that the information determining not only the covalent structure, but also the secondary and tertiary structure of the molecule, is contained in the amino acid sequence itself. It is of interest to determine which portions of the sequence are most necessary for correct refolding. The reduction and subsequent oxidation of subtilisin-modified RNasei has, therefore, been studied in an attempt to obtain at least a partial answer to this question. The results described below indicate that after removal of 20 of the 124 residues which form the RNase chain, an enzymatically active product may be produced by oxidation of the fully reduced derivative."

https://openalex.org/W2072125600,"Interference with deoxyribonucleic acid replication need not be a primary mechanism in the blockade of cell division by deuterium oxide, but current hypotheses on the molecular basis of the blockade do suggest that such interference might take place under appropriate conditions. Autoradiographic experiments support the suggestion, for whereas normal sea urchin eggs incorporate H(3)-thymidine into deoxyribonucleic acid from almost the beginning of development, cells immersed in deuterium-enriched media do not. Blockade of mitosis and inhibition of thymidine incorporation are simultaneously relieved when the eggs are returned to normal water."

https://openalex.org/W2061894973,"ALTHOUGH most fungi are regarded as strictly aerobic organisms, some species—under natural conditions—are known to colonize in localities which a priori must be expected to offer only poor supplies of free oxygen. This is the case with fungi attacking the interior of roots and stems of living trees. Owing to respiration in the living tissues of these organs, free oxygen dissolved in the water of vessels in sapwood and heartwood or present as free gas in intercellular spaces and non-functioning vessels is soon consumed. Concomitantly carbon dioxide is liberated. Diffusion of gases within a tree trunk probably occurs by the shortest distance, namely, by horizontal diffusion from the outside through the cortex into the interior of the stem and vice versa. However, in warm seasons when respiration-rate is high the very active cambium enclosing the central wood of a stem offers a barrier to the diffusion of gases in either direction1. Consequently as oxygen is consumed by living cells (medullary ray cells, parenchyma cells) in the sapwood the oxygen pressure will drop rapidly in the interior and be kept at a low level until diffusion is again made possible by a decrease in temperature."

It is possible to kill the animals quickly, without pain, by placing them in cool fresh water and raising the temperature steadily to about 40 degrees C."

Evidence obtained from air filters indicates elevated levels of radioactivity from nuclear tests in surface air during April through July 1960.

https://openalex.org/W2020986856,"PHAGOCYTOSIS of invading micro-organisms has long been known to play a major part in the defence of the mammalian organism against infectious disease. In view of the widespread use and potent pharmacological activity of the tranquillizing drugs, it is not surprising that administration of such compounds has occasionally been associated with alterations in normal resistance to infection1,2, and that such altered clinical responses have been linked to changes in the phagocytic activity of the reticulo-endothelial system3."
