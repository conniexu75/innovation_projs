https://openalex.org/W4205310234,"Heteroepitaxy-atomically aligned growth of a crystalline film atop a different crystalline substrate-is the basis of electrically driven lasers, multijunction solar cells, and blue-light-emitting diodes. Crystalline coherence is preserved even when atomic identity is modulated, a fact that is the critical enabler of quantum wells, wires, and dots. The interfacial quality achieved as a result of heteroepitaxial growth allows new combinations of materials with complementary properties, which enables the design and realization of functionalities that are not available in the single-phase constituents. Here we show that organohalide perovskites and preformed colloidal quantum dots, combined in the solution phase, produce epitaxially aligned 'dots-in-a-matrix' crystals. Using transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction, we reveal heterocrystals as large as about 60 nanometres and containing at least 20 mutually aligned dots that inherit the crystalline orientation of the perovskite matrix. The heterocrystals exhibit remarkable optoelectronic properties that are traceable to their atom-scale crystalline coherence: photoelectrons and holes generated in the larger-bandgap perovskites are transferred with 80% efficiency to become excitons in the quantum dot nanocrystals, which exploit the excellent photocarrier diffusion of perovskites to produce bright-light emission from infrared-bandgap quantum-tuned materials. By combining the electrical transport properties of the perovskite matrix with the high radiative efficiency of the quantum dots, we engineer a new platform to advance solution-processed infrared optoelectronics."

However, crustal heterogeneity has prevented a thorough geochemical comparison of its primary igneous building blocks—volcanic and plutonic rocks—and the processes by which they differentiate to felsic compositions. Our analysis of a comprehensive global data set of volcanic and plutonic whole-rock geochemistry shows that differentiation trends from primitive basaltic to felsic compositions for volcanic versus plutonic samples are generally indistinguishable in subduction-zone settings, but are divergent in continental rifts. Offsets in major- and trace-element differentiation patterns in rift settings suggest higher water content in plutonic magmas and reduced eruptibility of hydrous silicate magmas relative to dry rift volcanics. In both tectonic settings, our results indicate that fractional crystallization, rather than crustal melting, is predominantly responsible for the production of intermediate and felsic magmas, emphasizing the role of mafic cumulates as a residue of crustal differentiation. A global geochemical data set of volcanic and plutonic rocks indicates that differentiation trends from primitive basaltic to felsic compositions for volcanic versus plutonic samples are generally indistinguishable in subduction-zone settings, but are divergent in continental rifts. Brenhin Keller and co-authors present a global geochemical dataset of the two fundamental building blocks of the continental crust, volcanic (externally erupted) and plutonic (internally solidified) rocks. Their results indicate that differentiation trends from primitive basaltic to felsic compositions for volcanic versus plutonic samples are generally indistinguishable in subduction-zone settings, but divergent in continental rifts. Offsets in major- and trace-element differentiation patterns in rift settings suggest higher water content in plutonic magmas and reduced eruptibility of hydrous silicate magmas relative to dry rift volcanics. This work indicates that in both tectonic settings, fractional crystallization rather than crustal melting is predominantly responsible for the production of intermediate and felsic magmas."

In strictly C1-oxidizing LPMO9s, access to the solvent-facing axial coordination position is restricted by a conserved tyrosine residue, whereas access to this same position seems unrestricted in C4-oxidizing LPMO9s.

https://openalex.org/W1681378674,"We investigated whether and why the use of a foreign language influences moral judgment. We studied the trolley and footbridge dilemmas, which propose an action that involves killing one individual to save five. In line with prior work, the use of a foreign language increased the endorsement of such consequentialist actions for the footbridge dilemma, but not for the trolley dilemma. But contrary to recent theorizing, this effect was not driven by an attenuation of emotions. An attenuation of emotions was found in both dilemmas, and it did not mediate the foreign language effect on moral judgment. An examination of additional scenarios revealed that foreign language influenced moral judgment when the proposed action involved a social or moral norm violation. We propose that foreign language influences moral judgment by reducing access to normative knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W915184378,"IdeS is a streptococcal protease that cleaves IgG antibodies into F(ab’)2 and Fc fragments with a unique degree of specificity, thereby providing a novel treatment opportunity of IgG-driven autoimmune conditions and antibody mediated transplant rejection. Here we report the results from a first in man, double blinded and randomized study with single ascending doses of IdeS in healthy, male subjects. Twenty healthy subjects were given intravenous single ascending doses of IdeS. With impressive efficacy IdeS cleaved the entire plasma IgG-pool only minutes after dosing. IgG reached nadir 6-24 hours after dosing and then slowly recovered. The half-life of IdeS was 4.9 (±2.8) hours at 0.24 mg/kg with the main fraction eliminated during 24 hours. Already two hours after IdeS-dosing, the phagocytic capacity of IgG/IgG-fragments was reduced to background levels. Importantly, IdeS has the capacity to inactivate Fc-mediated effector function in vivo, was considered safe with no serious adverse events, and without dose limiting toxicity in this study. The complete, rapid, but temporary removal of IgG provides a new potent therapeutic opportunity in IgG-mediated pathogenic conditions.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01802697."
https://openalex.org/W2228762451,"Decidualization is an essential process of maternal endometrial stromal cells to support pregnancy. Although it is known that enhanced glucose influx is critical for decidualization, the underlying mechanism in regulating glucose metabolism in decidua remains insufficiently understood. Here, we demonstrate that aerobic glycolysis-related genes and factors are all substantially induced during decidualization, indicating the existence of Warburg-like glycolysis in decidua. In vitro, progesterone activates hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif1α) and c-Myc through Pi3k-Akt signaling pathway to maintain aerobic glycolysis in decidualizing cells. Knocking down of pyruvate kinase M2 (Pkm2) attenuates the induction of decidual marker gene. Decidual formation in vivo is also impaired by glycolysis inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate. Besides, lactate exporter monocarboxylate transporter 4 (Mct4) is induced in newly formed decidual cells, whereas lactate importer Mct1 and proliferation marker Ki-67 are complementarily located in the surrounding undifferentiated cells, which are supposed to consume lactate for proliferation. Hif1α activation is required for lactate-dependent proliferation of the undifferentiated cells. Inhibition of lactate flux leads to compromised decidualization and decelerated lactate-dependent proliferation. In summary, we reveal that Warburg-like glycolysis and local lactate shuttle are activated in decidua and play important roles for supporting early pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W915069682,"In Italy, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) strains are highly endemic and KPC producing CC258 is reported as the widely predominating clone. In Palermo, Italy, previous reports have confirmed this pattern. However, recent preliminary findings suggest that an epidemiological change is likely ongoing towards a polyclonal KPC-Kp spread. Here we present the results of molecular typing of 94 carbapenem non susceptible K. pneumoniae isolates detected during 2014 in the three different hospitals in Palermo, Italy.Ninety-four consecutive, non replicate carbapenem non susceptible isolates were identified in the three largest acute general hospitals in Palermo, Italy, in the six-month period March-August 2014. They were characterized by PCR for β-lactam, aminoglycoside and plasmid mediated fluoroquinolone resistance genetic determinants. The mgrB gene of the colistin resistant isolates was amplified and sequenced. Clonality was assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. Eight non-CC258 sequence types (STs) were identified accounting for 60% of isolates. In particular, ST307 and ST273 accounted for 29% and 18% of isolates. CC258 isolates were more frequently susceptible to gentamicin and non-CC258 isolates to amikacin. Colistin non susceptibility was found in 42% of isolates. Modifications of mgrB were found in 32 isolates.Concurrent clonal expansion of some STs and lateral transmission of genetic resistance determinants are likely producing a thorough change of the KPC-Kp epidemiology in Palermo, Italy. In our setting mgrB inactivation proved to substantially contribute to colistin resistance. Our findings suggest the need to continuously monitor the KPC-Kp epidemiology and to assess by a nationwide survey the possible shifting towards a polyclonal epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W1016679971,"During the past 20 years liver transplantation has become the definitive treatment for most severe types of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, in both children and adults. In the U.S., roughly 16,000 individuals are on the liver transplant waiting list. Only 38% of them will receive a transplant due to the organ shortage. This paper explores another option: bioengineering an autologous liver graft. We developed a 20-year model projecting future demand for liver transplants, along with costs based on current technology. We compared these cost projections against projected costs to bioengineer autologous liver grafts. The model was divided into: 1) the epidemiology model forecasting the number of wait-listed patients, operated patients and postoperative patients; and 2) the treatment model forecasting costs (pre-transplant-related costs; transplant (admission)-related costs; and 10-year post-transplant-related costs) during the simulation period. The patient population was categorized using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. The number of patients on the waiting list was projected to increase 23% over 20 years while the weighted average treatment costs in the pre-liver transplantation phase were forecast to increase 83% in Year 20. Projected demand for livers will increase 10% in 10 years and 23% in 20 years. Total costs of liver transplantation are forecast to increase 33% in 10 years and 81% in 20 years. By comparison, the projected cost to bioengineer autologous liver grafts is $9.7M based on current catalog prices for iPS-derived liver cells. The model projects a persistent increase in need and cost of donor livers over the next 20 years that’s constrained by a limited supply of donor livers. The number of patients who die while on the waiting list will reflect this ever-growing disparity. Currently, bioengineering autologous liver grafts is cost prohibitive. However, costs will decline rapidly with the introduction of new manufacturing strategies and economies of scale."
https://openalex.org/W2096421775,"Prolonged immobilization (IM) causes skeletal muscle atrophy characterized by mitochondrial deterioration and proteolysis. Muscle remobilization (RM) increases reactive oxygen species generation, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and oxidative stress, preventing muscle from quick recovery. Thus, we hypothesized that overexpression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) via in vivo transfection would promote mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defense, thus ameliorating the aforementioned deteriorations in a mouse model with 14-d IM followed by 5-d RM. PGC-1α transfection in tibialis anterior muscle resulted in a 7.2- and 4-fold increase in PGC-1α content in cytosol and nucleus, respectively. Mitochondrial biogenic (cytochrome c, mitochondrial transcription factor A), morphologic (mitochondrial density, mDNA/nDNA ratio), and functional (cytochrome c oxidase activity, ATP synthesis rate) markers, as well as fiber cross-sectional area, significantly increased in IM-RM muscle by PGC-1α overexpression. These effects were accompanied by an 18% decrease in H2O2, 30% decrease in nuclear factor-κB-DNA binding, and 25% reduction of IL-1β and-6 production in IM-RM muscle. There was a 34% increase in superoxide dismutase-2 activity, along with a 3.5-fold increase in NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3 expression caused by enhanced PGC-1α-estrogen-related receptor α binding. Our findings highlighted the importance of PGC-1α in protecting muscle from metabolic and redox disturbances caused by IM."
https://openalex.org/W2137408361,"Growing cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) in an agroforestry system generates a productive use of the land, preserves the best conditions for physical, chemical and biological properties of tropical soils, and plays an important role in improving cacao production and fertility of degraded tropical soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of two long term agroforestry systems of cacao management on soil physical and chemical properties in an area originally inhabited by 30 years old native secondary forest (SF). The two agroforestry systems adapted were: improved natural agroforestry system (INAS) where trees without economic value were selectively removed to provide 50% shade and improved traditional agroforestry system (ITAS) where all native trees were cut and burnt in the location. For evaluation of the changes of soil physical and chemical properties with time due to the imposed cacao management systems, plots of 10 cacao genotypes (ICS95, UF613, CCN51, ICT1112, ICT1026, ICT2162, ICT2171, ICT2142, H35, U30) and one plot with a spontaneous hybrid were selected. Soil samples were taken at 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm depths before the installation of the management systems (2004), and then followed at two years intervals. Bulk density, porosity, field capacity and wilting point varied significantly during the years of assessment in the different soil depths and under the systems assessed. Soil pH, CEC, exchangeable Mg and sum of the bases were higher in the INAS than the ITAS. In both systems, SOM, Ext. P, K and Fe, exch. K, Mg and Al+H decreased with years of cultivation; these changes were more evident in the 0-20 cm soil depth. Overall improvement of SOM and soil nutrient status was much higher in the ITAS than INAS. The levels of physical and chemical properties of soil under cacao genotypes showed a marked difference in both systems."
https://openalex.org/W858466272,"The global redistribution of biodiversity will intensify in the coming decades of climate change, making projections of species range shifts and of associated genetic losses important components of conservation planning. Highly-structured marine species, notably brown seaweeds, often harbor unique genetic variation at warmer low-latitude rear edges and thus are of particular concern. Here, a combination of Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) and molecular data is used to forecast the potential near-future impacts of climate change for a warm-temperate, canopy forming seaweed, Bifurcaria bifurcata. ENMs for B. bifurcata were developed using marine and terrestrial climatic variables, and its range projected for 2040-50 and 2090-2100 under two greenhouse emission scenarios. Geographical patterns of genetic diversity were assessed by screening 18 populations spawning the entire distribution for two organelle genes and 6 microsatellite markers. The southern limit of B. bifurcata was predicted to shift northwards to central Morocco by the mid-century. By 2090-2100, depending on the emission scenario, it could either retreat further north to western Iberia or be relocated back to Western Sahara. At the opposing margin, B. bifurcata was predicted to expand its range to Scotland or even Norway. Microsatellite diversity and endemism were highest in Morocco, where a unique and very restricted lineage was also identified. Our results imply that B. bifurcata will maintain a relatively broad latitudinal distribution. Although its persistence is not threatened, the predicted extirpation of a unique southern lineage or even the entire Moroccan diversity hotspot will erase a rich evolutionary legacy and shrink global diversity to current (low) European levels. NW Africa and similarly understudied southern regions should receive added attention if expected range changes and diversity loss of warm-temperate species is not to occur unnoticed."
https://openalex.org/W1822973471,"Self-entropy (SE) and transfer entropy (TE) are widely utilized in biomedical signal processing to assess the information stored into a system and transferred from a source to a destination respectively. The study proposes a more specific definition of the SE, namely the conditional SE (CSE), and a more flexible definition of the TE based on joint TE (JTE), namely the conditional JTE (CJTE), for the analysis of information dynamics in multivariate time series. In a protocol evoking a gradual sympathetic activation and vagal withdrawal proportional to the magnitude of the orthostatic stimulus, such as the graded head-up tilt, we extracted the beat-to-beat spontaneous variability of heart period (HP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and respiratory activity (R) in 19 healthy subjects and we computed SE of HP, CSE of HP given SAP and R, JTE from SAP and R to HP, CJTE from SAP and R to HP given SAP and CJTE from SAP and R to HP given R. CSE of HP given SAP and R was significantly smaller than SE of HP and increased progressively with the amplitude of the stimulus, thus suggesting that dynamics internal to HP and unrelated to SAP and R, possibly linked to sympathetic activation evoked by head-up tilt, might play a role during the orthostatic challenge. While JTE from SAP and R to HP was independent of tilt table angle, CJTE from SAP and R to HP given R and from SAP and R to HP given SAP showed opposite trends with tilt table inclination, thus suggesting that the importance of the cardiac baroreflex increases and the relevance of the cardiopulmonary pathway decreases during head-up tilt. The study demonstrates the high specificity of CSE and the high flexibility of CJTE over real data and proves that they are particularly helpful in disentangling physiological mechanisms and in assessing their different contributions to the overall cardiovascular regulation."

The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone indirectly and directly target MR. The presence and function of MR in skeletal muscle have not been explored. MR mRNA and protein are present in all tested skeletal muscles from both wild-type mice and DMD mouse models. MR expression is cell autonomous in both undifferentiated myoblasts and differentiated myotubes from mouse and human skeletal muscle cultures. To test for MR function in skeletal muscle, global gene expression analysis was conducted on human myotubes treated with MR agonist (aldosterone; EC50 1.3 nM) or antagonist (spironolactone; IC50 1.6 nM), and 53 gene expression differences were identified. Five differences were conserved in quadriceps muscles from dystrophic mice treated with spironolactone plus lisinopril (IC50 0.1 nM) compared with untreated controls. Genes down-regulated more than 2-fold by MR antagonism included FOS, ANKRD1, and GADD45B, with known roles in skeletal muscle, in addition to NPR3 and SERPINA3, bona fide targets of MR in other tissues. MR is a novel drug target in skeletal muscle and use of clinically safe antagonists may be beneficial for muscle diseases."

Frameshift and missense mutations in the fibulin-4 gene (EFEMP2/FBLN4) cause autosomal recessive cutis laxa (ARCL) 1B, characterized by loose skin, aortic aneurysm, arterial tortuosity, lung emphysema, and skeletal abnormalities. Homozygous missense mutations in FBLN4 are a prevalent cause of ARCL 1B. Here we generated a knock-in mouse strain bearing a recurrent fibulin-4 E57K homozygous missense mutation. The mutant mice survived into adulthood and displayed abnormalities in multiple organ systems, including loose skin, bent forelimb, aortic aneurysm, tortuous artery, and pulmonary emphysema. Biochemical studies of dermal fibroblasts showed that fibulin-4 E57K mutant protein was produced but was prone to dimer formation and inefficiently secreted, thereby triggering an endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Immunohistochemistry detected a low level of fibulin-4 E57K protein in the knock-in skin along with altered expression of selected elastic fiber components. Processing of a precursor to mature lysyl oxidase, an enzyme involved in cross-linking of elastin and collagen, was compromised. The knock-in skin had a reduced level of desmosine, an elastin-specific cross-link compound, and ultrastructurally abnormal elastic fibers. Surprisingly, structurally aberrant collagen fibrils and altered organization into fibers were characteristics of the knock-in dermis and forelimb tendons. Type I collagen extracted from the knock-in skin had decreased amounts of covalent intermolecular cross-links, which could contribute to the collagen fibril abnormalities.

https://openalex.org/W1548653035,"Introduction This study aimed to determine current levels of physical activity and sedentary behavior in middle school students on the basis of grade, sex, student attitudes toward physical education, and residence location. Methods In 2013, a cross-sectional study of 1793 students aged 12 to 15 years was conducted across eight middle schools in Beijing, China. Four schools were selected from an urban district and another four schools were from a suburban district. Physical activity and sedentary behavior data were collected using the commonly used school-based Chinese version of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Results The mean age of sampled students was 13.3±1.0 years; 51.5% were boys. Approximately 76.6% of students reported having three 45-minute physical education classes every week. A total of 35.6% students spent ≥1 h/day performing moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during school, and 34.9% spent ≥1 h/day in MVPA outside school time. Approximately half (49.7%) of the students engaged in reading, writing, or drawing for ≥2 h/day, and 42.9% reported screen time for ≥2 h/day. Although boys spent more time engaged in physical activity than girls did, they also spent more time exhibiting sedentary behavior. Each 10-unit increase in attitudes toward physical education was associated with an increased odds of 1.15 (95%CI: 1.09–1.20) for spending more than 1 h/day on MVPA. Students in suburban schools reported engaging in physical activity less when compared with those in urban schools. Conclusion The majority of our students did not meet the current physical activity recommendations, and about half of the students spent excessive time engaging in sedentary behaviors. Findings from this study highlight a positive association between student attitudes toward physical education and physical activity. Studies are needed to further explore the role of student attitudes toward physical education in promoting physical activity among Chinese students."
https://openalex.org/W1512224750,"Tissue remodeling is a characteristic of many solid tumor malignancies including melanoma. By virtue of tumor lymphatic transport, remodeling pathways active within the local tumor microenvironment have the potential to be operational within lymph nodes (LNs) draining the tumor interstitium. Here, we show that lymphatic drainage from murine B16 melanomas in syngeneic, immune-competent C57Bl/6 mice is associated with LN enlargement as well as nonuniform increases in bulk tissue elasticity and viscoelasticity, as measured by the response of whole LNs to compression. These remodeling responses, which quickly manifest in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) after tumor inoculation and before apparent metastasis, were accompanied by changes in matrix composition, including up to 3-fold increases in the abundance of soluble collagen and hyaluronic acid. Intranodal pressures were also significantly increased in TDLNs (+1 cmH2O) relative to both non-tumor-draining LNs (-1 cmH2O) and LNs from naive animals (-1 to 2 cmH2O). These data suggest that the reorganization of matrix structure, composition, and fluid microenvironment within LNs associated with tumor lymphatic drainage parallels remodeling seen in primary malignancies and has the potential to regulate the adhesion, proliferation, and signaling function of LN-resident cells involved in directing melanoma disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W1959797863,"SLC30A8 encodes a zinc transporter ZnT8 largely restricted to pancreatic islet β- and α-cells, and responsible for zinc accumulation into secretory granules. Although common SLC30A8 variants, believed to reduce ZnT8 activity, increase type 2 diabetes risk in humans, rare inactivating mutations are protective. To investigate the role of Slc30a8 in the control of glucagon secretion, Slc30a8 was inactivated selectively in α-cells by crossing mice with alleles floxed at exon 1 to animals expressing Cre recombinase under the pre-proglucagon promoter. Further crossing to Rosa26:tdRFP mice, and sorting of RFP(+): glucagon(+) cells from KO mice, revealed recombination in ∼ 30% of α-cells, of which ∼ 50% were ZnT8-negative (14 ± 1.8% of all α-cells). Although glucose and insulin tolerance were normal, female αZnT8KO mice required lower glucose infusion rates during hypoglycemic clamps and displayed enhanced glucagon release (p < 0.001) versus WT mice. Correspondingly, islets isolated from αZnT8KO mice secreted more glucagon at 1 mm glucose, but not 17 mm glucose, than WT controls (n = 5; p = 0.008). Although the expression of other ZnT family members was unchanged, cytoplasmic (n = 4 mice per genotype; p < 0.0001) and granular (n = 3, p < 0.01) free Zn(2+) levels were significantly lower in KO α-cells versus control cells. In response to low glucose, the amplitude and frequency of intracellular Ca(2+) increases were unchanged in α-cells of αZnT8KO KO mice. ZnT8 is thus important in a subset of α-cells for normal responses to hypoglycemia and acts via Ca(2+)-independent mechanisms."

With the emergence of drug resistance against the current formulations, there is a need to focus on the alternative approaches in order to control this menace. In the present study, biocompatible zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were used to see their in vitro effect on the biliary amphistomes, Gigantocotyle explanatum, infecting Bubalus bubalis because these nanoparticles are involved in generation of free radicals that induce oxidative stress, resulting in disruption of cellular machinery. The ZnO NPs were synthesized by using egg albumin as a biotemplate and subsequently characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Diffraction and Spectrophotometrical, which showed that ZnO NPs were highly purified wurtzite type polycrystals, with a mean size of 16.7 nm. When the parasites were treated with lower concentrations (0.004% and 0.008%) of the ZnO NPs, the worms mounted a protective response by stimulating the antioxidant system but the treatment of G. explanatum with 0.012% ZnO NPs produced significant inhibition of the antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p< 0.05) and glutathione S- transferase (GST) (p<0.01), while the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), a lipid peroxidation marker, was significantly (p< 0.01) elevated. SEM and histopathology revealed pronounced tegumental damage showing the disruption of surface papillae and the annulations, particularly in the posterior region near acetabulum. The under expression of a number of polypeptides, loss of worm motility in a time dependent manner, further reflect strong anthelmintic potential of ZnO NPs. It can be concluded that the anthelmintic effect might be due to the production of reactive oxygen species that target a variety of macromolecules such as nucleic acid, protein and lipids which are involved in different cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W1907678862,"Keratins are cytoskeletal proteins that hierarchically arrange into filaments, starting with the dimer sub-unit. They are integral to the structural support of cells, in skin, hair and nails. In skin, keratin is thought to play a critical role in conferring the barrier properties and elasticity of skin. In general, the keratin dimer is broadly described by a tri-domain structure: a head, a central rod and a tail. As yet, no atomistic-scale picture of the entire dimer structure exists; this information is pivotal for establishing molecular-level connections between structure and function in intermediate filament proteins. The roles of the head and tail domains in facilitating keratin filament assembly and function remain as open questions. To address these, we report results of molecular dynamics simulations of the entire epithelial human K1/K10 keratin dimer. Our findings comprise: (1) the first three-dimensional structural models of the complete dimer unit, comprising of the head, rod and tail domains; (2) new insights into the chirality of the rod-domain twist gained from analysis of the full domain structure; (3) evidence for tri-subdomain partitioning in the head and tail domains; and, (4) identification of the residue characteristics that mediate non-covalent contact between the chains in the dimer. Our findings are immediately applicable to other epithelial keratins, such as K8/K18 and K5/K14, and to intermediate filament proteins in general."

A positive association signal was followed up in a tagging approach and tested in an independent Finnish cohort of 205 cases, in a British cohort of 1269 trios, as well as in two cohorts from the United States (US); one with 403 families and the other with 100 cases and 104 controls. Results In the initial Finnish cohort, the SNP rs5030717 in the TLR4 gene region showed significant association (OR 1.33, P = .003) to OM. Tagging SNP analysis of the gene found rs1329060 (OR 1.33, P = .002) and rs1329057 (OR 1.29, P = .003) also to be associated. In the more severe phenotype the association was stronger. This finding was supported by an independent Finnish case cohort, but the associations failed to replicate in the British and US cohorts. In studies on TLR4 signaling in 20 study subjects, the three-marker risk haplotype correlated with a decreased TNFα secretion in myeloid dendritic cells. Conclusions The TLR4 gene locus, regulating the innate immune response, influences the genetic predisposition to childhood OM in a subpopulation of patients. Environmental factors likely modulate the genetic components contributing to the risk of OM."

In this work, we found that MPO and EPO poorly cross-link collagen IV, even when experimentally deposited into basement membrane. We therefore hypothesized that the LRR, Ig, and vWFC domains found in peroxidasin, but not in related animal heme peroxidases, uniquely allow peroxidasin to form sulfilimine bonds in collagen IV. Indeed, the catalytic and Ig domains are required for cross-linking activity, which distinguishes peroxidasin from other animal heme peroxidases. Full-length peroxidasin open reading frame (ORF) cloned in the pCDNA-V5-His-TOPO vector (kindly provided by Dr. Miklos Geiszt, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary) was used as the starting construct. The construct lacking the C-terminal vWFC domain (−vWFC) was created by PCR amplification of the ORF at the N terminus and a point between the catalytic and vWFC domains using flanking KpnI and NotI sites. The forward primer was 5′-GGGTGTCCGAGCGAATTCCGCTGCCTGTGC-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-CATTGCGGCCGCAGGTCCTACAGTCTTCACAGCAGT-3′. Using PCR-based mutagenesis as previously described (14Bhave G.

Deletion constructs were then created with EcoRI digestion, removal of the intervening fragment, and re-ligation to produce the construct. A 2-residue Gly-Ser insertion at the junction occurred as an expected byproduct.

The PFHR-9 cells were then removed using two detergent extractions at room temperature for 5–10 min with hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, + 0.1 mm CaCl2 + 0.1% bovine serum albumin) + 1% Triton X-100. Cellular debris was further cleared with two washes with hypotonic buffer + 0.1% sodium deoxycholate. To remove endogenous peroxidasin, the matrix was extracted with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride + 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, for 15 min at room temperature and then washed extensively with 1× PBS. These PFHR-9 matrix plates were either stored under sterile conditions at −80 °C or used immediately thereafter. HEK293T cells were plated onto PFHR-9 matrix and transfected with the cDNAs of interest using Lipofectamine LTX per the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). The cells were then incubated for 48 h in the presence of 5 μm hematin and 5 mm sodium butyrate to maximize functional peroxidase. After incubation, the culture media was collected and extracellular matrix isolated for analysis. To isolate extracellular matrix (ECM), the cells and underlying ECM were scraped into deoxycholate buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA-Na) including protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml of pepstatin) and sonicated to eliminate viscosity. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min and the resulting supernatant was designated as the cell lysate and the insoluble pellet was further processed to isolate ECM. The pellet was resuspended in high salt buffer (1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mm PMSF) with sonication and extracted for 10–15 min at 4 °C. The insoluble material was again collected with centrifugation and rinsed briefly with low salt buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5). After repeat centrifugation, the resulting pellet was operationally defined as ECM or basement membrane. To delineate sulfilimine cross-link content of the collagen IV network, the ECM was sonicated in collagenase buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 25 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 50 μm phloroglucinol) and digested with collagenase (50 μg/ml; CLSPA grade, Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) overnight at 37 °C. The digested material was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant with solubilized NC1 hexamer was collected. This material underwent SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining to visualize and quantify sulfilimine cross-linked dimeric and non-cross-linked monomeric subunits. The average number of cross-links per hexamer was determined using the density of the single (D1) and double cross-linked (D2) and non-cross-linked (M) subunit bands.Cross-links per hexamer = (6×fraction D2) +( 3 × fraction D1)(Eq. 1) In parallel experiments, the isolated ECM underwent immunoblotting to determine the presence of MPO, EPO, and PXDN. In this case, the ECM was sonicated into SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and heated at 80 °C for 15 min. The sample was then centrifuged (20,000 × g for 10 min) and the supernatant underwent immunoblot analysis (see below). In a subset of experiments (Fig. 3), the ECM first underwent collagenase digestion and then soluble and insoluble fractions were isolated by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min). These fractions were then solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with DTT and underwent immunoblotting for MPO, EPO, PXDN, and collagen IV. Culture media was harvested to determine whether transfected peroxidases could be detected by immunoblotting and peroxidase activity. After addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 50 mm DTT, media samples directly underwent immunoblotting. For measuring peroxidase activity, media was first precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate. Precipitated protein was solubilized in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and protease inhibitors) at 1/10th the original media volume. 25 μl of the solubilized precipitate was combined with 250 μl of developing buffer (0.4 m sodium acetate, pH 5.4, 0.1% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 2 mm tetramethylbenzidine, and 50 μm H2O2) and A650 was measured as an indicator of peroxidase-mediated oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine. Western blotting was conducted using standard techniques including 5% nonfat milk plus 0.05% Tween 20 for blocking nonspecific antibody binding. The following primary antibodies and dilutions were utilized. 1) Anti-human PXDN rabbit polyclonal antibody developed against peptide sequence of IREKLKRLYGSTLNI in our laboratory at 1:1000. 2) Anti-human/mouse MPO mouse monoclonal (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 1:1000. 3) Anti-EPO rabbit polyclonal (Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, CA) at 1:1000. 4) Anti-actin goat polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) at 1:200. 5) Anti-collagen IV α2 chain (H22 rat monoclonal; Chondrex, Inc., Redmond, WA) at 1:1000. Bound primary antibody was detected using species-specific, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection per the manufacturer's instructions (SuperSignalTM West Pico Substrate, Life Technologies). We had previously demonstrated that peroxidasin, but not MPO, cross-links the insoluble collagen IV network using an overlay method wherein transfected cells are plated on uncross-linked collagen IV (4Bhave G.

After this initial work, we discovered the central role of Br− in peroxidasin function (6McCall A.S. Cummings C.F. Bhave G. Vanacore R. Page-McCaw A. Hudson B.G. Bromine is an essential trace element for assembly of collagen IV scaffolds in tissue development and architecture.Cell. 2014; 157: 1380-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Because MPO forms both HOCl and HOBr and peroxidasin generates HOBr, the inability of MPO to form sulfilimine cross-links may simply reflect inefficient HOBr production (4Bhave G. Cummings C.F. Vanacore R.M. Kumagai-Cresse C. Ero-Tolliver I.A. Rafi M. Kang J.S. Pedchenko V. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Hudson B.G.

Chemistry and biology of human peroxidases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 445: 197-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility, we tested the ability of EPO, known to predominantly form HOBr (4Bhave G. Cummings C.F. Vanacore R.M. Kumagai-Cresse C. Ero-Tolliver I.A. Rafi M. Kang J.S. Pedchenko V. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Hudson B.G. Peroxidasin forms sulfilimine chemical bonds using hypohalous acids in tissue genesis.Nat. Chem.

Brominating oxidants generated by human eosinophils.Science. 1986; 234: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), to cross-link collagen IV. Although EPO formed sulfilimine bonds marginally better than mock control and MPO, EPO was far inferior to peroxidasin suggesting that HOBr production alone is not the pivotal feature that distinguishes PXDN from MPO and EPO (Fig. 1, b–d). Because halide oxidation preference (Br− versus Cl−) did not account for peroxidasin-mediated sulfilimine bond formation, we hypothesized that peroxidasin incorporates into extracellular matrix to produce HOBr near its collagen IV substrate, whereas MPO and EPO remain as soluble secreted proteins, whose hypohalous acid products are quenched by side reactions with other proteins before reaching their collagen IV target (15Weiss S.J. Tissue destruction by neutrophils.N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3852) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we used immunoblotting to determine whether peroxidasin, MPO, and EPO were present in the detergent and high-salt insoluble extracellular matrix fraction after overlay with transfected cells. Peroxidasin, MPO, and EPO all associated with extracellular matrix (Fig. 2, a–c). The absence of actin immunoreactivity ruled against the possibility of intracellular contamination as a cause for the association of peroxidasin, MPO, and EPO with extracellular matrix (Fig. 2d). Thus, MPO and EPO fail to cross-link collagen IV even when these peroxidases artificially associate with basement membrane in the overlay assay. These data suggest that extracellular matrix association and HOBr production per se are insufficient to cross-link collagen IV. An alternative possibility is that peroxidasin uniquely binds to collagen IV, whereas MPO and EPO associate with other basement membrane components. But, solid phase and solution binding assays did not demonstrate an interaction between peroxidasin, MPO, or EPO with collagen IV using peroxidase concentrations up to 1 μm (data not shown). To verify this unexpected finding, we hypothesized that if peroxidasin is tightly bound to collagen IV in the insoluble extracellular matrix, then destruction of the collagen IV network with collagenase should solubilize peroxidasin. However, after collagenase treatment, peroxidasin remained insoluble (Fig. 3a), as did MPO and EPO (Fig. 3, c and d). As expected, collagenase treatment successfully solubilized the NC1 domain of the collagen IV network, the relevant site for peroxidasin action (Fig. 3b). Thus, we conclude that peroxidasin does not form a stable complex with the collagen IV network near the NC1 domain. A distinctive feature of peroxidasin is the combination of protein-protein interaction domains, specifically LRR, Ig, and vWFC, along with a catalytic peroxidase domain (7Nelson R.E. Fessler L.I. Takagi Y. Blumberg B. Keene D.R. Olson P.F. Parker C.G. Fessler J.H. Peroxidasin: a novel enzyme-matrix protein of Drosophila development.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3438-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that one or more non-catalytic domains of peroxidasin would be required to efficiently form sulfilimine bonds. To test the requirement of the non-catalytic, protein-protein interaction domains of peroxidasin for sulfilimine bond formation, we created several domain deletion constructs (Fig. 4a) and examined their ability to cross-link basement membrane collagen IV in the overlay assay. Except for the construct lacking Ig domains (−Ig), all of the mutant peroxidasin deletion variants exhibited expression and colorimetric peroxidase activity in the culture media (Fig. 4, b and c). As suggested by the general association of peroxidases with extracellular matrix, all of the constructs, including −Ig, demonstrated basement membrane incorporation, because they were designed to include the peroxidase domain (Fig. 4c). The peroxidase domain of peroxidasin alone appeared to support collagen IV cross-linking although significantly less than full-length peroxidasin. When the Ig domains were added to the peroxidase domain, sulfilimine bond forming activity was completely restored to the level observed with full-length peroxidasin. Any construct that contained both peroxidase and Ig domains exhibited normal collagen IV cross-linking activity. Similarly, the construct lacking the Ig domain (−Ig) failed to form sulfilimine cross-links, although proper folding and function were uncertain, because the protein was not found in culture media to measure colorimetric peroxidase activity (Fig. 4d). Taken together, these data suggest that the Ig domain is required to recapitulate physiologic sulfilimine bond formation. We hypothesized that peroxidasin may behave similarly to other proteins with multiple Ig domains where the N-terminal domain is most involved in interactions with other proteins (16Brondijk T.H. de Ruiter T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10125-10134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, we focused our attention on the N-terminal Ig domain of peroxidasin and decided to create progressive deletions from the N-terminal end of the peroxidase-Ig construct (Pxd-Ig; Fig. 4a). The first construct lacking 7 N-terminal amino acids (VATITPE) of Pxd-Ig (Pxd-Ig-7 aa) was completely unable to form sulfilimine cross-links in collagen IV despite adequate peroxidase activity and basement membrane incorporation (Fig. 5). Thus, a relatively small N-terminal portion of the Ig domains is critical for sulfilimine bond formation. Prior to this work, we assumed that the unique ability of PXDN to cross-link collagen IV may reflect selective HOBr production along with universal expression, paralleling collagen IV, within and among animals. Our assumption predicted that any cell secreting a HOBr producing peroxidase, such as EPO, would cross-link an underlying collagen IV network. However, EPO failed to efficiently cross-link collagen IV even when our experimental paradigm successfully created a non-physiologic association between EPO and basement membrane. These data led us to hypothesize that the non-catalytic domains of peroxidasin are required for cross-link formation. Using deletion constructs, we demonstrated that both the catalytic and N-terminal Ig domain of peroxidasin are essential to form sulfilimine cross-links, evolutionarily conserved post-translational modifications in collagen IV. We have previously demonstrated that peroxidasin is conserved throughout the animal kingdom (1Fidler A.L. Vanacore R.M. Chetyrkin S.V. Pedchenko V.K. Bhave G. Yin V.P. Stothers C.L. Rose K.L.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Domain analysis of peroxidasin cDNA sequences from ancient animals, such as Cnidaria, revealed that the minimal structure of peroxidasin includes only 2 of 4 Ig domains consistent with this work, which found a requirement limited to a short, N-terminal portion of these domains in human peroxidasin (Fig. 6a). Taken together, evolutionary conservation, widespread expression in tissues, and the Ig domains of peroxidasin allow for it to form sulfilimine cross-links in collagen IV with no apparent redundancy with other animal heme peroxidases. The Ig domain superfamily is widely found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Bacterial Ig domains are often in enzymatically active proteins, whereas animal Ig domains are typically found as cell surface adhesion receptors primarily involved in immune and nervous system development and function (20Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. The immunoglobulin fold. Structural classification, sequence patterns and common core.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar, 21Smith D.K. Xue H. Sequence profiles of immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin-like domains.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 530-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Ig domains are categorized into 4 sets based on structural similarity to the analogous antibody domains: constant (C1 and C2 sets), variable (V set), and intermediate (I-set) (21Smith D.K. Xue H. Sequence profiles of immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin-like domains.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 530-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Ig domains of peroxidasin are classified within the I-set, consistent with the hypothesis that the I-set is the primordial Ig domain of the animal kingdom (21Smith D.K. Xue H. Sequence profiles of immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin-like domains.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 530-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Buljan M. Bateman A. The evolution of protein domain families.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Akin to bacterial Ig domain proteins, peroxidasin is the only known animal protein to combine an Ig domain with a catalytic domain, suggesting a functionally intermediate position for peroxidasin between bacterial and animal Ig domain superfamily proteins. We initially considered a simple model wherein peroxidasin interacts with collagen IV via its N-terminal Ig domain to produce HOBr in close spatial proximity to its substrate, the sulfilimine cross-linked residues of the collagen IV NC1 hexamer. However, we found evidence against a stable association directly between peroxidasin and collagen IV although we cannot rule out a transient interaction. Thus, we hypothesize that peroxidasin associates with another basement membrane component to possibly form a ternary complex with collagen IV to facilitate HOBr delivery to the NC1 substrate. Presumably the N-terminal Ig domain modifies the spatial orientation of this complex to facilitate sulfilimine bond formation (Fig. 6b). The model implies that HOBr may diffuse a short distance before encountering its collagen IV substrate rather than being delivered directly without free diffusion. Indeed, recent work based on homology between peroxidasin and MPO suggests that the heme cavity of peroxidasin may not be large enough to accommodate collagen IV for direct HOBr delivery. The authors of this work hypothesize that a relatively short diffusion distance and inefficient bromide oxidation allows for sulfilimine bond formation with minimal collateral oxidative damage (23Soudi M.

The collagen IV sulfilimine cross-link and peroxidasin are critical for the integrity and tissue development of basement membranes. Based on this work, we envision a mechanism involving a ternary complex between peroxidasin, another basement membrane component, and collagen IV with peroxidasin generating diffusible HOBr to catalyze sulfilimine bond formation. In this model, the N-terminal Ig domain of peroxidasin is critical for the efficient delivery of HOBr to its collagen IV substrate. I. A. E.-T. conducted and analyzed the experiments. B. G. H. and G.

https://openalex.org/W1568776786,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and new approaches for both diagnosis and treatment are required. Autoantibodies directed against apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) represent promising biomarkers for use in risk stratification of CVD and may also play a direct role in pathogenesis.To characterize the anti-ApoA-I autoantibody response, we measured the immunoreactivity to engineered peptides corresponding to the different alpha-helical regions of ApoA-I, using plasma from acute chest pain cohort patients known to be positive for anti-ApoA-I autoantibodies.Our results indicate that the anti-ApoA-I autoantibody response is strongly biased towards the C-terminal alpha-helix of the protein, with an optimized mimetic peptide corresponding to this part of the protein recapitulating the diagnostic accuracy for an acute ischemic coronary etiology (non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina) obtainable using intact endogenous ApoA-I in immunoassay. Furthermore, the optimized mimetic peptide strongly inhibits the pathology-associated capacity of anti-ApoA-I antibodies to elicit proinflammatory cytokine release from cultured human macrophages.In addition to providing a rationale for the development of new approaches for the diagnosis and therapy of CVD, our observations may contribute to the elucidation of how anti-ApoA-I autoantibodies are elicited in individuals without autoimmune disease."

CSE of the dominant primary motor cortex (M1) of right first dorsal interosseous muscle was assessed by motor evoked potentials, before, immediately, 10, 20 and 30 minutes after application of five experimental conditions: 1) anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS), 2) a-tPCS with 125 ms pulse duartion (a-tPCSPD = 125), 3) a-tPCS with 250 ms pulse duration (a-tPCSPD = 250), 4) a-tPCS with 500 ms pulse duration (a-tPCSPD = 500) and 5) sham a-tPCS. The total charges were kept constant in all experimental conditions except sham condition. Post-hoc comparisons indicated that a-tPCSPD = 500 produced larger CSE compared to a-tPCSPD = 125 (P<0.0001), a-tPCSPD = 250 (P = 0.009) and a-tDCS (P = 0.008). Also, there was no significant difference between a-tPCSPD = 250 and a-tDCS on CSE changes (P>0.05). All conditions except a-tPCSPD = 125 showed a significant difference to the sham group (P<0.006). All participants tolerated the applied currents. It could be concluded that a-tPCS with a PD of 500ms induces largest CSE changes, however further studies are required to identify optimal values."
https://openalex.org/W2405284913,"Previously, we demonstrated that when mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from mouse ES cells were transplanted into skeletal muscle, more than 60% of them differentiated into muscles in the crush-injured tibialis anterior muscle in vivo, although MSCs neither differentiated nor settled in the intact muscle. Microenvironments, including the extracellular matrix between the injured and intact muscle, were quite different. In the injured muscle, hyaluronan (HA), heavy chains of inter-α-inhibitor (IαI), CD44, and TNF-α-stimulated gene 6 product (TSG-6) increased 24–48 h after injury, although basement membrane components of differentiated muscle such as perlecan, laminin, and type IV collagen increased gradually 4 days after the crush. We then investigated the microenvironments crucial for cell transplantation, using the lysate of C2C12 myotubules for mimicking injured circumstances in vivo. MSCs settled in the intact muscle when they were transplanted together with the C2C12 lysate or TSG6. MSCs produced and released TSG6 when they were cultured with C2C12 lysates in vitro. MSCs pretreated with the lysate also settled in the intact muscle. Furthermore, MSCs whose TSG6 was knocked down by shRNA, even if transplanted or pretreated with the lysate, could not settle in the muscle. Immunofluorescent staining showed that HA and IαI always co-localized or were distributed closely, suggesting formation of covalent complexes, i.e. the SHAP-HA complex in the presence of TSG6. Thus, TSG6, HA, and IαI were crucial factors for the settlement and probably the subsequent differentiation of MSCs."

Acoustic detection was based on a novel approach where DNA amplicons were monitored and discriminated based on their length rather than mass. Experiments were performed during real time monitoring of analyte binding and in a direct manner, i.e. without the use of labels for enhancing signal transduction. The proposed protocol improves time processing by circumventing gel electrophoresis and can be incorporated as a routine detection method in a diagnostic lab or an automated lab-on-a-chip system for plant pathogen diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W923891776,"Laying performance is an important economical trait of goose production. As laying performance is of low heritability, it is of significance to develop a marker-assisted selection (MAS) strategy for this trait. Definition of sequence variation related to the target trait is a prerequisite of quantitating MAS, but little is presently known about the goose genome, which greatly hinders the identification of genetic markers for the laying traits of geese. Recently developed restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a possible approach for discerning large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and reducing the complexity of a genome without having reference genomic information available. In the present study, we developed a pooled RAD sequencing strategy for detecting geese laying-related SNP. Two DNA pools were constructed, each consisting of equal amounts of genomic DNA from 10 individuals with either high estimated breeding value (HEBV) or low estimated breeding value (LEBV). A total of 139,013 SNP were obtained from 42,291,356 sequences, of which 18,771,943 were for LEBV and 23,519,413 were for HEBV cohorts. Fifty-five SNP which had different allelic frequencies in the two DNA pools were further validated by individual-based AS-PCR genotyping in the LEBV and HEBV cohorts. Ten out of 55 SNP exhibited distinct allele distributions in these two cohorts. These 10 SNP were further genotyped in a goose population of 492 geese to verify the association with egg numbers. The result showed that 8 of 10 SNP were associated with egg numbers. Additionally, liner regression analysis revealed that SNP Record-111407, 106975 and 112359 were involved in a multiplegene network affecting laying performance. We used IPCR to extend the unknown regions flanking the candidate RAD tags. The obtained sequences were subjected to BLAST to retrieve the orthologous genes in either ducks or chickens. Five novel genes were cloned for geese which harbored the candidate laying-related SNP, including membrane associated guanylate kinase (MAGI-1), KIAA1462, Rho GTPase activating protein 21 (ARHGAP21), acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2 (ACSF2), astrotactin 2 (ASTN2). Collectively, our data suggests that 8 SNP and 5 genes might be promising candidate markers or targets for marker-assisted selection of egg numbers in geese."
https://openalex.org/W1557652940,"Estimating and projecting population trends using population viability analysis (PVA) are central to identifying species at risk of extinction and for informing conservation management strategies. Models for PVA generally fall within two categories, scalar (count-based) or matrix (demographic). Model structure, process error, measurement error, and time series length all have known impacts in population risk assessments, but their combined impact has not been thoroughly investigated. We tested the ability of scalar and matrix PVA models to predict percent decline over a ten-year interval, selected to coincide with the IUCN Red List criterion A.3, using data simulated for a hypothetical, short-lived organism with a simple life-history and for a threatened snail, Tasmaphena lamproides. PVA performance was assessed across different time series lengths, population growth rates, and levels of process and measurement error. We found that the magnitude of effects of measurement error, process error, and time series length, and interactions between these, depended on context. We found that high process and measurement error reduced the reliability of both models in predicted percent decline. Both sources of error contributed strongly to biased predictions, with process error tending to contribute to the spread of predictions more than measurement error. Increasing time series length improved precision and reduced bias of predicted population trends, but gains substantially diminished for time series lengths greater than 10-15 years. The simple parameterization scheme we employed contributed strongly to bias in matrix model predictions when both process and measurement error were high, causing scalar models to exhibit similar or greater precision and lower bias than matrix models. Our study provides evidence that, for short-lived species with structured but simple life histories, short time series and simple models can be sufficient for reasonably reliable conservation decision-making, and may be preferable for population projections when unbiased estimates of vital rates cannot be obtained."

In this report, we show how to build such an instrument in order to record 77K fluorescence spectra. This instrument consists of a low power monochromatic light-emitting diode (LED), and a portable CCD array based spectrometer. The optical components are coupled together using a fiber optic cable, and a custom made housing that also supports a dewar flask.

https://openalex.org/W929694515,"The importance of olfaction for various avian behaviors has become increasingly evident. So far, the use of olfaction for food detection among raptors has only been demonstrated for Cathartes vultures. The Oriental honey buzzard (Pernis orientalis) is a resident and migrant in Taiwan and regularly forages in apiaries. One of its foods in apiaries is yellow pollen dough, a softball-sized mixture of pollen, soybeans, and sugar that beekeepers provide as a supplementary food for bees. Given that pollen dough is not similar to any naturally occurring food, we hypothesized that buzzards identify the dough's nutritious contents using olfaction, perhaps in combination with vision. Using a series of choice experiments in which individuals could choose between two doughs, we showed that (1) buzzards almost unerringly chose pollen-containing over pollen lacking doughs when otherwise the doughs were identical in size, shape, and yellow color; (2) buzzards always preferred yellow over black or green doughs if both doughs contained pollen; (3) buzzards still preferred pollen-containing over pollen-lacking doughs when both doughs were black, but at a lower rate than in (1). We statistically excluded the possible influences of the doughs' relative brightness or of repeat visits by the same individuals. Our experiments thus suggest the use of a 'multi-modal foraging strategy' among buzzards whereby olfaction and vision are likely to be both used in identifying food at close distances. We also estimated the olfactory receptor gene repertoire size in the buzzard's genome which is almost five times as large as that of three other raptor species. Therefore, olfaction is likely of far greater ecological importance to this species than to other raptor species. We suggest that olfaction should be considered in the design of behavioral and genetic studies to better understand the use of multiple senses in avian behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1550076706,"Dehydration-Responsive Element Binding proteins (DREB)/C-repeat (CRT) Binding Factors (CBF) have been identified as transcriptional activators during plant responses to cold stress. The objective of this study was to determine the physiological roles of a CBF gene isolated from a cold-tolerant perennial grass species, Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), which designated as PpCBF3, in regulating plant tolerance to freezing stress. Transient transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll protoplast with PpCBF3-eGFP fused protein showed that PpCBF3 was localized to the nucleus. RT-PCR analysis showed that PpCBF3 was specifically induced by cold stress (4°C) but not by drought stress [induced by 20% polyethylene glycol 6000 solution (PEG-6000)] or salt stress (150 mM NaCl). Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing PpCBF3 showed significant improvement in freezing (-20°C) tolerance demonstrated by a lower percentage of chlorotic leaves, lower cellular electrolyte leakage (EL) and H2O2 and O2.- content, and higher chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency compared to the wild type. Relative mRNA expression level analysis by qRT-PCR indicated that the improved freezing tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing PpCBF3 was conferred by sustained activation of downstream cold responsive (COR) genes. Other interesting phenotypic changes in the PpCBF3-transgenic Arabidopsis plants included late flowering and slow growth or 'dwarfism', both of which are desirable phenotypic traits for perennial turfgrasses. Therefore, PpCBF3 has potential to be used in genetic engineering for improvement of turfgrass freezing tolerance and other desirable traits."
https://openalex.org/W1618435743,"Tibet makes up the majority of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, often referred to as the roof of the world. Its complex landforms, physiognomy, and climate create a special heterogeneous environment for mosses. Each moss species inhabits its own habitat and ecological niche. This, in combination with its sensitivity to environmental change, makes moss species distribution a useful indicator of vegetation alteration and climate change. This study aimed to characterize the diversity and distribution of Didymodon (Pottiaceae) in Tibet, and model the potential distribution of its species. A total of 221 sample plots, each with a size of 10 × 10 m and located at different altitudes, were investigated across all vegetation types. Of these, the 181 plots in which Didymodon species were found were used to conduct analyses and modeling. Three noteworthy results were obtained. First, a total of 22 species of Didymodon were identified. Among these, Didymodon rigidulus var. subulatus had not previously been recorded in China, and Didymodon constrictus var. constrictus was the dominant species. Second, analysis of the relationships between species distributions and environmental factors using canonical correspondence analysis revealed that vegetation cover and altitude were the main factors affecting the distribution of Didymodon in Tibet. Third, based on the environmental factors of bioclimate, topography and vegetation, the distribution of Didymodon was predicted throughout Tibet at a spatial resolution of 1 km, using the presence-only MaxEnt model. Climatic variables were the key factors in the model. We conclude that the environment plays a significant role in moss diversity and distribution. Based on our research findings, we recommend that future studies should focus on the impacts of climate change on the distribution and conservation of Didymodon."
https://openalex.org/W1461880338,"Recovery of thymopoiesis is critical for immune reconstitution after HSCT. IL-7 and SCF are two major thymotropic cytokines. We investigated whether the kinetics of circulating levels of these cytokines might provide insight into the prolonged immunodeficiency after double umbilical cord blood transplantation (dUCBT) in adults. We examined plasma levels of IL-7 and SCF, T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circle (TREC) levels and T cell subsets in 60 adult patients undergoing dUCBT. Median levels of IL-7 increased by more than 3-fold at 4 weeks and remained elevated through 100 days after dUCBT. SCF showed a less than 2-fold increase and more protracted elevation than IL-7. IL-7 levels inversely correlated with the reconstitution of various T cell subsets but not with TRECs. SCF levels inversely correlated with reconstitution of CD4+T cells, especially the naïve CD4+CD45RA+ subset, and with TRECs suggesting that SCF but not IL-7 had an effect on thymic regeneration. In Cox models, elevated levels of IL-7 and SCF were associated with higher non-relapse mortality (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01) and worse overall survival (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001). Elevated IL-7 but not SCF was also associated with development of GvHD (p = 0.03). Thus, IL-7 and SCF are elevated for a prolonged period after dUCBT and persistently high levels of these cytokines may correlate with worse clinical outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W1447946853,"Echolocation and audiovocal communication have been studied extensively in bats. The manner in which these abilities are incorporated within escape behaviors during life-threatening distress is largely unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that behavioral response profiles expressed during distress are relatively stereotypic given their evolutionary adaptations to avoid predators. We subjected juvenile and adult big-footed myotis (Myotis macrodactylus) to a sequence of three types of life threatening distress: 1) trapping them in a mist-net (environmental threat), 2) approaching them when trapped (predator threat), and 3) partially restraining their freedom to move (arrest), and recorded their escape behavior in each of the three conditions. Response profiles differed across individuals and with the context in which they were expressed. During environmental and predator threat, bats displayed significantly more biting and wing-flapping behaviors and emitted more echolocation pulses than during arrest. Response profiles also varied with age. During arrest, juveniles were more likely than adults to emit distress calls and vice-versa for biting and wing flapping during environmental and predator threat. Overall, individualized response profiles were classified into ten clusters that were aligned along two divergent response trajectories when viewed within two-dimensional, multifactorial decision space. Juvenile behaviors tended to follow a predominantly ""social-dependence"" trajectory, whereas adult behaviors were mostly aligned along a ""self-reliance"" trajectory. We conclude that bats modify their vocal behavior and make age-appropriate and contextually adaptive decisions when distressed. This decision-making ability is consistent with observations in other social species, including humans."

Estimates of OVC school attendance were determined for the yearly time periods. Logistic regression was used to investigate the factors influencing OVC access to education.19,354 children aged 5-17 were included in the analysis. We estimated that 79.1% (95% CI: 78.5% - 79.7%) of OVCs attended school during the 3-year period. Logistic regression revealed the odds of attending school were lower among OVCs from Western (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.99) and Northern (OR 0.64; 95% CI: 0.56 - 0.73) regions compared to the Central region. Female OVCs had a significantly higher odds of attending school (OR 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02 - 1.17) compared to their male counterparts. When adjusting for all variables simultaneously, we found the odds of school attendance reduced by 12% between 2011 and 2012 among all OVCs (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81 - 0.97).Our findings reinforce the need to provide continuing support to OVC in Uganda, ensuring they have the opportunity to attain an education. The data indicate important regional and gender variation that needs to be considered for support strategies and in social policy. The results suggest the need for greater local empowerment to address the needs of OVCs. We recommend further research to understand why OVC access to education and attendance varies between regions and improvement of district level mapping of OVC access to education, and further study to understand the particular factors impacting the lower school attendance of male OVCs."
https://openalex.org/W889829975,"In the retina blood vessels are required to support a high metabolic rate, however, uncontrolled vascular growth can lead to impaired vision and blindness. Subretinal vascularization (SRV), one type of pathological vessel growth, occurs in retinal angiomatous proliferation and proliferative macular telangiectasia. In these diseases SRV originates from blood vessels within the retina. We use mice with a targeted disruption in the Vldl-receptor (Vldlr) gene as a model to study SRV with retinal origin. We find that Vldlr mRNA is strongly expressed in the neuroretina, and we observe both vascular and neuronal phenotypes in Vldlr-/- mice. Unexpectedly, horizontal cell (HC) neurites are mistargeted prior to SRV in this model, and the majority of vascular lesions are associated with mistargeted neurites. In Foxn4-/- mice, which lack HCs and display reduced amacrine cell (AC) numbers, we find severe defects in intraretinal capillary development. However, SRV is not suppressed in Foxn4-/-;Vldlr-/- mice, which reveals that mistargeted HC neurites are not required for vascular lesion formation. In the absence of VLDLR, the intraretinal capillary plexuses form in an inverse order compared to normal development, and subsequent to this early defect, vascular proliferation is increased. We conclude that SRV in the Vldlr-/- model is associated with mistargeted neurites and that SRV is preceded by altered retinal vascular development."
https://openalex.org/W1709832311,"Surveillance for gonorrhoea antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is compromised by a move away from culture-based testing in favour of more convenient nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) tests. We assessed the potential benefit of a molecular resistance test in terms of the timeliness of detection of gonorrhoea AMR.An individual-based mathematical model was developed to describe the transmission of gonorrhoea in a remote Indigenous population in Australia. We estimated the impact of the molecular test on the time delay between first importation and the first confirmation that the prevalence of gonorrhoea AMR (resistance proportion) has breached the WHO-recommended 5% threshold (when a change in antibiotic should occur). In the remote setting evaluated in this study, the model predicts that when culture is the only available means of testing for AMR, the breach will only be detected when the actual prevalence of AMR in the population has already reached 8 - 18%, with an associated delay of ~43 - 69 months between first importation and detection. With the addition of a molecular resistance test, the number of samples for which AMR can be determined increases facilitating earlier detection at a lower resistance proportion. For the best case scenario, where AMR can be determined for all diagnostic samples, the alert would be triggered at least 8 months earlier than using culture alone and the resistance proportion will have only slightly exceeded the 5% notification threshold.Molecular tests have the potential to provide more timely warning of the emergence of gonorrhoea AMR. This in turn will facilitate earlier treatment switching and more targeted treatment, which has the potential to reduce the population impact of gonorrhoea AMR."

As contact between China and West Africa is frequent, the possibility that Ebola virus would enter China was high. Thus, an external assessment of the quality of Ebola virus detection was organized by the National Center for Clinical Laboratories in China. Virus-like particles encapsulating known sequences of epidemic strains of Ebola virus from 2014 were prepared as positive quality controls. The sample panel, which was composed of seven positive and three negative samples, was dispatched to 19 laboratories participating in this assessment of Ebola virus detection. Accurate detection was reported at 14 of the 19 participating laboratories, with a sensitivity of 91.43% and a specificity of 100%. Four participants (21.05%) reported false-negative results and were classified as ""acceptable."" One participant (5.26%) did not detect any positive samples and was thus classified as ""improvable."" Based on the results returned, the ability to detect weakly positive Ebola specimens should be improved. Furthermore, commercial assays and the standard primers offered by the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were found to be most accurate and dependable for Ebola detection. A two-target detection approach is recommended for Ebola screening; this approach could reduce the probability of false-negative results. Additionally, standardization of operations and punctual adjustment of instruments are necessary for the control and prevention of Ebola virus."
https://openalex.org/W1689457393,"Relapsed, refractory lymphoma remains to be a challenge and lacks efficient treatment. Some tumor cells escape from treatment, become resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, and rapidly regenerate into large tumors. Lymphoma cells induce accumulation of Gr-1(+-)CD11b(+) myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in lymphatic organs and their vicinity. MDSCs enable tumor cells to escape from immune cells mediated surveillance and attack. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapeutic agent that eliminates both tumor cells and MDSCs, improving the immune environment favorable for subsequent treatment. We evaluated the effects of low dose gemcitabine combined with intra-tumorally delivered dendritic cells (DCs) for the treatment of A20 large-size lymphoma. We showed that MDSCs increased markedly in lymphoma-bearing mice, and that gemcitabine significantly increased the apoptosis of MDSCs. Treatment of lymphoma with either gemcitabine or intra-tumoral DCs alone could not inhibit tumor growth or rescue lymphoma-bearing mice. Treatment of lymphoma with small dose gemcitabine followed by intra-tumorally injected DCs significantly improved the efficacy of either individual treatment by reducing MDSCs, inducing onsite DCs maturation, eliminating tumor cells, inhibiting tumor growth and relapse, and extending the survival of the lymphoma-bearing mice, partly through the induction of the IFNγ secreting cells and the activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes. We showed that NK cells and CD8(+ )T cells were the major effectors to mediate the inhibition of tumor growth. Thus, the observation that gemcitabine synergizes DCs mediated immunotherapy to improve the efficacy of large size lymphoma treatment provides an experimental basis for the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy for the efficient treatment of relapsed or refractory lymphoma."

Methods We conducted a case-control study at a major tuberculosis clinic in Sydney, Australia, which included all patients with peripheral LNTB seen at the clinic between 2000 and 2012. Controls were randomly selected patients with PTB seen at the same clinic during the study period. Epidemiological data were extracted from the hospital electronic database and medical records. Associations between LNTB and age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities and phylogenetic lineages of MTB in comparison to PTB were examined using logistic regression in univariate and multivariate analyses. Results There were 212 cases with LNTB and 424 randomly selected controls with PTB. Among patients with LNTB, 74% were female and the mean age (standard deviation, SD) was 42 (16) years. Among patients with PTB, 43% were female and the mean age was 44 (22) years. Females, 45 to 64-year-olds and Southern Asians had an increased risk for LNTB (OR 3.13, 95% CI 2.10-4.67; OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.29-4.84; OR 3.95, 95% CI 1.54-10.12 respectively). Patients with diabetes were at a higher risk of PTB (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 – 0.83 for LNTB). A subset analysis showed that patients infected with the East African Indian strain of MTB were more likely to develop LNTB (OR 10.07, 95% CI 2.37-42.77). Conclusions An increased risk for LNTB (but still lower rates than for PTB) was found among females, people aged 45 to 64 years and people born in Southern Asia. An increased risk for PTB was found among patients with diabetes. The East African Indian strain of MTB was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of LNTB compared to other MTB strains."

Very little has been achieved, however, in terms of actual reduction in the number of victims despite numerous anti-sex trafficking programs. This situation may be attributable to a lack of empirical evidence upon which to formulate anti-sexual trafficking interventions. This study aimed to assess sex trafficking-related knowledge, awareness and attitudes, and factors associated with sex trafficking awareness and attitudes towards the victims of sex trafficking and/or anti-sex trafficking campaigns among adolescent female students in Nepal. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between August–September 2013 among 292 adolescent female students (>10 years old) using systematic random sampling from three high schools in Sindhupalchowk district, Nepal. As an initial step, descriptive analyses were employed to characterize the data and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore factors associated with sex trafficking awareness and related attitudes. Results Seventy-six percent of sampled students reported that they were aware of sex trafficking and 94.6% indicated media (i.e., radio or television) as the primary sources of their knowledge. Fifty-one percent mentioned relatives/friends as mediators of sex trafficking, 60.4% reported promise for better jobs as the primary attraction behind sex trafficking, and 48.6% mentioned adolescent females as the most vulnerable group for sex trafficking. Over half (56.8%) of the respondents had positive attitudes towards the victims of sex trafficking and/or anti-sex trafficking campaigns. Age (OR = 3.38, 95% CI:2.51–4.55), parents’ occupation (OR = 3.89, 95% CI:1.58–9.58), and having a radio/TV at home (OR = 6.67, 95% CI:3.99–9.54) were significantly associated with awareness, whereas being younger (OR = 0.67, 95% CI:0.55–0.79) and having joint-family (OR = 2.67, 95% CI:1.49–4.80) were significantly associated with having a positive attitudes towards the victims of sex trafficking and/or anti-sex trafficking campaigns. Conclusion Findings presented have important implications for anti-trafficking programs, in particular those designed to educate the adolescent females who are at most-risk of sex trafficking. Educational programs need to include specific interventions to improve knowledge and attitudes towards sex trafficking among adolescent females in Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W903134927,"As habitual self-stigma can have a tremendous negative impact on people with mental illness, it is of paramount importance to identify its risk factors. The present study aims to examine the potential contributory role of attentional bias in habitual self-stigma. People with mental illness having strong (n = 47) and weak (n = 47) habitual self-stigma completed a computerized emotional Stroop task which included stigma-related, positive, and non-affective words as stimuli. The strong habit group was found to exhibit faster color-naming of stigma-related words (compared to non-affective words), whereas the weak habit group showed no difference in the speed of response to different stimuli. These findings suggest that people with stronger habitual self-stigma may be more able to ignore the semantic meaning of stigma-related words and focus on the color-naming task. Moreover, people with stronger habitual self-stigma may have greater attentional avoidance of stigma-related material. The present study is the first to demonstrate a specific relationship between habitual self-stigma and biased processing of stigma-related information. In order to further determine the role and the nature of attentional bias in habitual self-stigma, future research should employ a broader range of experimental paradigms and measurement techniques to examine stigma-related attentional bias in people with mental illness."
https://openalex.org/W1569770394,"Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) patients harboring RUNX1 mutations have a dismal prognosis with anthracycline/cytarabine-based chemotherapy. We aimed to develop an in vivo model of RUNX1-mutated, CN-AML in which the nature of residual disease in this molecular disease subset could be explored. We utilized a well-characterized patient-derived, RUNX1-mutated CN-AML line (CG-SH). Tail vein injection of CG-SH into NOD scid gamma mice led to leukemic engraftment in the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood within 6 weeks. Treatment of leukemic mice with anthracycline/cytarabine-based chemotherapy resulted in clearance of disease from the spleen and peripheral blood, but persistence of disease in the bone marrow as assessed by flow cytometry and secondary transplantation. Whole exome sequencing of CG-SH revealed mutations in ASXL1, CEBPA, GATA2, and SETBP1, not previously reported. We conclude that CG-SH xenografts are a robust, reproducible in vivo model of CN-AML in which to explore mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance and novel therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W913164567,"Much progress has been made in understanding the important cis-mediated controls on mouse TCRα gene function, including identification of the Eα enhancer and TCRα locus control region (LCR). Nevertheless, previous data have suggested that other cis-regulatory elements may reside in the locus outside of the Eα/LCR. Based on prior findings, we hypothesized the existence of gene regulatory elements in a 3.9-kb region 5' of the Cα exons. Using DNase hypersensitivity assays and TCRα BAC reporter transgenes in mice, we detected gene regulatory activity within this 3.9-kb region. This region is active in both thymic and peripheral T cells, and selectively affects upstream, but not downstream, gene expression. Together, these data indicate the existence of a novel cis-acting regulatory complex that contributes to TCRα transgene expression in vivo. The active chromatin sites we discovered within this region would remain in the locus after TCRα gene rearrangement, and thus may contribute to endogenous TCRα gene activity, particularly in peripheral T cells, where the Eα element has been found to be inactive."

https://openalex.org/W2253150810,"Solutions exchange systems are responsible for the timing of drug application on patch clamp experiments. There are two basic strategies for generating a solution exchange. When slow exchanges are bearable, it is easier to perform the exchange inside the tubing system upstream of the exit port. On the other hand, fast, reproducible, exchanges are usually performed downstream of the exit port. As both strategies are combinable, increasing the performance of upstream exchanges is desirable. We designed a simple method for manufacturing T-junctions (300 μm I.D.) and we measured the time profile of exchange of two saline solutions using a patch pipette with an open tip. Three factors were found to determine the timing of the solution switching: pressure, travelled distance and off-center distance. A linear relationship between the time delay and the travelled distance was found for each tested pressure, showing its dependence to the fluid velocity, which increased with pressure. The exchange time was found to increase quadratically with the delay, although a sizeable variability remains unexplained by this relationship. The delay and exchange times increased as the recording pipette moved away from the center of the stream. Those increases became dramatic as the pipette was moved close to the stream borders. Mass transport along the travelled distance between the slow fluid at the border and the fast fluid at the center seems to contribute to the time course of the solution exchange. This effect would be present in all tubing based devices. Present results might be of fundamental importance for the adequate design of serial compound exchangers which would be instrumental in the discovery of drugs that modulate the action of the physiological agonists of ion channels with the purpose of fine tuning their physiology."
