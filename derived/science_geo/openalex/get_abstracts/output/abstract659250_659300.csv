https://openalex.org/W3084236163,"Miniproteins against SARS-CoV-2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is decorated with spikes, and viral entry into cells is initiated when these spikes bind to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Many monoclonal antibody therapies in development target the spike proteins. Cao et al. designed small, stable proteins that bind tightly to the spike and block it from binding to ACE2. The best designs bind with very high affinity and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection of mammalian Vero E6 cells. Cryo–electron microscopy shows that the structures of the two most potent inhibitors are nearly identical to the computational models. Unlike antibodies, the miniproteins do not require expression in mammalian cells, and their small size and high stability may allow formulation for direct delivery to the nasal or respiratory system.

https://openalex.org/W3084071750,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1. To understand the pathogenicity and antigenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and to develop therapeutic tools, it is essential to profile the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The current map of SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity is based on computational predictions and relies on homology with other coronaviruses. As the protein complement varies among coronaviruses, especially in regard to the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific range of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Here, using a suite of ribosome-profiling techniques2–4, we present a high-resolution map of coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which enables us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORFs) and to identify 23 unannotated viral ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs that are likely to have a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; instead, virus translation dominates host translation because of the high levels of viral transcripts. Our work provides a resource that will form the basis of future functional studies. A high-resolution map of coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome enables the identification of 23 unannotated open reading frames and quantification of the expression of canonical viral open reading frames."
https://openalex.org/W3083958169,"Thermal management is one of the main challenges for the future of electronics1–5. With the ever-increasing rate of data generation and communication, as well as the constant push to reduce the size and costs of industrial converter systems, the power density of electronics has risen6. Consequently, cooling, with its enormous energy and water consumption, has an increasingly large environmental impact7,8, and new technologies are needed to extract the heat in a more sustainable way—that is, requiring less water and energy9. Embedding liquid cooling directly inside the chip is a promising approach for more efficient thermal management5,10,11. However, even in state-of-the-art approaches, the electronics and cooling are treated separately, leaving the full energy-saving potential of embedded cooling untapped. Here we show that by co-designing microfluidics and electronics within the same semiconductor substrate we can produce a monolithically integrated manifold microchannel cooling structure with efficiency beyond what is currently available. Our results show that heat fluxes exceeding 1.7 kilowatts per square centimetre can be extracted using only 0.57 watts per square centimetre of pumping power. We observed an unprecedented coefficient of performance (exceeding 10,000) for single-phase water-cooling of heat fluxes exceeding 1 kilowatt per square centimetre, corresponding to a 50-fold increase compared to straight microchannels, as well as a very high average Nusselt number of 16. The proposed cooling technology should enable further miniaturization of electronics, potentially extending Moore’s law and greatly reducing the energy consumption in cooling of electronics. Furthermore, by removing the need for large external heat sinks, this approach should enable the realization of very compact power converters integrated on a single chip. Cooling efficiency is greatly increased by directly embedding liquid cooling into electronic chips, using microfluidics-based heat sinks that are designed in conjunction with the electronics within the same semiconductor substrate."

https://openalex.org/W3084174900,"Mitochondria require nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to carry out the fundamental processes that fuel respiration and mediate cellular energy transduction. Mitochondrial NAD+ transporters have been identified in yeast and plants1,2, but their existence in mammals remains controversial3–5. Here we demonstrate that mammalian mitochondria can take up intact NAD+, and identify SLC25A51 (also known as MCART1)—an essential6,7 mitochondrial protein of previously unknown function—as a mammalian mitochondrial NAD+ transporter. Loss of SLC25A51 decreases mitochondrial—but not whole-cell—NAD+ content, impairs mitochondrial respiration, and blocks the uptake of NAD+ into isolated mitochondria. Conversely, overexpression of SLC25A51 or SLC25A52 (a nearly identical paralogue of SLC25A51) increases mitochondrial NAD+ levels and restores NAD+ uptake into yeast mitochondria lacking endogenous NAD+ transporters. Together, these findings identify SLC25A51 as a mammalian transporter capable of importing NAD+ into mitochondria. SLC25A51 is identified as a transporter of intact NAD+ into mammalian mitochondria and is required to maintain the mitochondrial NAD+ pool and respiratory function."

https://openalex.org/W3084234242,"Caenorhabditis elegans must distinguish pathogens from nutritious food sources among the many bacteria to which it is exposed in its environment1. Here we show that a single exposure to purified small RNAs isolated from pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) is sufficient to induce pathogen avoidance in the treated worms and in four subsequent generations of progeny. The RNA interference (RNAi) and PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathways, the germline and the ASI neuron are all required for avoidance behaviour induced by bacterial small RNAs, and for the transgenerational inheritance of this behaviour. A single P. aeruginosa non-coding RNA, P11, is both necessary and sufficient to convey learned avoidance of PA14, and its C. elegans target, maco-1, is required for avoidance. Our results suggest that this non-coding-RNA-dependent mechanism evolved to survey the microbial environment of the worm, use this information to make appropriate behavioural decisions and pass this information on to its progeny."
https://openalex.org/W3084103887,"Hydrogen, the simplest and most abundant element in the Universe, develops a remarkably complex behaviour upon compression1. Since Wigner predicted the dissociation and metallization of solid hydrogen at megabar pressures almost a century ago2, several efforts have been made to explain the many unusual properties of dense hydrogen, including a rich and poorly understood solid polymorphism1,3-5, an anomalous melting line6 and the possible transition to a superconducting state7. Experiments at such extreme conditions are challenging and often lead to hard-to-interpret and controversial observations, whereas theoretical investigations are constrained by the huge computational cost of sufficiently accurate quantum mechanical calculations. Here we present a theoretical study of the phase diagram of dense hydrogen that uses machine learning to 'learn' potential-energy surfaces and interatomic forces from reference calculations and then predict them at low computational cost, overcoming length- and timescale limitations. We reproduce both the re-entrant melting behaviour and the polymorphism of the solid phase. Simulations using our machine-learning-based potentials provide evidence for a continuous molecular-to-atomic transition in the liquid, with no first-order transition observed above the melting line. This suggests a smooth transition between insulating and metallic layers in giant gas planets, and reconciles existing discrepancies between experiments as a manifestation of supercritical behaviour."

https://openalex.org/W3083793515,"Centrosomes catalyse the formation of microtubules needed to assemble the mitotic spindle apparatus1. Centrosomes themselves duplicate once per cell cycle, in a process that is controlled by the serine/threonine protein kinase PLK4 (refs. 2,3). When PLK4 is chemically inhibited, cell division proceeds without centrosome duplication, generating centrosome-less cells that exhibit delayed, acentrosomal spindle assembly4. Whether PLK4 inhibitors can be leveraged as a treatment for cancer is not yet clear. Here we show that acentrosomal spindle assembly following PLK4 inhibition depends on levels of the centrosomal ubiquitin ligase TRIM37. Low TRIM37 levels accelerate acentrosomal spindle assembly and improve proliferation following PLK4 inhibition, whereas high TRIM37 levels inhibit acentrosomal spindle assembly, leading to mitotic failure and cessation of proliferation. The Chr17q region containing the TRIM37 gene is frequently amplified in neuroblastoma and in breast cancer5–8, rendering these cancer types highly sensitive to PLK4 inhibition. We find that inactivating TRIM37 improves acentrosomal mitosis because TRIM37 prevents PLK4 from self-assembling into centrosome-independent condensates that serve as ectopic microtubule-organizing centres. By contrast, elevated TRIM37 expression inhibits acentrosomal spindle assembly through a distinct mechanism that involves degradation of the centrosomal component CEP192. Thus, TRIM37 is an essential determinant of mitotic vulnerability to PLK4 inhibition. Linkage of TRIM37 to prevalent cancer-associated genomic changes—including 17q gain in neuroblastoma and 17q23 amplification in breast cancer—may offer an opportunity to use PLK4 inhibition to trigger selective mitotic failure and provide new avenues to treatments for these cancers. Acentrosomal assembly of the mitotic spindle upon inhibition of the PLK4 protein is shown to depend on the ubiquitin ligase TRIM37, with implications for the use of PLK4 inhibitors to treat neuroblastoma and breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3084363389,"We sought to evaluate the adherence of Vietnamese adults to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) preventive measures, and gain insight into the effects of the epidemic on the daily lives of Vietnamese people. An online questionnaire was administered from March 31 to April 6, 2020. The questionnaire assessed personal preventive behavior (such as physical distancing, wearing a face mask, cough etiquette, regular handwashing and using an alcohol hand sanitizer, body temperature check, and disinfecting mobile phones) and community preventive behavior (such as avoiding meetings, large gatherings, going to the market, avoiding travel in a vehicle/bus with more than 10 persons, and not traveling outside of the local area during the lockdown). A total adherence score was calculated by summing the scores of the 9 personal and the 11 community prevention questions. In total, 2175 respondents completed the questionnaire; mean age: 31.4 ± 10.7; (range: 18–69); 66.9% were women; 54.2% were health professionals and 22.8% were medical students. The mean adherence scores for personal and community preventive measures were 7.23 ± 1.63 (range 1–9) and 9.57 ± 1.12 (range 1–11), respectively. Perceived adaptation of the community to lockdown (Beta (β) = 2.64, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.25–4.03), fears/worries concerning one’s health (β = 2.87, 95% CI 0.04–5.70), residing in large cities (β = 19.40, 95% CI 13.78–25.03), access to official COVID-19 information sources (β = 16.45, 95% CI 6.82–26.08), and working in healthcare/medical students (β = 22.53, 95% CI 16.00–29.07) were associated with a higher adherence score to anti-COVID instructions. In conclusion, this study confirmed a high degree of adherence to personal and community preventive behavior among Vietnamese people. Our findings are consistent with the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Vietnam, where there have been few infections and no recorded deaths up to the first week of July 2020."
https://openalex.org/W3083967630,"Sensory discrimination is essential for survival. However, how sensory information is finely controlled in the brain is not well defined. Here, we show that astrocytes control tactile acuity via tonic inhibition in the thalamus. Mechanistically, diamine oxidase (DAO) and the subsequent aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1) convert putrescine into GABA, which is released via Best1. The GABA from astrocytes inhibits synaptically evoked firing at the lemniscal synapses to fine-tune the dynamic range of the stimulation-response relationship, the precision of spike timing, and tactile discrimination. Our findings reveal a novel role of astrocytes in the control of sensory acuity through tonic GABA release."

https://openalex.org/W3084285889,"Heterochromatin that depends on histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) renders embedded genes transcriptionally silent1-3. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, H3K9me heterochromatin can be transmitted through cell division provided the counteracting demethylase Epe1 is absent4,5. Heterochromatin heritability might allow wild-type cells under certain conditions to acquire epimutations, which could influence phenotype through unstable gene silencing rather than DNA change6,7. Here we show that heterochromatin-dependent epimutants resistant to caffeine arise in fission yeast grown with threshold levels of caffeine. Isolates with unstable resistance have distinct heterochromatin islands with reduced expression of embedded genes, including some whose mutation confers caffeine resistance. Forced heterochromatin formation at implicated loci confirms that resistance results from heterochromatin-mediated silencing. Our analyses reveal that epigenetic processes promote phenotypic plasticity, letting wild-type cells adapt to unfavourable environments without genetic alteration. In some isolates, subsequent or coincident gene-amplification events augment resistance. Caffeine affects two anti-silencing factors: Epe1 is downregulated, reducing its chromatin association, and a shortened isoform of Mst2 histone acetyltransferase is expressed. Thus, heterochromatin-dependent epimutation provides a bet-hedging strategy allowing cells to adapt transiently to insults while remaining genetically wild type. Isolates with unstable caffeine resistance show cross-resistance to antifungal agents, suggesting that related heterochromatin-dependent processes may contribute to resistance of plant and human fungal pathogens to such agents."

https://openalex.org/W3083990469,"Influenza A virus causes millions of severe cases of disease during annual epidemics. The most abundant protein in influenza virions is matrix protein 1 (M1), which mediates virus assembly by forming an endoskeleton beneath the virus membrane1. The structure of full-length M1, and how it oligomerizes to mediate the assembly of virions, is unknown. Here we determine the complete structure of assembled M1 within intact virus particles, as well as the structure of M1 oligomers reconstituted in vitro. We find that the C-terminal domain of M1 is disordered in solution but can fold and bind in trans to the N-terminal domain of another M1 monomer, thus polymerizing M1 into linear strands that coat the interior surface of the membrane of the assembling virion. In the M1 polymer, five histidine residues—contributed by three different monomers of M1—form a cluster that can serve as the pH-sensitive disassembly switch after entry into a target cell. These structures therefore reveal mechanisms of influenza virus assembly and disassembly. Structures of the assembled matrix protein 1 of influenza A virus in intact virus particles and of oligomers of this protein reconstituted in vitro reveal mechanisms of assembly and disassembly of influenza virus."
https://openalex.org/W3084074256,"Isoprene is the dominant non-methane organic compound emitted to the atmosphere1–3. It drives ozone and aerosol production, modulates atmospheric oxidation and interacts with the global nitrogen cycle4–8. Isoprene emissions are highly uncertain1,9, as is the nonlinear chemistry coupling isoprene and the hydroxyl radical, OH—its primary sink10–13. Here we present global isoprene measurements taken from space using the Cross-track Infrared Sounder. Together with observations of formaldehyde, an isoprene oxidation product, these measurements provide constraints on isoprene emissions and atmospheric oxidation. We find that the isoprene–formaldehyde relationships measured from space are broadly consistent with the current understanding of isoprene–OH chemistry, with no indication of missing OH recycling at low nitrogen oxide concentrations. We analyse these datasets over four global isoprene hotspots in relation to model predictions, and present a quantification of isoprene emissions based directly on satellite measurements of isoprene itself. A major discrepancy emerges over Amazonia, where current underestimates of natural nitrogen oxide emissions bias modelled OH and hence isoprene. Over southern Africa, we find that a prominent isoprene hotspot is missing from bottom-up predictions. A multi-year analysis sheds light on interannual isoprene variability, and suggests the influence of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. Direct satellite measurements of atmospheric isoprene are compared with model predictions, showing broad agreement but highlighting spatial and temporal biases in modelled isoprene and nitrogen oxide emissions."
https://openalex.org/W3084020252,"The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) core promoter is the strategic site of convergence of the signals that lead to the initiation of DNA transcription1–5, but the downstream core promoter in humans has been difficult to understand1–3. Here we analyse the human Pol II core promoter and use machine learning to generate predictive models for the downstream core promoter region (DPR) and the TATA box. We developed a method termed HARPE (high-throughput analysis of randomized promoter elements) to create hundreds of thousands of DPR (or TATA box) variants, each with known transcriptional strength. We then analysed the HARPE data by support vector regression (SVR) to provide comprehensive models for the sequence motifs, and found that the SVR-based approach is more effective than a consensus-based method for predicting transcriptional activity. These results show that the DPR is a functionally important core promoter element that is widely used in human promoters. Notably, there appears to be a duality between the DPR and the TATA box, as many promoters contain one or the other element. More broadly, these findings show that functional DNA motifs can be identified by machine learning analysis of a comprehensive set of sequence variants. A machine learning approach shows that the downstream core promoter region (DPR) is widely used in human gene promoters, and that many promoters contain either a DPR or a TATA box, but not both."

https://openalex.org/W3084091409,"The successful operation of quantum computers relies on protecting qubits from decoherence and noise, which—if uncorrected—will lead to erroneous results. Because these errors accumulate during an algorithm, correcting them is a key requirement for large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum information processors. Besides computational errors, which can be addressed by quantum error correction1–9, the carrier of the information can also be completely lost or the information can leak out of the computational space10–14. It is expected that such loss errors will occur at rates that are comparable to those of computational errors. Here we experimentally implement a full cycle of qubit loss detection and correction on a minimal instance of a topological surface code15,16 in a trapped-ion quantum processor. The key technique used for this correction is a quantum non-demolition measurement performed via an ancillary qubit, which acts as a minimally invasive probe that detects absent qubits while imparting the smallest quantum mechanically possible disturbance to the remaining qubits. Upon detecting qubit loss, a recovery procedure is triggered in real time that maps the logical information onto a new encoding on the remaining qubits. Although the current demonstration is performed in a trapped-ion quantum processor17, the protocol is applicable to other quantum computing architectures and error correcting codes, including leading two- and three-dimensional topological codes. These deterministic methods provide a complete toolbox for the correction of qubit loss that, together with techniques that mitigate computational errors, constitute the building blocks of complete and scalable quantum error correction. A deterministic correction of errors caused by qubit loss or leakage outside the computational space is demonstrated in a trapped-ion experiment by using a minimal instance of the topological surface code."

Scavenger receptor class A (SR-A) has five known members (SCARA1 to -5 or SR-A1 to -A5), which are type II transmembrane proteins that form homotrimers on the cell surface. SR-A members recognize various ligands and are involved in multiple biological pathways. Among them, SCARA5 can function as a ferritin receptor; however, the interaction between SCARA5 and ferritin has not been fully characterized. Here, we determine the crystal structures of the C-terminal scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain of both human and mouse SCARA5 at 1.7 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively, revealing three Ca2+-binding sites on the surface. Using biochemical assays, we show that the SRCR domain of SCARA5 recognizes ferritin in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and both L- and H-ferritin can be recognized by SCARA5 through the SRCR domain. Furthermore, the potential binding region of SCARA5 on the surface of ferritin is explored by mutagenesis studies. We also examine the interactions of ferritin with other SR-A members and find that SCARA1 (SR-A1, CD204) and MARCO (SR-A2, SCARA2), which are highly expressed on macrophages, also interact with ferritin. By contrast, SCARA3 and SCARA4, the two SR-A members without the SRCR domain, have no detectable binding with ferritin.

In the SR-A family, SCARA5 was initially found to be expressed in embryonic and adult mouse testis (17Sarraj M.A. McClive P.J. Wilmore H.P. Loveland K.L. Sinclair A.H.

Further characterization showed that SCARA5 existed in various tissues restricted to epithelial cells, and the SCARA5-transfected cells could bind Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus but not zymosan (18Jiang Y.

Sequence analysis shows that SCARA5 has relatively high similarity with SCARA1; its ectodomain contains a spacer region, a CL region, and an SRCR domain (Fig. 1A) (18Jiang Y. Oliver P. Davies K.E.

Although SCARA5 does not bind modified LDLs, it has been shown that it could be a ferritin receptor mediating ferritin uptake in embryonic cells (15Li J.Y. Paragas N. Ned R.M. Qiu A. Viltard M.

Here we investigate the binding of SCARA5 with ferritin and determine the crystal structure of the SRCR domain of SCARA5 and also explore the interactions of ferritin with the SR-A members by biochemical assays, which may help to understand the mechanisms of ferritin recognition via the SR-A family. SCARA5 has been reported to recognize and internalize ferritin (15Li J.Y. Paragas N. Ned R.M. Qiu A. Viltard M. Leete T. Drexler I.R. Chen X. Sanna-Cherchi S. Mohammed F. Williams D. Lin C.S.

Here, we transfected HEK293 cells with the mCherry-tagged full-length human SCARA5 (isoform 1) and an SRCR domain deletion mutant of SCARA5 (SCARA5ΔSRCR), respectively (Fig. 1A). The transfected cells were fed with the FITC-labeled L-ferritin. The FACS results showed that the SCARA5-transfected cells could bind to L-ferritin, but SCARA5ΔSRCR had no binding to L-ferritin under similar conditions (Fig. 1B). The fluorescent images also showed that L-ferritin co-localized with SCARA5 on the transfected cells, but no L-ferritin was found on the SCARA5ΔSRCR-transfected cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the SRCR domain could mediate the uptake of L-ferritin. Moreover, we expressed and purified a series of truncation mutants of SCARA5 using insect cells, including the intact ectodomain, the ectodomain without the SRCR domain (ΔSRCR), and the SRCR domain alone (Fig. 1A), all fused with a C-terminal His6 tag and a FLAG tag (DYKDDDK). The FLAG tag pulldown results showed that the intact ectodomain and the SRCR domain alone could pull down L-ferritin directly, but no L-ferritin was detected using the ectodomain without the SRCR portion (Fig. 1C), confirming that the SRCR domain is the binding domain of L-ferritin on SCARA5. In addition, we also tested the binding of ferritin with the SCARA5 isoform 4, which does not have the spacer region of isoform 1 (Fig. 1A), and found that isoform 1 had higher ferritin binding affinity or internalization efficiency than isoform 4 (Fig. 1, B and D), which may be caused by the different lengths of the two isoforms as longer tethers may reduce steric hindrance from cell membrane (55McMahon C.

The expression of the SRCR domain of SCARA5 alone in insect cells usually gave low yields. By contrast, the fragment including the CL region (Lys305–Met392) and the SRCR domain (CL-SRCR; Lys305–His495 for hSCARA5) could be expressed at high levels, and the CL portion of the CL-SRCR fragment could be degraded quickly (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W3084413779,"Despite its size and rigidity, the cell nucleus can be moved or reorganized by cytoskeletal filaments under various conditions (for example, during viral infection)1–11. Moreover, whereas chromatin organizes into non-random domains12, extensive heterogeneity at the single-cell level13 means that precisely how and why nuclei reorganize remains an area of intense investigation. Here we describe convolutional neural network-based automated cell classification and analysis pipelines, which revealed the extent to which human cytomegalovirus generates nuclear polarity through a virus-assembled microtubule-organizing centre. Acetylation of tubulin enables microtubules emanating from this centre to rotate the nucleus by engaging cytoplasmically exposed dynein-binding domains in the outer nuclear membrane protein nesprin-2G, which polarizes the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN1. This in turn creates intranuclear polarity in emerin, and thereby controls nuclear actin filaments that spatially segregate viral DNA from inactive histones and host DNA, maximizing virus replication. Our findings demonstrate the extent to which viruses can control the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Human cytomegalovirus rotates the nuclei of infected cells to set up intranuclear polarization and thereby separate viral DNA from inactive histones and associated host DNA."

https://openalex.org/W3083820075,"The transport of carbon into Earth’s mantle is a critical pathway in Earth’s carbon cycle, affecting both the climate and the redox conditions of the surface and mantle. The largest unconstrained variables in this cycle are the depths to which carbon in sediments and altered oceanic crust can be subducted and the relative contributions of these reservoirs to the sequestration of carbon in the deep mantle1. Mineral inclusions in sublithospheric, or ‘superdeep’, diamonds (derived from depths greater than 250 kilometres) can be used to constrain these variables. Here we present oxygen isotope measurements of mineral inclusions within diamonds from Kankan, Guinea that are derived from depths extending from the lithosphere to the lower mantle (greater than 660 kilometres). These data, combined with the carbon and nitrogen isotope contents of the diamonds, indicate that carbonated igneous oceanic crust, not sediment, is the primary carbon-bearing reservoir in slabs subducted to deep-lithospheric and transition-zone depths (less than 660 kilometres). Within this depth regime, sublithospheric inclusions are distinctly enriched in 18O relative to eclogitic lithospheric inclusions derived from crustal protoliths. The increased 18O content of these sublithospheric inclusions results from their crystallization from melts of carbonate-rich subducted oceanic crust. In contrast, lower-mantle mineral inclusions and their host diamonds (deeper than 660 kilometres) have a narrow range of isotopic values that are typical of mantle that has experienced little or no crustal interaction. Because carbon is hosted in metals, rather than in diamond, in the reduced, volatile-poor lower mantle2, carbon must be mobilized and concentrated to form lower-mantle diamonds. Our data support a model in which the hydration of the uppermost lower mantle by subducted oceanic lithosphere destabilizes carbon-bearing metals to form diamond, without disturbing the ambient-mantle stable-isotope signatures. This transition from carbonate slab melting in the transition zone to slab dehydration in the lower mantle supports a lower-mantle barrier for carbon subduction. Oxygen isotope measurements of mineral inclusions in superdeep diamonds indicate that carbonated igneous oceanic crust is the primary carbon-bearing reservoir in slabs subducted to deep-lithospheric and transition-zone depths."
https://openalex.org/W3084248106,"Renal fibrosis, which is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in the renal tubulointerstitium, can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The role of microfiber-associated protein 4 (MFAP4), which is an ECM protein that interacts with elastin and collagen, in renal fibrosis has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to examine the role of MFAP4 in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis and the underlying mechanism using in vivo and in vitro models. The MFAP4-/- mice were subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) to elucidate the role of MFAP4 in renal fibrosis in vivo. Compared to the wild-type mice, the MFAP4-/- mice exhibited decreased protein expression of p-p65 and p-IKBα and ECM deposition after UUO. The MFAP4-/- mice exhibited attenuated nuclear translocation of p65 (the hub subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway), suppressed activation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad pathways, and downregulated expression of fibronectin, collagen I, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. The knockdown of MFAP4 mitigated the TGF-β-induced upregulated expression of fibronectin, collagen I, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2). Compared to the HK-2 cells transfected with sh-MFAP4, the HK-2 cells co-transfected with sh-MFAP4 and Ad-MFAP4 exhibited severe inflammatory response and increased fibrosis-related proteins expression. Mechanistically, the knockdown of MFAP4 inhibited the activation of NF-κB and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathways and downregulated the expression of fibrosis-related proteins. The findings of this study indicate that MFAP4 is involved in UUO-induced renal fibrosis through regulation of NF-κB and TGF-β/Smad pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3084390693,"Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) converts serine plus tetrahydrofolate (THF) into glycine plus methylene-THF and is upregulated at the protein level in lung and other cancers. In order to better understand the role of SHMT2 in cancer a model system of HeLa cells engineered for inducible over-expression or knock-down of SHMT2 was characterized for cell proliferation and changes in metabolites and proteome as a function of SHMT2. Ectopic over-expression of SHMT2 increased cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Knockdown of SHMT2 expression in vitro caused a state of glycine auxotrophy and accumulation of phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide (AICAR), an intermediate of folate/1-carbon-pathway-dependent de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. Decreased glycine in the HeLa cell-based xenograft tumors with knocked down SHMT2 was potentiated by administration of the anti-hyperglycinemia agent benzoate. However, tumor growth was not affected by SHMT2 knockdown with or without benzoate treatment. Benzoate inhibited cell proliferation in vitro, but this was independent of SHMT2 modulation. The abundance of proteins of mitochondrial respiration complexes 1 and 3 was inversely correlated with SHMT2 levels. Proximity biotinylation in vivo (BioID) identified 48 mostly mitochondrial proteins associated with SHMT2 including the mitochondrial enzymes Acyl-CoA thioesterase (ACOT2) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1) along with more than 20 proteins from mitochondrial respiration complexes 1 and 3. These data provide insights into possible mechanisms through which elevated SHMT2 in cancers may be linked to changes in metabolism and mitochondrial function."

This extended network of neutral and ionized filaments surrounds the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the two most massive satellite galaxies of the Milky Way1–4. Recent observations indicate that the LMC and SMC are on their first passage around the Galaxy5, that the Magellanic Stream is made up of gas stripped from both clouds2,6,7 and that the majority of this gas is ionized8,9. Although it has long been suspected that tidal forces10,11 and ram-pressure stripping12,13 contributed to the formation of the Magellanic Stream, models have not been able to provide a full understanding of its origins3. Several recent developments—including the discovery of dwarf galaxies associated with the Magellanic group14–16, determination of the high mass of the LMC17, detection of highly ionized gas near stars in the LMC18,19 and predictions of cosmological simulations20,21—support the existence of a halo of warm (roughly 500,000 kelvin) ionized gas around the LMC (the ‘Magellanic Corona’). Here we report that, by including this Magellanic Corona in hydrodynamic simulations of the Magellanic Clouds falling onto the Milky Way, we can reproduce the Magellanic Stream and its leading arm. Our simulations explain the filamentary structure, spatial extent, radial-velocity gradient and total ionized-gas mass of the Magellanic Stream. We predict that the Magellanic Corona will be unambiguously observable via high-ionization absorption lines in the ultraviolet spectra of background quasars lying near the LMC. Embedding the Magellanic Clouds in a corona of ionized gas allows the gaseous Magellanic Stream to be modelled accurately."
https://openalex.org/W3084240691,"Neonicotinoids, a class of insecticides structurally similar to nicotine that target biting and sucking insects, are the most widely used insecticides today, in part due to their supposed low toxicity in other organisms. However, a growing body of research has found that even low doses of neonicotinoids can induce unexpected negative effects on the physiology and survival of a wide range of non-target organisms. Importantly, no work has been done on the commercial formulations of pesticides that include imidacloprid as the active ingredient, but that also contain many other components. The present study examines the sublethal effects of “Tree and Shrub”™ (“T+S”), a commercial insecticide containing the neonicotinoid imidacloprid as its active ingredient, on Caenorhabditis elegans. We discovered that “T+S” significantly stunted the overall growth in wildtype nematodes, an effect that was exacerbated by concurrent exposure to heat stress. “T+S” also negatively impacted fecundity as measured by increased germline apoptosis, a decrease in egg-laying, and fewer viable offspring. Lastly, exposure to “T+S” resulted in degenerative changes in nicotinic cholinergic neurons in wildtype nematodes. As a whole, these findings demonstrate widespread toxic effects of neonicotinoids to critical functions in nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W3084077974,"Since the initial report of glyphosate-resistant (GR) Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson in 2006, resistant populations have been reported in 28 states. The mechanism of resistance is amplification of a 399-kb extrachromosomal circular DNA, called the EPSPS replicon, and is unique to glyphosate-resistant plants. The replicon contains a single copy of the 10-kb 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene which causes the concomitant increased expression of EPSP synthase, the target enzyme of glyphosate. It is not known whether the resistance by this amplification mechanism evolved once and then spread across the country or evolved independently in several locations. To compare genomic representation and variation across the EPSPS replicon, whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) and mapping of sequences from both GR and susceptible (GS) biotypes to the replicon consensus sequence was performed. Sampling of GR biotypes from AZ, KS, GA, MD and DE and GS biotypes from AZ, KS and GA revealed complete contiguity and deep representation with sequences from GR plants, but lack of homogeneity and contiguity with breaks in coverage were observed with sequences from GS biotypes. The high sequence conservation among GR biotypes with very few polymorphisms which were widely distributed across the USA further supports the hypothesis that glyphosate resistance most likely originated from a single population. We show that the replicon from different populations was unique to GR plants and had similar levels of amplification."

Karate is a martial art that combines aerobic and large-amplitude movements, balance and core training, and mindfulness, suggesting a potential benefit for individuals with PD from multiple perspectives. Objective To evaluate the feasibility of community-based Shotokan karate classes involving physical activity and mindfulness among individuals with mild- to moderate-stage PD, and to explore the effects of karate on objective and patient-reported outcomes. Methods We conducted a 10-week, unblinded trial of twice weekly, PD-specific karate classes. Feasibility was assessed by: dropout rates, adherence via attendance records, adverse effects and falls, and continued participation six months post-intervention. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention assessments of disease-related quality of life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8, PDQ-8), falls, and post-intervention assessment of change in overall wellbeing (Patient Global Impression of Change, PGIC), with exploratory measures of mobility using the Timed Up and Go (TUG), mood using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and cognition using digit span forward and backward and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Results Of 19 enrolled participants, 15 completed the study (79%). Among completers, mean adherence was 87% during the ten weeks of intervention, and 53% maintained karate participation six months later and endorsed sustained improvement, respectively. No adverse effects or change in fall frequency were detected. Among completers, 53% were women, and mean PD duration was 6 years (range 2-20). Quality of life improved to a clinically significant degree (PDQ-8: mean 25.3 (standard deviation (SD) 20.8) versus 19.3 (SD 19.6), p = 0.01, effect size 0.83). On the PGIC, 87% endorsed feeling moderately or considerably better. Mobility did not change significantly (TUG: 9.6 seconds (SD 2.23) versus 9.0 seconds (SD 1.89), p = 0.12, effect size 0.43), nor were there changes in overall physical activity, mood, or cognition (p = 0.35-0.92). Conclusions In a small, 10-week, unblinded trial of community-based karate classes for individuals with mild and moderate PD, high adherence was noted. Quality of life and wellbeing improved significantly, without changes in exploratory outcomes of mobility or neuropsychological outcomes. The study was underpowered, particularly for the exploratory outcomes. Controlled and longitudinal investigation is warranted to confirm our pilot findings and explore the long-term effects and sustainability of karate in PD.

https://openalex.org/W3084029235,"Background Invasive fungal infection (IFI) detection requires application of complex case definitions by trained staff. Administrative coding data (ICD-10-AM) may provide a simplified method for IFI surveillance, but accuracy of case ascertainment in children with cancer is unknown. Objective To determine the classification performance of ICD-10-AM codes for detecting IFI using a gold-standard dataset (r-TERIFIC) of confirmed IFIs in paediatric cancer patients at a quaternary referral centre (Royal Children’s Hospital) in Victoria, Australia from 1st April 2004 to 31st December 2013. Methods ICD-10-AM codes denoting IFI in paediatric patients (<18-years) with haematologic or solid tumour malignancies were extracted from the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset and linked to the r-TERIFIC dataset. Sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and the F1 scores of the ICD-10-AM codes were calculated. Results Of 1,671 evaluable patients, 113 (6.76%) had confirmed IFI diagnoses according to gold-standard criteria, while 114 (6.82%) cases were identified using the codes. Of the clinical IFI cases, 68 were in receipt of ≥1 ICD-10-AM code(s) for IFI, corresponding to an overall sensitivity, PPV and F1 score of 60%, respectively. Sensitivity was highest for proven IFI (77% [95% CI: 58–90]; F1 = 47%) and invasive candidiasis (83% [95% CI: 61–95]; F1 = 76%) and lowest for other/unspecified IFI (20% [95% CI: 5.05–72%]; F1 = 5.00%). The most frequent misclassification was coding of invasive aspergillosis as invasive candidiasis. Conclusion ICD-10-AM codes demonstrate moderate sensitivity and PPV to detect IFI in children with cancer. However, specific subsets of proven IFI and invasive candidiasis (codes B37.x) are more accurately coded."

Working from prior literature on rising employment dualization and the fissuring of workplaces into high and low wage employers, we explore a set of organizational explanations for rising between and within workplace inequality focusing on the role of employment dualization, skill segregation/complexity, and firm fissuring. We describe and model these hypothesized processes with administrative data on a large random sample panel of German workplaces. We find that rising inequalities are associated with polarization in industrial wage rates and the birth of new low wage workplaces, as well as increased establishment skill specialization and the growth of part-time jobs in workplace divisions of labor. We conclude with recommendations for future research that directly examines more proximate mechanisms and their relative importance in different institutional contexts."

Human behavior is reportedly one of the critical factors in the occurrence of such injuries. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation of abnormal driving behaviors with the frequency and severity of RTIs among drivers in Hamadan, west of Iran.The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 800 people driving, who were selected by multistage cluster sampling technique. Data were collected using a three-part self-administered questionnaire including demographic, social and driving characteristics; the Manchester driver behavior questionnaire (DBQ); as well as information on a history of the occurrence of the injuries caused by the crashes and the severity of them. Data were statistically analyzed using numerical indices, linear regression analysis, Pearson correlation, ordinal logistic regression model and multinomial logistic regression.The highest and lowest mean percentages of abnormal driving behavior were related to unintentional violations (19.13) and Lapses (16.44), respectively. ""Changing radio stations and listening to music while driving"", ""overtaking a driver who drives slowly"", and ""unintentionally exceeding the speed limit"" were the three highest behaviors associated with road traffic injuries, with the mean and standard deviation of (1.93 ± 1.4), (1.90±1.4), (1.58±1.3), respectively. Age, gender, educational level, driving experience and driving hours during the day were significantly associated with DBQ dimensions and severity of road traffic injuries.The results of this study showed that socio-demographic characteristics were significantly correlated with driving behavior. In addition, driving behaviors were correlated with traffic crashes and the resulting injuries. The findings of this study can be utilized to develop driving behavior interventions among the drivers."
https://openalex.org/W3083812680,"Motivation Determining intracellular metabolic flux through isotope labeling techniques such as 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) incurs significant cost and effort. Previous studies have shown transcriptomic data coupled with constraint-based metabolic modeling can determine intracellular fluxes that correlate highly with 13C-MFA measured fluxes and can achieve higher accuracy than constraint-based metabolic modeling alone. These studies, however, used validation data limited to E. coli and S. cerevisiae grown on glucose, with significantly similar flux distribution for central metabolism. It is unclear whether those results apply to more diverse metabolisms, and therefore further, extensive validation is needed. Results In this paper, we formed a dataset of transcriptomic data coupled with corresponding 13C-MFA flux data for 21 experimental conditions in different unicellular organisms grown on varying carbon substrates and conditions. Three computational flux-balance analysis (FBA) methods were comparatively assessed. The results show when uptake rates of carbon sources and key metabolites are known, transcriptomic data provides no significant advantage over constraint-based metabolic modeling (average correlation coefficients, transcriptomic E-Flux2 0.725 and SPOT 0.650 vs non-transcriptomic pFBA 0.768). When uptake rates are unknown, however, predictions obtained utilizing transcriptomic data are generally good and significantly better than those obtained using constraint-based metabolic modeling alone (E-Flux2 0.385 and SPOT 0.583 vs pFBA 0.237). Thus, transcriptomic data coupled with constraint-based metabolic modeling is a promising method to obtain intracellular flux estimates in microorganisms, particularly in cases where uptake rates of key metabolites cannot be easily determined, such as for growth in complex media or in vivo conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3084156731,"Introduction New financial incentives, such as reduced Medicare reimbursements, have led hospitals to closely monitor their readmission rates and initiate efforts aimed at reducing them. In this context, many surgical departments participate in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), which collects detailed demographic, laboratory, clinical, procedure and perioperative occurrence data. The availability of such data enables the development of data science methods which predict readmissions and, as done in this paper, offer specific recommendations aimed at preventing readmissions. Materials and methods This study leverages NSQIP data for 722,101 surgeries to develop predictive and prescriptive models, predicting readmissions and offering real-time, personalized treatment recommendations for surgical patients during their hospital stay, aimed at reducing the risk of a 30-day readmission. We applied a variety of classification methods to predict 30-day readmissions and developed two prescriptive methods to recommend pre-operative blood transfusions to increase the patient’s hematocrit with the objective of preventing readmissions. The effect of these interventions was evaluated using several predictive models. Results Predictions of 30-day readmissions based on the entire collection of NSQIP variables achieve an out-of-sample accuracy of 87% (Area Under the Curve—AUC). Predictions based only on pre-operative variables have an accuracy of 74% AUC, out-of-sample. Personalized interventions, in the form of pre-operative blood transfusions identified by the prescriptive methods, reduce readmissions by 12%, on average, for patients considered as candidates for pre-operative transfusion (pre-operative hematoctic <30). The prediction accuracy of the proposed models exceeds results in the literature. Conclusions This study is among the first to develop a methodology for making specific, data-driven, personalized treatment recommendations to reduce the 30-day readmission rate. The reported predicted reduction in readmissions can lead to more than $20 million in savings in the U.S. annually."

The aim of this study was to explore the incidence of dentinal cracks after root canal instrumentation with various rotary systems, in vitro. One hundred and eighty intact lower central incisors were selected and randomly divided into fourteen treatment groups (n = 12/group) and a control group (n = 12). After decoronation, the root canals were instrumented with fourteen different rotary systems (E3, E3 azure, NT2, Hyflex CM, Hyflex EDM, 2Shape, OneCurve, ProTaper Next, ProTaper Gold, WaveOne Gold, Mtwo, Reciproc Blue, TF adaptive, K3XF). All roots were horizontally sectioned at 3, 6, and 9 mm from the apex with a low-speed saw under water-cooling. The slices were then examined under stereomicroscope for dentinal cracks. No cracks were found in the control group. Cracks were found in all treatment groups, predominantly in the 3 mm slices. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of cracks when comparing the different systems to each other at any section level. At 3 mm, however, five of the studied systems, namely K3XF (p = 0.004), Protaper Next (p = 0.001), Reciproc Blue (p<0.001), TF adaptive (p = 0.050), and 2Shape (p = 0.009) presented a significantly higher number of cracks than the control group. Within the limitations of this study, instrumented canals presented dentinal cracks, while uninstrumented ones presented no cracks after sectioning. There seems to be no significant difference among the tested systems regarding crack formation in the instrumented root canal wall. Crack formation occurred irrespective of the motion of the rotary system (rotational or reciprocation). Further studies are needed to clarify the factors that contribute to crack formation in the case of each individual rotary system."

In the present study, we isolated one new (ganyearmcaoone A, 1) and eight known compounds (2-9) from a water extract of the dried roots of ganyearmcao; all of the compounds were isolated for the first time from this medicinal plant. We elucidated the chemical structures of these compounds using comprehensive analyses of HR-ESI-MS and 1D, 2D NMR. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of the nine compounds on lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells; we did so using photographic and quantitative assessments of the lipid content with oil red O staining and by measuring triglyceride levels. Compared with the control, compounds 6 and 9 significantly inhibited differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and lipid accumulation. Compound 1 showed potential inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation. Molecular docking results indicated that compounds 6 and 9 may efficiently bind to AMPK and its downstream kinase (SCD1), thereby inhibiting lipid accumulation.

Although there is a possibility that the extracellular domain of these slit diaphragm proteins can be a target for a pathological proteolysis, the precise mechanism driving the phenomenon remains unknown. Here we show that Matriptase, a membrane-anchored protein, was activated at podocytes in CKD patients and mice, whereas Matriptase inhibitors slowed the progression of mouse kidney disease. The mechanism could be accounted for by an imbalance favoring Matriptase over its cognate inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1), because conditional depletion of HAI-1 in podocytes accelerated podocyte injury in mouse model. Matriptase was capable of cleaving Podocin, but such a reaction was blocked by either HAI-1 or dominant-negative Matriptase. Furthermore, the N terminus of Podocin, as a consequence of Matriptase cleavage of Podocin, translocated to nucleoli, suggesting that the N terminus of Podocin might be involved in the process of podocyte injury.

An increasing number of CKD patients end up suffering from end-stage renal disease, requiring renal hemodialysis, and loading huge financial burden on the shoulder of their home countries. Developing specific treatments for curing CKD are warranted. The glomerular filtration unit consists of three layers: fenestrated endothelial cells, the glomerular basement membrane, and podocytes (2Lenz O. Elliot S.J. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Matrix metalloproteinases in renal development and disease.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11 (10703682): 574-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Podocytes, a major cell type of renal glomerulus, are terminally differentiated and interdigitate with adjacent podocytes to form glomerular filtration barrier (3Brinkkoetter P.T. Ising C. Benzing T.

Interdigitated foot processes of podocytes form a 40-nm-wide cell junction that is composed of several proteins called slit diaphragm (SD) proteins. Podocyte injury is often associated with a loss of SD proteins, and the unique characteristic of several SD proteins with the extracellular domain might be a key to understand podocyte injury. However, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. Proteolysis is a physiological process that is required for the maintenance of renal physiology at multiple levels, including gene transcription, cell trafficking, and extracellular secretion. Aberrant activation of proteolysis is likely involved in the pathogenesis of renal disease. In particular, a number of protease families likely play a key role for the development of renal fibrosis, including, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), serine proteases, and cathepsins (4Eddy A.A.

Podocyte injury is often initiated by SD disruption, but its precise mechanism has yet to be clarified. Recently, it was shown that a nonspecific serine protease inhibitor, camostat mesilate, slowed the progression of renal disease caused by the protection of podocytes (7Hayata M. Kakizoe Y. Uchimura K. Morinaga J. Yamazoe R. Mizumoto T. Onoue T. Ueda M. Shiraishi N. Adachi M. Miyoshi T. Sakai Y. Tomita K. Kitamura K. Effect of a serine protease inhibitor on the progression of chronic renal failure.Am. J. Physiol.

Nonetheless, the specific type of enzyme involved in this process also remains unknown. We established a model of adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy in mice developing albuminuria and podocyte injury with a reduction in mRNA expressions for several markers of podocytes in mouse glomerulus, including Podocin, Synaptopodin, and WT-1 (Fig. S1, A–D). Podocyte injury was also histologically confirmed by periodic acid–Schiff reagent staining and immunohistochemistry. Likewise, desmin, a marker of podocyte injury, was up-regulated along with glomerular injury (data not shown). Interestingly, the injured podocytes still expressed, to some extent, both Nephrin and Podocin in this model (Fig. S1E). A microarray analysis using glomeruli of ADR nephropathy mice identified 15 serine proteases, which were highly up-regulated (>2.0-fold) in glomeruli of mice with ADR nephropathy. This is compared with control mice at 6 weeks after administration (Fig. 1A and Table S1). Among these factors, only a type II transmembrane serine protease Matriptase (also known as suppressor of tumorigenicity 14 protein, or ST14) is expressed at the epithelial cell junctions in a wide variety of tissues (8Tanabe L.M. List K. The role of type II transmembrane serine protease-mediated signaling in cancer.FEBS J. 2017; 284 (27870503): 1421-143610.1111/febs.13971Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We examined the expressions of other type II transmembrane serine protease and found that Matriptase was induced at mRNA and protein levels in glomeruli of ADR mice at day 42 (Figs. 1, B and C, and 2, A–C). In particular, Matriptase was predominantly expressed in podocytes (Fig. 2C). Likewise, Matriptase expression was only detected in cultured podocytes but not in cultured endothelium and mesangial cells (data not shown). Glomerular Matriptase protein was also significantly higher in patients with clinical proteinuria because of diabetic nephropathy or membranous nephropathy but not in subjects with IgA nephropathy who had no clinical proteinuria (Fig. 2D).Figure 2Matriptase is induced in podocytes of mice with ADR nephropathy and patients with clinical proteinuria. A, immunohistochemistry showed an increase in glomerular Matriptase protein expression. RT–quantitative PCR showed a significant increase in mRNA expression of glomerular Matriptase and quantitative analysis using immunohistochemistry confirmed the protein expression in mice with ADR nephropathy compared with control mice. B, glomerular serine protease activity was enhanced in ADR mice compared with control mice. C, Matriptase (green) was co-localized (yellow) with Nephrin (red) in glomerulus of mouse with ADR nephropathy. D, Matriptase protein expression was observed in human glomerulus of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and membranous nephropathy (MN), whereas it was negative in that of IgA nephropathy (IgAN).

Among 13 candidate genes (Fig. S2A), HAI-1 level was significantly up-regulated in the podocytes (confirmed by immunohistochemistry) and in the serum of diabetic eNOS-KO mice (Fig. 3, A–C, and Fig. S2B). A microarray analysis showed that glomerular Matriptase mRNA expression was highly up-regulated by 5.3 times in diabetic eNOS-KO mice compared with eNOS-KO mice (Fig. S2, C and D). Analyses of these two independent mouse models suggest that the Matriptase/HAI-1 pathway plays a key role in podocyte injury and could therefore be a potential therapeutic target for kidney disease. Matriptase and HAI-1 are co-expressed in many epithelial cells (12Oberst M. Anders J. Xie B. Singh B. Ossandon M. Johnson M. Dickson R.B. Lin C.-Y. Matriptase and HAI-1 are expressed by normal and malignant epithelial cells in vitro in vivo.Am. J.

In turn, an imbalance favoring Matriptase over HAI-1 contributes to various diseases (14Saleem M. Adhami V.M. Zhong W. Longley B.J. Lin C.-Y. Dickson R.B. Reagan-Shaw S. Jarrard D.F. Mukhtar H.

According to the Nephroseq database, HAI-1 is induced (1.5-fold), along with 2-fold increase in Matriptase expression, in the podocytes of diabetic nephropathy. This indicates that enhancing Matriptase activation over HAI-1 could be a potential mechanism for the progression of podocyte injury. Consistent with these observations, the podocyte-specific depletion of HAI-1 deteriorated podocyte injury in ADR nephropathy (Fig. 3, D and E, and Fig. S3, A–C). Podocyte injury could be accounted for by aberrant Matriptase activation caused by the absence of HAI-1 in the podocyte. To develop a therapeutic approach to nephropathy, we subsequently examined whether the selective inhibition of Matriptase could protect kidneys from disease progression. We examined two types of serine protease inhibitors toward Matriptase activity: a selective peptide-mimetic inhibitor of Matriptase (IN-1) (18Colombo É. Désilets A. Duchêne D. Chagnon F. Najmanovich R. Leduc R. Marsault E. Design and synthesis of potent, selective inhibitors of Matriptase.ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2012; 3 (24900505): 530-53410.1021/ml3000534Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and a synthetic nonspecific serine protease inhibitor nafamostat mesilate (NM), which ameliorates rat kidney disease (7Hayata M. Kakizoe Y. Uchimura K. Morinaga J. Yamazoe R. Mizumoto T. Onoue T. Ueda M. Shiraishi N. Adachi M. Miyoshi T. Sakai Y. Tomita K. Kitamura K. Effect of a serine protease inhibitor on the progression of chronic renal failure.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2012; 303 (22832926): F1126-F113510.1152/ajprenal.00706.2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It was found that the two compounds inhibited Matriptase activity in a dose-response manner, and inhibitory effects were nearly equipotent, with an IC50 of IN-1 of 1.3 nm versus the IC50 of NM at 0.86 nm (Fig. 4A). However, inhibition assays toward thrombin activity showed that IC50 was 2.8 μm for IN-1, whereas it was 99 nm for NM (Fig. 4B), suggesting that IN-1 is more specific to Matriptase than NM. To examine the therapeutic effect of IN-1, this compound was applied to BALB/c mice with ADR nephropathy upon 15 days after ADR treatment. We observed that Matriptase inhibitor IN-1 slowed the progression of ADR nephropathy with blocking podocyte injury and ameliorated albuminuria (Fig. 4, C–F). Likewise, NM-1 also blocked the glomerular injury and suppressed urinary albumin excretion in mice with ADR nephropathy (Fig. S4). These results indicate that blocking Matriptase could be a potential therapeutic approach against chronic kidney diseases. Next, we sought to identify the substrates of Matriptase in podocytes. Interestingly, Matriptase was found to directly cleave mouse Podocin (mPodocin) (Fig. S5, A and I) but not with other slit membrane proteins, such as Claudin5, β-Catenin, or Nephrin (Fig. S5, B–D). Fig. 5A shows that enzymatic dead G827R Matriptase mutant failed to cleave mPodocin, and multiple bands in anti-His blot indicated that Matriptase was activated by self-cleavage at multiple sites. The mPodocin was cleaved at the membrane but not in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). A mutagenesis on mPodocin identified Arg50 as the specific cleavage site of Matriptase and not at Arg36, Arg45, or Arg54 (Fig. 5C and Fig. S5, H and I). Matriptase cleavage of mPodocin was blocked by co-expression of WT, as well as the extracellular domain of HAI-1 (Fig. 5D). We also identified the fragmented cleaved mPodocin in the urine of mice with ADR nephropathy (Fig. S5E), suggesting that Matriptase cleaves Podocin in in vivo. Exogenous expression of mPodocin N-terminal fragment (mPodocin-N; 2–50 amino acids) showed the mPodocin-N as being localized in the nucleus, whereas full-length mPodocin and △N-mPodocin (51–385 amino acids) remained at the plasma membrane (Fig. 5E). Human Podocin (hPodocin) was also cleaved by Matriptase (Fig. S5G). N-terminal fragment of hPodocin (hPodocin-N) appears to be co-localized with Fibrillarin, a marker of nucleoli, suggesting that hPodocin-N migrated to the nucleus and bound nucleoli (Fig. S6B). Podocytes have been found to produce other types of proteases, matrix metalloproteases MMP-2 and -9, all of which are believed to have significant roles within the glomerulus because they degrade type IV collagen, a major protein of the glomerular basement membrane (19Lelongt B. Legallicier B. Piedagnel R. Ronco P.M. Do matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 (gelatinases) play a role in renal development, physiology and glomerular diseases?.Curr. Opin. Nephrol.

It has also been observed that altered MMPs/tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) balance leads to increased extracellular matrix deposition or excessive degradation activity, a finding with critical implications for glomerular diseases (2Lenz O.

The up-regulation of MMP-9 expression can be found in several glomerular diseases accompanied by proteinuria in human patients (20McMillan J.I. Riordan J.W. Couser W.G. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H.

Podocytes express CD40 and CD154, the ligand of CD40, to induce MMP-9 expression in an autocrine fashion (23Rigothier C. Daculsi R. Lepreux S. Auguste P. Villeneuve J. Dewitte A. Doudnikoff E.

In various diseases, coagulation proteases also contribute to tissue injuries, including cancer progression and cardiovascular diseases. These injuries are mediated by protease-activated receptors (PARs) (24Schaffner F. Ruf W. Tissue factor and protease-activated receptor signaling in cancer.Semin. Thromb.

Consistent with findings from an earlier study suggesting that PARs play a role in kidney disease progression (26Harris J.J. McCarthy H.J. Ni L. Wherlock M. Kang H. Wetzels J.F. Welsh G.I. Saleem M.A. Active proteases in nephrotic plasma lead to a Podocin-dependent phosphorylation of VASP in podocytes via protease activated receptor-1.J. Pathol. 2013; 229 (23436459): 660-67110.1002/path.4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), PAR-1 has indeed been found to contribute to the development of podocyte and glomerular injuries (27Guan Y. Nakano D. Zhang Y. Li L. Liu W. Nishida M. Kuwabara T. Morishita A. Hitomi H. Mori K. Mukoyama M. Masaki T. Hirano K. Nishiyama A.

Sci. 2017; 135 (29110957): 81-8810.1016/j.jphs.2017.09.002Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is important to realize that individual proteases induce divergent signaling pathways that lead to differential functional consequences (28Jiang Y. Yau M.K. Kok W.M. Lim J. Wu K.C. Liu L. Hill T.A. Suen J.Y. Fairlie D.P. Biased signaling by agonists of protease activated receptor 2.ACS Chem. Biol. 2017; 12 (28169521): 1217-122610.1021/acschembio.6b01088Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These studies imply that the strategy to target all the proteases via nonspecific protease inhibitor may not always be beneficial; the targeting of specific protease(s) by specific inhibitor(s) may be a better approach. Although proteases play key roles in the maintenance of renal filtration barriers, and there are indications to suggest that serine protease inhibition is involved in kidney disease progression (7Hayata M. Kakizoe Y. Uchimura K. Morinaga J. Yamazoe R. Mizumoto T. Onoue T. Ueda M. Shiraishi N. Adachi M. Miyoshi T. Sakai Y. Tomita K. Kitamura K. Effect of a serine protease inhibitor on the progression of chronic renal failure.Am. J. Physiol.

In this study, we showed that HAI-1 was essential to the protection of podocytes from nephropathy by blocking of Matriptase-mediated cleavage of Podocin. We also demonstrated that a transmembrane serine protease Matriptase acted as a potential therapeutic target, findings that imply a new class of selective peptide-mimetic inhibitor of Matriptase can be applied as a potential drug for the treatment of chronic kidney diseases. Although careful preclinical studies are required before applying the Matriptase inhibitor in clinical practice, our finding that NM, which is commonly used for the treatment of pancreatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (29Murakawa M. Okamura T. Shibuya T. Harada M. Otsuka T. Niho Y. Use of a synthetic protease inhibitor for the treatment of L-asparaginase-induced acute pancreatitis complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation.Ann. Hematol. 1992; 64 (1623061): 249-25210.1007/BF01738305Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), also protects the kidney from disease progression might give some reassurance that the inhibition of Matriptase is a safe and promising approach. In conclusion, we identified Matriptase as a potential cause for podocyte injury. The aberrantly activated enzyme beyond the suppression by HAI-1 potently cleaves Podocin and disturbs podocyte integrity, leading to renal injury. Most surprisingly, Podocin-N migrates to the nucleus and binds nucleoli, indicating its roles in physiological and active cell death process. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with either the Animal Experimentation Committee of Kyoto University, Tanabe R&D Service Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), or both. The protocol was approved by the animal care and use committee. Male C57BL/6J-Nos3tm1nc (eNOS-KO) mice at 7 weeks of age were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).

https://openalex.org/W3084163480,"A negative energy balance (NEB) is detrimental to reproduction in animals. A suggested link between NEB and reproductive failure is the gastrointestinal hormone ghrelin, because of the association between ghrelin and the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. The [D-Lys3]-Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide-6 ([D-Lys3]-GHRP-6) is a ghrelin antagonist that acts on ghrelin receptors (GHS-R1). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 on reproduction variables in feed restricted ewes. Two experiments were conducted. Experiment I was conducted for 30 days; and Experiment II for 13 days. In both experiments the ewes (n = 18) were randomly assigned to: Control (CO): fed to meet maintenance requirements; Feed restriction (FR): 80% of maintenance restriction; or Ghrelin antagonist (GA): feed restricted and daily subcutaneous of 7.5μg/kg of [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6. Plasma was collected to measure hormones and metabolite concentration. In Experiment II, the hypothalamus and ovaries were collected on day 13. In both Experiments, sheep allocated to the FR and GA treatments decreased their body weight compared with sheep in the CO group (P < 0.06); progesterone however, did not differ between treatments (P > 0.10). Experiment I: Plasma ghrelin concentration was greater (P < 0.01) in FR and GA compared with CO ewes. Plasma non-esterified fatty acids concentration was greater (P < 0.01) in GA and FR than CO. Experiment II: Kisspeptin1-Receptor (Kiss1-R) mRNA expression was greater in FR (P < 0.01) and tended to be greater in GA (P = 0.10) compared with CO ewes. The neuro peptide-Y (NPY) mRNA expression was greater (P = 0.03) in FR than CO; and tended to be greater (P = 0.06) compared with GA ewes. Growth hormone releasing hormone (GhRH) mRNA expression was greater in GA (P = 0.04) and tended to be greater in FR (P = 0.07) compared with CO ewes. Feed restriction increased GhRH, NPY, and Kiss-R mRNA expression in hypothalamus without affecting reproductive variables.Ghrelin antagonist may prevent an increase inNPY expression in ewes."
