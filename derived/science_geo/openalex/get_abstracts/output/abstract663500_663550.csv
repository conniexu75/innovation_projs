https://openalex.org/W3101697142,"Although single-cell RNA sequencing studies have begun to provide compendia of cell expression profiles1-9, it has been difficult to systematically identify and localize all molecular cell types in individual organs to create a full molecular cell atlas. Here, using droplet- and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing of approximately 75,000 human cells across all lung tissue compartments and circulating blood, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, we create an extensive cell atlas of the human lung. We define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 out of 45 previously known cell types and 14 previously unknown ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas identifies the biochemical functions of lung cells and the transcription factors and markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signalling interactions and immune cell homing; and identifies cell types that are directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. By comparing human and mouse data, we identified 17 molecular cell types that have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others with substantially altered expression profiles, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types. This atlas provides the molecular foundation for investigating how lung cell identities, functions and interactions are achieved in development and tissue engineering and altered in disease and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3095217725,"The urgent need for an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has forced development to progress in the absence of well-defined correlates of immunity. While neutralization has been linked to protection against other pathogens, whether neutralization alone will be sufficient to drive protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the broader population remains unclear. Therefore, to fully define protective humoral immunity, we dissected the early evolution of the humoral response in 193 hospitalized individuals ranging from moderate to severe. Although robust IgM and IgA responses evolved in both survivors and non-survivors with severe disease, non-survivors showed attenuated IgG responses, accompanied by compromised Fcɣ receptor binding and Fc effector activity, pointing to deficient humoral development rather than disease-enhancing humoral immunity. In contrast, individuals with moderate disease exhibited delayed responses that ultimately matured. These data highlight distinct humoral trajectories associated with resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need for early functional humoral immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3100161724,"The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions led to major transit demand decline for many public transit systems in the United States. This paper is a systematic analysis of the dynamics and dimensions of this unprecedented decline. Using transit demand data derived from a widely used transit navigation app, we fit logistic functions to model the decline in daily demand and derive key parameters: base value , the apparent minimal level of demand and cliff and base points , representing the initial date when transit demand decline began and the final date when the decline rate attenuated. Regression analyses reveal that communities with higher proportions of essential workers, vulnerable populations (African American, Hispanic, Female, and people over 45 years old), and more coronavirus Google searches tend to maintain higher levels of minimal demand during COVID-19. Approximately half of the agencies experienced their decline before the local spread of COVID-19 likely began; most of these are in the US Midwest. Almost no transit systems finished their decline periods before local community spread. We also compare hourly demand profiles for each system before and during COVID-19 using ordinary Procrustes distance analysis. The results show substantial departures from typical weekday hourly demand profiles. Our results provide insights into public transit as an essential service during a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3099442067,"Effective and sustained inhibition of non-enzymatic oncogenic driver proteins is a major pharmacological challenge. The clinical success of thalidomide analogues demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of drug-induced degradation of transcription factors and other cancer targets1-3, but a substantial subset of proteins are resistant to targeted degradation using existing approaches4,5. Here we report an alternative mechanism of targeted protein degradation, in which a small molecule induces the highly specific, reversible polymerization of a target protein, followed by its sequestration into cellular foci and subsequent degradation. BI-3802 is a small molecule that binds to the Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric-à-brac (BTB) domain of the oncogenic transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and leads to the proteasomal degradation of BCL66. We use cryo-electron microscopy to reveal how the solvent-exposed moiety of a BCL6-binding molecule contributes to a composite ligand-protein surface that engages BCL6 homodimers to form a supramolecular structure. Drug-induced formation of BCL6 filaments facilitates ubiquitination by the SIAH1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Our findings demonstrate that a small molecule such as BI-3802 can induce polymerization coupled to highly specific protein degradation, which in the case of BCL6 leads to increased pharmacological activity compared to the effects induced by other BCL6 inhibitors. These findings open new avenues for the development of therapeutic agents and synthetic biology."
https://openalex.org/W3101915523,"Adaptive radiation is the likely source of much of the ecological and morphological diversity of life1-4. How adaptive radiations proceed and what determines their extent remains unclear in most cases1,4. Here we report the in-depth examination of the spectacular adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika. On the basis of whole-genome phylogenetic analyses, multivariate morphological measurements of three ecologically relevant trait complexes (body shape, upper oral jaw morphology and lower pharyngeal jaw shape), scoring of pigmentation patterns and approximations of the ecology of nearly all of the approximately 240 cichlid species endemic to Lake Tanganyika, we show that the radiation occurred within the confines of the lake and that morphological diversification proceeded in consecutive trait-specific pulses of rapid morphospace expansion. We provide empirical support for two theoretical predictions of how adaptive radiations proceed, the 'early-burst' scenario1,5 (for body shape) and the stages model1,6,7 (for all traits investigated). Through the analysis of two genomes per species and by taking advantage of the uneven distribution of species in subclades of the radiation, we further show that species richness scales positively with per-individual heterozygosity, but is not correlated with transposable element content, number of gene duplications or genome-wide levels of selection in coding sequences."
https://openalex.org/W3104338697,"Tumours often contain B cells and plasma cells but the antigen specificity of these intratumoral B cells is not well understood1-8. Here we show that human papillomavirus (HPV)-specific B cell responses are detectable in samples from patients with HPV-positive head and neck cancers, with active production of HPV-specific IgG antibodies in situ. HPV-specific antibody secreting cells (ASCs) were present in the tumour microenvironment, with minimal bystander recruitment of influenza-specific cells, suggesting a localized and antigen-specific ASC response. HPV-specific ASC responses correlated with titres of plasma IgG and were directed against the HPV proteins E2, E6 and E7, with the most dominant response against E2. Using intratumoral B cells and plasma cells, we generated several HPV-specific human monoclonal antibodies, which exhibited a high degree of somatic hypermutation, consistent with chronic antigen exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses detected activated B cells, germinal centre B cells and ASCs within the tumour microenvironment. Compared with the tumour parenchyma, B cells and ASCs were preferentially localized in the tumour stroma, with well-formed clusters of activated B cells indicating ongoing germinal centre reactions. Overall, we show that antigen-specific activated and germinal centre B cells as well as plasma cells can be found in the tumour microenvironment. Our findings provide a better understanding of humoral immune responses in human cancer and suggest that tumour-infiltrating B cells could be harnessed for the development of therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W3099873525,"This survey-based study aimed to explore the mental health status and psychological care needs of 933 health-care workers in Italy during the COVID-19 outbreak. Sociodemographic data, exposure to COVID-19, perception of psychological care needs, depression, anxiety, somatization, and post-traumatic symptoms were concurrently assessed. The majority of the sample (71%) suffered from somatization and 55% of distress. Female care workers experienced higher levels of anxiety (d = 0.50) and somatization symptoms (d = 0.82) and stated they needed psychological care more than men (p &lt; .001). Younger participants (aged &lt;40 years-old) reported higher levels of somatization, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms (effects size range from d = 0.22 to d = 0.31). Working in a high infected area (red-zones) and directly with COVID-19 patients (front-line) affected the psychological health of participants to a smaller degree. Health-care workers who lost one of their patients reported higher levels of depression (d = 0.22), anxiety (d = 0.19), post-traumatic symptoms (d = 0.30), and psychological care needs than those who did not have the same experience (p &lt; .01). Health-care workers who perceived the need for psychological support scored above the clinical alarming level (cut-off scores) in all the psychological scales, ranging from 76% to 88%. Psychological distress (p &lt; .01), anxiety (p &lt; .05), depression (p &lt; .05), and being women (p &lt; .01) contribute to explain the need for psychological care and accounted for 32% of the variance in this sample. These findings point out the importance to consider the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Italian health-care workers and strongly suggest establishing psychological support services for providing adequate professional care."

https://openalex.org/W3104494422,"Recent analyses have reported catastrophic global declines in vertebrate populations1,2. However, the distillation of many trends into a global mean index obscures the variation that can inform conservation measures and can be sensitive to analytical decisions. For example, previous analyses have estimated a mean vertebrate decline of more than 50% since 1970 (Living Planet Index2). Here we show, however, that this estimate is driven by less than 3% of vertebrate populations; if these extremely declining populations are excluded, the global trend switches to an increase. The sensitivity of global mean trends to outliers suggests that more informative indices are needed. We propose an alternative approach, which identifies clusters of extreme decline (or increase) that differ statistically from the majority of population trends. We show that, of taxonomic-geographic systems in the Living Planet Index, 16 systems contain clusters of extreme decline (comprising around 1% of populations; these extreme declines occur disproportionately in larger animals) and 7 contain extreme increases (around 0.4% of populations). The remaining 98.6% of populations across all systems showed no mean global trend. However, when analysed separately, three systems were declining strongly with high certainty (all in the Indo-Pacific region) and seven were declining strongly but with less certainty (mostly reptile and amphibian groups). Accounting for extreme clusters fundamentally alters the interpretation of global vertebrate trends and should be used to help to prioritize conservation efforts."

https://openalex.org/W3099502543,"<h2>Summary</h2> Adult stem cells (SCs) transit between the cell cycle and a poorly defined quiescent state. Single neural SCs (NSCs) with quiescent, primed-for-activation, and activated cell transcriptomes have been obtained from the subependymal zone (SEZ), but the functional regulation of these states under homeostasis is not understood. Here, we develop a multilevel strategy to analyze these NSC states with the aim to uncover signals that regulate their level of quiescence/activation. We show that transitions between states occur <i>in vivo</i> and that activated and primed, but not quiescent, states can be captured and studied in culture. We also show that peripherally induced inflammation promotes a transient activation of primed NSCs (pNSCs) mediated by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) acting through its receptor, TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), and a return to quiescence in a TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)-dependent manner. Our data identify a signaling pathway promoting NSC alertness and add to the emerging concept that SCs can respond to the systemic milieu."
https://openalex.org/W3100273862,"Cell differentiation typically occurs with concomitant shape transitions to enable specialized functions. To adopt a different shape, cells need to change the mechanical properties of their surface. However, whether cell surface mechanics control the process of differentiation has been relatively unexplored. Here we show that membrane mechanics gate exit from naive pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells. By measuring membrane tension during early differentiation, we find that naive stem cells release their plasma membrane from the underlying actin cortex when transitioning to a primed state. By mechanically tethering the plasma membrane to the cortex by enhancing Ezrin activity or expressing a synthetic signaling-inert linker, we demonstrate that preventing this detachment forces stem cells to retain their naive pluripotent identity. We thus identify a decrease in membrane-to-cortex attachment as a new cell-intrinsic mechanism that is essential for stem cells to exit pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W3081724017,"Aquatic birds represent a vast reservoir from which new pandemic influenza A viruses can emerge1. Influenza viruses contain a negative-sense segmented RNA genome that is transcribed and replicated by the viral heterotrimeric RNA polymerase (FluPol) in the context of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes2,3. RNA polymerases of avian influenza A viruses (FluPolA) replicate viral RNA inefficiently in human cells because of species-specific differences in acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32), a family of essential host proteins for FluPol activity4. Host-adaptive mutations, particularly a glutamic-acid-to-lysine mutation at amino acid residue 627 (E627K) in the 627 domain of the PB2 subunit, enable avian FluPolA to overcome this restriction and efficiently replicate viral RNA in the presence of human ANP32 proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms of genome replication and the interplay with ANP32 proteins remain largely unknown. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of influenza C virus polymerase (FluPolC) in complex with human and chicken ANP32A. In both structures, two FluPolC molecules form an asymmetric dimer bridged by the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain of ANP32A. The C-terminal low-complexity acidic region of ANP32A inserts between the two juxtaposed PB2 627 domains of the asymmetric FluPolA dimer, suggesting a mechanism for how the adaptive PB2(E627K) mutation enables the replication of viral RNA in mammalian hosts. We propose that this complex represents a replication platform for the viral RNA genome, in which one of the FluPol molecules acts as a replicase while the other initiates the assembly of the nascent replication product into a viral ribonucleoprotein complex."
https://openalex.org/W3105847615,"Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a neurotropic alphavirus transmitted by mosquitoes that causes encephalitis and death in humans1. VEEV is a biodefence concern because of its potential for aerosol spread and the current lack of sufficient countermeasures. The host factors that are required for VEEV entry and infection remain poorly characterized. Here, using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screen, we identify low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain-containing 3 (LDLRAD3)-a highly conserved yet poorly characterized member of the scavenger receptor superfamily-as a receptor for VEEV. Gene editing of mouse Ldlrad3 or human LDLRAD3 results in markedly reduced viral infection of neuronal cells, which is restored upon complementation with LDLRAD3. LDLRAD3 binds directly to VEEV particles and enhances virus attachment and internalization into host cells. Genetic studies indicate that domain 1 of LDLRAD3 (LDLRAD3(D1)) is necessary and sufficient to support infection by VEEV, and both anti-LDLRAD3 antibodies and an LDLRAD3(D1)-Fc fusion protein block VEEV infection in cell culture. The pathogenesis of VEEV infection is abrogated in mice with deletions in Ldlrad3, and administration of LDLRAD3(D1)-Fc abolishes disease caused by several subtypes of VEEV, including highly virulent strains. The development of a decoy-receptor fusion protein suggests a strategy for the prevention of severe VEEV infection and associated disease in humans."

https://openalex.org/W3105713537,"The regulation of signalling capacity, combined with the spatiotemporal distribution of developmental signals themselves, is pivotal in setting developmental responses in both plants and animals1. The hormone auxin is a key signal for plant growth and development that acts through the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors2-4. A subset of these, the conserved class A ARFs5, are transcriptional activators of auxin-responsive target genes that are essential for regulating auxin signalling throughout the plant lifecycle2,3. Although class A ARFs have tissue-specific expression patterns, how their expression is regulated is unknown. Here we show, by investigating chromatin modifications and accessibility, that loci encoding these proteins are constitutively open for transcription. Through yeast one-hybrid screening, we identify the transcriptional regulators of the genes encoding class A ARFs from Arabidopsis thaliana and demonstrate that each gene is controlled by specific sets of transcriptional regulators. Transient transformation assays and expression analyses in mutants reveal that, in planta, the majority of these regulators repress the transcription of genes encoding class A ARFs. These observations support a scenario in which the default configuration of open chromatin enables a network of transcriptional repressors to regulate expression levels of class A ARF proteins and modulate auxin signalling output throughout development."
https://openalex.org/W3102342444,"Wildfires have increased in size and frequency in recent decades in many biomes, but have they also become more severe? This question remains under-examined despite fire severity being a critical aspect of fire regimes that indicates fire impacts on ecosystem attributes and associated post-fire recovery. We conducted a retrospective analysis of wildfires larger than 1000 ha in south-eastern Australia to examine the extent and spatial pattern of high-severity burned areas between 1987 and 2017. High-severity maps were generated from Landsat remote sensing imagery. Total and proportional high-severity burned area increased through time. The number of high-severity patches per year remained unchanged but variability in patch size increased, and patches became more aggregated and more irregular in shape. Our results confirm that wildfires in southern Australia have become more severe. This shift in fire regime may have critical consequences for ecosystem dynamics, as fire-adapted temperate forests are more likely to be burned at high severities relative to historical ranges, a trend that seems set to continue under projections of a hotter, drier climate in south-eastern Australia."

https://openalex.org/W3098604035,"Cancer cell metabolism is a targetable vulnerability; however, a precise understanding of metabolic heterogeneity is required. Inactivating mutations in BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) are associated with metastasis in uveal melanoma (UM), the deadliest adult eye cancer. BAP1 functions in UM remain unclear. UM patient sample analysis divided BAP1 mutant UM tumors into two subgroups based on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) gene expression suggesting metabolic heterogeneity. Consistent with patient data, transcriptomic analysis of BAP1 mutant UM cell lines also showed OXPHOShigh or OXPHOSlow subgroups. Integrated RNA sequencing, metabolomics, and molecular analyses showed that OXPHOShigh BAP1 mutant UM cells utilize glycolytic and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways, whereas OXPHOSlow BAP1 mutant UM cells employ fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, the two subgroups responded to different classes of metabolic suppressors. Our findings indicate that targeting cancer metabolism is a promising therapeutic option for BAP1 mutant UM; however, tailored approaches may be required due to metabolic heterogeneities."
https://openalex.org/W3103965653,"Clinical and molecular characterization by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is reported in 35 COVID-19 patients attending the University Hospital in Siena, Italy, from April 7 to May 7, 2020. Eighty percent of patients required respiratory assistance, half of them being on mechanical ventilation. Fiftyone percent had hepatic involvement and hyposmia was ascertained in 3 patients. Searching for common genes by collapsing methods against 150 WES of controls of the Italian population failed to give straightforward statistically significant results with the exception of two genes. This result is not unexpected since we are facing the most challenging common disorder triggered by environmental factors with a strong underlying heritability (50%). The lesson learned from Autism-Spectrum-Disorders prompted us to re-analyse the cohort treating each patient as an independent case, following a Mendelian-like model. We identified for each patient an average of 2.5 pathogenic mutations involved in virus infection susceptibility and pinpointing to one or more rare disorder(s). To our knowledge, this is the first report on WES and COVID-19. Our results suggest a combined model for COVID-19 susceptibility with a number of common susceptibility genes which represent the favorite background in which additional host private mutations may determine disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3099838549,"CrAss-like phages are a recently described expansive group of viruses that includes the most abundant virus in the human gut1–3. The genomes of all crAss-like phages encode a large virion-packaged protein2,4 that contains a DFDxD sequence motif, which forms the catalytic site in cellular multisubunit RNA polymerases (RNAPs)5. Here, using Cellulophaga baltica crAss-like phage phi14:2 as a model system, we show that this protein is a DNA-dependent RNAP that is translocated into the host cell along with the phage DNA and transcribes early phage genes. We determined the crystal structure of this 2,180-residue enzyme in a self-inhibited state, which probably occurs before virion packaging. This conformation is attained with the help of a cleft-blocking domain that interacts with the active site and occupies the cavity in which the RNA–DNA hybrid binds. Structurally, phi14:2 RNAP is most similar to eukaryotic RNAPs that are involved in RNA interference6,7, although most of the phi14:2 RNAP structure (nearly 1,600 residues) maps to a new region of the protein fold space. Considering this structural similarity, we propose that eukaryal RNA interference polymerases have their origins in phage, which parallels the emergence of the mitochondrial transcription apparatus8. The RNA polymerase from the crAss-like bacteriophage phi14:2, which is translocated into the host cell with phage DNA and transcribes early phage genes, is structurally most similar to eukaryotic RNA interference polymerases, suggesting that the latter have a phage origin."
https://openalex.org/W3098151040,"Climate change, as an emerging phenomenon, has led to changes in the distribution, movement, and even risk of extinction of various wildlife species and this has raised concerns among conservation biologists. Different species have two options in the face of climate change, either to adopt or follow their climatic niche to new places through the connectivity of habitats. The modeling of interpatch landscape communications can serve as an effective decision support tool for wildlife managers. This study was conducted to assess the effects of climate change on the distribution and habitat connectivity of the endangered subspecies of Asian black bear ( Ursus thibetanus gedrosianus ) in the southern and southeastern Iran. The presence points of the species were collected in Provinces of Kerman, Hormozgan, and Sistan-Baluchestan. Habitat modeling was done by the Generalized Linear Model, and 3 machine learning models including Maximum Entropy, Back Propagation based artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. In order to achieve the ensemble model, the results of the mentioned models were merged based on the method of “accuracy rate as weight” derived from their validation. To construct pseudo-absence points for the use in the mentioned models, the Ensemble model of presence-only models was used. The modeling was performed using 15 habitat variables related to climatic, vegetation, topographic, and anthropogenic parameters. The three general circulation models of BCC-CSM1, CCSM4, and MRI-CGCM3 were selected under the two scenarios of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 by 2070. To investigate the effect of climate change on the habitat connections, the protected areas of 3 provinces were considered as focal nodes and the connections between them were established based on electrical circuit theory and Pairwise method. The true skill statistic was employed to convert the continuous suitability layers to binary suitable/unsuitable range maps to assess the effectiveness of the protected areas in the coverage of suitable habitats for the species. Due to the high power of the stochastic forest model in determining the importance of variables, this method was used. The results showed that presence/absence models were successful in the implementation and well distinguished the points of presence and pseudo-absence from each other. Based on the random forests model, the variables of Precipitation of Driest Quarter, Precipitation of Coldest Quarter, and Temperature Annual Range have the greatest impact on the habitat suitability. Comparing the modeling findings to the realities of the species distribution range indicated that the suitable habitats are located in areas with high humidity and rainfall, which are mostly in the northern areas of Bandar Abbas, south of Kerman, and west and south of Sistan-Baluchestan. The area of suitable habitats, in the MRI-CGCM3 (189731 Km 2 ) and CCSM4 (179007 Km 2 ) models under the RCP2.6 scenario, is larger than the current distribution (174001 Km 2 ). However, in terms of the performance of protected areas, the optimal coverage of the species by the boundary of the protected areas, under each of the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, is less than the present time. According to the electric circuit theory, connecting the populations in the protected areas of Sistan-Baluchestan province to those in the northern Hormozgan and the southern Kerman would be based on the crossing through the heights of Sistan-Baluchestan and Hormozgan provinces and the plains between these heights would be the movement pinch points under the current and future scenarios. Populations in the protected areas of Kerman have higher quality patch connections than that of the other two provinces. The areas such as Sang-e_Mes, Kouh_Shir, Zaryab, and Bahr_Aseman in Kerman Province and Kouhbaz and Geno in Hormozgan Province can provide suitable habitats for the species in the distribution models. The findings revealed that the conservation of the heights along with the caves inside them could be a protective priority to counteract the effects of climate change on the species."
https://openalex.org/W3099559306,"Many indigenous fermented foods of Northern Thailand and neighbouring regions have traditionally been known for their health benefits. In this study, we explored the communities of bacteria in selected fermented foods which are commonly consumed among ethnic groups around Northern Thailand, for which information on their microbial compositions or their functional properties is still limited. The selected food groups included Thua Nao (alkaline fermented soybean product), Nham (fermented pork sausage/loaf), Nam phak (fermented Chinese cabbage) and Miang (fermented leaves from Miang Tea trees). Bacteria in these fermented foods were isolated and enumerated. Bacterial communities were determined using a culture-independent (pyrosequencing) approach. Lactic acid bacteria were recovered from all of these fermented food samples, with levels ranging from 3.1 to 7.5 log CFU/g throughout the fermentation processes. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene from the fermented food samples using 454-pyrosequencing resulted in 113,844 sequences after quality evaluation. Lactic acid bacteria were found in high proportions in Nham, Nam phak and Miang. Bacillus was predominant in Thua nao, in which significant proportions of Lactic acid bacteria of the family Leuconostocaceae were also found. Groups of lactic acid bacteria found varied among different food samples, but three genera were predominant: Lactococcus , Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc , of which many members are recognised as probiotics. The results showed that these traditional Thai fermented food products are rich sources of beneficial bacteria and can potentially be functional/probiotic foods."
https://openalex.org/W3101780951,"Cassava will have a vital role to play, if food security is to be achieved in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially Central and East Africa. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci poses a major threat to cassava production by small holder farmers in part due to their role as a vector of cassava mosaic begomoviruses (CMBs) and cassava brown streak ipomoviruses (CBSIs). In the present study untargeted metabolomics has been used as a tool to assess natural variation, similarities and attempts to identify trait differentiators among an East African cassava diversity panel that displayed tolerance/resistance to the effects of Bemisia tabaci infestation. The metabolome captured, was represented by 1529 unique chemical features per accession. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified a 23% variation across the panel, with geographical origin/adaption the most influential classification factors. Separation based on resistance and susceptible traits to Bemisia tabaci could also be observed within the data and was corroborated by genotyping data. Thus the metabolomics pipeline represented an effective metabotyping approach. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) of both the metabolomics and genotyping data was performed and revealed a high level of similarity between accessions. Specific differentiating features/metabolites were identified, including those potentially conferring vigour to whitefly tolerance on a constitutive manner. The implications of using these cassava varieties as parental breeding material and the future potential of incorporating more exotic donor material is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3104404898,"Objective In Nigeria, unmet need for contraception is high despite improved access to modern contraception. To identify factors that support Nigerian women’s contraceptive decisions to achieve their reproductive goals, in the presence or absence of their partner’s support, we seek to identify individual/couple and community level determinants of a spectrum of contraceptive practices, from non-use to covert and overt use of contraception. Methods Data were drawn from a national probability survey conducted by Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 in Nigeria in 2017–2018. A sample of 12,948 women 15–49 years was included, 6433 of whom were in need of contraception at the time of the survey. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analysis to identify individual/couple and community level factors associated with covert use relative to non-use and to overt use of contraception. Results Altogether, 58.0% of women in need of contraception were non-users, 4.5% were covert users and 37.5% used contraception overtly. Covert users were more educated and wealthier than non-users, but less educated and less wealthy than overt users. Covert users were less likely to cohabitate with their partner compared to non-users [AOR = 4.60 (95%CI: 3.06–6.93)] and overt users [AOR = 5.01 (95%CI: 3.24–7.76)] and more likely to reside in urban areas. At the community level, covert users were more likely to live in communities with higher contraceptive prevalence and higher levels of female education relative to non-users. They were also more likely to live in communities with higher female employment [AOR = 1.62, (95%CI: 0.96–2.73)] compared to overt users. Conclusion By identifying individual and community level factors associated with the spectrum from non-use to covert use and overt use of contraception, this study highlights the importance of integrating individual and community interventions to support women’s realization of their reproductive goals."
https://openalex.org/W3098509437,"Background Obesity is a major public health with increasing numbers of obese individuals are at risk for kidney disease. However, the validity of serum creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimating equations in obese population is yet to be determined. Methods We evaluated the performance of the reexpressed Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), reexpressed MDRD with Thai racial factor, Thai estimated GFR (eGFR) as well as Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations among obese patients, defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m 2 with the reference measured GFR (mGFR) determined by 99m Tc-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid ( 99m Tc-DTPA) plasma clearance method. Serum creatinine levels were measured using standardized enzymatic method simultaneously with GFR measurement. The statistical methods in assessing agreement for continuous data including total deviation index (TDI), concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and coverage probability (CP) for each estimating equation were compared with the reference mGFR. Accuracy within 10% representing the percentage of estimations falling within the range of ±10% of mGFR values for all equations were also tested. Results A total of 240 Thai obese patients were finally recruited with mean BMI of 31.5 ± 5.8 kg/m 2 . In the total population, all eGFR equations underestimated the reference mGFR. The average TDI values were 55% indicating that 90% of the estimates falling within the range of -55 to +55% of the reference mGFR. The CP values averaged 0.23 and CCC scores ranged from 0.75 to 0.81, reflecting the low to moderate levels of agreement between each eGFR equation and the reference mGFR. The proportions of patients achieving accuracy 10% ranged from 23% for the reexpressed MDRD equation to 33% for the Thai eGFR formula. Among participants with BMI more than 35 kg/m 2 (n = 48), the mean error of all equations was extremely wide and significantly higher for all equations compared with the lower BMI category. Also, the strength of agreement evaluated by TDI, CCC, and CP were low in the subset of patients with BMI ≥35 kg/m 2 . Conclusion Estimating equations generally underestimated the reference mGFR in subjects with obesity. The overall performance of GFR estimating equations demonstrated poor concordance with the reference mGFR among individuals with high BMI levels.

Methods In a nested case-control study, 50 women with GDM who spontaneously conceived and delivered a live-born infant were matched with a total of 100 uncomplicated singleton control pregnancies based on body mass index (± 2 kg/m 2 ), gestational age at sampling (exact day) and maternal age (± 2 years). In serum samples, obtained between 70–90 days gestational age, sFRP4, Chemerin, Leptin and Adiponectin concentrations were determined by ELISA. Statistical comparisons were performed using univariate and multi-variate logistic regression analysis after logarithmic transformation of the concentrations. Discrimination of the models was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC). Results First trimester sFRP4 concentrations were significantly increased in GDM cases (2.04 vs 1.93 ng/ml; p&lt;0.05), just as Chemerin (3.19 vs 3.15 ng/ml; p&lt;0.05) and Leptin (1.44 vs 1.32 ng/ml; p&lt;0.01). Adiponectin concentrations were significantly decreased (2.83 vs 2.94 ng/ml; p&lt;0.01) in GDM cases. Further analysis only showed a weak, though significant, correlation of sFRP4 with Chemerin (R 2 = 0.124; p&lt;0.001) and Leptin (R 2 = 0.145; p&lt;0.001), and Chemerin with Leptin (R 2 = 0.282; p&lt;0.001) in the control group. In a multivariate logistic regression model of these four markers, only Adiponectin showed to be significantly associated with GDM (odds ratio 0.12, 95%CI 0.02–0.68). The AUC of this model was 0.699 (95%CI 0.605–0.793). Conclusion In the first trimester of pregnancy, a multi-marker model with sFRP4, Leptin, Chemerin and Adiponectin is associated with the development of GDM. Therefore, this panel seems to be an interesting candidate to further evaluate for prediction of GDM in a prospective study."
https://openalex.org/W3100956938,"Introduction Little is known about the effects of HIV reservoir research at the end of life on staff members involved. Staff members’ perceptions and experiences were assessed related to their involvement in the Last Gift, a rapid autopsy study at the University of California San Diego enrolling people living with HIV who are terminally ill and have a desire to contribute to HIV cure-related research. Methods Two focus group discussions consisting of clinical ( n = 7) and rapid research autopsy ( n = 8) staff members were conducted to understand the perspectives of staff members and the impact the Last Gift rapid autopsy study had on them. The total sample consisted of 66.7% females and 33.3% males and was ethnically diverse (66.7% Caucasian, 6.7% African American, 20.0% Asian descent, 6.7% Hispanic descent and American Indian) with a range of experience in the HIV field from 1 year to 30 years. Results Qualitative focus group data revealed five major themes underlying study staff members’ multilayered mental and practical involvement: 1) positive perceptions of the Last Gift study, with sub-themes including Last Gift study participants’ altruism, fulfillment, and control at the end of life, 2) perceptions of staff members’ close involvement in the Last Gift study, with sub-themes related to staff members’ cognitive processing, self-actualization and fulfillment, stress management and resilience, coping mechanisms, and gratitude toward Last Gift participants and toward the study itself, 3) considerations for successful and sustainable study implementation, such as ethical awareness and sustained community and patient engagement, 4) collaborative learning and organizational processes and the value of interdependence between staff members, and 5) considerations for potential study scale-up at other clinical research sites. Discussion Understanding staff members’ nuanced emotional and procedural experiences is crucial to the Last Gift study’s sustainability and will inform similar cure research studies conducted with people living with HIV at the end of life. The study’s potential reproducibility depends on a robust research infrastructure with established, interdependent clinical and rapid autopsy teams, continuous community engagement, and an ethical and well-informed engagement process with people living with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W3105245501,"Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses to humans. In Africa, two subspecies, Ae . aegypti aegypti ( Aaa ) and Ae . aegypti formosus ( Aaf ) have been described. Until very recently, it was considered that the two forms were sympatric in East Africa and that only Aaf was present in Central and West Africa. However, recent data suggests that Aaa was also common in Senegal without any clear evidence of genetic differences with Aaf . This study was carried out in different Ae . aegypti populations from Senegal to better clarify their taxonomic status. The larvae, pupae and eggs were collected between July and September 2018 and reared individually to adult stage. For each population, F 1 progeny from eggs laid by a single female F 0 were reared as sibling samples. The number of pale scales on the first abdominal tergite (T 1 ) and the basal part of the second tergite (T 2 ) were counted. Individuals with no pale scale on T 1 were classified as Aaf while those with at least one pale scale on this tergite were classified as Aaa . The morphological variations within families of Aaf were studied across 4 generations. In total, 2400 individuals constituting 240 families were identified, of which 42.5% were heterogeneous (families with both forms). Multivariate statistical analysis of variance including T 1 and T 2 data together showed that populations were significantly different from each other. Statistical analysis of T 1 alone showed a similarity between populations from the southeast while variations were observed within northwest population. The analysis of family composition across generations showed the presence of Aaa and Aaf forms in each generation. The classification of Ae . aegypti into two subspecies is invalid in Senegal. Populations exhibit morphological polymorphism at the intra-family level that could have biological and epidemiological impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3102249225,"Pain induces deficits in appreciation of rewards (i.e. anhedonia) and variation in response to pain may be partly explained by individual differences in general expectations (i.e. optimism). Dairy calves are routinely subjected to painful procedures such as hot-iron disbudding. We tested if female Holstein calves (n = 17) display signs of anhedonia (as evidenced by reduced consumption of a sweet solution) after hot-iron disbudding (performed under general and local anesthesia), and whether individual differences in optimism explain the variation in this response. Individual variation in optimism was measured using responses to two judgment bias tests (performed when calves were 25 d old), and anhedonia was measured by comparing consumption of a sweet solution before and after hot-iron disbudding. We found that intake of the sweet solution declined (by mean ± SD: 48.4 ± 44.3%) on the day after disbudding, and that more pessimistic calves were more affected. Sweet solution consumption did not return to baseline for the duration of the study (i.e. 5 days). Calves reduced their intake of a sweet solution after hot-iron disbudding, consistent with pain-induced anhedonia, and more pessimistic calves showed stronger evidence of anhedonia, suggesting that they were more affected by the procedure. However, our results cannot rule out the possibility that calf responses were driven by anorexia."
https://openalex.org/W3105016260,"One of the challenges in biocatalysis is the development of stable and efficient bi-enzymatic cascades for bio-redox reactions coupled to the recycling of soluble cofactors. Aldo-keto reductase (LEK) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) can be utilized as the NADPH recycling system for economic and efficient biocatalysis of ( R )-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate (( R )-CHBE), an important chiral pharmaceutical intermediate. The LEK and GDH was efficiently co-immobilized in mesocellular siliceous foams (MCFs) under microwave irradiation (CoLG-MIA). while they were also co-immobilized by entrapment in calcium alginate without MIA as control (CoLG-CA). The relative activity of CoLG-MIA was increased to 140% compared with that of free LEK. The CoLG-MIA exhibited a wider range of pH and temperature stabilities compared with other preparations. The thermal, storage and batch operational stabilities of microwave-assisted immobilized LEK-GDH were also improved. The NADPH recycling system exhibited the potential as the stable and efficient catalyst for the industrial preparation of ( R )-CHBE."
https://openalex.org/W3103403317,"Movements of a tool typically diverge from the movements of the hand manipulating that tool, such as when operating a pivotal lever where tool and hand move in opposite directions. Previous studies suggest that humans are often unaware of the position or movements of their effective body part (mostly the hand) in such situations. It has been suggested that this might be due to a “haptic neglect” of bodily sensations to decrease the interference of representations of body and tool movements. However, in principle this interference could also be decreased by neglecting sensations regarding the tool and focusing instead on body movements. While in most tool use situations the tool-related action effects are task-relevant and thus suppression of body-related rather than tool-related sensations is more beneficial for successful goal achievement, we manipulated this task-relevance in a controlled experiment. The results showed that visual, tool-related effect representations can be suppressed just as proprioceptive, body-related ones in situations where effect representations interfere, given that task-relevance of body-related effects is increased relative to tool-related ones."
https://openalex.org/W3104269042,"This paper analyzes the concordance between bibliometrics and peer review. It draws evidence from the data of two experiments of the Italian governmental agency for research evaluation. The experiments were performed by the agency for validating the adoption in the Italian research assessment exercises of a dual system of evaluation, where some outputs were evaluated by bibliometrics and others by peer review. The two experiments were based on stratified random samples of journal articles. Each article was scored by bibliometrics and by peer review. The degree of concordance between the two evaluations is then computed. The correct setting of the experiments is defined by developing the design-based estimation of the Cohen’s kappa coefficient and some testing procedures for assessing the homogeneity of missing proportions between strata. The results of both experiments show that for each research areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics the degree of agreement between bibliometrics and peer review is—at most—weak at an individual article level. Thus, the outcome of the experiments does not validate the use of the dual system of evaluation in the Italian research assessments. More in general, the very weak concordance indicates that metrics should not replace peer review at the level of individual article. Hence, the use of the dual system in a research assessment might worsen the quality of information compared to the adoption of peer review only or bibliometrics only."
https://openalex.org/W3103034704,"Background Evidence shows that antiretroviral (ART) exposure is associated with neurodevelopmental delays in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-exposed uninfected (HEU) children. However, there are few insights into modifiable maternal and child factors that may play a role in improving neurodevelopment in HEU children. We used a parent-centric neurodevelopment tool, Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) to examined neurodevelopment in HEU children at 12–24 months of age, and associations with maternal and child factors. Methods 505 HIV-infected women (initiated ART pre- or during pregnancy) with live singleton births attending primary health care were enrolled; 355 of their HEU children were assessed for neurodevelopment (gross motor, fine motor, communication, problem solving and personal-social domains) at 12–24 months using age-specific ASQ administered by a trained fieldworker. Associations with maternal and child factors were examined using logistic regression models. Results Among mothers (median age 30 years, IQR, 26–34), 52% initiated ART during pregnancy; the median CD4 count was 436 cells/μl (IQR, 305–604). Most delayed neurodevelopment in HEU children was in gross (9%) and fine motor (5%) functions. In adjusted models, maternal socio-economic status (aOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24–0.76) was associated with reduced odds of delayed gross-fine motor neurodevelopment. Maternal age ≥35 years (aOR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05–0.89) and maternal body mass index (BMI) &lt;18.5 (aOR 6.76, 95% CI 1.06–43.13) were associated with delayed communication-problem-solving-personal-social neurodevelopment. There were no differences in odds for either domain by maternal ART initiation timing. Conclusions Delayed neurodevelopment was detected in both gross and fine motor functions in this cohort of HEU children, with strong maternal predictors that may be explored as potentially modifiable factors associated with neurodevelopment at one to two years of age."
https://openalex.org/W3104553865,"Background Moderate intensity exercise ranging 40–60% of maximum oxygen uptake is advised to promote energy expenditure and fat oxidation in overweight and obese people. Although fat oxidation has been shown to be highly variable among individual, there is still a relative uncertainty regarding exercise prescription for women specifically. This article aimed to determine whether indicators of body composition can be used to narrow the exercise intensity range for exercise prescription in women. Methods A total of 35 healthy women (age 30.8±9.5 yr) classified according to their BMI in normal weight (NOR; ≤24.9 kg·m 2 ), overweight (OVW; 25–29.9 kg·m 2 ) and obese groups (OBE; ≥30 kg·m 2 ) completed a submaximal graded test (intensities eliciting ~30%, 40%, 50% and 60% of maximum oxygen uptake). Blood lactate, perceived exertion and absolute and relative substrate oxidation for fat (OX FAT ) and carbohydrates (OX CHO ) were measured at each stage. Results Perceived exertion and blood lactate increased as a function of exercise but did not differ across groups. There were no significant changes in absolute and relative OX FAT across groups, or as a function of exercise intensity. Peak OX FAT occurred at the 40%, 50% and 40% stages for NOR, OVW and OBE groups, respectively, with no significant differences across groups. Conclusion We measured no differences, but considerable inter-individual variation, in fat oxidation in women of different body composition. This result is in agreement with previous research based on exercise performed at constant rate and in independent participant groups. Our findings do not support the fat oxidation hypothesis, and further emphasise the perspective that exercise prescription should be individualised and likely be based on considerations other than substrate oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W3105157733,"Virulent strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (gram-positive group A Streptococcus pyogenes [GAS]) recruit host single-chain human plasminogen (hPg) to the cell surface—where in the case of Pattern D strains of GAS, hPg binds directly to the cells through a surface receptor, plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-protein (PAM). The coinherited Pattern D GAS-secreted streptokinase (SK2b) then accelerates cleavage of hPg at the R561-V562 peptide bond, resulting in the disulfide-linked two-chain protease, human plasmin (hPm). hPm localizes on the bacterial surface, assisting bacterial dissemination via proteolysis of host defense proteins. Studies using isolated domains from PAM and hPg revealed that the A-domain of PAM binds to the hPg kringle-2 module (K2hPg), but how this relates to the function of the full-length proteins is unclear. Herein, we use intact proteins to show that the lysine-binding site of K2hPg is a major determinant of the activation-resistant T-conformation of hPg. The binding of PAM to the lysine-binding site of K2hPg relaxes the conformation of hPg, leading to a greatly enhanced activation rate of hPg by SK2b. Domain swapping between hPg and mouse Pg emphasizes the importance of the Pg latent heavy chain (residues 1–561) in PAM binding and shows that while SK2b binds to both hPg and mouse Pg, the activation properties of streptokinase are strictly attributed to the serine protease domain (residues 562–791) of hPg. Overall, these data show that native hPg is locked in an activation-resistant conformation that is relaxed upon its direct binding to PAM, allowing hPm to form and provide GAS cells with a proteolytic surface.

Plasminogen (Pg) is a 791-amino acid single-chain plasma zymogen ([Glu1]-Pg), which upon proteolytic activation to the two-chain disulfide-linked serine protease, plasmin (Pm), via cleavage at the R561V562 peptide bond and additional loss of a N-terminal 77-residue activation peptide, catalyzes the degradation of fibrin clot.

Much of the virulence of Pattern D GAS is due to the specialized relationships between PAM, hPg, and SK2b. Unlike subforms of SK found in other GAS strains (e.g., SK1 and SK2a), SK2b possesses very low activity for hPg activation in the absence of PAM, but the activation of hPg is greatly enhanced when hPg is bound to PAM (14McArthur J.D.

For effective binding, LBSs require an anionic center, viz., D54XD56 (using K1hPg numbering from Cys1 of the isolated kringle) that interacts with the amino group of lysine analogues. The R70 cationic locus of the LBS interacts with COO- of EACA, while Y61 and W71 form the hydrophobic groove that stabilizes the methylene groups of EACA (23Mathews I.I. Vanderhoff-Hanaver P.

Using these same recombinant hPg kringle domains, along with truncated peptides from various PAM-type M-Prts, we demonstrated that the interaction between PAM and hPg is mediated by the LBS of K2hPg along with one (a1) or two (a1, a2) lysine isostere(s) found in the NH2-terminal A-domain of PAM (21Rios-Steiner J.L.

Since these kringle domains share extensive commonality in the LBS residues, it is concluded that binding exosites must exist in each kringle that modulates the affinity of hPg to PAM. While mouse Pg (mPg) is highly homologous to hPg, and contains the same domain structure as hPg, mPg is well known not to be activated by SK and not to bind to PAM as efficiently as hPg (25Fu Q. Figuera-Losada M. Ploplis V.A. Cnudde S. Geiger J.H. Prorok M. Castellino F.J.

This perhaps explains the refractiveness of mPg to GAS infections unless applied to transgenic mice containing the hPg transgene (36Sun H.M. Ringdahl U. Homeister J.W. Fay W.P. Engleberg N.C. Yang A.Y. Rozek L.S. Wang X.X. Sjobring U. Ginsburg D. Plasminogen is a critical host pathogenicity factor for group A streptococcal infection.Science. 2004; 305: 1283-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Since mice are the most commonly used surrogates for human diseases, we sought in the current study to expand the differences between hPg and mPg as virulence factors for GAS pathogenicity. Our approach involved the construction of chimeric variants of the two Pgs, as well as a single strategic mutation in K2hPg, to examine the strength of PAM binding and its effect on the activation rate of hPg. We correlated the biophysical properties of the Pg variants with their abilities to be activated to Pm through the virulence mechanism employed by Pattern D GAS. The results of this study are summarized in the current communication. Since mice are heavily employed as models for human disease, we focused our work on differences at the protein levels that are responsible for the disparate pathogenicities between mice and humans as related to GAS infections. In general, mice are poorly susceptible to infections by Pattern D GAS and thus are not optimal models for this disease. However, mice become very good models for these types of GAS infections when hPg DNA is transgenically inserted into the mouse genome, recapitulating many of the characteristics of human infections (36Sun H.M. Ringdahl U. Homeister J.W. Fay W.P. Engleberg N.C. Yang A.Y. Rozek L.S. Wang X.X. Sjobring U. Ginsburg D. Plasminogen is a critical host pathogenicity factor for group A streptococcal infection.Science. 2004; 305: 1283-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A major reason for this is that mPg is not activated by GAS-secreted SK and mPg is not as tightly and effectively bound to the major Pg surface receptor, PAM (25Fu Q. Figuera-Losada M. Ploplis V.A. Cnudde S. Geiger J.H. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. The lack of binding of VEK-30, an internal peptide from the group A streptococcal M-like protein, PAM, to murine plasminogen is due to two amino acid replacements in the plasminogen kringle-2 domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 282: 1580-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we have examined the basis of these differences between hPg and mPg through an approach that takes advantage of the well-known domainal nature of Pg, thus allowing the use of substitutions and exchanges of functional units of each Pg and assessment of the properties of the chimeric proteins. In order to examine the primary structural similarities and differences between hPg and mPg, their sequences were aligned (Fig. S1A). The alignments showed that the overall level of homology between hPg and mPg is ∼80%. Sequences within the latent HCs (shown in black) are ∼77% homologous between hPg and mPg, and sequences of the latent LCs (shown in blue) show ∼84% homology. Figure. S1B provides an alignment of the five kringle domains of hPg and shows that the lysine-binding residues (highlighted in red) of hPg are highly conserved across all the lysine-binding kringles (K1hPg, K2hPg, K4hPg, and K5hPg). K3hPg does not bind to lysine because of a key mutation in its anionic center (DGD to DGK). Parental Pgs (hPg and mPg), along with a set of chimeric Pgs, viz., mouse heavy chain (mHC)-human light chain (hLC) and human heavy chain (hHC)-mouse light chain (mLC), and a point mutant, hPg[D219N], which eliminates by a single mutation the LBS in the K2 domain of hPg, were used in this work. Following expression of the Pgs in Drosophila Schneider S2 cells, each variant was purified by lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography (37Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Plasminogen: purification from human plasma by affinity chromatography.Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). Typical protein yields ranged from 7 to 21 mg/l. The purities, molecular weights, and conformations of the Pg variants were examined by SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). The gel electrophoretograms (Fig. 1A) show that all proteins were highly purified, with molecular weights close to their expected values. Some slight differences in mobility are observed, perhaps due to glycosylation differences. However, for precise determinations of the molecular weights of the chimeric Pgs, the purified proteins were first subjected to analysis by SEC-MALS, an example of which is shown in Figure 1B, as well as sedimentation equilibrium by AUC. The results, listed in Table 1, show agreement between the molecular weights using both analytical methods and the calculated molecular weights of each protein (minus the carbohydrate). These results demonstrate that highly purified full-length Pgs were obtained.Table 1Molecular weights of plasminogensPlasminogen formMolecular Weight, calculated kDaaMolecular weight obtained from protein linear sequence calculated by ExPASy.Molecular Weight, SEC-MALS kDabMolecular weight determined by size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS).Molecular Weight., AUC kDacMolecular weight determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) at 20,000 rpm.hPg88.490.1 ± 0.990.7 ± 0.4mPg88.694.6 ± 0.392.5 ± 0.9mHC-hLC88.392.7 ± 0.791.9 ± 1.6hHC-mLC88.892.4 ± 0.790.8 ± 0.7hPg[D219N]88.495.3 ± 0.791.1 ± 1.5a Molecular weight obtained from protein linear sequence calculated by ExPASy.b Molecular weight determined by size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS).c Molecular weight determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) at 20,000 rpm. Open table in a new tab In the case of Pg, the sedimentation coefficient (S020,w) value is highly diagnostic of the overall conformation and activatability of Pg. We have shown in numerous studies that fully intact Pgs from all species examined in Cl--containing buffers provide a S20,w value of ∼5.7 S, which represents the tight (T) conformation of Pg (19McCance S.G.

In this state, the LBSs of the kringles are bound to side chains of other regions of the HC, including the activation peptide (40Urano T. Takada Y. Takada A.

Relaxation of this conformation by addition of lysine and its analogues, e.g., EACA, or removal of the 77-residue activation peptide, disrupts the side chain binding with the LBS of the kringle domains, thereby producing the highly activatable relaxed (R)-conformation with a S20,w value that is reduced by ∼1 S (38Brockway W.J.

The S20,w values of each Pg (Table 2) show small differences in the T-conformations of the different chimeric proteins, perhaps reflective of altered interactions between their HCs and LCs, but the T-conformations of the HC were retained to a large degree in all proteins since addition of EACA reduced the S20,w by ∼1.0 S. On the other hand, in the mutant hPg[D219N], the lowered S20,w of 5.31 S partially disrupts the T-conformation of the hHC since a smaller additional change was found after addition of EACA.

Here we study the interaction between a braconid wasp ( Aphidius ervi ) and its pea aphid host ( Acyrthosiphon pisum ). We first identify variation in resistance to wasp parasitism that can be attributed to aphid genotype. We then use transcriptome sequencing to identify genes in the aphid genome that are differentially expressed at an early stage of parasitism, and we compare these patterns in highly resistant and susceptible aphid host lines. We find that resistant genotypes are upregulating genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and several key innate immune system genes in response to parasitism, but that this response seems to be weaker in susceptible aphid genotypes. Together, our results provide a first look into the complex molecular mechanisms that underlie aphid resistance to wasp parasitism and contribute to a broader understanding of how resistance mechanisms evolve in natural populations."
https://openalex.org/W3100125387,"While talent development and the contributing factors to success are hardly discussed among the experts in the field, the aim of the study was to investigate annual variation in competition performance (AVCP), number of races per year, and age, as potential success factors for international swimming competitions. Data from 40’277 long-course races, performed by all individual female starters (n = 253) at the 2018 European Swimming Championships (2018EC) for all 10 years prior to these championships, were analyzed. Relationships between 2018EC ranking and potential success factors, i.e., AVCP, number of races per year, and age, were determined using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression analysis. While AVCP was not related to ranking, higher ranked swimmers at the 2018EC swam more races during each of the ten years prior to the championships ( P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, older athletes were more successful ( r = -0.42, P &lt; 0.001). The regression model explained highly significant proportions ( P &lt; 0.001) and 43%, 34%, 35%, 49% of total variance in the 2018EC ranking for 50m, 100m, 200m, and 400m races, respectively. As number of races per year ( β = -0.29 –-0.40) had a significant effect on ranking of 50-400m races, and age ( β = -0.40 –-0.61) showed a significant effect on ranking over all race distances, number of races per year and age may serve as success factors for international swimming competitions. The larger number of races swum by higher ranked female swimmers may have aided long-term athlete development regarding technical, physiological, and mental skill acquisitions. As older athletes were more successful, female swimmers under the age of peak performance, who did not reach semi-finals or finals, may increase their chances of success in following championships with increased experience."

However, WC cut-off point might be differ based on different race or ethnicity. This study aims to analyze the optimal WC cut-off point to identify T2DM risk among Indonesian population. Method We analyzed the secondary data of national based cross-sectional study of the Indonesian Basic National Health Research 2013, comprising 24,660 adults aged ≥ 18 years who were assessed for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The new proposed cut-off point for WC was calculated using ROC curve analysis and Youden index. The odds ratio of having T2DM was calculated using logistic regression analysis. Results Increased WC was associated with worsening dysglycemia status among men and women (p&lt;0.001). The optimal cut-off point of WC for detecting T2DM from ROC analysis was 76 for men and 80 for women. Based on this WC cut-off point, the odds ratio for having T2DM was 1.64 [95% CI 1.45–1.86, p&lt;0.01] for men and 1.90 [95% CI 1.71–2.11 p&lt;0.01] for women. Conclusion The newly proposed WC cut-off point of 76 for men and 80 women can be used to screen the risk of T2DM among Indonesian population."
https://openalex.org/W3101965091,"Combining global gridded population and fossil fuel based CO 2 emission data at 1 km scale, we investigate the spatial origin of CO 2 emissions in relation to the population distribution within countries. We depict the correlations between these two datasets by a quasi-Lorenz curve which enables us to discern the individual contributions of densely and sparsely populated regions to the national CO 2 emissions. We observe pronounced country-specific characteristics and quantify them using an indicator resembling the Gini-index. As demonstrated by a robustness test, the Gini-index for each country arise from a compound distribution between the population and emissions which differs among countries. Relating these indices with the degree of socio-economic development measured by per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at purchase power parity, we find a strong negative correlation between the two quantities with a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.71. More specifically, this implies that in developing countries locations with large population tend to emit relatively more CO 2 , and in developed countries the opposite tends to be the case. Based on the relation to urban scaling, we discuss the implications for CO 2 emissions from cities. Our results show that general statements with regard to the (in)efficiency of large cities should be avoided as it is subject to the socio-economic development of respective countries. Concerning the political relevance, our results suggest a differentiated spatial prioritization in deploying climate change mitigation measures in cities for developed and developing countries."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the anatomical variations of the CVS in patients with coronary artery calcification. 196 patients underwent non-contrast CT and coronary CT angiography using 256-slice CT. All subjects were divided into four groups based on their coronary artery calcium score (CACS): 50 patients with CACS = 0 Agatston unit (AU), 52 patients with CACS = 1–100 AU, 44 patients with CACS = 101–400 AU, and 50 patients with CACS &gt; 400 AU. The presence of the following cardiac veins was evaluated: the coronary sinus (CS), great cardiac vein (GCV), posterior interventricular vein (PIV), posterior vein of the left ventricle (PVLV), left marginal vein (LMV), anterior interventricular vein (AIV), and small cardiac vein (SCV). Vessel diameters were also measured. We found that the CS, GCV, PIV, and AIV were visualized in all patients, whereas the PVLV and LMV were identified in a certain proportion of patients: 98% and 96% in the CACS = 0 AU group, 100% and 78.8% in the CACS = 1–100 AU group, 93.2% and 77.3% in the CACS = 101–400 AU group, and 98% and 78% in the CACS &gt; 400 AU group, respectively. The LMV was less often identified in the last three groups than in the first group (p &lt; 0.05). The frequency of having either one PVLV or LMV was higher in the last three groups than in the first group (p &lt; 0.05).

https://openalex.org/W3102429043,"Childhood cancers are increasingly recognized as disorders of cellular development. This study sought to identify the cellular and developmental origins of cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma, the most common brain tumor of childhood. Using publicly available gene expression data from pilocytic astrocytoma tumors and controlling for driver mutation, a set of developmental-related genes which were overexpressed in cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma was identified. These genes were then mapped onto several developmental atlases in order to identify normal cells with similar gene expression patterns and the developmental trajectory of those cells was interrogated. Eight known neuro-developmental genes were identified as being expressed in cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma. Mapping those genes or their orthologs onto mouse neuro-developmental atlases identified overlap in their expression within the ventricular zone of the cerebellar anlage. Further analysis with a single cell RNA-sequencing atlas of the developing mouse cerebellum defined this overlap as occurring in ventricular zone progenitor cells at the division point between GABA-ergic neuronal and glial lineages, a developmental trajectory which closely mirrors that previously described to occur within pilocytic astrocytoma cells. Furthermore, ventricular zone progenitor cells and their progeny exhibited evidence of MAPK pathway activation, the paradigmatic oncogenic cascade known to be active in cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma. Gene expression from developing human brain atlases recapitulated the same anatomic localizations and developmental trajectories as those found in mice. Taken together, these data suggest this population of ventricular zone progenitor cells as the cell-of-origin for BRAF fusion-positive cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma."
