https://openalex.org/W1984767115,"In order to determine if brain tissue grafts can provide functional input to recipient central nervous system tissue, fetal rat dopamine-containing neurons were implanted adjacent to the caudate nucleus of adult recipients whose endogenous dopaminergic input had been destroyed. The grafts showed good survival and axonal outgrowth. Motor abnormalities, which had been induced by the destruction of the endogenous dopaminergic input to the caudate, were significantly reduced after grafting of the fetal brain tissue. These data suggest that such implants may be potentially useful in reversing deficits after circumscribed destruction of brain tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1486351035,"Steady state and kinetic studies on the binding of 125I-beta nerve growth factor (NGF) to single cells from sensory ganglia of 8-day-old chick embryos show two distinct, saturable binding sites with dissociation constants of Kd(I) = 2.3 X 10(-11) M and Kd(II) = 1.7 X 10(-9) M. The difference in the affinities is due to different rate constants of dissociation (k-1(I) = 10(-3) s-1, k-1(II) = 2 X 10(-1 s-1). The association to both sites is apparently diffusion controlled (k+1(I) = 4.8 X 10(7) M-1s-1, k+2(II) = 10(7) to 10(8) M-1s-1). The binding of betaNGF to both sites is specific, since none of a number of hormones or proteins tested compete for the binding of 125I-betaNGF to either of those two sites. The heterogeneity of the binding of 125I-betaNGF is not due to heterogeneity of the 125I-betaNGF preparation nor to a negatively cooperative binding. In experiments where the dissociation of 125I-betaNGF is induced by the addition of saturating amounts of unlabeled betaNGF, the ratio of the 125I-betaNGF released with either of the two dissociation rate constants is solely dependent on the occupancy of the two sites before dissociation is started and is independent of the total occupancy of the sites during dissociation. The rate of dissociation of 125I-betaNGF from the higher affinity binding site I is accelerated by unlabeled betaNGF under conditions where the occupancy is both increased and decreased. Although the dissociation characteristics of 125I-beta NGF change with increasing times of exposure of the cells to the ligand, and 125I-beta NGF is degraded after it binds to the cells, these secondary processes do not interfere with the analysis of the binding data. At the lowest concentration of 125I-beta NGF used for the analysis less than 10% of the 125I-beta NGF is degraded. Both kinetic and steady state binding data reveal the two NGF binding sites at 2 degrees C as well as at 37 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W2010021658,"The addition of certain amino acid analogues (canavanine, hydroxynorvaline, o-methylthreonine) or a mild heat shock at 45°C caused chicken embryo fibroblasts to increase rapidly the synthesis of three proteins (molecular weights 22,000, 76,000 and 95,000 daltons) to levels which dominate the cells biosynthetic capacity and exceed the level of synthesis of the major cell structural proteins. Actinomycin D blocked the increased synthesis of p22, p76 and p95 in both analogue and heat shock-treated cells, while cycloheximide addition during the “induction” period blocked formation of these proteins only in analogue-treated cells. The elevated levels of synthesis for this set of proteins began to decrease shortly after restoration of the normal amino acid or normal temperature, and the normal pattern of cell protein synthesis was found 8 hr later. Induction of a similar set of proteins was detected in mouse L cells and baby hamster kidney cells after treatment with amino acid analogues or heat shock. Several laboratories have reported synthesis of proteins with similar molecular weights in cells subjected to conditions that alter glucose metabolism, and we speculate that these proteins may be associated with a hexose transport system."

https://openalex.org/W1967318154,"We have determined the entire nucleotide sequence of a cloned β-globinmaj gene derived from the BALB/c mouse. This sequence is 1567 bases long and includes the 5′ cap region as well as the presumptive poly(A) addition site of β-globin mRNA. The sequence establishes the fact that the gene is encoded in three discontinuous segments of DNA interrupted by two intervening sequences and precisely locates each. The smaller intervening sequence, 116 bases long, occurs between Arg and Leu codons at codon positions 30 and 31. The larger intervening sequence of 646 bases also occurs between Arg and Leu codons, but at codon positions 104 and 105. There is striking homology between the borders of the two intervening sequences, but no extensive dyad symmetry. Furthermore, the DNA region that just precedes and overlaps the 5′ cap structure of the mRNA shows homology to corresponding regions in other eucaryotic genes including the late adenovirus promoter. The 3′ untranslated sequence is closely homologous to that of the rabbit β-globin mRNA. The sequence thus allows us to identify several noncoding regions of potential importance for the expression and processing of genetic information. It also provides a basis for future comparison with other sequenced genes and a defined substrate for the development of direct tests of gene function."
https://openalex.org/W1982233852,"Xenopus 5S RNA genes in recombinant form with the plasmid pMB9 are transcribed accurately when added to a supernatant fraction obtained from disrupted nuclei of Xenopus laevis oocytes. After an initial 30 min lag period, the rate of synthesis of 5S RNA is constant for at least an hour and synthesis is still detected after 18 hr. As much as 40% of the total RNA synthesized from the recombinant DNA used in these experiments can be 5S RNA. The coding strand of the 5S RNA genes is transcribed at a rate 10 to 15 times greater than the noncoding strand. Plasmid and spacer DNA, however, are also transcribed. What fraction of total RNA synthesized is 5S RNA is strongly affected by DNA concentration, ionic strength and MgCl2 concentration. Inhibition of transcription by intermediate concentrations of alpha-amanitin demonstrates that RNA polymerase III transcribes at least 90% of all RNA synthesized. Adenovirus 2 DNA is also transcribed in the nuclear supernatant by RNA polymerase III. Approximately 15% of the total RNA synthesized migrates in an acrylamide gel as a band of 5.5S RNA and has been identified as virus-associated RNA1 by its oligonucleotide fingerprint."

All ten possible dimers of the four non-H1 histones, H3, H2B, H2A and H4, are observed, the major dimers being H3-H3, H3-H2A, H2B-H2A, H2a-H2A and two separate dimers of H2B-H4.

https://openalex.org/W2107888204,"Fibroblasts isolated by enzymic digestion of chick embryo tendons have previously been used to examine the kinetics for the secretion of procollagen (Kao, W. W.-Y., Berg, R. A., and Prockop, D. J. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8391-8397). The results indicated that the kinetics approximated the sum of two first order processes with half-times of 14 and 115 min. Here, the same fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of 1.53 mM cis-4-hydroxyproline, an analogue of proline, or in the presence of 0.3 mM alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl, an inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase, so that the cells synthesized procollagen which could not assume a triple helical conformation characteristic of procollagen. Measurements of the secretion of nonhelical procollagen indicated that the kinetics for secretion differed from the kinetics for the secretion of procollagen and approximated a single first order process with a half-time of approximately 130 min. The nonhelical procollagen synthesized and secreted in the presence of either cis-4-hydroxyproline or alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl consisted of disulfide-bonded pro gamma chains of type I procollagen. The results suggested that the intracellular nonhelical procollagen was present in a single metabolic pool and secretion from this pool occurred with a different rate-limiting step than for helical procollagen. Further results indicated that nonhelical procollagen had a high affinity for prolyl hydroxylase and the affinity for the enzyme was greatly reduced if the procollagen was allowed to assume the triple helical conformation characteristic of normal procollagen. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the secretion of procollagen is influenced by its conformation-dependent interaction with prolyl hydroxylase or other post-translational enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1978521951,Increasing numbers of anthropological studies about native Amazonian warfare and demographic practices attempt to explain these phenomena as competition over or a response to scarce game animals and other sources of high-quality protein. Recently completed field research among the Yanomamö Indians living at the Venezuela-Brazil border indicates that their protein intake is comparable to that found in highly developed industrialized nations and as much as 200 percent more than many nutritional authorities recommend as daily allowances. Recent data on other Amazonian tribes likewise fails to indicate a correlation between protein intake and intensity of warfare patterns.
https://openalex.org/W1523805904,"The four molecular forms of chick embryo leg muscle acetylcholinesterase have been isolated by velocity sedimentation; their apparent sedimentation coefficients are 19.5 S, 11.5 S, 7.1 S, and 5.4 S. All four forms are glycoproteins, exhibit the same Km for acetylcholine, and are inhibited to the same extent by specific inhibitors of acetyl- and buryrylcholinesterase. Treatment of the 19.5 S form of acetylcholinesterase with trypsin generates an array of molecular forms, several of which have sedimentation coefficients identical with the naturally occurring forms. Collagenase treatment of the 19.5 S acetylcholinesterase results in a somewhat different pattern of acetylcholinesterase forms including a novel 20.6 S form. Only the 19.5 S acetylcholinesterase is sensitive to collagenase treatment. Our results indicate that the several acetylcholinesterase forms share a common catalytic subunit, and suggest that the molecular forms of acetylcholinesterase in the chick represent different ensembles of a common monomer. In culture, the muscle cells contain only the 11.5 and 7.1 S acetylcholinesterase forms; however, they also secrete substantial amounts of enzyme into the medium. These secreted acetylcholinesterases have sedimentation coefficients of 9 S and 15 S. The relative abundance of the different acetylcholinesterase molecular forms changes during muscle development, both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that the assembly and distribution of this family of membrane glycoproteins is developmentally regulated."

However, when these cells are induced to extend neurites under conditions in which mitotic sister cells are readily identifiable, 60% of these sister pairs display analogous morphologies. These cells are related either as identical twins or as mirror images of each other. The relatedness is expressed in considerable detail of neurite morphology. These relationships can persist through at least two cell divisions. The results suggest that animal cells can inherit specific determinants of shape."

https://openalex.org/W1989208004,"Abstract Retinol-binding protein (RBP), the plasma transport protein for vitamin A, is synthesized and secreted by the liver. In vitamin A deficiency, RBP secretion is blocked, leading to low serum and high liver levels of RBP. Administration of retinol to the intact rat stimulates a rapid secretion of RBP from liver into serum. We explored the use of a liver cell culture system to study the regulation of the synthesis and secretion of RBP. We found two lines of differentiated rat hepatoma cells, MH 1 C 1 and H 4 II EC 3 (H 4 ), that synthesized RBP during culture in vitro. The net synthesis of RBP was a function of the number of cells per dish and the duration of incubation. Both cell lines synthesized RBP when incubated in Neuman and Tytell's Serumless Medium (NTS medium), while the MH 1 C 1 cells also synthesized RBP in Ham's F-12 medium with added serum. A relatively large proportion (14–56%) of the RBP was retained within the cells when they were incubated in the vitamin A-free NTS medium alone. Addition of serum to NTS medium stimulated the release of RBP from the cells into the medium and also increased the net synthesis of RBP. These effects were not due to the increased adhesion of the cells to the petri dish. Addition of retinol (at levels of 0.35 or 3.5 nmole/ml) to the NTS medium resulted in the stimulation of RBP secretion from the cells into the medium and an increase in the net synthesis of RBP. By contrast, retinol had no effect on either the net synthesis or the cell-to-medium distribution of rat serum albumin. The data from these cell lines in culture suggest that retinol has a specific regulatory effect on RBP metabolism. These cells thus resemble the normal rat liver cell in vivo in regard to the known regulation of RBP metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2042127340,"Displaced retinal ganglion cells in birds are the sole source of the retinal projection onto the nucleus of the basal optic root, the main component of the accessory optic system. This nucleus has direct bilateral axonal projections onto the oculomotor nuclear complex, the trochlear nucleus, and folia IXc,d and paraflocculus of the vestibulocerebellum. The cerebellar projection terminates within a superficial band of the granule cell layer adjacent to the Purkinje cell layer as a mossy fiber system. This bisynaptic projection onto oculomotor neurons and the cerebellum may play a functionally distinct and specific role in oculomotor reflexes."
https://openalex.org/W1535175660,"During the embryonic development of chick calvaria (membranous cranial bones), the relative rate of procollagen synthesis increased from about 12% of total protein synthesis on Day 10 to about 65% on Day 17. This increase is due to a 1.7-fold increase in the absolute rate of procollagen synthesis and a 3-fold decrease in the synthesis of noncollagenous proteins. The increase in procollagen synthesis is directly proportional to an increase in procollagen mRNA content per cell as measured either by cell-free translation or by hybridization with complementary DNA. The results indicate that translational control of procollagen mRNA does not play a substantial role during calvaria development and that the specialization in the synthesis of this protein is largely due to the loss or inactivation of mRNAs for noncollagenous proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1560573755,"Differential accessibility of liganded, high affinity rabbit anti-fluorescyl IgG antibody combining sites to the aqueous milieu has been investigated by solvent perturbation of the extrinsic fluorescence of bound fluorophore. Iodide, a dynamic quencher of fluorescein, was selected for use in these studies after examination of a number of water-soluble fluorescence quenchers. Quenching of antibody-bound fluorophore by iodide was measured with a number of liganded anti-fluorescyl IgG preparations, demonstrating partial solvent exposure of the fluorophore as well as heterogeneity of the high affinity antibody populations. Fluorescence quenching, lifetime, and absorption spectroscopy provided evidence that the antibody-bound fluorophore quenched by iodide interacted with it directly and that anomalous binding of the anion to the surface of the protein, resulting in ground state perturbations of the immunoglobulin, could not explain the observed results."

https://openalex.org/W1499149598,"An enzyme preparation from cultured chick embryo vertebral chondrocytes attacks chondroitin SO4 oligosaccharides from the nonreducing terminal in a recycling pathway involving the sequential action of a beta-glucuronidase, a 4- or a 6-sulfatase, and a beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. The sequence is blocked by saccharo-1,4-lactone, an inhibitor of the beta-glucuronidase, or by 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactonolactone, an inhibitor of the beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. The level of 4-sulfatase activity is low relative to the other activities and limits the rate of catabolism of hybrid oligosaccharide structures containing both 6-sulfated galactosamine residues and 4-sulfated galactosamine residues. This results in the accumulation of shortened oligosaccharides, most of which have galactosamine-4-SO4 residues at their nonreducing terminals. In the presence of the lactone inhibitors, polymeric chondroitin SO4 is broken down by the enzyme preparation to oligosaccharides which are 10 to 15 monosaccharides long, indicating that degradation of chondroitin SO4 chains is initiated by an endoglycosidase which generates oligosaccharide substrates for the recycling exoglycosidase system."
https://openalex.org/W1973213508,"Neoplastic cells, transformed cells and some normal mammalian cells secrete large amounts of plasminogen activator (PA), an arginine-specific protease which converts plasminogen to plasmin. To study the regulation of PA, we have obtained two classes of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids. PG19, a mouse PA+ cell line, was fused with C32 (human PA+) or human diploid fibroblasts (PA-). All hybrids secreted PA. Human- and mouse-specific forms of PA were distinguished in these hybrids by electrophoretic methods. While all hybrids produced the murine PA, many produced the human PA and some did not. All hybrids which produced human PA had chromosome 6 in common. The absence of each of the other human chromosomes did not affect PA expression, while the absence of chromosome 6 correlated with the lack of human PA. We conclude that chromosome 6 carries the structural gene for human PA. These experiments also show that the fusion of mouse PA+ cells with human PA- cells results in the activation of the human PA gene."

https://openalex.org/W2065583176,"TRANSFORMED CELLS are frequently less adhesive than normal cells. This decrease in adhesion has been associated with the loss of specific cell surface proteins, changes in morphology, alterations in the underlying cytoskeleton and the increased activity of the serine protease, plasminogen activator1–3. Hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells exhibit increased levels of adhesion to glass4,5 and decreased plasminogen activator activity6,7 when incubated in the presence of the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. Plasminogen activator converts plasminogen in serum to plasmin. It has been shown that plasmin causes the reversible dissociation of intracellular actin-containing cables in anchorage-dependent rat embryo cells8 and may also be partially responsible for decreased adhesion of Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts3. Cell–substrate adhesion presumably requires specific cell surface glycoproteins and intact cytoskeletal elements9,10. It is possible that plasmin acts either to modify ‘adhesive’ proteins on the cell surface or to disrupt linkages between these surface components and the underlying cytoskeleton. We have used variant HTC cells selectively resistant to the dexamethasone inhibition of plasminogen activator6 to test the hypothesis that hormonal induction of cell adhesion is secondary to the inhibition of plasminogen activator which in turn allows the accumulation of the glycoproteins necessary for adhesion. We have modified cell adhesion assay techniques5,11 to provide a sensitive measure of cell–substrate adhesion for both wild-type and variant HTC cells in the presence and absence of serum and plasminogen. We report here that plasminogen activator does not have an important role in the hormonal regulation of HTC cell adhesiveness."

https://openalex.org/W2089884031,"The normal ovarian cycle of female rats is typically replaced by persistent estrus when these animals are housed under constant light. Evidence presented here shows that the maintenance of periodicity in the environment can at least delay (if not prevent) the photic induction of persistent vaginal estrus. Female rats in constant light were exposed to vaginal smearing at random times or at the same time every day. In another experiment, female rats were exposed to either constant bright light, constant dim light, or a 24-hour photic cycle of bright and dim light. The onset of persistent vaginal estrus was delayed in rats exposed to 24-hour time cues even though the light intensities were the same as or greater than those for the aperiodic control groups. The results suggest that the absence of 24-hour time cues in constant light contributes to the induction of persistent estrus."
