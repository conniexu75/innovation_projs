https://openalex.org/W2035543709,"The yeast sir2 gene and its orthologues in Drosophila and C. elegans have well-established roles in lifespan determination and response to caloric restriction. We have studied mice carrying two null alleles for SirT1, the mammalian orthologue of sir2, and found that these animals inefficiently utilize ingested food. These mice are hypermetabolic, contain inefficient liver mitochondria, and have elevated rates of lipid oxidation. When challenged with a 40% reduction in caloric intake, normal mice maintained their metabolic rate and increased their physical activity while the metabolic rate of SirT1-null mice dropped and their activity did not increase. Moreover, CR did not extend lifespan of SirT1-null mice. Thus, SirT1 is an important regulator of energy metabolism and, like its orthologues from simpler eukaryotes, the SirT1 protein appears to be required for a normal response to caloric restriction."
https://openalex.org/W1977316848,"Vocal learning is a critical behavioral substrate for spoken human language. It is a rare trait found in three distantly related groups of birds-songbirds, hummingbirds, and parrots. These avian groups have remarkably similar systems of cerebral vocal nuclei for the control of learned vocalizations that are not found in their more closely related vocal non-learning relatives. These findings led to the hypothesis that brain pathways for vocal learning in different groups evolved independently from a common ancestor but under pre-existing constraints. Here, we suggest one constraint, a pre-existing system for movement control. Using behavioral molecular mapping, we discovered that in songbirds, parrots, and hummingbirds, all cerebral vocal learning nuclei are adjacent to discrete brain areas active during limb and body movements. Similar to the relationships between vocal nuclei activation and singing, activation in the adjacent areas correlated with the amount of movement performed and was independent of auditory and visual input. These same movement-associated brain areas were also present in female songbirds that do not learn vocalizations and have atrophied cerebral vocal nuclei, and in ring doves that are vocal non-learners and do not have cerebral vocal nuclei. A compilation of previous neural tracing experiments in songbirds suggests that the movement-associated areas are connected in a network that is in parallel with the adjacent vocal learning system. This study is the first global mapping that we are aware for movement-associated areas of the avian cerebrum and it indicates that brain systems that control vocal learning in distantly related birds are directly adjacent to brain systems involved in movement control. Based upon these findings, we propose a motor theory for the origin of vocal learning, this being that the brain areas specialized for vocal learning in vocal learners evolved as a specialization of a pre-existing motor pathway that controls movement."
https://openalex.org/W2060405968,"The secreted liver protein fetuin-A (AHSG) is up-regulated in hepatic steatosis and the metabolic syndrome. These states are strongly associated with low-grade inflammation and hypoadiponectinemia. We, therefore, hypothesized that fetuin-A may play a role in the regulation of cytokine expression, the modulation of adipose tissue expression and plasma concentration of the insulin-sensitizing and atheroprotective adipokine adiponectin.Human monocytic THP1 cells and human in vitro differenttiated adipocytes as well as C57BL/6 mice were treated with fetuin-A. mRNA expression of the genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and the adipokine adiponectin (ADIPOQ) was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. In 122 subjects, plasma levels of fetuin-A, adiponectin and, in a subgroup, the multimeric forms of adiponectin were determined. Fetuin-A treatment induced TNF and IL1B mRNA expression in THP1 cells (p<0.05). Treatment of mice with fetuin-A, analogously, resulted in a marked increase in adipose tissue Tnf mRNA as well as Il6 expression (27- and 174-fold, respectively). These effects were accompanied by a decrease in adipose tissue Adipoq mRNA expression and lower circulating adiponectin levels (p<0.05, both). Furthermore, fetuin-A repressed ADIPOQ mRNA expression of human in vitro differentiated adipocytes (p<0.02) and induced inflammatory cytokine expression. In humans in plasma, fetuin-A correlated positively with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a marker of subclinical inflammation (r = 0.26, p = 0.01), and negatively with total- (r = -0.28, p = 0.02) and, particularly, high molecular weight adiponectin (r = -0.36, p = 0.01).We provide novel evidence that the secreted liver protein fetuin-A induces low-grade inflammation and represses adiponectin production in animals and in humans. These data suggest an important role of fatty liver in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2152785734,"Only a limited number of complete mitochondrial genome sequences belonging to Native American haplogroups were available until recently, which left America as the continent with the least amount of information about sequence variation of entire mitochondrial DNAs. In this study, a comprehensive overview of all available complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes of the four pan-American haplogroups A2, B2, C1, and D1 is provided by revising the information scattered throughout GenBank and the literature, and adding 14 novel mtDNA sequences. The phylogenies of haplogroups A2, B2, C1, and D1 reveal a large number of sub-haplogroups but suggest that the ancestral Beringian population(s) contributed only six (successful) founder haplotypes to these haplogroups. The derived clades are overall starlike with coalescence times ranging from 18,000 to 21,000 years (with one exception) using the conventional calibration. The average of about 19,000 years somewhat contrasts with the corresponding lower age of about 13,500 years that was recently proposed by employing a different calibration and estimation approach. Our estimate indicates a human entry and spread of the pan-American haplogroups into the Americas right after the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum and comfortably agrees with the undisputed ages of the earliest Paleoindians in South America. In addition, the phylogenetic approach also indicates that the pathogenic status proposed for various mtDNA mutations, which actually define branches of Native American haplogroups, was based on insufficient grounds."
https://openalex.org/W2059588512,"Recently an association was demonstrated between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs9939609, within the FTO locus and obesity as a consequence of a genome wide association (GWA) study of type 2 diabetes in adults. We examined the effects of two perfect surrogates for this SNP plus 11 other SNPs at this locus with respect to our childhood obesity cohort, consisting of both Caucasians and African Americans (AA). Utilizing data from our ongoing GWA study in our cohort of 418 Caucasian obese children (BMI≥95th percentile), 2,270 Caucasian controls (BMI<95th percentile), 578 AA obese children and 1,424 AA controls, we investigated the association of the previously reported variation at the FTO locus with the childhood form of this disease in both ethnicities. The minor allele frequencies (MAF) of rs8050136 and rs3751812 (perfect surrogates for rs9939609 i.e. both r2 = 1) in the Caucasian cases were 0.448 and 0.443 respectively while they were 0.391 and 0.386 in Caucasian controls respectively, yielding for both an odds ratio (OR) of 1.27 (95% CI 1.08–1.47; P = 0.0022). Furthermore, the MAFs of rs8050136 and rs3751812 in the AA cases were 0.449 and 0.115 respectively while they were 0.436 and 0.090 in AA controls respectively, yielding an OR of 1.05 (95% CI 0.91–1.21; P = 0.49) and of 1.31 (95% CI 1.050–1.643; P = 0.017) respectively. Investigating all 13 SNPs present on the Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip in this region of linkage disequilibrium, rs3751812 was the only SNP conferring significant risk in AA. We have therefore replicated and refined the association in an AA cohort and distilled a tag-SNP, rs3751812, which captures the ancestral origin of the actual mutation. As such, variants in the FTO gene confer a similar magnitude of risk of obesity to children as to their adult counterparts and appear to have a global impact."
https://openalex.org/W2044575601,"FSP27 (fat-specific protein 27) is a member of the cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor-α-like effector (CIDE) family. Although Cidea and Cideb were initially characterized as activators of apoptosis, recent studies have demonstrated important metabolic roles for these proteins. In this study, we investigated the function of another member of this family, FSP27 (Cidec), in apoptosis and adipocyte metabolism. Although overexpression of FSP27 is sufficient to increase apoptosis of 293T and 3T3-L1 cells, more physiological levels of expression stimulate spontaneous lipid accumulation in several cell types without induction of adipocyte genes. Increased triacylglycerol is likely due to decreased β-oxidation of nonesterified fatty acids. Altered flux of fatty acids into triacylglycerol may be a direct effect of FSP27 function, which is localized to lipid droplets in 293T cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Stable knockdown of FSP27 during adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells substantially decreases lipid droplet size, increases mitochondrial and lipid droplet number, and modestly increases glucose uptake and lipolysis. Expression of FSP27 in subcutaneous adipose tissue of a human diabetes cohort decreases with total fat mass but is not associated with measures of insulin resistance (e.g. homeostasis model assessment). Together, these data indicate that FSP27 binds to lipid droplets and regulates their enlargement.

Chem. 1999; 274: 270-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, strong metabolic phenotypes of mice lacking Cidea and Cideb indicate that this family plays critical roles in energy balance (3Zhou Z. Yon Toh S. Chen Z. Guo K. Peng Ng C. Ponniah S.

Cidea knock-out mice are lean and resistant to diet-induced obesity because of increased lipolysis and mitochondrial uncoupling in brown adipose tissue (3Zhou Z. Yon Toh S. Chen Z. Guo K. Peng Ng C. Ponniah S. Lin S.-C. Hong W. Li P. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Although expression of Cidea is limited to brown adipocytes in mice, humans express CIDE-A in white adipose tissue, where lower levels are observed with obesity and insulin resistance (5Nordstrom E.A. Ryden M. Backlund E.C. Dahlman I. Kaaman M. Blomqvist L. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Arner P. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1726-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Gummesson A. Jernas M.

Arner P. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3032-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), knockdown of CIDE-A in human adipocytes enhances lipolysis (5Nordstrom E.A. Ryden M. Backlund E.C. Dahlman I. Kaaman M. Blomqvist L. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Arner P. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1726-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cideb knock-out mice are also lean and resistant to diet-induced obesity; however, this family member is expressed highly in liver, and the phenotype is because of decreased hepatic lipogenesis, increased fatty acid oxidation, and increased whole body energy expenditure (4Li J.Z. Ye J. Xue B. Qi J. Zhang J. Zhou Z. Li Q. Wen Z. Li P. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2523-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, through a number of mechanisms, the CIDE family appears to have important roles in lipid metabolism. FSP27 (fat-specific protein of 27 kDa or Cidec) is the third member of the CIDE family. FSP27 was identified prior to the other family members based upon induction during adipogenesis (8Danesch U. Hoeck W. Ringold G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7185-7193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CIDE-3, the human version of FSP27, was characterized as 66% homologous to mouse and as an activator of apoptosis when expressed in 293T cells (9Liang L. Zhao M. Xu Z. Yokoyama K.K. Li T. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the lack of function ascribed to FSP27 limited its investigation. Hepatic FSP27 is induced highly in steatotic livers that express PPARγ1, providing evidence for a possible metabolic function for this protein (10Sato W. Horie Y. Kataoka E. Ohshima S. Dohmen T. Iizuka M. Sasaki J. Sasaki T. Hamada K. Kishimoto H. Hepatol. Res. 2006; 34: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although FSP27 was detected in a screen of proteins co-purifying with 3T3-L1 adipocyte lipid droplets, suggesting that FSP27 is localized to this compartment, mitochondrial contamination of the droplets was suspected (11Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46835-46842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial localization of FSP27 is consistent with findings for other CIDE family members (2Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Benedict M.A. Nunez G. J. Biol.

Kumar C. Zhang Y. Mann M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1257-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that FSP27 is a lipid droplet protein that plays an important role in droplet formation. Similar to members of the PAT family of lipid droplet-associated proteins (14Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol.

Although FSP27 is not required for adipogenesis or accumulation of triacylglycerol, FSP27 deficiency prevents enlargement of lipid droplets and increases mitochondrial density. This is not because of induction of brown adipogenesis because expression of uncoupling protein-1 and other markers is not elevated. Altered accumulation of lipid may be due in part to indirect effects of FSP27 on lipid and glucose metabolism; however, localization of FSP27 to the surface of lipid droplets suggests a direct structural and/or regulatory role. A recent publication from Czech and co-workers (20Puri V. Konda S. Ranjit S. Aouadi M. Chawla A. Chouinard M. Chakladar A. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Cell Culture—293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 292 mg/ml l-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown in similar growth medium but with 8% (v/v) calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA). 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described previously (21Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rb–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts were induced to differentiate as described (22Hansen J.B.

Plasmids and Transfections—pEGFP-FSP27 was created by cloning FSP27 cDNA with 5′ EcoRI and 3′ BamHI sites upstream and in-frame with the eGFP sequence in pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The entire FSP27 coding region was included except for the stop codon. FLAG-tagged FSP27-N (amino acids 1–138) and FSP27-C (amino acids 132–239) were created by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and pLNCX2 (Clontech) vectors. Plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using calcium phosphate co-precipitation (25Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA mix was incubated for 5–10 min at room temperature and then gently added to 293T cells that had the media changed 30 min before adding the precipitated DNA. After 4–6 h of incubation, cells were shocked by removing media and gently adding 3 ml of 12.5% glycerol in PBS. After a 2-min incubation, the glycerol solution was aspirated, and 10 ml of media were added. Plasmids were electroporated into 3T3-L1 adipocytes as described (26Chiang S. Chang L. Saltiel A.R. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Retroviral Transduction of 3T3-L1 Cells—For retrovirus production, 7.5 μg of DNA of each of the two packaging vectors ϵ and ψ, along with 7.5 μg of DNA of the retroviral plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using calcium phosphate co-precipitation (25Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Media from 293T cells transfected with the retroviral vectors were passed through a 0.45-μm sterile Millipore filter into tubes containing Polybrene (8 μg/ml) and then poured onto 30–40% confluent 3T3-L1 cells. Three rounds of infection were performed; cells were grown to 70% confluence and split into selection media containing puromycin (1.75 μg/ml) or neomycin (8 μg/ml). Cells were cultured in selective media while subconfluent. Cell Labeling and Microscopy—Bright field images of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes were viewed on a Zeiss Axiovert 25 microscope and photographed with a Nikon Coolpix 885 digital camera. Confocal fluorescent images of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were taken on an Olympus Fluoview 500 microscope with Fluoview 500 software, under ×60 magnification. The electroporated adipocytes were prepared as described (26Chiang S. Chang L. Saltiel A.R. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) except they were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS; they were stained with Oil Red O as described (23Preece A. A Manual for Histologic Technicians. Little Brown and Co., Boston1972Google Scholar) or Mito-Tracker Deep Red 633 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 293T cells were cultured on glass coverslips (Corning Inc., Corning, NY), fixed by submersing coverslips in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.05% (w/v) saponin (Sigma) in PBS. Lipids were stained with 1 μg/ml Nile Red (Invitrogen). Nuclei were labeled by placing coverslips onto glass slides with Prolong Gold Anti-Fade with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Coverslips were dried and sealed to the slides with clear nail polish (Sally Hansen, Farmingdale, NY) and viewed on an Olympus Fluoview 500 microscope as above. FSP27 knockdown and control adipocytes were viewed under a Philips CM-100 transmission electron microscope and photographed with a Kodak 1.6 Megaplus camera. The adipocytes were prepared for electron microscopy by fixing them for 30 min at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Sorenson's buffer, treating with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m Sorenson's buffer for 15 min, en bloc staining with 3% uranyl acetate in distilled H2O for 15 min, dehydrating for 3 min each in 50, 70, 90, and 100% ethanol, and then infiltrating with Epon resin according to the following schedule: a 3:1 mix of ethanol:resin for 20 min; 1:1 ethanol:resin for 20 min; 1:3 ethanol:resin for 45 min; and 100% resin for 1 h. The 100% resin was then refreshed and allowed to polymerize at 60 °C for 24 h. The blocks were cut into 70-nm sections with a diamond knife. The sections were placed on copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for visualization of cellular components. Electron micrographs of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were analyzed for TAG content with ImageJ software (Research Services Branch, National Institutes of Health). Stable Knockdown of FSP27 in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Four different 21-nucleotide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs targeting FSP27 mRNA were designed using web design from Invitrogen. The sense oligonucleotides were as follows: FSP27-KD1, 5′-GGAAGGTTCGCAAAGGCATCA-3′; FSP27KD2, 5′-GCCAACTAAGAAGATCGATGT-3′; FSP27-KD3, 5′-GCAACCCTCTATGACACATAC-3′; and FSP27-KD4, 5′-GGATGCCACCGAGGAAGAACA-3′. The oligonucleotides were cloned into the retroviral pSUPERIOR.retro.puro vector from OligoEngine (Seattle, WA) with a sense-loop-antisense design, using the loop sequence CTTCCTGTCA. The sense and anti-sense strands of the oligonucleotides (250 pmol each) were annealed in 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.5) and 1 m NaCl with conditions of 95 °C for 3 min, then 25 cycles of 20 s with a 1 °C decrement per cycle, 70 °C for 10 min, and then 65 cycles of 20 s with a 1 °C decrement per cycle, then 4 °C. Annealed oligonucleotides were ligated into the pSUPERIOR.retro.puro vector using T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). The vector was digested with BglII and HindIII and gel-purified. Ligation was performed using 1 μl of the annealed oligonucleotide mix, 75 ng of digested vector, T4 DNA ligase, and 1× ligation buffer in a 10-μl reaction. Ligation was performed at conditions of 100 cycles of 22 °C for 20 s and 12 °C for 1 min. The ligation mix was transformed into chemically competent DH5α cells. Purified plasmids were sequenced by the core facility at the University of Michigan to verify the correct insert. The knockdown of FSP27 expression was measured after day 10 of differentiation. FSP27 expression was measured using quantitative PCR with the forward primer 5′-GACCTCCTGAACAAGGTCCA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TAGCTGGGCTCTCTTCTTGC-3′ and SYBRGreen master mix. Of the four shRNAs evaluated, KD1 and KD4 decreased expression of FSP27 by 85 and 65%, respectively. Results presented here are from KD1. Adipocytes with FSP27 deficiency because of KD4 showed characteristics intermediate between control and KD1 cells. Quantitative PCR—The following marker genes for white adipose tissue or brown adipose tissues were evaluated: Cidea, Prdm16, Cox7a1, Zic1, Tbx15, Wnt4, IGFBP3, Dpt, Aldh1a1, Meox2, Fabp4, Ucp1, Pparγ, Cebpα, adiponectin, perilipin, adipophilin, and S3-12. Primers were obtained from published reports (27Timmons J.A. Wennmalm K. Larsson O. Walden T.B. Lassmann T. Petrovic N. Hamilton D.L. Gimeno R.E. Wahlestedt C. Baar K. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Proc.

Primer sequences are available upon request. RNA was harvested from cells in triplicates using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Pelleted RNAs were dissolved in 15 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and concentration was measured with a spectrophotometer. Two μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using TaqMan reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Random hexamers were used for first strand cDNA synthesis. Gene expression levels were analyzed by quantitative PCR in an ABI-PRISM® 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBRGreen mastermix (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression levels were normalized to 18 S rRNA (pre-developed TaqMan assay, Applied Biosystems). Gene expression levels for 18 S were determined using the Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). All reactions were run under singleplex conditions. Samples were run in triplicate under quantitative PCR conditions. Data were quantified and normalized using the ΔCt method. Data are from day 14 3T3-L1 adipocytes and are representative of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. As controls, mRNA from mouse interscapular brown adipose tissue and cultured brown adipocytes differentiated in vitro were included in the real time PCR. RNAs from cultured brown adipocytes were a present from Jamie A. Timmons and were obtained as described by Scheele et al. (29Scheele C. Nielsen A.R. Walden T.B. Sewell D.A. Fischer C.P. Brogan R.J. Petrovic N. Larsson O. Tesch P.A. Wennmalm K. Hutchinson D.S. Cannon B. Wahlestedt C. Pedersen B.K. Timmons J.A. FASEB J. 2008; 21: 3653-3665Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Glucose Uptake Assay—Day 14–16 adipocytes were incubated for 3 h in serum- and glucose-free media. Basal and insulin-induced (100 nm) glucose uptake was measured by rinsing cells and incubating for 30 min in uptake buffer with or without insulin followed by addition of unlabeled glucose and radiolabeled 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose. Cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and media were removed, and cells were washed in cold saline solution (0.9% NaCl). Cells were lysed in 500 μl of 0.05 n NaOH, and 400 μl were added to a scintillation vial and tritium detected by addition of 3 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation liquid. Protein content was measured from the remaining cell lysate using the Bio-Rad Protein assay. Glucose uptake is expressed as mean ± S.D. and relative to control cells for each independent experiment (n = 5, each experiment performed in triplicate). β-Oxidation Assay—Mitochondrial β-oxidation of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (GE Healthcare) in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was assayed by the degree of incorporation of 3H into H2O. Krebs-Ringer buffer (Sigma) containing 10 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science), 100 μm unlabeled palmitic acid (Sigma), and 8.33 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid was added to cells that had been washed with PBS. “Blank” plates were obtained by incubating cells with methanol for 1 min prior to addition of reaction mixture. Cells were incubated for 2 h and then washed twice with 1 ml of PBS, and the reaction mixtures and PBS were all added to NaOH-treated AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin (Bio-Rad) in plastic chromatography columns (Evergreen Scientific, Los Angeles, CA). The resin was then washed twice with 1 ml of H2O. Reaction mix, PBS, and H2O were collected in scintillation vials, and 3H was counted for 5 min. Tritium (counts/min) for the non-blank plates was normalized to the base readings from the blank plates, and these values were normalized to the protein concentration of each plate. After PBS washes, each plate was lysed in Lysis Buffer (1% SDS, 60 mm Tris base, 10 mm EDTA (pH 6.8)) and protein concentration determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Triacylglycerol Content—Concentration of triacylglycerol in preadipocytes was determined using Infinity triglyceride reagent (Sigma) as described (30Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Gerin I. DeRose P.M. Bajnok L. Longo K.A. Misek D.E. Kuick R. Hanash S.M. Atkins K.B. Andresen S.M. Nebb H.I. Madsen L. Kristiansen K. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5989-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Concentration of TAG in control and FSP27-knockdown adipocytes was determined using the GPO-Trinder reagent (Pointe Scientific, Canton, MI), according to manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured as described above. Lipolysis Assay—Day 14–17 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in low glucose media without serum but with 1% free fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h. Media were stored at–80 °C until analysis. Samples were analyzed for glycerol and nonesterified fatty acid content using the GPO-Trinder reagent (Pointe Scientific, Canton, MI) and the half-micro-NEFA C assay (WAKO Chemicals, Neuss, Germany), respectively. Samples were analyzed according to manufacturer's instructions. Glycerol and nonesterified fatty acid release are expressed in mmol/well. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Western Blots—Cultured cells were washed with PBS, lysed, and quantitated as above. Protein was separated on 4–12% gradient Tris-glycine gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked in 5% skim milk, and detected with either of the following primary antibodies: PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); Glut4 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA); FABP4 (gift from D. Lane, Johns Hopkins University); perilipin (donated by D. Brasaemle). FABP4 and Glut4 primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Dako) using autoradiography film. PPARγ and perilipin antibodies were detected by IRDye secondary antibodies and scanned on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Human Diabetes Study—We used a cross-sectional case control study design. Participants were divided into four distinct groups as follows: patients classified as non-obese (body mass index, <30 kg/m2) or obese (body mass index, ≥30 kg/m2) and either with normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, or with type 2 diabetes. Participants (n = 192) were recruited by advertising in a local newspaper. The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes were used to classify patients. Participants were carefully screened to isolate metabolic conditions other than type 2 diabetes. Exclusion criteria were as follows: treatment with insulin, recent or ongoing infection, and history of malignant disease. Participants were categorized as having cardiovascular disease if they had claudication or at least one of the following diagnoses: cerebrovascular accident, angina pectoris, or prior coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Participants received oral and written information about the experimental procedures before giving their written informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg Council (01-141/04). Protocol—Participants reported in the laboratory between 0800 and 1000 h after an overnight fast. They did not take any medication in the 24 h preceding the examination, and those with type 2 diabetes did not take hypoglycemic medication for 1 week prior to the examination. A general health examination was performed. Sphygmomanometric measurement of brachial blood pressure was performed on the participants while resting in supine position. Fasting blood samples were drawn from an antecubital vein, and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Prior to the oral glucose tolerance test, adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue using the percutaneous needle biopsy technique with suction, preceded by a subcutaneous injection of lidocaine. The biopsies were cleaned of connective tissue and blood and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pelleted RNA was dissolved in 15 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and cDNA prepared as described above. Human FSP27 (CIDE-3) expression levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH (PDAR, Applied Biosystems), and ratios of FSP27:GAPDH expression were determined using the standard curve method. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test—Blood samples were drawn before and 1 and 2 h after drinking 500 ml of water containing 75 g of dissolved glucose. The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria were applied, i.e. normal glucose tolerance (n = 81) was defined as fasting venous plasma glucose <7.0 and venous plasma glucose <7.8 mm, 2 h after the oral glucose load; impaired glucose tolerance (n = 30) was defined as fasting venous plasma glucose <7.0 mm and venous plasma glucose between 7.8 and 11.0 mm 2 h after the oral glucose load; type 2 diabetes (DM2, n = 81) was defined as fasting venous plasma glucose >7 mm or venous plasma glucose >11.1 mm 2 h after the oral glucose load. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was calculated from fasting glucose and insulin measurements and used as an indicator of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Statistical Analysis—Data from cell culture experiments were tested for significance by ANOVA using SigmaStat 2.03. If data failed to show a normal distribution even after transformation, an ANOVA on ranks using the Mann-Whitney t test was performed. The glucose uptake data were log-transformed to obtain a normal distribution, and data are thus presented as geometric mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis of gene expression data were performed on ΔCt levels (Ct-18 S), which were normally distributed and thus presented as mean ± S.D. For analysis of glycerol and nonesterified fatty acid release, data were analyzed using ANOVA or ANOVA on ranks. Data are thus presented as mean ± S.D. Data from the human diabetes cohort were analyzed using SAS 9.1. Expression of FSP27 Stimulates Apoptosis in 293T and 3T3-L1 Cells—To investigate the pro-apoptotic properties of FSP27, we transiently transfected 293T cells with control vector (pcDNA3.1) or expression vectors for FSP27 (including N- and C-terminal regions), death receptor 4, or Cideb (Fig. 1A). In blinded experiments, control cells underwent apoptosis at a rate of ∼1%, whereas expression of FSP27 increased apoptosis to ∼7.5%, consistent with data reported previously with the human homolog of FSP27 (9Liang L.

https://openalex.org/W1991867714,"Culture-expanded human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are increasingly used in a variety of preclinical and clinical studies. However, these cells have a low rate of engraftment to bone marrow or damaged tissues. Several laboratories have shown that during isolation and subculturing mesenchymal stem cells quickly lose the expression of CXCR4, the key receptor responsible for lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cell homing. Here we show that culturing of hMSCs as three-dimensional aggregates (hMSC spheroids) restores CXCR4 functional expression. Expression of CXCR4 inversely correlates with the secretion of SDF-1 by hMSCs. Cells from hMSC spheroids up-regulate expression of CD49b, the α2 integrin subunit, and suppress the expression of CD49d, the α4 integrin subunit. Transfer of cells from the spheroids back to a monolayer suppresses the expression of CXCR4 and CD49b and restores the expression of CD49d. Treatment of cells from the spheroids with SDF-1 leads to CXCR4 internalization and activation of ERK-1,2. Adhesion of hMSCs to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was investigated. SDF-1, AMD-3100, or exposure of HUVECs to hypoxia did not affect adhesion of hMSCs from a monolayer to HUVECs. Adhesion of cells from hMSC spheroids to HUVECs was stimulated by SDF-1, AMD-3100, or by exposure of HUVECs to hypoxia. Stimulatory effects of hypoxia and addition of SDF-1 or AMD-3100 were not additive. Overall, our data indicate that the expression of CXCR4 by hMSCs regulates hMSC adhesion to endothelial cells.

When infused into the peripheral circulation, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attracted to an irradiated bone marrow or injured tissues (10Rombouts W.J. Ploemacher R.E.

Improvement in hMSC engraftment in bone marrow and ischemic tissues might help to decrease the number of infused cells and be beneficial for clinical applications. The homing mechanisms that guide recruitment of MSCs are still unclear. MSCs are believed to migrate via the bloodstream to seed the sites of hematopoiesis during embryonic development (17Campagnoli C. Roberts I.A. Kumar S. Bennett P.R. Bellantuono I. Fisk N.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 2396-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar) or sites of injury in adult life (10Rombouts W.J. Ploemacher R.E.

Over the past decade, significant advances have been made in characterizing homing of HSCs to the bone marrow. The distribution of HSCs circulating in the bloodstream is controlled by the ability of these cells to adhere and roll on bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial cells, transmigrate through an endothelial barrier, and be retained in bone marrow niches. These processes are controlled by cell adhesion molecules and chemokines (18Chute J.P. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2006; 13: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Initially discovered as a co-receptor for human immunodeficiency virus entry (19Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3636) Google Scholar), the chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand, the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), are believed to be key players in colonization of bone marrow by HSCs (20Peled A. Petit I. Kollet O. Magid M. Ponomaryov T. Byk T. Nagler A. Ben-Hur H. Many A. Shultz L. Lider O. Alon R. Zipori D. Lapidot T. Science. 1999; 283: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). The interaction between SDF-1 and CXCR4 mediates engraftment of cancer stem cells to the bone marrow (21Geminder H. Sagi-Assif O. Goldberg L. Meshel T. Rechavi G. Witz I.P. Ben-Baruch A. J.

Dheen S.T. Tay S.S. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2004; 22: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). SDF-1 is constantly produced by bone marrow stromal cells, immature osteoblasts, and endothelial cells (25Ponomaryov T. Peled A. Petit I. Taichman R.S. Habler L. Sandbank J. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Magerus A. Caruz A. Fujii N. Nagler A. Lahav M. Szyper-Kravitz M. Zipori D. Lapidot T. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Knock outs of CXCR4 or SDF-1 are lethal, resulting in severe bone marrow failure, a significant defect in colonization of embryonic bone marrow by HSCs, and abnormal development of heart and brain (26Nagasawa T.

Homing capabilities of MSCs are greatly influenced by cell culture conditions. Most of the freshly isolated MSCs were detected in the bone marrow of sublethally irradiated mice after systemic administration, whereas homing to the bone marrow of MSCs subcultured for as little as 24 h was significantly reduced (10Rombouts W.J. Ploemacher R.E. Leukemia. 2003; 17: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). It was suggested that subculturing of MSCs leads to changes in their phenotype that affects MSC homing (32Kemp K.C. Hows J. Donaldson C. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2005; 46: 1531-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The earliest passages of hMSCs express CXCR4 and chemotactically respond to SDF-1 (33Honczarenko M. Le Y. Swierkowski M. Ghiran I. Glodek A.M. Silberstein L.E. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2006; 24: 1030-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 34Ringe J. Strassburg S. Neumann K. Endres M. Notter M. Burmester G.R. Kaps C. Sittinger M. J. Cell Biochem. 2007; 101: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Culturing of hMSCs for more than two passages was associated with a decrease in expression of adhesion molecules, the loss of chemokine receptors, including CXCR4, and lack of chemotactic response to chemokines (33Honczarenko M.

Because of the low abundance of MSCs in bone marrow isolates, only culture-expanded hMSCs are likely to be used in clinic. The loss of the chemokine response results in impairment of homing and represents a substantial challenge for therapeutic application of hMSCs. Attempts to increase functional CXCR4 expression in MSCs have included transduction of hMSCs with a retroviral vector encoding CXCR4 (37Bhakta S. Hong P. Koc O. Cardiovasc. Revasc. Med. 2006; 7: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and treatment of the cells with tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-β and -γ, and copaxone (38Croitoru-Lamoury J. Lamoury F.M. Zaunders J.J. Veas L.A. Brew B.J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2007; 27: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or insulin-like growth factor (39Li Y. Yu X. Lin S. Li X. Zhang S. Song Y.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 356: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that transfer of hMSCs from a monolayer to hanging drops results in spontaneous association of cells leading to formation of spheroids. Culturing hMSCs as three-dimensional aggregates caused substantial changes in the pattern of gene expression (40Potapova I.A. Gaudette G.R. Brink P.R. Robinson R.B. Rosen M.R. Cohen I.S. Doronin S.V. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2007; 25: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These changes included up-regulation of CXCR4 and the α2 integrin subunit mRNAs. We hypothesized that the expression of CXCR4 and the α2 integrin subunit at the protein level will be affected as well. In this study we investigated effects of spheroid formation on the expression of cell surface markers by hMSCs and adhesion of hMSCs to HUVECs. Cell Culture— hMSCs and HUVECs were purchased from Cambrex BioScience. hMSCss were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (Lonza). HUVECs were cultured in EGM-2 basal medium containing growth factors supplied by the manufacturer (Lonza). Passages 2–5 of hMSCs or HUVECs were used. Spheroids were formed from hMSCs as previously described (40Potapova I.A. Gaudette G.R. Brink P.R. Robinson R.B. Rosen M.R. Cohen I.S. Doronin S.V. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2007; 25: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, hMSCs grown to confluence were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma) and dissociated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution (Lonza). The digestion was stopped by addition of trypsin inhibitor solution (Lonza). hMSCs were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma) and 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). The cells (250,000 cells in 40 μl) were kept for 3 days in hanging drops. Growth medium was changed every day. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Surface Antigens—Analysis of cell surface antigens was performed as described (29Majumdar M.K. Keane-Moore M. Buyaner D. Hardy W.B. Moorman M.A. McIntosh K.R. Mosca J.D. J Biomed. Sci. 2003; 10: 228-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were dissociated from a monolayer of hMSCs or hMSC spheroids with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution (Lonza) for 90 min at room temperature. Trypsinization was stopped by addition of trypsin inhibitor solution (Lonza). Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with flow cytometry buffer made from PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.1% sodium azide (Fluka). Cells (2 × 105) were stained using manufacturer-suggested concentrations of fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Anti-human HLA class I, CD31, CD34, CD55, and CD105 were purchased from Diaclone. Anti-human c-met was obtained from eBioscience. Antibodies to human CD28, CD29, CD38, CD44, CD49b, CD49d, CD54, CD73, CD90, CD117, CD166, CD184, and CD209 were from BD Biosciences. After staining, cells were washed with 5 ml of the flow cytometry buffer and resuspended in the flow cytometry buffer supplemented with 1% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Background staining was assessed by incubation of cells with mouse fluorochrome- and isotype-matched immunoglobulins (isotype controls). Flow cytometric analysis of hMSCs grown as a monolayer or isolated from the spheroids was performed using identical instrumental settings by analyzing 10,000 events on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Signals from subcellular debris were eliminated during data acquisition by gating. The CellQuest™ software package was used to process the data. Exposure of Cells to Hypoxia—HUVECs were exposed to hypoxia in a BD GasPak EZ Anaerobe Gas-generating Pouch System with an Indicator (BD Biosciences) as described (40Potapova I.A. Gaudette G.R. Brink P.R. Robinson R.B. Rosen M.R. Cohen I.S. Doronin S.V. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2007; 25: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). As certified by the manufacturer, the Anaerobe Gas Generating Pouch System produces an atmosphere containing 10% carbon dioxide and 1% oxygen. Preparation of Conditioned Medium—DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum was conditioned by a confluent monolayer of hMSCs or by hMSC spheroids for 24 h as described (40Potapova I.A. Gaudette G.R. Brink P.R. Robinson R.B. Rosen M.R. Cohen I.S. Doronin S.V. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2007; 25: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was collected, passed through Acrodisc 0.2 μm HT Tuffryn Membrane Low Protein Binding Filters (Pall Corp.), and stored at -80 °C until use. SDF-1 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—The SDF-1 content in conditioned medium was measured with an ELISA kit for human SDF-1 (R&D Systems). The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were dissociated from a monolayer of hMSCs or 3-day old hMSC spheroids as described above. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, plated in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum on Lab-Tek II chamber CC2 glass slides (Nalge Nunc International), and allowed to adhere for 8 h. Then the cells were serum-starved for 2 h in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and treated with or without 1 μg/ml SDF-1α in HBSS for 45 min in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with buffered formalin (1:10 dilution) (Fisher Diagnostic) for 10 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Slides were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Bovine serum albumin was then removed, slides were washed again with PBS, and cells were stained overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml anti-human CXCR4 antibody (R&D Systems; catalog number MAB172). Unbound CXCR4 antibodies were removed by washing slides three times with PBS. Slides were incubated with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated F(ab′)2 secondary antibodies (1:1000; Molecular Probes) dissolved in PBS containing 0.165 μm Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) and 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Slides were washed three times with PBS and mounted on coverslips in VectaShield mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (VectaShield-DAPI; Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescence was analyzed by deconvolution microscopy using an Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cross-sectional images were obtained with 250 nm Z-stack steps and processed using a constrained iterative algorithm of the AxioVision 4.1 software package (Carl Zeiss). ERK-1,2 Activation Assay—Cells were dissociated from a monolayer of hMSCs or 3-day-old hMSC spheroids as described above, collected by centrifugation, and washed with PBS. Dissociated cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture dishes (5 × 104/well) in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum and allowed to adhere for 8 h. Cells were then serum-starved for 4 h and treated with and without 1 μg/ml SDF-1α in HBSS for 0–20 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were lysed with 1 ml/well of lysis buffer containing 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a set of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (cocktails type 1 and 2) (Sigma) for 15 min at 4 °C. The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Proteins (25 μg) were separated in Bis-Tris 12% Criterion gel using XT MOPS running buffer (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Western blot was performed using p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-284) (197G2) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using affinity-purified peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment antibody (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Adhesion Assay—Adhesion of hMSCs to endothelial cells was studied using hMSCs isolated from a monolayer or 3-day-old hMSC spheroids. Cells were dissociated using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution (Lonza) for 15 min in the case of hMSC monolayers or for 90 min in the case of the spheroids. Trypsinization was stopped by addition of trypsin inhibitor solution (Lonza). Isolated cells were washed with PBS, labeled with 2 μg/ml Calcein AM in HBSS for 45 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, washed with HBSS, and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. HUVECs were plated in 24-well plates and maintained in EBM-2 growth medium for 2–3 days until they reached confluence. For the adhesion assay, EBM-2 medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. hMSCs (10,000 cells/well) were added to endothelial cells. The adhesion assay was performed in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml SDF-1 or 10 μm AMD-3100 or without additives. Plates were placed on a rotation platform (30 rotations/min) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Wells were washed three times with 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum followed by addition of 0.5 ml/well of the same medium. Fluorescence was acquired from the bottom of the plates using a POLARstar OPTIMA microplate reader at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/520 nm. Background fluorescence was determined in the wells containing no hMSCs but a monolayer of endothelial cells. Total cell load was estimated as the fluorescence from non-washed wells with added hMSCs. A minimum of six wells was used to estimate background fluorescence, total cell load, or fluorescence from adhered cells. Percent of bound cells was calculated as a ratio between fluorescence of adhered cells and total cell load after subtraction of background fluorescence. Data from five independent preparations of hMSC spheroids and four independent preparations of hMSCs grown as a monolayer were statistically processed with the SigmaStat software package (Sigma). Expression of Cell Surface Markers by hMSCs—According to flow cytometry, cells dissociated from a monolayer or the spheroids gave rise to homogeneous populations. Cells from 3-day-old spheroids had smaller size and higher granularity (supplemental Fig. S1). We tested expression of 19 markers commonly used to characterize hMSCs by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S2). hMSCs from a monolayer and the spheroids were positive for CD29, CD44, CD54, CD55, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD166, and HLA-I. Neither cells from a monolayer nor cells from the spheroids were positive for c-met, CD28, CD31, CD34, CD38, CD117, or CD209. We also analyzed effects of trypsinization on the expression of cell surface markers by hMSCs. Treatment with trypsin for 90 min did not affect the expression of CD49d and CD166 in hMSCs. Detection of CD29, CD44, CD54, CD55, CD90, CD105, and HLA-I was sensitive to trypsin-EDTA treatment. Nevertheless, all antigens that tested positive after 5 min of trypsinization remained positive after 90 min of incubation with trypsin (supplemental Fig. S3). Cells from a monolayer and the spheroids showed differences in the expression of CD49d (α4 integrin subunit), CD49b (α2 integrin subunit), and CD184 (CXCR4). Changes in the expression of these antigens occur gradually from day 1 to day 3 of hMSC culturing as the spheroids (supplemental Fig. S4). Representative stainings of hMSCs from a monolayer and 3-day-old spheroids are shown in Fig. 1, A–F. Cells from the spheroids were CD49d-negative and CD49b-positive (Fig. 1E), whereas cells from a monolayer were CD49b-negative and CD49d-positive (Fig. 1B). hMSCs grown as a monolayer did not express CD184 (Fig. 1C). A significant fraction of cells isolated from the spheroids demonstrated positive staining for CD184 (Fig. 1F). On average, 6.19 ± 1.4% cells from a monolayer and 89.9 ± 3.5% cells from 3-day-old spheroids were positive for CD49b (Fig. 1G). The fraction of cells stained positive for CD49d was 70.77 ± 15.9% for cells from a monolayer and 1.95 ± 1% for cells from 3-day-old hMSC spheroids (Fig. 1H). Only 2 ± 0.5% cells from a monolayer were CD184-positive; 35 ± 5% cells from 3-day-old spheroids showed positive staining for CD184 (Fig. 1I). The differences in the expression levels of CD49b, CD49d, and CD184 were statistically significant (t-test, p value <0.05). Overall, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the pattern of antigen expression by cells from the spheroids was similar to that found for hMSCs from a monolayer. Substantial differences, however, were detected in the expression of several proteins, CXCR4 and the α2 and α4 integrin subunits, responsible for cell adhesion and motility. Secretion of SDF-1 by hMSCs and hMSC Spheroids—It was reported that the expression of CXCR4 by hMSCs inversely correlates with the expression of SDF-1 (41Lisignoli G. Toneguzzi S. Zini N.

Cavallo C. Caplan A.I. Facchini A. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 207: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). According to our Affymetrix microarray data, the expression of SDF-1 mRNA was 10-fold down-regulated in hMSC spheroids (40Potapova I.A. Gaudette G.R. Brink P.R. Robinson R.B. Rosen M.R. Cohen I.S. Doronin S.V. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2007; 25: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We investigated how formation of the spheroids affects SDF-1 secretion by hMSCs. SDF-1 was measured in medium conditioned by a monolayer of hMSCs or 1-, 2-, or 3-day-old hMSC spheroids. The amount of SDF-1 in conditioned medium was normalized to the cell number. Relative changes in the secretion of SDF-1 are shown in Fig. 2. There was a statistically significant decline (t-test, p value <0.05) in SDF-1 secretion by 2- and 3-day-old hMSC spheroids in comparison with hMSCs from a monolayer. Transfer of hMSCs from the Spheroids to a Monolayer Restores the Expression Pattern of CXCR4 and the α2 and α4 Integrin Subunits—We investigated whether changes in the expression of CXCR4 and the α2 and α4 integrin subunits are reversible. For this, cells were isolated from 3-day-old hMSC spheroids and maintained in monolayer for 1–7 days. Expression of CXCR4 (CD184) and the α2 (CD49b) and α4 (CD49d) integrin subunits was analyzed by flow cytometry. Fig. 3A shows that the expression of CXCR4 (CD184) was down-regulated. Expression of the α2(CD49b) and α4(CD49d) integrin subunits also"
https://openalex.org/W1967197134,"Dicer-like (DCL) enzymes play a pivotal role in RNA silencing in plants, processing the long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that triggers silencing into the primary short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that mediate it. The siRNA population can be augmented and silencing amplified via transitivity, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR)-dependent pathway that uses the target RNA as substrate to generate secondary siRNAs. Here we report that Arabidopsis DCL2–but not DCL4-is required for transitivity in cell-autonomous, post-transcriptional silencing of transgenes. An insertion mutation in DCL2 blocked sense transgene-induced silencing and eliminated accumulation of the associated RDR-dependent siRNAs. In hairpin transgene-induced silencing, the dcl2 mutation likewise eliminated accumulation of secondary siRNAs and blocked transitive silencing, but did not block silencing mediated by primary siRNAs. Strikingly, in all cases, the dcl2 mutation eliminated accumulation of all secondary siRNAs, including those generated by other DCL enzymes. In contrast, mutations in DCL4 promoted a dramatic shift to transitive silencing in the case of the hairpin transgene and enhanced silencing induced by the sense transgene. Suppression of hairpin and sense transgene silencing by the P1/HC-Pro and P38 viral suppressors was associated with elimination of secondary siRNA accumulation, but the suppressors did not block processing of the stem of the hairpin transcript into primary siRNAs. Thus, these viral suppressors resemble the dcl2 mutation in their effects on siRNA biogenesis. We conclude that DCL2 plays an essential, as opposed to redundant, role in transitive silencing of transgenes and may play a more important role in silencing of viruses than currently thought."
https://openalex.org/W2076203883,"Ectopic expression of mutant forms of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) lacking lipid (G129E) or lipid and protein (C124S) phosphatase activity decreased sensitivity of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which have wild-type PTEN, to doxorubicin and increased sensitivity to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin. Cells transfected with a mutant PTEN gene lacking both lipid and protein phosphatase activities were more resistant to doxorubicin than cells transfected with the PTEN mutant lacking lipid phosphatase activity indicating that the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN was also important in controlling the sensitivity to doxorubicin, while no difference was observed between the lipid (G129E) and lipid and protein (C124S) phosphatase PTEN mutants in terms of sensitivity to rapamycin. A synergistic inhibitory interaction was observed when doxorubicin was combined with rapamycin in the phosphatase-deficient PTEN-transfected cells. Interference with the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN was sufficient to activate Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling. These studies indicate that disruption of the normal activity of the PTEN phosphatase can have dramatic effects on the therapeutic sensitivity of breast cancer cells. Mutations in the key residues which control PTEN lipid and protein phosphatase may act as dominant-negative mutants to suppress endogenous PTEN and alter the sensitivity of breast cancer patients to chemo- and targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1993688922,"Cannabinoids are potential agents for the development of therapeutic strategies against multiple sclerosis. Here we analyzed the role of the peripheral CB2 cannabinoid receptor in the control of myeloid progenitor cell trafficking toward the inflamed spinal cord and their contribution to microglial activation in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, EAE). CB2 receptor knock-out mice showed an exacerbated clinical score of the disease when compared with their wild-type littermates, and this occurred in concert with extended axonal loss, T-lymphocyte (CD4+) infiltration, and microglial (CD11b+) activation. Immature bone marrow-derived CD34+ myeloid progenitor cells, which play a role in neuroinflammatory pathologies, were shown to express CB2 receptors and to be abundantly recruited toward the spinal cords of CB2 knock-out EAE mice. Bone marrow-derived cell transfer experiments further evidenced the increased contribution of these cells to microglial replenishment in the spinal cords of CB2-deficient animals. In line with these observations, selective pharmacological CB2 activation markedly reduced EAE symptoms, axonal loss, and microglial activation. CB2 receptor manipulation altered the expression pattern of different chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5) and their receptors (CCR1, CCR2), thus providing a mechanistic explanation for its role in myeloid progenitor recruitment during neuroinflammation. These findings demonstrate the protective role of CB2 receptors in EAE pathology; provide evidence for a new site of CB2 receptor action, namely the targeting of myeloid progenitor trafficking and its contribution to microglial activation; and support the potential use of non-psychoactive CB2 agonists in therapeutic strategies for multiple sclerosis and other neuroinflammatory disorders.

This protective role of the eCB system during neuroinflammation is exerted, at least in part, by decreasing immune cell activation and infiltration (12Walter L. Stella N. Br. J.

Alleviation of EAE symptoms by cannabinoid intervention is mostly attributed to the engagement of neuronal CB1 receptors (4Maresz K. Pryce G. Ponomarev E.D. Marsicano G. Croxford J.L. Shriver L.P.

As modulation of cannabinoid signaling may result in unwanted psychoactive actions mediated by neuronal CB1 receptors, the use of CB2-selective agonists is an attractive therapeutic possibility (15Fernández-Ruiz J. Romero J. Velasco G. Tolón R.M. Ramos J.A. Guzmán M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 39-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 23Mackie K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 101-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The present study was therefore aimed at elucidating the role and action mechanism of the CB2 cannabinoid receptor in EAE. In particular, we focused on the trafficking of myeloid progenitors toward the inflamed spinal cord and their contribution to microglial activation during EAE pathogenesis. Materials—The following materials were kindly donated: CB2 receptor knock-out mice by Nancy Buckley (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and HU-308 by Pharmos (Rehovot, Israel). The following antibodies were used: polyclonal anti-200-kDa neurofilament heavy protein and anti-human CD11b (clone M1/70) from AbCam (Cambridge, UK); monoclonal rat anti-mouse CD45R/B220 (clone RA3-6B2) fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody, rat anti-mouse CD11b (clone M1/70), and anti-CD4 from BD Biosciences; monoclonal anti-mouse CD34-biotin (clone RAM34) from eBioscience (San Diego, CA); polyclonal anti-CB2 receptor from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO); monoclonal anti-human CD45RB (clone PD7/26) from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark); polyclonal anti-GFP from Invitrogen; and rabbit monoclonal anti-Ki-67 (SP6) from LabVision (Fremont, CA). Macrophagecolony stimulating factor and Flt-3 were from PreproTech Inc. (London, UK). Animal Procedures and EAE Induction—Animal procedures were performed according to the European Union guidelines (86/609/EU) for the use of laboratory animals. Adult CB2 receptor-deficient mice (8 weeks old) (24Buckley N.E. McCoy K.L. Mezey E. Bonner T. Felder C.C. Glass M. Zimmer A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 396: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and their respective wildtype littermates, housed in a temperature-controlled room with a fixed 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, were obtained from heterozygote crosses. For EAE induction, mice were immunized at days 0 and 7 by subcutaneous injection of 150 μg of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 peptide emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant, as described previously (25Nataf S. Carroll S.L. Wetsel R.A. Szalai A.J. Barnum S.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5867-5873Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, at days 0 and 2, mice were administered intraperitoneally with 500 ng of pertussis toxin (Sigma). Clinical scores were monitored using the following scale: 0, lack of clinical signs; 1, tail weakness; 2, hind limb paraparesis, hemiparesis, or ataxia; 3, hind limb paralysis or hemiparalysis; 4, complete paralysis; 5, moribund; 6, death. In pharmacological experiments, HU-308 (15 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally starting at the day of maximal score and thereafter daily until sacrifice. Control animals received the corresponding vehicle injections (100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml defatted bovine serum albumin and 4% dimethyl sulfoxide). Each clinical score value was obtained from a representative experiment of four or three independent experiments aimed at elucidating the effect of CB2 receptor genetic ablation or HU-308 administration, respectively. Cell transfer experiments were performed by intracardiac injection of 5 × 106 bone marrow cells derived from healthy C57BL/6 (ACTβ-EGFP) mice into EAE-induced wild-type (WT) and CB2-/- syngenic mice at day 9 before symptom appearance. Recipient mice were sacrificed and analyzed 10 days after engraftment. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in EAE mice (n = 4 each group) the day before sacrifice at the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Center of Complutense University (Madrid, Spain). Anesthetized mice were placed in a Biospec 47/40 (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) operating at 4.7 teslas, equipped with a 12-cm gradient set and using a 4-cm radio frequency surface coil. Three-dimensional T2-weighted spin-echo images were acquired using a fast spin-echo sequence. The acquisition parameters were: time recovery = 2226 ms, effective time echo = 117 ms, field of view = 2.5 × 1.6 × 1.0 cm3, and two averages. The acquisition matrix size was 256 × 128 × 32, which was zero-filled to get a reconstructed matrix size of 256 × 256 × 32. The total acquisition time was 19 min. Diffusion water images delineated the area of neuroinflammation evidenced as hyperintense signals. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—EAE mice were sacrificed, and isolated spinal cords were frozen on dry ice. Immunofluorescence analysis (26Aguado T. Palazuelos J. Monory K. Stella N. Cravatt B. Lutz B. Marsicano G. Kokaia Z. Guzmán M. Galve-Roperh I. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1551-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) was performed on ethanol-fixed 14-μm-thick cryostat sections. Spinal cord sections were rinsed and blocked for 30 min in PBS supplemented with 10% goat serum and 4% bovine serum albumin and, after washing, incubated with the indicated primary antibodies. Secondary antibody incubation (1 h at room temperature) was performed with the appropriate mouse, rat, and rabbit highly cross-adsorbed Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibodies or with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 streptavidin conjugates (Invitrogen). Washed sections were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml) in PBS prior to mounting. The specificity of CB2 receptor immunoreactivity was corroborated by using CB2-/- mouse sections, in which no immunoreactivity was observed, and allowed to adjust optimal confocal microscope settings. CB2 receptor expression was analyzed with anti-CB2 receptor antibody together with anti-CD11b and anti-CD34-biotinilated antibodies (overnight incubation at 4 °C) followed by secondary staining for rabbit and mouse IgGs with highly cross-adsorbed Alexa Fluor 647, Alexa Fluor 594, and streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibodies, respectively. In addition, triple immunostaining was performed with a combination of anti-CD34, CD45R/B220, and CB2 primary antibodies and their appropriate secondary fluorescent antibodies. All immunofluorescence data were obtained in a blinded manner by two independent observers in a minimum of 5-7 adjacent slices of two different samples from the lumbo-thoracic spinal cord of the same animal. To determine the loss of axonal surface and the extent of microglial activation, neurofilament H and CD11b staining was quantified with Metamorph-Offline software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA) and referred to the total white matter area of spinal cord sections. T-cells, CD34+ cells, and bone marrow GFP infiltration were quantified by immunoreactive positive cell counting, and results are given as mean cell number per mm2. CD34 and CD31 double immunostaining was routinely performed to confirm that CD34 immunoreactivity included, in addition to CD31+ vascular endothelial cells, cells with microglial features. Only CD34+ cells displaying a rounded morphology (similar to ameboid microglia) or extending short processes (similar to reactive microglia) were counted. Both perivascular and parenchymal CD34+ cells were observed, and a significant fraction of those cells did not express the endothelial marker CD31 and co-expressed the microglial marker CD11b. Results are given as mean cell number per mm2. In vitro immunofluorescence was performed with the indicated primary antibodies and the corresponding secondary fluorescent antibodies (as above). Immunofluorescence controls were routinely performed with incubations in which primary antibodies were not included. Immunofluorescence images shown in Figs. 2 and 3 were obtained with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan II) and acquired with a CDD camera (F-View II; Soft Imaging System). Images in Figs.

Briefly, 8-week-old female mice were sacrificed, and bone marrows were harvested by flushing out tibiae and femurs and culturing in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 4% N2 (Invitrogen), 15 ng/ml Flt-3, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor and penicillin and streptomycin. Six days after plating, non-adherent cells were harvested and, after washing, characterized by flow cytometry or replated for the generation of microglial-like cells. Myeloid progenitors were differentiated for 5 days in bone marrow culture medium (described above) supplemented with 1 volume (50%) of glial cell conditioned medium. Prior or after differentiation, adherent cells were fixed for immunofluorescence, frozen for RNA extraction, or detached for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll (Histopaque 1077; Sigma) from blood samples obtained from the cave vein. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 2% goat calf serum for flow cytometry analysis or frozen for RNA analysis. Flow cytometry was performed with 0.5 × 106 cells per condition fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Antibodies and their corresponding controls were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 2% goat serum-PBS and, after washing, samples were subjected to secondary antibody incubation. Ten thousand cells per recording were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. mRNA Detection and Quantification—RNA was obtained with the RNeasy Protect kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using the RNase-free DNase kit. cDNA was subsequently obtained using the SuperScript first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science, Welwyn Garden City, UK) and amplified with the primers indicated in supplemental Table 1A. CB1 and CB2 PCR amplifications were performed using the following conditions: 93 °C for 1 min, two rounds (30 s at 59 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and 30 s at 93 °C), two rounds (30 s at 57 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and 30 s at 93 °C), and 35 cycles (30 s at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and 30 s at 93 °C). Finally, after a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min, PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with Universal probe system (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) using the primers indicated in supplemental Table 1B. Amplifications were run in a 7900-HT Fast Real-time PCR system, and obtained values were adjusted using 18 S RNA levels as reference. Multiple Sclerosis Human Tissue Samples—Tissue samples were supplied by the UK Multiple Sclerosis Tissue Bank, funded by the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Registered Charity 207495. Cortical brain samples fixed in formalin, embedded, and cut in 4-μm-thick sections were employed for immunohistochemical study as described previously (28Benito C. Romero J.P. Tolon R.M. Clemente D. Docagne F. Hillard C.J. Guaza C. Romero J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2396-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were deparaffinized and, after washing, subjected to antigen retrieval procedure. Tissue samples were incubated with mouse anti-human CD45RB and rat anti-human CD11b monoclonal antibodies together with rabbit polyclonal anti-CB2 receptor antibody. Statistical Analysis—Results shown represent the means ± S.E. of the number of experiments indicated in every case. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance. A post hoc analysis was made by the Student-Neuman-Keuls test. In vivo data were analyzed by an unpaired Student's t test. CB2 Cannabinoid Receptor Deficiency Exacerbates EAE Pathogenesis—Wild-type mice immunized by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein injection developed EAE with the appearance of symptoms starting at day 12.4 ± 4.2 and, after reaching a maximal stage at day 20.2 ± 2.7 (Fig. 1A), entered a chronic clinical phase (22Davoust N.

https://openalex.org/W1992260035,"A number of intracellular proteins that are protective after brain injury are classically thought to exert their effect within the expressing cell. The astrocytic metallothioneins (MT) are one example and are thought to act via intracellular free radical scavenging and heavy metal regulation, and in particular zinc. Indeed, we have previously established that astrocytic MTs are required for successful brain healing. Here we provide evidence for a fundamentally different mode of action relying upon intercellular transfer from astrocytes to neurons, which in turn leads to uptake-dependent axonal regeneration. First, we show that MT can be detected within the extracellular fluid of the injured brain, and that cultured astrocytes are capable of actively secreting MT in a regulatable manner. Second, we identify a receptor, megalin, that mediates MT transport into neurons. Third, we directly demonstrate for the first time the transfer of MT from astrocytes to neurons over a specific time course in vitro. Finally, we show that MT is rapidly internalized via the cell bodies of retinal ganglion cells in vivo and is a powerful promoter of axonal regeneration through the inhibitory environment of the completely severed mature optic nerve. Our work suggests that the protective functions of MT in the central nervous system should be widened from a purely astrocytic focus to include extracellular and intra-neuronal roles. This unsuspected action of MT represents a novel paradigm of astrocyte-neuronal interaction after injury and may have implications for the development of MT-based therapeutic agents.

This unsuspected action of MT represents a novel paradigm of astrocyte-neuronal interaction after injury and may have implications for the development of MT-based therapeutic agents. The mechanisms by which certain protective proteins expressed by astrocytes affect neuronal regeneration are not well understood. As an example, we have demonstrated that mice lacking the ability to express a protein produced predominantly by astrocytes in the CNS, 3The abbreviations used are: CNS, central nervous system; DiI, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; GAP-43, growth-associated protein-43; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IL-1α, interleukin-1α; MT, metallothionein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RAP, receptor-associated protein; RGC, retinal ganglion cell; RIA, radioimmunoassay; siRNA, short interfering RNA. metallothionein isoforms I/II (MT-I/-II), exhibit significantly worse outcomes following a range of CNS injuries (1Penkowa M.

Neurol. 2002; 173: 114-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Likewise, MT-I/-II-deficient animals fare worse following stroke, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (an experimental animal model of multiple sclerosis), and motor neuron disease (3Campagne M.L. Thibodeaux H. van Bruggen N. Cairns B. Gerald R. Palmer J.T. Williams S.P. Lowe D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12870-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 4Penkowa M.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8790-8796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, respectively). Hence, perturbation of an astrocytic protein has major consequences in the injured CNS, including an increase in apoptotic neurons and impaired neuronal regenerative growth. Indeed, genetically modified animals have been produced that exhibit the full range of possible astrocytic MT-I/-II expression, from null to overexpressing strains, and there is a robust correlation between MT-I/-II expression and the ability of the animal to recover from CNS insult or degenerative disease (1Penkowa M. Carrasco J. Giralt M. Moos T. Hidalgo J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 1: 2535-2545Crossref Google Scholar, 6Penkowa M. Espejo C. Martinez-Caceres E.M. Poulsen C.B. Montalban X. Hidalgo J. J.

J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7043-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies clearly demonstrate that MT-I/-II represented an important mechanism of protection and regeneration in the injured CNS. There are a number of ways that MT-I/-II might conceivably enhance the ability of astrocytes to promote neuronal regeneration. Metallothioneins, as exemplified by family members MT-I/-II, are zinc-binding proteins that may have roles in metal homeostasis or free radical scavenging (for reviews see Refs. 8Hidalgo J. Aschner M. Zatta P. Vasak M. Brain Res. Bull. 2001; 55: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 9West A.K. Chuah M.I. Vickers J.C. Chung R.S. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 15: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although their role in any tissue remains a matter of debate. Because they lack conventional secretion sequences (10Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and demonstrably accumulate in the astrocytic cytoplasm after neuronal injury (11Chung R.S. Adlard P.A. Dittmann J. Vickers J.C. Chuah M.I. West A.K. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the general consensus based upon more than 40 years of research is that MTs likely act within the expressing cell itself, and they may, for example, be part of the mechanism by which astrocytes handle toxic intermediates such as reactive oxygen molecules. However, we have shown that the role of MT-I/-II is potentially more complex than simply acting within astrocytes per se. We recently reported that MT-I/-II strongly increases post-injury regenerative sprouting when added directly to injured neurons in culture (12Chung R.S. Vickers J.C. Chuah M.I. West A.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3336-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, there are no glial or immune system cells present, indicating that extracellular MT-I/-II can act directly on injured neurons, i.e. outside the context of astrocytic cytoplasm. These experiments have since been replicated elsewhere showing that “exogenous” MT-I/-II strongly promotes regenerative neurite growth of cortical (12Chung R.S. Vickers J.C. Chuah M.I. West A.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3336-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dopaminergic, and hippocampal neurons (13Kohler L.B. Berezin V. Bock E. Penkowa M. Brain Res. 2003; 992: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and retinal ganglion cells (14Fitzgerald M. Nairn P. Bartlett C.A. Chung R.S. West A.K. Beazley L.D. Exp. Brain Res. 2007; 183: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) suggesting that there is a robust and generic neuronal response to extracellular MT-I/-II. Based upon these data and the existing literature, we have hypothesized a model to explain the role for extracellular MT-I/-II within the injured brain. We suggested that astrocytes respond to neural trauma by up-regulating MT-I/-II expression with the MT-I/-II being subsequently secreted, allowing direct interaction with neurons which promotes neuronal regeneration and survival following injury (15Chung R.S. West A.K. Neuroscience. 2004; 123: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although there are numerous studies investigating MT-I/-II expression following injury, little is known about the mechanism(s) whereby MT-I/-II might interact with neurons to exert their neuroregenerative effect. To examine these mechanisms, we addressed four questions. (a) Is MT-I/-II released by astrocytes in culture and following brain injury? (b) Is the interaction of extracellular MT-I/-II with neurons receptor-mediated? (c) Can MT-I/-II transfer from astrocytes to neurons be observed directly? (d) Is uptake of exogenous MT-I/-II associated with axon regeneration in vivo? We find that astrocytes are capable of releasing MT-I/-II in culture and that these proteins can be detected within the extracellular environment of the injured brain. In tissue culture experiments we identify a receptor whereby extracellular MT-I/-II directly interacts with neurons and demonstrate the direct transfer of MT-I/-II from astrocytes to neurons. Finally, we demonstrate in vivo that exogenous MT-I/-II uptake is associated with robust axon regeneration following optic nerve transection. The results suggest that transfer of MT-I/-II from astrocytes to neurons is an important component of the response of the CNS to injury. Metallothionein Protein—Because these studies have been performed in four different laboratories collaborating together, slightly different forms of MT protein have been used. The particular MT form that is used for each experiment has been specifically stated within the text and includes rabbit Zn-MT-IIA (Bestenbalt LLC), rabbit Zn-MT-II (Sigma catalog number M 9542), and a mixture of rabbit Zn-MT-I and Zn-MT-II (Sigma catalog number M 7641). There are small differences in the amino acid structure of these proteins, although all maintain the 20 conserved cysteine residues that characterize mammalian MTs. We have recently reported that MT proteins from a variety of sources, including mammalian and Drosophila MTs, appear to have a similar ability to promote wound healing following CNS injury (35Penkowa M. Tio L. Giralt M. Quintana A. Molinero A. Atrian S. Vasak M. Hidalgo J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 83: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), so we do not expect any issues in using the slightly different MT forms in this study. Focal Injury to the Adult Rat Neocortex, Collection of Gelfoam, and Western Blotting—Injuries were made to the Par 1 region of the adult rat neocortex as reported previously (12Chung R.S.

At the appropriate time, rats were re-anesthetized and transcardially perfused, and brains were then removed and post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. They were then sectioned at 50-μm thickness by vibratome (Leica VT1000E). In some experiments, absorbent gelfoam, which had been used to seal the burr hole in the skull during the initial surgery, was recovered at several time points post-injury (three animals per group). Gelfoam pieces were pooled for each time point, and soluble proteins were removed from the gelfoam by the addition of 100 μl of PBS, followed by vortexing. Samples were briefly centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 2 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -20° C for subsequent Western blotting. Western blotting was performed as described previously (36Chung R.S. Holloway A.F. Eckhardt B.L. Harris J.A. Vickers J.C. Chuah M.I. West A.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 323-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), under reducing conditions to minimize any potential oxidation of MT proteins. In subsequent Western blots, similar procedures were performed with the same samples, but either mouse anti-GFAP (1:500, Chemicon) or rabbit anti-ferritin (1:1000, ICN) primary antibodies were used. Primary Astrocyte Cultures, Culture Media Collection, and MT-I/-II Radioimmunoassay—Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared as described previously (37Vincent A.J. Taylor J.M. Choi-Lundberg D.L. West A.K. Chuah M.I. Glia. 2005; 51: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Astrocyte cultures were at least 98% pure (results not shown). Confluent astrocytes cultures were maintained in a total of 500 μl of culture medium and treated with either 10 units/ml IL-1α (Chemicon catalog number IL001), 10 μm ZnSO4, or 10 units/ml IL-1α + 10 μm ZnSO4 combined for the allotted time period, and media were collected, centrifuged at 13,000 × g (5 min), and stored at -20 °C. MT-I/-II was measured by radioimmunoassay as described previously (16Gasull T. Rebollo D.V. Romero B. Hidalgo J. J. Immunoassay. 1993; 14: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Primary Neuron Cell Cultures—Cortical neuron cultures were prepared as reported previously (12Chung R.S. Vickers J.C. Chuah M.I. West A.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3336-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in a culture medium consisting of Neurobasal™ medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% (final concentration) B-27 supplement, 0.1 mm (final concentration) l-glutamine, and 200 units/ml gentamicin. At the appropriate time, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and a permeabilizing immunocytochemistry method was used to visualize intracellular proteins, with most membrane-bound proteins lost using this protocol. This procedure was performed using an antibody diluent containing 0.03% Triton X detergent. For immunocytochemistry, mouse anti-MT (1:500; Dako), rabbit anti-megalin (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-Tau (1:5000; DAKO) antibodies were used. Secondary labeling was performed using appropriate AlexaFluor-488- or -594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from postnatal day 7 Wistar rats (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) as described previously by Schousboe et al. (38Schousboe A. Meier E. Drejer J. Hertz L. Shahar A. de Vellis J. Vernadakis A. Haber B A Dissection and Tissue Culture Manual of the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, Inc, New York1989: 203-206Google Scholar). For the cerebellar granule neuron neurite outgrowth assay, MT-I/-II was applied to neurons immediately after plating and fixed 24 h after treatment with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde for 20 min and immunostained using primary rabbit antibodies against GAP-43. Alexa-Fluor secondary goat anti-rabbit Ig antibodies were used to visualize the cells. In some experiments, MT-I/-II was immobilized onto coverslips by incubation on Permanox plasticware overnight and washed three times with PBS, and the neurons were then plated onto these coverslips, and neurite outgrowth was assessed 24 h later. For the analysis of neurite outgrowth, we have used a computer-assisted fluorescence microscopy technique described previously (32Rønn L.C. Ralets I. Hartz B.P. Bech M. Berezin A. Berezin V. Moller A. Bock E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 100: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In brief, digital images of at least 200 neurons for each group in each individual experiment were obtained systematically; a frame was superimposed on each image, and the number of intersections between neurites and test lines in a given frame was counted and divided by the number of neuron bodies, whereby a relationship between the number of neurite intersections and neurons is obtained. The neurite growth value of control cells was then considered 100%, and all the experimental groups are compared with it. Statistical evaluation was performed by the Studentŉs paired t test using Fig-P, 2.98 (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Studies—To confirm the interaction between MT and megalin, co-immuno-precipitation experiments were performed whereby an MT antibody was used to pull down MT and MT complexes, which were then probed for the presence of megalin by Western blotting. Briefly, 14-day in vitro cortical neurons plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/flask were treated with MT, and after 24 h the cells were lysed in 250 μl of ice-cold resuspension buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol). The cell lysate was collected into an Eppendorf tube, to which 250 μl of dilution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.75% Ipegal, 10% glycerol) was added. Lysates were pre-cleared by adding 50 μl of 50% protein-A-Sepharose slurry for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking on a rotational shaker to remove nonspecific proteins that potentially bind to the protein-A-Sepharose beads. The following steps were all performed in a 4 °C cold room. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the Sepharose beads, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube. The MT antibody (10 μl; Dako) was added to the lysate and incubated at 4 °C with shaking for 1 h. To this, 50 μl of 50% protein-A-Sepharose was added, and the lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with shaking. The sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube. The beads were washed three times with 200 μl of dilution buffer, centrifuging each time at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The final pellet was resuspended in 15 μl of Nu-PAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) and immediately used for Western blotting. Western blotting was performed as described previously (32Rønn L.C. Ralets I. Hartz B.P. Bech M. Berezin A. Berezin V. Moller A. Bock E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 100: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), using the Nu-PAGE system (Invitrogen) and 10-20% gradient gels. For all Western blots, the total protein content of samples was determined by the Bradford assay, and equal protein amounts were loaded for all samples. Membranes were probed with a rabbit anti-megalin antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:1000; Dako). AlexaFluor-594 Labeling of Rabbit MT-IIA—Rabbit MT-IIA was chemically conjugated to AlexaFluor-594 using an AlexaFluor probe labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Following the conjugation reaction, AlexaFluor-594 bound MT-IIA (MT-594) was separated from excess AlexaFluor-594 dye by standard gel chromatography over a G-75 column. Western blotting analysis confirmed the separation of the fluorescently tagged MT-IIA from excess dye. The excess fluorescent dye, which becomes nonreactive during this process, was used in later studies as an experimental control. Megalin siRNA Transfections into Neurons—In some experiments cortical neurons at a density of 1 × 106 cells were transfected with two pre-designed siRNA molecules targeting different regions of the rat megalin gene (Ambion catalog numbers 199330 and 199331). Transfections were performed by electroporation using a rat hippocampal neuron protocol and the Nucleofector™ (Amaxa) upon neurons at the end of the culturing process and immediately prior to plating out. 6 nm siRNA was used for each transfection. As a control, neurons underwent the entire transfection protocol but in the absence of siRNA. Western blotting 24 h later confirmed that transfection with either siRNA molecule greatly reduced expression of megalin (results not shown). Astrocyte Transfection Studies—The coding sequence for human MT-IIA was removed from a pre-existing bacterial expression vector (12Chung R.S. Vickers J.C. Chuah M.I. West A.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3336-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the pEGFP vector (BD Biosciences) such that the plasmid expresses an MT-IIA-GFP fusion protein. The pEGFP vector served as the control for all transfection studies. For transfection, a minimum of 1 × 106 astrocytes was transfected using the Amaxa Nucleofector™ and the Nucleofector™ rat astrocyte transfection kit (VPG-1006). In preliminary studies, transfection efficiencies were ∼30%, and immunocytochemistry confirmed co-localization of MT immunolabeling with MT-GFP (results not shown). Following transfection, the astrocytes were seeded into 14-day in vitro cortical neuron cultures (5 × 104 cells) at a seeding density of 1 × 104 cells and maintained for up to 7 days. At the appropriate time, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and immunocytochemistry was performed as discussed previously. For neuronal immunolabeling, a rabbit anti-Tau antibody (DAKO) was used at a concentration of 1:5000. For detection of MT-GFP and GFP in culture medium, samples were collected and concentrated ∼10-fold using Centricon-3 ultrafiltration columns (Millipore). Briefly, 500 μl of media was placed into each spin column and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 90 min. Concentrated samples were used for Western blotting studies, using the protocol described earlier. A monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (BD Biosciences) was used at a concentration of 1:4000, detected with a secondary goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (DAKO) used at a concentration of 1:1000. Complete Optic Nerve Transection Surgeries—Adult male Hooded Wistar rats were deeply anesthetized; the right optic nerve was exposed intraorbitally, and the nerve sheath was cut transversely except for the ventral aspect that was left intact to avoid damage to the ophthalmic blood vessels. The nerve parenchyma was lifted using hooked forceps and completely transected with iridectomy scissors ∼1 mm from the back of the eye. The cut ends of the nerve sheath were then sutured together (10-0 thread). The completeness of transection was confirmed by anterograde labeling. Animals with ischemic retinae (determined ophthalmoscopically) were euthanized. Rabbit MT-I/-II (Sigma) or control solutions (PBS or ZnSO4) were administered via a stereotactically positioned 30-gauge needle attached to a 10-μl Hamilton syringe. A final volume of 2.5 μl was administered via two injection sites (nasal and temporal). Eight animals received MT-I/-II injections, and eight received vehicle (saline). Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. For cell culture experiments, statistical evaluation was performed by the Studentŉs paired t test using either SigmaStat (Systat Software) or Fig-P version 2.98 (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). RGC counts and axon measurements were analyzed using analysis of variance (StatView, USA) and p values calculated using the Scheffe post hoc test. Detection of Extracellular MT-I/-II Released from Cultured Cortical Astrocytes—To test the hypothesis that astrocytes are capable of releasing MT-I/-II, primary cortical astrocytes were maintained in vitro, and the presence of MT-I/-II in the culture media was assessed using an MT-I/-II-specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) that is capable of detecting picogram amounts (16Gasull T. Rebollo D.V. Romero B. Hidalgo J. J. Immunoassay. 1993; 14: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Hidalgo J. Garcia A. Olivia A.M. Giralt M. Gasull T. Gonzalez B. Milnerowicz H. Wood A. Bremner I. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 93: 197-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In confluent astrocyte cultures, MT-I/-II was detected in the medium at a range of 15.6 ± 0.49 pg of MT/μg of total protein (average over 12 different experiments). In these cultures, intracellular MT-I/-II expression as observed by immunocytochemistry was low in most astrocytes. Astrocytes were then exposed to either zinc (ZnSO4, 10 μm) or interleukin-1 (recombinant human IL-1, 10 units/ml) or both. Co-treatment with zinc and interleukin-1 has been shown previously to lead to accumulation of MT-I/-II in a granular form near the cell membrane (18Kikuchi Y. Irie M. Kasahara T. Sawada J. Terao T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), feasibly suggesting MT-I/-II localization within secretory vesicles. When either zinc or IL-1 was added, there was no observable increase in extracellular MT-I/-II within the culture media over a 72-h period (Fig. 1A). However, the zinc and IL-1 co-treatment resulted in a statistically significant (p < 0.01; analysis of variance) increase in extracellular MT-I/-II within culture media, with levels increasing 2.5-fold by 72 h (Fig. 1A). The amount of extracellular MT-I/-II was calculated as a percentage of the total MT-I/-II protein in the cultures, and the levels increased from 6% in the control cultures to 13% 72 h after zinc and IL-1 co-treatment. No cell lysis was observed at any time point using lactate dehydrogenase assays (data not shown). To confirm these observations, astrocytes were cultured in flasks (1 × 106 cells/flask) and treated with either zinc or IL-1 alone, or zinc and IL-1 together (at the concentrations used above). After 72 h the culture medium was collected, concentrated using Millipore Ultrafiltration columns, and the presence of MT in culture medium detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Although there was a low level of MT detectable within the culture medium of untreated cells, this was mildly increased following treatment with zinc or IL-1. However, the dual zinc and IL-1 treatment induced much greater levels of MT secretion by astrocytes (Fig. 1B), in accordance with the RIA results above. Note that equal amounts of protein were loaded for each sample. In parallel experiments, from the same media samples we performed Western blots for albumin and noted no change in albumin levels within the culture medium (Fig. 1B). Detection of Extracellular MT-I/-II Following Focal Cortical Injury—To address the issue of whether MT-I/-II is found extracellularly following brain injury, we used a model of focal cortical injury to the adult rat brain as described previously (11Chung R.S. Adlard P.A. Dittmann J. Vickers J.C. Chuah M.I. West A.K. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Chung R.S. Vickers J.C. Chuah M.I. West A.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3336-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Absorbent gelfoam was placed over the pial surface above the lesion (Fig. 2A) at the time of injury and left in place for 1-14 days. Proteins were extracted from the gelfoam and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for MT-I/-II, GFAP, and ferritin (Fig. 2B). The latter two proteins were examined as a control for the presence of cells or cell debris (astrocytes and microglia, respectively) that may have invaded the gel foam. An adult rat brain homogenate was used as a positive control for all antisera. As shown in Fig. 2B, MT-I/-II was initially undetectable, but it could be clearly detected in the gelfoam extract at both 7 and 14 days post-injury. The absence of signature intracellular proteins from the two major classes of MT-expressing cells in the CNS, astrocytes and microglia, suggests that the MT-I/-II, which had accumulated in the gelfoam, was derived from an extracellular pool. The adult rat brain homogenate was positive for all three antigens, confirming that Western blotting was successful. Immobilized Extracellular MT-I/-II Is Not Neuritogenic—We have recently demonstrated that extracellular MT-I/-II can promote neurite outgrowth and axon regeneration, both in culture (12Chung R.S. Vickers J.C. Chuah M.I. West A.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3336-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kohler L.B. Berezin V. Bock E. Penkowa M.

Brain Res. 2007; 183: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and in vivo following an injury to the brain (12Chung R.S. Vickers J.C. Chuah M.I. West A.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3336-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or to a peripheral (sciatic) nerve (19Ceballos D. Lago N. Verdu E. Penkowa M. Carrasco J. Navarro X. Palmiter R.D. Hidalgo J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To investigate whether it is necessary for extracellular MT to be internalized to mediate neurite outgrowth of cultured neurons as we have reported previously (12Chung R.S. Vickers J.C. Chuah M.I. West A.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3336-3342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kohler L.B. Berezin V. Bock E. Penkowa M.

Brain Res. 2007; 183: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), rabbit MT-I/-II was bound to Permanox-coated slides. This technique allows the tethered protein to interact with the cell membrane of adhered cells but blocks intracellular import. Compared with the neuritogenic activity of untethered MT-I/II, immobilized MT-I/II was relatively inactive (Fig. 3). Addition of mobile MT-I/-II restored neurite outgrowth in the presence of immobilized MT-I/-II (Fig. 3). As an experimental control, a previously described peptide (P2d) was used (20Pedersen M.V. Kohler L.B. Ditlevsen D.K. Li S. Berezin V. Bock E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (39)"
https://openalex.org/W2142784426,"Background Learning to perform new movements is usually achieved by following visual demonstrations. Haptic guidance by a force feedback device is a recent and original technology which provides additional proprioceptive cues during visuo-motor learning tasks. The effects of two types of haptic guidances-control in position (HGP) or in force (HGF)–on visuo-manual tracking (“following”) of trajectories are still under debate. Methodology/Principals Findings Three training techniques of haptic guidance (HGP, HGF or control condition, NHG, without haptic guidance) were evaluated in two experiments. Movements produced by adults were assessed in terms of shapes (dynamic time warping) and kinematics criteria (number of velocity peaks and mean velocity) before and after the training sessions. Trajectories consisted of two Arabic and two Japanese-inspired letters in Experiment 1 and ellipses in Experiment 2. We observed that the use of HGF globally improves the fluency of the visuo-manual tracking of trajectories while no significant improvement was found for HGP or NHG. Conclusion/Significance These results show that the addition of haptic information, probably encoded in force coordinates, play a crucial role on the visuo-manual tracking of new trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W2086810771,"Background Mild cold exposure and overfeeding are known to elevate energy expenditure in mammals, including humans. This process is called adaptive thermogenesis. In small animals, adaptive thermogenesis is mainly caused by mitochondrial uncoupling in brown adipose tissue and regulated via the sympathetic nervous system. In humans, skeletal muscle is a candidate tissue, known to account for a large part of the epinephrine-induced increase in energy expenditure. However, mitochondrial uncoupling in skeletal muscle has not extensively been studied in relation to adaptive thermogenesis in humans. Therefore we hypothesized that cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis in humans is accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial uncoupling in skeletal muscle. Methodology/Principal Findings The metabolic response to mild cold exposure in 11 lean, male subjects was measured in a respiration chamber at baseline and mild cold exposure. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial uncoupling (state 4) was measured in muscle biopsies taken at the end of the respiration chamber stays. Mild cold exposure caused a significant increase in 24h energy expenditure of 2.8% (0.32 MJ/day, range of −0.21 to 1.66 MJ/day, p<0.05). The individual increases in energy expenditure correlated to state 4 respiration (p<0.02, R2 = 0.50). Conclusions/Significance This study for the first time shows that in humans, skeletal muscle has the intrinsic capacity for cold induced adaptive thermogenesis via mitochondrial uncoupling under physiological conditions. This opens possibilities for mitochondrial uncoupling as an alternative therapeutic target in the treatment of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2069488810,"Phenotypic heterogeneity in an isogenic, microbial population enables a subset of the population to persist under stress. In mycobacteria, stresses like nutrient and oxygen deprivation activate the stress response pathway involving the two-component system MprAB and the sigma factor, SigE. SigE in turn activates the expression of the stringent response regulator, rel. The enzyme polyphosphate kinase 1 (PPK1) regulates this pathway by synthesizing polyphosphate required for the activation of MprB. The precise manner in which only a subpopulation of bacterial cells develops persistence, remains unknown. Rel is required for mycobacterial persistence. Here we show that the distribution of rel expression levels in a growing population of mycobacteria is bimodal with two distinct peaks corresponding to low (L) and high (H) expression states, and further establish that a positive feedback loop involving the mprAB operon along with stochastic gene expression are responsible for the phenotypic heterogeneity. Combining single cell analysis by flow cytometry with theoretical modeling, we observe that during growth, noise-driven transitions take a subpopulation of cells from the L to the H state within a ""window of opportunity"" in time preceding the stationary phase. We find evidence of hysteresis in the expression of rel in response to changing concentrations of PPK1. Our results provide, for the first time, evidence that bistability and stochastic gene expression could be important for the development of ""heterogeneity with an advantage"" in mycobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2029650615,"Specification of the anterior-posterior axis in Drosophila oocytes requires proper communication between the germ-line cells and the somatically derived follicular epithelial cells. Multiple signaling pathways, including Notch, contribute to oocyte polarity formation by controlling the temporal and spatial pattern of follicle cell differentiation and proliferation. Here we show that the newly identified Hippo tumor-suppressor pathway plays a crucial role in the posterior follicle cells in the regulation of oocyte polarity. Disruption of the Hippo pathway, including major components Hippo, Salvador, and Warts, results in aberrant follicle-cell differentiation and proliferation and dramatic disruption of the oocyte anterior-posterior axis. These phenotypes are related to defective Notch signaling in follicle cells, because misexpression of a constitutively active form of Notch alleviates the oocyte polarity defects. We also find that follicle cells defective in Hippo signaling accumulate the Notch receptor and display defects in endocytosis markers. Our findings suggest that the interaction between Hippo and classic developmental pathways such as Notch is critical to spatial and temporal regulation of differentiation and proliferation and is essential for development of the body axes in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1970954417,"Abnormal prefrontal functioning plays a central role in the working memory (WM) deficits of schizophrenic patients, but the nature of the relationship between WM and prefrontal activation remains undetermined. Using two functional neuroimaging methods, we investigated the neural correlates of remembering and forgetting in schizophrenic and healthy participants. We focused on the brain activation during WM maintenance phase with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also examined oxygenated hemoglobin changes in relation to memory performance with the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) using the same spatial WM task. Distinct types of correct and error trials were segregated for analysis. fMRI data indicated that prefrontal activation was increased during WM maintenance on correct trials in both schizophrenic and healthy subjects. However, a significant difference was observed in the functional asymmetry of frontal activation pattern. Healthy subjects showed increased activation in the right frontal, temporal and cingulate regions. Schizophrenic patients showed greater activation compared with control subjects in left frontal, temporal and parietal regions as well as in right frontal regions. We also observed increased ‘false memory’ errors in schizophrenic patients, associated with increased prefrontal activation and resembling the activation pattern observed on the correct trials. NIRS data replicated the fMRI results. Thus, increased frontal activity was correlated with the accuracy of WM in both healthy control and schizophrenic participants. The major difference between the two groups concerned functional asymmetry; healthy subjects recruited right frontal regions during spatial WM maintenance whereas schizophrenic subjects recruited a wider network in both hemispheres to achieve the same level of memory performance. Increased “false memory” errors and accompanying bilateral prefrontal activation in schizophrenia suggest that the etiology of memory errors must be considered when comparing group performances. Finally, the concordance of fMRI and NIRS data supports NIRS as an alternative functional neuroimaging method for psychiatric research."
https://openalex.org/W2016093887,"A characteristic of Plasmodium falciparum infections is the gradual acquisition of clinical immunity resulting from repeated exposures to the parasite. While the molecular basis of protection against clinical malaria remains unresolved, its effects on epidemiological patterns are well recognized. Accumulating epidemiological data constitute a valuable resource that must be intensively explored and interpreted as to effectively inform control planning.Here we apply a mathematical model to clinical data from eight endemic regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The model provides a quantitative framework within which differences in age distribution of clinical disease are assessed in terms of the parameters underlying transmission. The shorter infectious periods estimated for clinical infections induce a regime of bistability of endemic and malaria-free states in regions of mesoendemic transmission. The two epidemiological states are separated by a threshold that provides a convenient measure for intervention design. Scenarios of eradication and resurgence are simulated.In regions that support mesoendemic transmission, intervention success depends critically on reducing prevalence below a threshold which separates endemic and malaria-free regimes."
https://openalex.org/W1978961215,"Osteopontin (SPP1) is an important bone matrix mediator found to have key roles in inflammation and immunity. SPP1 genetic polymorphisms and increased osteopontin protein levels have been reported to be associated with SLE in small patient collections. The present study evaluates association between SPP1 polymorphisms and SLE in a large cohort of 1141 unrelated SLE patients [707 European-American (EA) and 434 African-American (AA)], and 2009 unrelated controls (1309 EA and 700 AA). Population-based case-control association analyses were performed. To control for potential population stratification, admixture adjusted logistic regression, genomic control (GC), structured association (STRAT), and principal components analysis (PCA) were applied. Combined analysis of 2 ethnic groups, showed the minor allele of 2 SNPs (rs1126616T and rs9138C) significantly associated with higher risk of SLE in males (P = 0.0005, OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.28–2.33), but not in females. Indeed, significant gene-gender interactions in the 2 SNPs, rs1126772 and rs9138, were detected (P = 0.001 and P = 0.0006, respectively). Further, haplotype analysis identified rs1126616T-rs1126772A-rs9138C which demonstrated significant association with SLE in general (P = 0.02, OR = 1.30, 95%CI 1.08–1.57), especially in males (P = 0.0003, OR = 2.42, 95%CI 1.51–3.89). Subgroup analysis with single SNPs and haplotypes also identified a similar pattern of gender-specific association in AA and EA. GC, STRAT, and PCA results within each group showed consistent associations. Our data suggest SPP1 is associated with SLE, and this association is especially stronger in males. To our knowledge, this report serves as the first association of a specific autosomal gene with human male lupus."
https://openalex.org/W2006743236,"The cytosolic chaperone network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is intimately associated with the emergence and maintenance of prion traits. Recently, the Hsp110 protein, Sse1, has been identified as a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) for both cytosolic Hsp70 chaperone family members, Ssa1 and Ssb1. We have investigated the role of Sse1 in the de novo formation and propagation of [PSI+], the prion form of the translation termination factor, Sup35. As observed by others, we find that Sse1 is essential for efficient prion propagation. Our results suggest that the NEF activity is required for maintaining sufficient levels of substrate-free Ssa1. However, Sse1 exhibits an additional NEF-independent activity; it stimulates in vitro nucleation of Sup35NM, the prion domain of Sup35. We also observe that high levels of Sse1, but not of an unrelated NEF, very potently inhibit Hsp104-mediated curing of [PSI+]. Taken together, these results suggest a chaperone-like activity of Sse1 that assists in stabilization of early folding intermediates of the Sup35 prion conformation. This activity is not essential for prion formation under conditions of Sup35 overproduction, however, it may be relevant for spontaneous [PSI+] formation as well as for protection of the prion trait upon physiological Hsp104 induction."

The molecular mechanisms of trefoil factors, initiators of mucosal healing and being greatly involved in tumorigenesis, have remained elusive.A naturally existing 72-kDa complex of non-lens betagamma-crystallin (alpha-subunit) and trefoil factor (beta-subunit), named betagamma-CAT, was identified from frog Bombina maxima skin secretions. Its alpha-subunit and beta-subunit (containing three trefoil factor domains), with a non-covalently linked form of alphabeta(2), show significant sequence homology to ep37 proteins, a group of non-lens betagamma-crystallins identified in newt Cynops pyrrhogaster and mammalian trefoil factors, respectively. betagamma-CAT showed potent hemolytic activity on mammalian erythrocytes. The specific antiserum against each subunit was able to neutralize its hemolytic activity, indicating that the two subunits are functionally associated. betagamma-CAT formed membrane pores with a functional diameter about 2.0 nm, leading to K(+) efflux and colloid-osmotic hemolysis. High molecular weight SDS-stable oligomers (>240-kDa) were detected by antibodies against the alpha-subunit with Western blotting. Furthermore, betagamma-CAT showed multiple cellular effects on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Low dosages of betagamma-CAT (25-50 pM) were able to stimulate cell migration and wound healing. At high concentrations, it induced cell detachment (EC(50) 10 nM) and apoptosis. betagamma-CAT was rapidly endocytosed via intracellular vacuole formation. Under confocal microscope, some of the vacuoles were translocated to nucleus and partially fused with nuclear membrane. Bafilomycin A1 (a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar-type ATPase) and nocodazole (an agent of microtuble depolymerizing), while inhibited betagamma-CAT induced vacuole formation, significantly inhibited betagamma-CAT induced cell detachment, suggesting that betagamma-CAT endocytosis is important for its activities.These findings illustrate novel cellular functions of non-lens betagamma-cyrstallins and action mechanism via association with trefoil factors, serving as clues for investigating the possible occurrence of similar molecules and action mechanisms in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2050290821,"Elevated levels of circulating matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) have been demonstrated in patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this study was to analyse levels of MMP-9 in a population free from symptomatic CAD and investigate their associations with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, including C-reactive protein (CRP).A cross-sectional study was performed in a population based random sample aged 45-69 (n = 345, 50% women). MMP-9 levels were measured in EDTA-plasma using an ELISA-method. CV risk factors were measured using questionnaires and standard laboratory methods.Plasma MMP-9 was detectable in all participants, mean 38.9 ng/mL (SD 22.1 ng/mL). Among individuals without reported symptomatic CAD a positive association (p<0.001) was seen, for both men and women, of MMP-9 levels regarding total risk load of eight CV risk factors i.e. blood pressure, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake. The association was significant also after adjustment for CRP, and was not driven by a single risk factor alone. In regression models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, alcohol intake and CRP, elevated MMP-9 levels were independently positively associated with systolic blood pressure (p = 0.037), smoking (p<0.001), alcohol intake (p = 0.003) and CRP (p<0.001). The correlation coefficient between MMP-9 and CRP was r = 0.24 (p<0.001).In a population without reported symptomatic CAD, MMP-9 levels were associated with total CV risk load as well as with single risk factors. This was found also after adjustment for CRP."
https://openalex.org/W2051197187,"The cellular and molecular mechanisms of tumor progression following chemotherapy are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that cisplatin (CDDP) treatment upregulates VEGF and Flt1 expression leading to the survival and expansion of a highly tumorigenic fraction of side-population (SP) cells in osteosarcoma (HOS), neuroblastoma (SK-N-BE2) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RH-4) cell lines. In all three lines, we show that CDDP treatment increases levels of VEGF and Flt1 expression, and induces enhanced clonogenic capacity and increased expression of the ‘stemness’-associated genes Nanog, Bmi-1 and Oct-4 in the SP fraction. In HOS, these changes are associated with the transformation of a non-tumorigenic osteosarcoma SP fraction to a highly tumorigenic phenotype. Inhibition of Flt1 led to complete reduction of tumorigenicity in the HOS SP fraction, and reduction of clonogenic capacity and expression of stemness genes in the SK-N-BE(2) and RH-4 SP fractions. Treatment with U0126, a specific inhibitor of MAPK/ERK1,2 completely downregulates CDDP-induced VEGF and Flt1 expression and induction/expansion of SP fraction in all three cell lines, indicating that these effects are mediated through MAPK/ERK1,2 signaling. In conclusion, we report a novel mechanism of CDDP-induced tumor progression, whereby the activation of VEGF/Flt1 autocrine signaling leads to the survival and expansion of a highly tumorigenic SP fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1990553356,"When caterpillars feed on maize (Zea maize L.) lines with native resistance to several Lepidopteran pests, a defensive cysteine protease, Mir1-CP, rapidly accumulates at the wound site. Mir1-CP has been shown to inhibit caterpillar growth in vivo by attacking and permeabilizing the insect's peritrophic matrix (PM), a structure that surrounds the food bolus, assists in digestion and protects the midgut from microbes and toxins. PM permeabilization weakens the caterpillar defenses by facilitating the movement of other insecticidal proteins in the diet to the midgut microvilli and thereby enhancing their toxicity. To directly determine the toxicity of Mir1-CP, the purified recombinant enzyme was directly tested against four economically significant Lepidopteran pests in bioassays. Mir1-CP LC50 values were 1.8, 3.6, 0.6, and 8.0 ppm for corn earworm, tobacco budworm, fall armyworm and southwestern corn borer, respectively. These values were the same order of magnitude as those determined for the Bacillus thuringiensis toxin Bt-CryIIA. In addition to being directly toxic to the larvae, 60 ppb Mir1-CP synergized sublethal concentrations of Bt-CryIIA in all four species. Permeabilization of the PM by Mir1-CP probably provides ready access to Bt-binding sites on the midgut microvilli and increases its activity. Consequently, Mir1-CP could be used for controlling caterpillar pests in maize using non-transgenic approaches and potentially could be used in other crops either singly or in combination with Bt-toxins."
https://openalex.org/W1983318535,"Childhood fevers due to malaria remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality among under-five children in Nigeria. The degree of vulnerability perceived by mothers will affect their perception of the severity and threat of their child's fever and the patterns of health care use. This study was undertaken to compare maternal responses to childhood fever in urban and rural areas of Enugu, south east Nigeria.Data was collected with pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaires from 276 and 124 urban and rural households respectively. In each household, only one woman aged 15-49 years who had lived in each of the urban and rural communities for at least one year and had at least one child less than 5 years old was interviewed. Malaria was mentioned as the commonest cause of childhood fevers. Rural mothers were more likely to recognize danger signs and symptoms than urban mothers. Rural mothers use more of informal than formal health services, and there is more home management of the fever with urban than rural mothers. Chloroquine, ACT, SP and Paracetamol are the main drugs given at home for childhood fevers, but the rural mothers were more likely to use leftover drugs from previous treatment to treat the fevers than urban mothers. The urban respondents were also more likely to use a preventive measure. Urban mothers sought actions faster than rural mothers and the total cost of treatment was also higher in urban areas.Both urban and rural mothers are aware that malaria is the major cause of childhood fevers. Although rural mothers recognize childhood fever and danger signs better than urban mothers, the urban mothers' responses to fever seem to be better than that for rural mothers. These responses and differences may be important for geographical targeting by policy makers for malaria interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2076213872,"Human embryonic stem cells (HESC) readily differentiate into an apparently haphazard array of cell types, corresponding to all three germ layers, when their culture conditions are altered, for example by growth in suspension as aggregates known as embryoid bodies (EBs). However, this diversity of differentiation means that the efficiency of producing any one particular cell type is inevitably low. Although pancreatic differentiation has been reported from HESC, practicable applications for the use of beta-cells derived from HESC to treat diabetes will only be possible once techniques are developed to promote efficient differentiation along the pancreatic lineages.Here, we have tested whether the transcription factor, Pax4 can be used to drive the differentiation of HESC to a beta-cell fate in vitro. We constitutively over-expressed Pax4 in HESCs by stable transfection, and used Q-PCR analysis, immunocytochemistry, ELISA, Ca(2+) microfluorimetry and cell imaging to assess the role of Pax4 in the differentiation and intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis of beta-cells developing in embryoid bodies produced from such HESC. Cells expressing key beta-cell markers were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting after staining for high zinc content using the vital dye, Newport Green.Constitutive expression of Pax4 in HESC substantially enhances their propensity to form putative beta-cells. Our findings provide a novel foundation to study the mechanism of pancreatic beta-cells differentiation during early human development and to help evaluate strategies for the generation of purified beta-cells for future clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W1964737066,"The assembly of core histones onto eukaryotic DNA is modulated by several histone chaperone complexes, including Asf1, CAF-1, and HIRA. Asf1 is a unique histone chaperone that participates in both the replication-dependent and replication-independent pathways. Here we report the crystal structures of the apo-form of fission yeast Asf1/Cia1 (SpAsf1N; residues 1-161) as well as its complexes with the B-domain of the fission yeast HIRA orthologue Hip1 (Hip1B) and the C-terminal region of the Cac2 subunit of CAF-1 (Cac2C). The mode of the fission yeast Asf1N-Hip1B recognition is similar to that of the human Asf1-HIRA recognition, suggesting that Asf1N recognition of Hip1B/HIRA is conserved from yeast to mammals. Interestingly, Hip1B and Cac2C show remarkably similar interaction modes with Asf1. The binding between Asf1N and Hip1B was almost completely abolished by the D37A and L60A/V62A mutations in Asf1N, indicating the critical role of salt bridge and van der Waals contacts in the complex formation.

Eukaryotic genomic DNA forms hierarchical nucleoprotein complex structures in the nucleus. The nucleosome core particle is the basal repeating unit of the complex, which is composed of ∼147 bp of DNA wrapped around a core histone particle, comprising a tetramer of H3 and H4 and two dimers of H2A and H2B (1Luger K.

The precise and regular arraying of nucleosomes is supposed to be a key determinant for the formation of upper hierarchical structures, such as the 30-nm fibers and chromatin fibers. The assembly of the nucleosome is regulated by several groups of chromatin-associated factors involving histone chaperones, chromatin remodeling factors, and histone modification enzymes, which are tightly linked to the regulation of DNA metabolism (2Kornberg R.D.

Importantly, two human family members of Asf1 (ASF1A and ASF1B) are involved in both the major S-phase histone H3.1- and histone variant H3.3 complexes, whereas the Asf1-interactive histone chaperones CAF-1 and HIRA are detected only in the histone H3.1 and H3.3 complexes, respectively (28Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Consistently, Asf1 facilitates both DNA replication-dependent and -independent histone depositions cooperatively with the CAF-1 and HIR complexes, respectively (5Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R.

Recently, the complex structure of human Asf1 with the B-domain of HIRA was reported (30Tang Y. Poustovoitov M.V. Zhao K. Garfinker M. Canutescu A. Dunbrack R. Adams P.D. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, biochemical studies suggested that human Cac2, the second largest subunit of CAF-1, interacts with Asf1 at the HIRA-binding region of Asf1 through its B-domain-like motif at the C terminus (30Tang Y. Poustovoitov M.V. Zhao K. Garfinker M. Canutescu A. Dunbrack R. Adams P.D. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Hence, human Asf1 is thought to interact mutually exclusively with the histone chaperones HIRA and CAF-1. However, structural evidence for the interaction between Asf1 and CAF-1 has yet to be obtained. In addition, it is not clear how Asf1 recognizes HIRA and CAF-1 for histone assembly in yeast. In this study, we report the crystal structures of the apo-form of fission yeast Asf1/Cia1 (SpAsf1N; residues 1-161) and its complexes with the B-domain of the fission yeast HIRA orthologue Hip1 (Hip1B) and the C-terminal region of fission yeast Cac2 (Cac2C) (Fig. 1A). Cac2C shows remarkably similar modes of interaction toward Asf1 as compared with those of Hip1B and HIRA. Based on structural and biochemical analyses of the three histone chaperones, we discuss a mutually exclusive binding model of Asf1 to CAF-1 and Hip1/HIRA. Peptides—All peptides used in co-crystallization and for in vitro binding experiments were purchased from Invitrogen. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The structural domain of Asf1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SpAsf1N; residues 1-161) was subcloned into the pET15b vector (Novagen) such that the construct consisted of an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site upstream of the expressed protein. For the GST fusion proteins used in the in vitro binding experiments, the SpAsf1N structural domain sequence was subcloned into the pGEX-2T vector (GE Healthcare). Point mutants of Asf1 were generated by subjecting the pGEX-2T-SpAsf1N constructs to mutagenesis using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). The following mutagenic oligomers were used (forward primers are shown with mutation codons in bold-face, 5′ to 3′): D37A-forward, GTCTGGAGCCGTTAAAAAGCGCCCTGGAATGGAAGTTGACA; E39A-forward, CCGTTAAAAAGCGACCTGGCATGGAAGTTGACATATG; D58A-forward, AAGTTACGACCAAATTTTGGCCACGCTACTAGTGGGACCTA; L60A/V62A-forward, ACGACCAAATTTTGGACACGGCACTAGCGGGACCTATACCAATCGGG; E75A-forward, GGATTAATAAATTCGTTTTTGCAGCTGATCCTCCTAATATCG; D77A-forward, AATTCGTTTTTGAAGCTGCTCCTCCTAATATCGATCTT; V95A-forward, GATGTTTTGGGTGTCACAGCTATTTTACTCTCTTGTGC; D104A-forward, CTCTCTTGTGCATATGAGGCTAATGAGTTTGTTCGAGTAGG. All of the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—pET15-SpAsf1N was transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli (Novagen). The cells were grown to late log phase at 37 °C and were then induced overnight with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, plus a complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). The supernatant fraction was loaded onto a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare), which was washed with the lysis buffer and then eluted with a linear imidazole gradient using 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.5 m imidazole as the elution buffer. The fractions of interest were pooled and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol as the buffer. The N-terminal hexahistidine tag was cleaved by overnight digestion with thrombin (Sigma), and the free tag and the uncleaved proteins were removed by a second passage through the HisTrap HP column. Finally, another round of purification on the Superdex 75 16/60 column was performed. For GST-SpAsf1N expression, the constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3), grown to late log phase at 37 °C and then induced overnight with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C. The fusion proteins were each bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns (GE Healthcare), which were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Further purification was performed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 10/30 column (GE Healthcare). Preparation of the SpAsf1N-Hip1B Peptide Complex and Its Crystallization—The expression, purification, and crystallization of the functional domain of SpAsf1-N (residues 1-161) were reported recently (31Umehara T.

The Asf1-Hip1B complex was formed by mixing 1 μg of freshly purified SpAsf1N with a 5-fold molar excess of the S. pombe Hip1 B-domain peptide (residues 469-497; IPTKFVQKVTITKEGKKRVAPQLLTTLSA) and incubating the mixture for 1 h at room temperature. The complex was then purified as a single peak by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 resin. The purified complex was successfully crystallized in a 96-well plate by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method under 25% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 170 mm NH4F at a concentration of 4 mg/ml protein at 20 °C. The crystals were cryoprotected by briefly soaking them in the mother liquor solution containing 10% glycerol prior to flash-cooling in a cold stream of nitrogen gas. Preparation of the SpAsf1N-Cac2C Peptide Complex and Its Crystallization—The Asf1-Cac2C complex was formed by mixing purified SpAsf1N, at a 4 mg/ml final concentration, with a 5-fold molar excess of the S. pombe Cac2 homolog SPAC26H5.03 C-terminal sequence (residues 493-512; RKVESSKVSKKRIAPTPVYP) and incubating the mixture for 1 h at room temperature. Crystals of the complex were obtained by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in 24-well plates in 1.8 m Na+/K+-PO4-2, pH 8.0, at 20 °C. The crystals were cryoprotected by carefully dragging them through a drop of paratone-N oil prior to flash-cooling in a cold stream of nitrogen gas. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data were collected at the beamline BL26B1 (SPring-8, Hyogo, Japan) for the native SpAsf1N and on the RAXIS IV++ in-house facilities for the two complexes (Hip1B and Cac2C). All of the data were collected under cryogenic conditions. The data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 package (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M.

Open table in a new tab Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Assay—Steady-state binding analyses between GST-SpAsf1N and the Hip1B or Cac2C peptides were carried out using a Biacore-3000 apparatus. Experiments were performed at 25 °C, using a CM5 sensor chip and HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20). The GST-Asf1N proteins were captured at final densities of 14,000 to 16,000 resonance units. The peptides in the HBS-EP buffer were passed over the GST-SpAsf1N surfaces at a rate of 20 μl min-1. The concentrations of the wild-type peptides were 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 nm, and those of the mutant peptides were 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 nm. A saturated response value at each concentration of the peptide was used as the equilibrium response value, and the steady-state data were fit to a simple 1:1 interaction model to obtain the dissociation constants. Sequence Comparison of Hip1 and Cac2—The Asf1 protein associates with HIRA through the Asf1 binding domain of HIRA (namely, the B-domain) (38Nelson D.M. Ye X. Hall C. Santos H. Ma T. Kao G.D.

The HIRA homolog from S. pombe, Hip1/HIRL, is a 932-residue protein containing eight WD40 repeat domains. The putative Hip1 B-domain lies in the region between WD40 repeats 6 and 7, within residues 450-500. A sequence alignment of the B-domains from a diverse array of organisms shows a high degree of conservation (Fig. 1B). The “consensus sequence” consists of a conserved glycine (Gly-483) at position -3 followed immediately by three positively charged residues, with a conserved arginine (Arg-486) at position 0, and a proline residue (Pro-489) occupying position +3. The Cac2/p60 subunit of the CAF-1 complex similarly binds to Asf1 (12Tyler J.K. Collins K.A. Prasad-Sinha J. Amiott E. Bulger M. Harte P.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell.

A sequence alignment of the Cac2/p60 C-terminal residues from various organisms is shown in Fig. 1C. The alignment reveals that the C-terminal region of p60 exhibits significant similarity to the B-domain of HIRA (Fig. 1D). An arginine (Arg-504) at position 0 is the only strictly conserved residue in the aligned sequences; this is preceded by another basic residue at position -1 and is followed by hydrophobic residues at positions +1, +3, and +6. In vertebrate sequences, a pair of overlapping Asf1-binding sites is predicted to lie at the Cac2/p60 C termini (30Tang Y. Poustovoitov M.V. Zhao K. Garfinker M. Canutescu A. Dunbrack R. Adams P.D. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, the putative Cac2/p60 orthologue corresponds to SPAC26H5.03, a WD40 repeat protein that shares 34% sequence identity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae p60 along its entire length. Interestingly, in S. pombe there is greater similarity between the Hip1 B-domain and the C-terminal region of the putative Cac2 protein than in most of the other organisms examined, with the Lys-Lys-Arg (484-486) residues at positions -2 to 0 and the Ala-Pro (488-489) residues at positions +2 to +3 being conserved (Fig. 1D). The Native SpAsf1N Structure—For the structure determination, we expressed and purified the highly conserved, N-terminal structural domain of S. pombe Asf1/Cia1 (SpAsf1N; residues 1-161), which corresponds to the functionally active globular domain of S. cerevisiae Asf1. The native spAsf1 protein was crystallized in the C2 space group, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement, using the ScAsf1/Cia1 structure (40Padmanabhan B. Kataoka K. Umehara T. Adachi N. Yokoyama S. Horikoshi M. J. Biochem.

Briefly, the core of the spAsf1 structure consists of 10 β-strands forming an elongated β-sandwich of two anti-parallel sheets packed against each other (Fig. 2). The topology falls into the “switched” immunoglobulin class of proteins. The “front” face is composed of the strands β4, β5, β7, β8, and β10, and the “back” face is formed by the strands β1, β3, and β6. The front face forms a highly hydrophobic concave surface. In contrast to the well conserved β-strands, the three loop/helical regions connecting the β-strands (loops β4-β5, β6-β7, and β8-β9) are less conserved. These loops are positioned above the hydrophobic surface and exhibit a greater degree of flexibility (see below). Structure of the SpAsf1N-Hip1B Complex—As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the SpAsf1N protein was co-purified with the Hip1 B-domain peptide (Hip1B; residues 469-497), yielding a crystal in the P21 space group containing two complexes per asymmetric unit (Table 1). The electron density for the peptide was clearly visible in the regions corresponding to residues 474-494 of one molecule (chain E in the Protein Data Bank code 2Z34) and residues 475-496 of the other molecule (chain F).

https://openalex.org/W2089993659,"Genotoxic stress activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases (PIKKs) that phosphorylate proteins involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis. Previous work showed that the PIKK ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) but not ATM and Rad3 related phosphorylates p53 (Ser15) during hyperoxia, a model of prolonged oxidative stress and DNA damage. Here, we show hSMG-1 is responsible for the rapid and early phosphorylation of p53 (Ser15) and that ATM helps maintain phosphorylation after 24 h. Despite reduced p53 phosphorylation and abundance in cells depleted of hSMG-1 or ATM, levels of the p53 target p21 were still elevated and the G(1) checkpoint remained intact. Conditional overexpression of p21 in p53-deficient cells revealed that hyperoxia also stimulates wortmannin-sensitive degradation of p21. siRNA depletion of hSMG-1 or ATM restored p21 stability and the G(1) checkpoint during hyperoxia. These findings establish hSMG-1 as a proximal regulator of DNA damage signaling and reveal that the G(1) checkpoint is tightly regulated during prolonged oxidative stress by both PIKK-dependent synthesis and proteolysis of p21."

Additionally, we wished to identify NRTI-related mutations in HIV-1 RT C-terminal domains. We sequenced 118 RNase H domains from clinical viral isolates in Brazil, and analyzed 510 thumb and connection domain and 450 RNase H domain sequences collected from public HIV sequence databases, together with their treatment status and histories. Drug-naïve and NRTI-treated datasets were compared for intra- and inter-group conservation, and differences were determined using Fisher's exact tests. One third of RT C-terminal residues were found to be conserved among group M variants. Three mutations were found exclusively in NRTI-treated isolates. Nine mutations in the connection and 6 mutations in the RNase H were associated with NRTI treatment in subtype B. Some of them lay in or close to amino acid residues which contact nucleic acid or near the RNase H active site. Several of the residues pointed out herein have been recently associated to NRTI exposure or increase drug resistance to NRTI.This is the first comprehensive genotypic analysis of a large sequence dataset that describes NRTI-related mutations in HIV-1 RT C-terminal domains in vivo. The findings into the conservation of RT C-terminal domains may pave the way to more rational drug design initiatives targeting those regions."
https://openalex.org/W2007108360,"The identification and development of novel nontoxic phytochemicals that target androgen and androgen receptor (AR) signaling remains a priority for prostate cancer (PCA) control. In the present study, we assessed the antiandrogenic efficacy of isosilybin B employing human PCA LNCaP (mutated AR), 22Rv1 (mutated AR) and LAPC4 (wild-type AR) cells. Isosilybin B (10-90 microM) treatment decreased the AR and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in LNCaP, 22Rv1 and LAPC4 cells, but not in non-neoplastic human prostate epithelial PWR-1E cells. Isosilybin B treatment also inhibited synthetic androgen R1881-induced nuclear localization of AR, PSA expression and cell growth, and caused G(1) arrest. In mechanistic studies identifying AR degradation, isosilybin B caused increased phosphorylation of Akt (Ser-473 and Thr-308) and Mdm2 (Ser-166), which was linked with AR degradation as pretreatment with PI3K inhibitor (LY294002)-restored AR level. Further, overexpression of kinase-dead Akt largely reversed isosilybin B mediated-AR degradation suggesting a critical role of Akt in AR degradation. Antibody pull-down results also indicated that isosilybin B treatment enhances the formation of complex between Akt, Mdm2 and AR, which promotes phosphorylation-dependent AR ubiquitination and its degradation by proteasome. Together, present findings identify a novel mechanism for isosilybin B-mediated anticancer effects in human PCA cells."

Both gain-of-function and RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous ING2 reveal that ING2 couples TGF-β signals to the induction of transcription and cell cycle arrest. We also find that the Smad-interacting transcriptional modulator SnoN interacts with ING2 and promotes the assembly of a protein complex containing SnoN, ING2, and Smad2. Knockdown of endogenous SnoN blocks the ability of ING2 to promote TGF-β-dependent transcription, and conversely expression of SnoN augments ING2 enhancement of the TGF-β response.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). This involves the phosphorylation of the receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) proteins. The phosphorylated R-Smad then forms a complex with the copartner Smad4 and accumulates in the nucleus. In the nucleus, the R-Smad-Smad4 complex binds to Smad-binding elements (SBEs) on promoters of TGF-β-responsive genes and regulates target gene expression in collaboration with specific transcriptional coregulators and associated histone acetyltransferases or histone deacetylases (21Massague J.

SnoN interacts with the R-Smads and co-Smad4 on promoters of TGF-β-responsive genes (24Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Luo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9431-9441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). SnoN exerts a biphasic effect on TGF-β-dependent transcription. At low “physiological” concentrations SnoN acts as a coactivator, and at higher amounts SnoN represses TGF-β-dependent transcription (25Sarker K.P. Wilson S.M. Bonni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13037-13046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). SnoN recruitment of a histone deacetylase complex to TGF-β promoters may account for SnoN repression of TGF-β-dependent transcription (26Liu X. Sun Y. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Luo K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which SnoN activates TGF-β-dependent transcription and responses including cell cycle arrest have remained unknown.In this study, we show that the ING family member ING2 mediates the ability of TGF-β to activate transcription and inhibit cell proliferation. We find that SnoN associates with ING2 to promote the assembly of a protein complex containing ING2, SnoN, and R-Smad2. We also find that SnoN is required for ING2 up-regulation of TGF-β-dependent transcription. Collectively, our data suggest that SnoN collaborates with ING2 to mediate TGF-β-induced Smad2-dependent responses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—pC1 expression vectors encoding human ING1a, 1b, and 2 proteins were generated as described elsewhere (28Kataoka H. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Feng X. Hara Y. Miura Y. Joh T. Nakabayashi H. Vaziri H. Harris C.C. Riabowol K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5785-5792PubMed Google Scholar). Using pCI-ING2 as a template, ING2 was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pCMV5B/FLAG and pCMV5B/Myc mammalian expression vectors to express N-terminal FLAG and Myc epitope-tagged ING2 proteins, respectively. The pCAGIP/FLAG/ING2 vector was generated by subcloning the FLAG/ING2 cDNA insert into a digested pCAGIP/FLAG/FoxH1 vector using convenient endonuclease restriction sites (29von Both I. Silvestri C.

The pCAGIP/FLAG/ING2 plasmid allows the coexpression of FLAG-tagged ING2 and the puromycin resistance marker proteins from an internal ribosomal entry site-containing bicistronic transcript. pCMV5B-based constructs expressing Myc-tagged ΔN, ΔC, and ΔPHD deletion mutant ING2 proteins lacking amino acid residues 1-63, 199-281, and 199-258, respectively, were generated using a PCR-based approach to produce ING2 cDNA missing the corresponding nucleotides.

All of the constructs were verified by restriction digests and/or DNA sequencing analysis (University of Calgary Core Sequencing Facility).Cell Lines and Transfections—The mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) and human hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines were cultured in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The human kidney epithelial (293T) cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with high glucose and l-glutamine, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The HepG2 and Mv1Lu cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 293T cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method. To generate stable Mv1Lu cell lines expressing a puromycin-resistant marker alone or together with FLAG/ING2, cells were transfected with the pCAGIP-based vectors using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by selection of stable transfectants using 0.45 μg/ml puromycin (Invitrogen) in the growth medium.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates prepared in TNTE buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C as described previously (25Sarker K.P. Wilson S.M. Bonni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13037-13046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Specific protein expression in the cleared lysate was analyzed by Western blotting of the total cell lysate. In protein-protein interaction experiments, 90% of the supernatant was also subjected to immunoprecipitation using mouse anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), mouse anti-Smad2 (BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-SnoN (H317; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-ING2 (Southern Alberta Cancer Research Institute Antibody Facility), or rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) antibodies as described previously (35Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The protein composition of total cell lysate and immunoprecipitation samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using mouse anti-Myc (9E10, Covance), mouse anti-FLAG, rabbit anti-SnoN, mouse anti-Smad2, rabbit ING2, mouse anti-HA (Covance), or rabbit anti-Actin (Sigma) as primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) as the secondary antibodies as described before (25Sarker K.P. Wilson S.M. Bonni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13037-13046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ECL (Amersham Biosciences)-generated signals were visualized and quantified using a VersaDoc 5000 Imager together with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).Luciferase Reporter Assays—HepG2 and Mv1Lu cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 1.5 × 105 cells/well and in 24-well plates at 2.5 × 104 cells/well, respectively. One day later cells were cotransfected with the 3TP, SBE4, or pG5-E1b firefly luciferase reporter construct, the pR-TK Renilla luciferase or CMV-β-galactosidase internal control reporter vector, together with a control expression vector or one encoding the TGF-β type I receptor protein (a wild type (WT) version or a constitutively active form in which threonine 204 is converted to aspartate), an ING protein (ING1a, ING1b, wild type, or deletion mutant versions of ING2), SnoN protein, Gal4 (DNA-binding domain, amino acids 1-147) protein, Gal4-Smad2 fusion protein, ING2 RNAi, or SnoN RNAi as outlined in the figure legends. In experiments where activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway was induced by coexpression of TβRI (T204D), the cells were kept in 10% fetal bovine serum until cell lysis. Otherwise, the cells were incubated 1 day post-transfection in 0.2% fetal bovine serum-containing medium in the presence or absence of 100 pm TGF-β (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 16-18 h at 37 °C. Two days post-transfection, the cells were lysed and subjected to dual or regular luciferase activity assays as described previously (25Sarker K.P. Wilson S.M. Bonni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13037-13046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Kataoka H. Bonnefin P. Vieyra D. Feng X. Hara Y. Miura Y. Joh T. Nakabayashi H. Vaziri H. Harris C.C. Riabowol K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5785-5792PubMed Google Scholar). Arbitrary firefly luciferase activity, expressed in relative light units, was normalized to Renilla luciferase or β-galactosidase activity, as indicated in the figure legends, to control for variations in transfection efficiency. Each experimental condition was carried out in triplicate, and the data are presented as the means (±S.D.). The experiments were repeated on independent batches of cells at least two times.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Mv1Lu cells were lysed using TRIzol lysis reagent (Invitrogen), followed by total RNA extraction and concentration using chloroform and isopropanol/ethanol, respectively. Poly(A)-cDNA was generated by subjecting the mink RNA to reverse transcription using the reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)12-18 (Amersham Biosciences) as the primer. Mink plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), ING2, and GAPDH cDNA fragments were PCR-amplified using the mink poly(A)-cDNA as template and gene-specific PAI-1 (sense, 5′-GCCTGGCCCTTGTCTTTGGTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGAAGTAGAGGGCATTCACCAGC-3′), ING2 (sense, 5′-AGCGGAGCCGGCTGCTCACC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCCTGCTTGGCCTTGGAGCG-3′), and GAPDH (sense, 5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′) oligonucleotides as primers. PCR products of approximately 490, 530, and 300 bp were generated for PAI-1, ING2, and GAPDH, respectively. The PCR products were resolved using 1.2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The amplified products were visualized using the Versadoc 5000 Imager and quantified using Quantity one software (Bio-Rad). For each sample the density of PAI-1 or ING2 was normalized to the GAPDH value.Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Assay—Transfected or nontransfected Mv1Lu cells plated in 96-well dishes and preincubated for 3 h in 0.2% serum-containing medium were treated for 18-20 h with or without TGF-β at the concentrations specified in Fig. 4. BrdUrd incorporation and detection were carried out using a BrdUrd assay kit I (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, during the last hour in culture, the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 10 mm BrdUrd-containing medium. The cells were fixed at -20 °C using a glycine-ethanol based solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then incubated with a mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody alone or together with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h followed by several washes with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then switched to a solution containing Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) together with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Roche Applied Science) or cy5-anti-mouse and cy2-anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Laboratories). A minimum of 200 cells/well were scanned, and the data were generated using the Kinetic Scan Reader (Cellomics, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). The data were analyzed using the accompanying Target Activation Bio-Application software (36Gasparri F. Mariani M. Sola F. Galvani A. J. Biomol. Screen. 2004; 9: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Each experimental condition was carried out in three to five replicates. Each experiment was repeated at least three independent times. The number of Hoechst-positive cells that were BrdUrd- and/or GFP-positive was determined. The number of BrdUrd-positive cells expressed as a percentage of GFP- or Hoechst-labeled cells scanned per well was then reported by the Bio-Application software. The average percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells of the replicates was calculated and used to determine other parameters as described in legend of Fig. 5. The data presented in Fig. 5 represent the means (±S.E.) of the parameters obtained from three to four independent experiments.FIGURE 5ING2 contributes to TGF-β inhibition of cell proliferation.

B, cells that were untransfected (-), stably expressing the puromycin resistance marker alone (control), or together with a FLAG-tagged ING2 (ING2) were left untreated (-TGF-β) or incubated for 18 h with 62.5 pm TGF-β (+TGF-β). The cells were incubated with BrdUrd-containing medium for 1 h and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence and Hoechst nuclear staining (see “Experimental Procedures”). BrdUrd- and Hoechst-positive cells were imaged and analyzed as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The data presented in the bar graph represent the means (±S.E.) of the average of the percent BrdUrd-positive cells from four independent experiments. The asterisk indicates statistically significant difference from the TGF-β-treated untransfected and the resistance marker controls as determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test (p ≤ 0.025). C, control or ING2 expressing stable cells were incubated with increasing TGF-β concentrations for 18 h followed by BrdUrd labeling. For each of the control or ING2 expressing cells, the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells at each TGF-β concentration was expressed relative to that in the absence of TGF-β. The means (±S.E.) of the average values from three independent experiments are plotted on the y axis versus the TGF-β concentration (fM) on the x axis. D, knockdown of endogenous ING2 reduces TGF-β-dependent suppression of cell proliferation. Mv1Lu cells transiently transfected with the control or ING2 RNAi vector were incubated in the absence or presence of 25 pm TGF-β followed by BrdUrd incorporation. BrdUrd and GFP immunolabeling, detection, and analysis were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For each transfection group, the percentage of decrease in BrdUrd-positive cells by TGF-β treatment was determined by expressing the difference in the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells in absence and presence of TGF-β relative to the BrdUrd-positive cells in the absence of TGF-β. The data presented in the bar graph represent the means (±S.E.) of the percentage of decrease in BrdUrd-positive cells by TGF-β from four independent experiments.

The TGF-β family of growth factors has pleiotropic roles that are critical in normal development and homeostasis (15Roberts, A. B., and Sporn, M. B. (1990) in Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors (Sporn, M. B., and Roberts, A. B., eds) pp. 419-472, Springer-Verlag, HeidelbergGoogle Scholar, 16Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2993) Google Scholar). The Smad signal transducers play a major role in transmitting the TGF-β signal from the cell surface to the nucleus where the Smad proteins regulate gene expression (21Massague J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). A major focus of research in TGF-β signaling is the elucidation of the nuclear mechanisms by which the Smads mediate TGF-β-dependent gene expression and consequent responses. Both the TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway and the ING transcriptional proteins inhibit cell proliferation and exert tumor-suppressive effects, suggesting the hypothesis that the ING proteins might play a role in TGF-β-dependent responses (10Russell M. Berardi P. Gong W. Riabowol K. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Feng X. Hara Y. Riabowol K.

Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). To test this idea, we first asked whether these proteins modulate TGF-β-induced transcription. We determined the effect of expression of different members of the ING family of proteins on TGF-β induction of a reporter gene that contains TGF-β-responsive promoter elements from the PAI-1 gene driving luciferase enzyme expression (33Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the TGF-β pathway was stimulated by coexpressing a constitutively activated form of the TGF-β type I serine/threonine kinase receptor (TβRI) in which threonine 204 is converted to aspartate (Fig. 1A and Ref. 37Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ING2 robustly increased TβRI-induced reporter gene expression (Fig. 1A). The effect of ING2 and TβRI on reporter gene expression was synergistic (Fig. 1B). In contrast to ING2, the ING family members ING1a and ING1b, which are the ING family members most closely related to ING2, had less effect on the TβRI-induced response (Fig. 1A). Thus, among the ING proteins, ING2 may be more efficient in inducing TGF-β-dependent transcription. We also found that ING2 increased the ability of the activated type I receptor to induce the SBE4-luciferase reporter gene, which has four tandem repeats of SBEs driving the expression of the luciferase construct (Fig. 1C and Ref. 34Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). ING2 also promoted the expression of the reporter gene driven by the PAI-1 promoter in HepG2 and the Mv1Lu lung epithelial cell lines upon exposure to the TGF-β ligand (data not shown and Fig. 1D). In other experiments, we found that ING2 expression significantly augmented the ability of TGF-β to induce endogenous PAI-1 gene expression in Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 2), further supporting the idea that ING2 positively controls TGF-β-induced transcription. Collectively, these data indicate that ING2 may function to up-regulate TGF-β-dependent transcription and suggest that ING2 may act via Smad family proteins to mediate the TGF-β response.FIGURE 1ING2 enhances TGF-β-dependent transcription.

https://openalex.org/W1991970955,"Background Bronchiolitis caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants less than two years old is a growing public health concern worldwide, and there is currently no safe and effective vaccine. A major component of RSV nucleocapsid, the nucleoprotein (N), has been so far poorly explored as a potential vaccine antigen, even though it is a target of protective anti-viral T cell responses and is remarkably conserved between human RSV A and B serotypes. We recently reported a method to produce recombinant N assembling in homogenous rings composed of 10–11 N subunits enclosing a bacterial RNA. These nanoparticles were named sub-nucleocapsid ring structure (N SRS). Methodology and Principal Findings The vaccine potential of N SRS was evaluated in a well-characterized and widely acknowledged mouse model of RSV infection. BALB/c adult mice were immunized intranasally with N SRS adjuvanted with the detoxified E. coli enterotoxin LT(R192G). Upon RSV challenge, vaccinated mice were largely protected against virus replication in the lungs, with a mild inflammatory lymphocytic and neutrophilic reaction in their airways. Mucosal immunization with N SRS elicited strong local and systemic immunity characterized by high titers of IgG1, IgG2a and IgA anti-N antibodies, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells. Conclusions/Significance This is the first report of using nanoparticles formed by the recombinant nucleocapsid protein as an efficient and safe intra-nasal vaccine against RSV."

In common with all Ntn-hydrolases, they are expressed as inactive precursors that undergo activation in an autocatalytic manner. The maturation process involves intramolecular hydrolysis of a single peptide bond, leading to the formation of two subunits (α and β) folded as one structural domain, with the nucleophilic Thr residue located at the freed N terminus of subunit β. The mechanism of the autocleavage reaction remains obscure. We have determined the crystal structure of an active site mutant of EcAIII, with the catalytic Thr residue substituted by Ala (T179A). The modification has led to a correctly folded but unprocessed molecule, revealing the geometry and molecular environment of the scissile peptide bond.

The autocatalytic reaction is analyzed from the point of view of the Thr179 side chain rotation, identification of a potential general base residue, and the architecture of the oxyanion hole. Posttranslational modifications of proteins can be divided into reactions leading to covalent attachment, usually at a side chain, of a specific chemical group, such as phosphate or carbohydrate, and into reactions that lead to cleavage or cleavage/rearrangement of the polypeptide backbone. The latter processes can be enzyme-catalyzed or occur without an additional biocatalyst. An important class of backbone rearrangement is connected with autocatalytic processes in maturating proteins. Notable examples in this category include intein splicing and simple backbone cleavage. Protein splicing requires cleavage of two peptide bonds that surround the so-called intein, followed by ligation of the flanking polypeptides, the N- and C-exteins. The process consists of four steps: acyl rearrangement, transesterification, cyclization of an asparagine residue, and a second acyl rearrangement (1Evans T.C. Xu M.-Q. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4869-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In maturation following the autocleavage pathway, only a single peptide cleavage occurs, and the mechanism includes only acylation and water-dependent deacylation. Although the mechanism of protein splicing has been extensively studied and seems to be well understood, the autoproteolysis reactions are rather obscure. The known examples of autoproteolytic proteins include a large group of N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) 2The abbreviations used are: Ntn, N-terminal nucleophile; hT179A, hexagonal form of EcAIII T179A mutant; oT179A, orthorhombic form of EcAIII T179A mutant. -hydrolases (2Brannigan J.A.

Sequence similarity within the Ntn-hydrolase family is very limited, but despite the variation of primary structure, the proteins share a common sandwich-like αββα fold created by two β-sheets surrounded by two layers of α-helices (13Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2329-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The autocatalyzed maturation of Ntn-hydrolases involves either the removal of a propeptide (14Seemüller E. Lupas A. Baumeister W. Nature. 1996; 382: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) or the generation of two subunits that are then utilized for the formation of the active enzyme. The autocatalytic apparatus of maturating proteins can be described by analogy to classic serine proteases. Their reactive machinery usually consists of a catalytic triad formed by a nucleophilic residue (Ser), a general base (His), and an additional acidic residue (Asp). The nucleophile carrying out the acylation step is activated by the general base that abstracts the proton from the serine OH group. The role of the acidic residue is to properly position the basic residue and enhance its basicity (15Dodson G. Wlodawer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 347-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Various deviations from the canonical triad have been noted, including enzymes that utilize only a dyad or even a single-residue active site. Protein splicing and autoproteolytic maturation of Ntn-hydrolases have a common first step, consisting in an N→ O (or N→ S) acyl shift with the formation of a tetrahedral (thio)ester intermediate (1Evans T.C. Xu M.-Q. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4869-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This intermediate exists as a five-membered oxyoxazolidine or oxythiazolidine ring. The rearrangement requires a nucleophilic attack of a hydroxyl (or thiol) group on the peptide carbonyl C atom. There are several controversial points about this process, the main one concerning the nucleophilic activation of the attacking group. In the case of splicing proteins, it has been proposed that a conserved His residue participates in the deprotonation of the -O(S)H nucleophile, but in the available crystal structures no suitable interaction has been found. However, a hydrogen bond between a His side chain and the scissile bond N atom was observed (16Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In consequence, it has been proposed that the His residue facilitates the breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate by protonating the N atom. In inteins that utilize a Cys residue as the nucleophile, the thiol group does not require assistance of other groups (17Noren C.J. Wang J. Perler F.B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 450-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that it is the stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate by an oxyanion hole that drives the reaction. An additional factor is the unusual geometry of the scissile peptide bond, which is either cis (16Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or distorted trans (18Poland B.W. Xu M.Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similar problems plague the interpretation of the mechanism of Ntn-hydrolase maturation. One of the difficulties is the lack of a consensus sequence motif flanking the autocleavage point. Data obtained for the most studied Ntn-hydrolases, namely aspartylglucosaminidases, seemed to indicate that either a His (19Guan C. Liu Y. Shao Y. Cui T. Liao W. Ewel A. Whitaker R. Paulus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9695-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or an Asp residue N-terminal to the scissile bond is responsible for the activation of the nucleophilic threonine (20Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Qian X. Guan C. Guo H.C. Structure. 2003; 11: 997-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the His-Asp-Thr sequence is not conserved among other Ntn-hydrolases. Our studies are focused on another group of the Ntn family, namely on plant-type l-asparaginases, which hydrolyze the side-chain amide bond of asparagine or of isoaspartyl dipeptides (9Borek D. Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Kisiel A. Podkowinski J. Bonthron D.T. Krowarsch D. Otlewski J. Jaskolski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3215-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Close homologs have been found not only in plants but also in bacteria, with the Escherichia coli protein, EcAIII (E. coli iaaA (ybiK) gene product), being particularly well studied (10Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Jaskolski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28484-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Borek D. Jaskolski M. Acta Crystallgr. Sect.

D. 2004; 60: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Enzymes from both sources have a catalytic Thr nucleophile located at the free N terminus of subunit β, liberated during the autoproteolytic maturation event that generates two separate subunits (α and β) from a single-chain precursor (10Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Jaskolski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28484-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Michalska K. Bujacz G. Jaskolski M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is believed that the maturation mechanism involves the very same Thr nucleophile that is liberated in its consequence. However, the details of the maturation reaction are obscure, since the free α-amino group, supposed to activate the nucleophilic hydroxyl, is not present in the immature protein. A plausible candidate for the general base in the maturation of plant-type asparaginases has not been proposed so far; nor has the oxyanion hole been defined, which is necessary for the stabilization of the oxyoxazolidine intermediate. To investigate the structural basis of EcAIII maturation, we have generated and crystallized an active site mutant with the catalytic Thr residue substituted by alanine (T179A). The structure of this EcaIII variant has been determined in two crystal forms, hexagonal (hT179A) and orthorhombic (oT179A). The latter one (Protein Data Bank code 2ZAK) has been reported earlier (24Michalska K. Borek D. Hernández-Santoyo A. Jaskolski M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2008; 64: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in the context of EcAIII polymorphism. The analysis in this paper is mainly based on the hexagonal form and on comparison of the two structures. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The plasmid carrying the mutated gene of EcAIII was constructed using a pET-11d vector (Novagene) containing the wild type gene sequence (25Borek D. Jaskolski M. Acta Biochim. Polon. 2001; 48: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as a template. The plasmid DNA was PCR-amplified using the following primers: 5′-AATGGGCGCCGTGGGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCCCACGGCGCCCATT-3′. The codon change ACC→ GCC (underlined) introduced the T179A mutation in the protein sequence. The recombinant plasmid was sequenced to confirm the correctness of the inserted sequence and subsequently transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagene). 30 ml of LB medium with 100 μg·ml-1 ampicillin were inoculated with 20 μl of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells containing the recombinant plasmid and grown overnight at 37 °C. The culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium with appropriate antibiotics and grown for 4 h, when the expression of the recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The bacteria were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and then centrifuged at 6000 rpm, 4 °C, for 25 min and resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5. After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 9000 rpm, 4 °C, for 25 min, to remove cell debris. All purification steps were carried out at room temperature. The supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate formed at 35-65% saturation, containing the recombinant protein, was collected, resuspended in water, and dialyzed against water and subsequently against 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5. The solution was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5. The column was washed with the same buffer, and then a 0-1 m linear NaCl gradient in the same buffer was applied. The fractions containing T179A EcAIII were collected and rechromatographed under the same conditions but in a 0-0.3 m NaCl gradient. Fractions with EcAIII were collected, concentrated using a YM-10 membrane Amicon 8010 system (Millipore), and loaded onto a Sephadex G75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5, and 0.2 m NaCl. The pure protein was pooled, concentrated, and kept frozen at -80 °C until use. The expression product migrates in SDS-PAGE as a single band with a molecular mass of 33 kDa, corresponding to intact precursor molecule. Crystallization—Crystallization was carried out by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. Drops (4 μl) contained a 1:1 volume ratio of protein at a 7 mg/ml concentration in a solution composed of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5, and 0.1 m NaCl and a range of precipitants from Hampton Crystal Screen II (Hampton Research). The hexagonal crystals of T179A EcAIII appeared within 1 day in drops containing 4.3 m NaCl and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. They were used for diffraction experiments without further optimization. Crystallization of the orthorhombic form has been described elsewhere (24Michalska K. Borek D. Hernández-Santoyo A. Jaskolski M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2008; 64: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The reservoir solution contained 0.2 m MgCl2, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. Data Collection and Processing—The diffraction experiment for the hexagonal crystals was performed using the X12 European Molecular Biology Laboratory beamline of the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron and a MarResearch CCD225 detector. The crystals did not require additional cryoprotection and were directly flash-cooled in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. The images were indexed and integrated using Mosflm (26Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and merged using Scala (27Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar) in the 6/mmm Laue symmetry. Since the 00l reflections were missing in the data set, the space group was determined at the molecular replacement stage.

Due to space group ambiguity, all possibilities in the 622 class were tested.

Structure Analysis and Visualization Software—Geometric analysis of the T179A structure was carried out using the Molprobity server (32Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall III, W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W375-W383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3048) Google Scholar). Superpositions of the molecular Cα traces were calculated in Lsqkab (33Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2378) Google Scholar). Figures were prepared using Dino or PyMol (both available on the World Wide Web). Expression and Purification—The T179A mutant of plant-type asparaginase from E. coli has been expressed and purified to homogeneity. The expression was carried out in an E. coli strain that constitutively produces small amounts of unmutated EcAIII. However, from a visual inspection of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels after purification, there was no indication of the presence of the native protein, which should appear as two bands corresponding to the two autoproteolytic products with molecular masses of 19 and 14 kDa. The single 33 kDa band corresponds to the intact T179A precursor protein, which does not undergo autoprocessing, and not to the wild-type EcAIII, since at the end of the purification procedure, the latter protein exists only in the activated form (9Borek D. Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Kisiel A. Podkowinski J. Bonthron D.T. Krowarsch D. Otlewski J. Jaskolski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3215-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The maturation can theoretically take place either in cis or in trans mode. In the cis mechanism, the reaction occurs within one precursor molecule, whereas a trans reaction would involve two molecules, one acting as the catalyst and the other as a substrate. Since in the applied expression system there should be at least catalytic amounts of wild-type EcAIII, our failure to detect cleaved EcAIII suggests that the autoprocessing reaction occurs in the cis mode. In addition, this result confirms that the EcAIII precursor with Thr179 replaced by alanine is incapable of autoprocessing. Structure Solution—The hT179A structure was solved by molecular replacement using the Protein Data Bank 1K2X model of mature EcAIII as the molecular probe. The asymmetric unit of the P6122 cell contains two intact polypeptides with T179A EcAIII sequence, organized into an AB homodimer, structurally corresponding to the (αβ)2 dimer of heterodimers typical for the mature EcAIII structure. In the crystallographic model built in electron density maps, molecule A comprises residues Gly2-Glu159 and Gly168-Lys314, whereas molecule B comprises residues Gly2-Ala161 and Gly168-Glu313. Residues 2-178 correspond to subunit α, and residues 179-321 correspond to subunit β of the mature enzyme. The missing residues (Gln160-Ser167 and Gly315-Gln321 from chain A, Thr162-Ser167 and Lys314-Gln321 from chain B) do not have well defined electron density, indicating high mobility or disorder of these segments of the molecule, which are located at the C-terminal portions of the α and β subunit sequences. Overall Structure of the T179A EcAIII Mutant—The overall fold of this EcAIII precursor is essentially identical to that of the mature enzyme. The protein core is established by two β-sheets facing each other in a parallel manner (Fig. 2a). The smaller β-sheet comprises four antiparallel strands (S4β, S5β, S6β, and S7β2), 3The topology of the protein is described as in mature EcAIII (10Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Jaskolski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28484-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (i.e. a Greek letter following the symbol (S for strand, H for helix); the consecutive number of a secondary structure element indicates its location in the α or β portion of the sequence. whereas the bigger one contains nine strands (S9β, S8β, S1α, (S5α, only in hT179A; see below), S1β, S2β, S2α, S3α, and S4α), which, except for the last interaction, are organized in an antiparallel fashion. This β-sheet is extended by an additional β-strand (S3β′) belonging to the second molecule. The envelope of the protein core is formed by two layers of helices. The layer flanking the bigger β-sheet is made of seven helices (H1α, H2α, H3α, H4α, H5α, H6α, and H7α), two of which have the 310 classification (H1α and H6α), whereas the smaller β-sheet is covered by four α-helices (H1β, H2β, H3β, and H4β). This overall fold, usually described as the αββα sandwich, is found in all Ntn-hydrolases. The Linker Region—The fragment of the polypeptide chain that acts as a linker (residues Ala161-Gly178) between the subunits was not visible in the structures of mature EcAIII, either due to disorder or because of C-terminal degradation occurring during the purification procedure (9Borek D. Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Kisiel A. Podkowinski J. Bonthron D.T. Krowarsch D. Otlewski J. Jaskolski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3215-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The highest degree of completeness of subunit α in the mature protein (up to Ala161) was observed in the 2ZAL structure. In all other structures, the visible C-terminal chain of subunit α is several residues shorter. The covalent anchoring of this fragment in the present mutant protein has stabilized its conformation, making it possible to model as many as 11 residues upstream of the 178-179 cleavage point. Nevertheless, a small portion of the linker region, about seven residues long, is still not visible in the electron density. In the orthorhombic structure, the disordered fragment is even longer, 14 residues (for chain A). This result indicates that there is intrinsic flexibility in the linker region, regardless of the maturation stage of the protein. The fragments of the linker region that have well defined electron density mostly do not adopt any regular secondary structure, with the exception of residues Leu171-Asp172, which have a β-strand conformation, establishing the S5α element involved in antiparallel β-sheet interactions with the C terminus of strand S1α. Comparison with Other EcAIII Structures—Superposition of the hexagonal T179A EcAIII mutant structure on the mature EcAIII model deposited in the Protein Data Bank as 1K2X reveals only minor changes in the overall conformation of the protein. The most pronounced differences are found at H1α, H2α, and the region directly preceding these helices, namely the C-terminal fragment of S1α and the S1α/H1α loop (Fig. 2b). In particular, according to DSSP secondary structure assignment (34Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12409) Google Scholar), the β-strand S1α in the precursor is slightly longer than in mature EcAIII. This extension is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the two-residue S5α element that is not present in the mature molecule. The 310 helix H1α and the N terminus of H2α are in the mutant structure shifted toward solvent. Additional small changes are observed in the positions of helices H6α and H7α. When the hexagonal and orthorhombic models of the mutant protein are compared, the only visible discrepancies are located in the same areas as in the comparison with 1K2X (Fig. 2b). Additionally, in the oT179A form, the intersubunit linker is fully disordered, mimicking the situation in all mature EcAIII structures. The only exception is the presence of the Gly178 residue, which together with Ala179 defines the scissile peptide bond. Interestingly, the lack of the S5α strand in oT179A influences the length of S1α as well, which without the stabilization within the S1α-S5αβ-sheet contains the same number of residues as in the mature protein. The root mean square deviations (Å) between equivalent Cα atoms in pairwise comparisons show the same level of similarity for the hT179A/oT179A (0.66) and hT179A/1K2X (0.65) pairs, whereas for the oT179A/1K2X pair (0.49), the superposition is slightly better. Such a result indicates that the mutation itself and the intact polypeptide chain that is its consequence are not responsible for the observed conformational changes. The root mean square deviation values also show that the hexagonal form of T179A EcAIII is slightly different from other EcAIII molecules, probably due to different crystal packing interactions. Analysis of superpositions of the separate α and β portions in mature and precursor EcAIII indicates that there is no subunit reorientation upon maturation. Inogranic Ions—The high concentration of NaCl used for crystallization resulted in a number of inorganic ions bound to the protein molecule (Fig. 2a). The identity of sodium ions with complete octahedral coordination was confirmed by the bondvalence method (35Müller P. Kopke S. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2003; 59: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, except for one ion, the distribution of the Na+ cations follows the molecular NCS dyad. The binding of the Cl- ions is less regular; only 12 of 17 obey the symmetry of the protein dimer. In a manner identical to that observed in all mature EcAIII enzymes, one of the sodium cations occupies the cavity within a loop formed by residues Leu60-Ile70, where it is coordinated by six main-chain carbonyl groups. Previously, we suggested that this Na+ cation is essential for proper conformation of the Leu60-Ile70 loop, which in turn supports the required orientation of the catalytic Thr179 residue for the enzymatic reaction (10Michalska K.

However, to date the mechanisms underlying PIK3CA regulation and activation in vivo is still unclear. During tumorigenesis, host-tumor interactions may play a critical role in editing the tumor. Here, we report a novel mechanism through which the tumor microenvironment activates the PIK3CA oncogene. We show that PIK3CA upregulation occurs in non-proliferating tumor regions in vivo. We identified and characterized the PIK3CA 5′ upstream transcriptional regulatory region and confirmed that PIK3CA is transcriptionally regulated through NF-κB pathway. These results offer a new mechanism through which the tumor microenvironment directly activates oncogenic pathways in tumor cells."

Because these results suggest an effect of mutant SOD1 on mitochondrial function, we assessed the enzymatic activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in the spinal cords of CCS/G93A SOD1 and control mice. CCS/G93A SOD1 mouse spinal cord demonstrates a 55% loss of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) activity compared with spinal cord from age-matched non-transgenic or G93A SOD1 mice. In contrast, CCS/G93A SOD1 spinal cord shows no reduction in the activities of complex I, II, or III. Blue native gel analysis further demonstrates a marked reduction in the levels of complex IV but not of complex I, II, III, or V in spinal cords of CCS/G93A SOD1 mice compared with non-transgenic, G93A SOD1, or CCS/WT SOD1 controls. With SDS-PAGE analysis, spinal cords from CCS/G93A SOD1 mice showed significant decreases in the levels of two structural subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, COX1 and COX5b, relative to controls. In contrast, CCS/G93A SOD1 mouse spinal cord showed no reduction in levels of selected subunits from complexes I, II, III, or V. Heme A analyses of spinal cord further support the existence of cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in CCS/G93A SOD1 mice. Collectively, these results establish that CCS/G93A SOD1 mice manifest an isolated complex IV deficiency which may underlie a substantial part of mutant SOD1-induced mitochondrial cytopathy."

We wondered whether insulin-operated signaling pathways modulate mitochondrial respiration via NO, to alternatively release complete glucose oxidation to CO(2) and H(2)O or to drive glucose storage to glycogen.We illustrate here that NO produced by translocated nNOS (mtNOS) is the insulin-signaling molecule that controls mitochondrial oxygen utilization. We evoke a hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic non-invasive clamp by subcutaneously injecting adult male rats with long-lasting human insulin glargine that remains stable in plasma by several hours. At a precise concentration, insulin increased phospho-Akt2 that translocates to mitochondria and determines in situ phosphorylation and substantial cooperative mtNOS activation (+4-8 fold, P<.05), high NO, and a lowering of mitochondrial oxygen uptake and resting metabolic rate (-25 to -60%, P<.05). Comparing in vivo insulin metabolic effects on gastrocnemius muscles by direct electroporation of siRNA nNOS or empty vector in the two legs of the same animal, confirmed that in the silenced muscles disrupted mtNOS allows higher oxygen uptake and complete (U-(14)C)-glucose utilization respect to normal mtNOS in the vector-treated ones (respectively 37+/-3 vs 10+/-1 micromolO(2)/h.g tissue and 13+/-1 vs 7.2+/-1 micromol (3)H(2)O/h.g tissue, P<.05), which reciprocally restricted glycogen-synthesis by a half.These evidences show that after energy replenishment, insulin depresses mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle via NO which permits substrates to be deposited as macromolecules; at discrete hyperinsulinemia, persistent mtNOS activation could contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction with insulin resistance and obesity and therefore, to the progression of the metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2033457158,"Although diseases associated with microvascular endothelial dysfunction are among the most prevalent illnesses to date, currently no method exists to isolate pure endothelial cells (EC) from skeletal muscle for in vivo or in vitro study.By utilizing multicolor fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS), we have isolated a distinct population of Sca-1(+), CD31(+), CD34(dim) and CD45(- )cells from skeletal muscles of C57BL6 mice. Characterization of this population revealed these cells are functional EC that can be expanded several times in culture without losing their phenotype or capabilities to uptake acetylated low-density lipoprotein (ac-LDL), produce nitric oxide (NO) and form vascular tubes. When transplanted subcutaneously or intramuscularly into the tibialis anterior muscle, EC formed microvessels and integrated with existing vasculature.This method, which is highly reproducible, can be used to study the biology and role of EC in diseases such as peripheral vascular disease. In addition this method allows us to isolate large quantities of skeletal muscle derived EC with potential for therapeutic angiogenic applications."
https://openalex.org/W1966880102,"Integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation is critical for platelet physiology and is controlled by signal transduction through kinases and phosphatases. Compared with kinases, a role for phosphatases in platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) signaling is less understood. We report that the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac) associates constitutively with the integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) in resting platelets and in human embryonal kidney 293 cells expressing alpha(IIb)beta(3). The membrane proximal KVGFFKR sequence within the cytoplasmic domain of integrin alpha(IIb) is sufficient to support a direct interaction with PP2Ac. Fibrinogen binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3) during platelet adhesion decreased integrin-associated PP2A activity and increased the phosphorylation of a PP2A substrate, vasodilator associated phosphoprotein. Overexpression of PP2Ac(alpha) in 293 cells decreased alpha(IIb)beta(3)-mediated adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen. Conversely, small interference RNA mediated knockdown of endogenous PP2Ac(alpha) expression in 293 cells, enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 activation, and accelerated alpha(IIb)beta(3) adhesion to fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Inhibition of ERK1/2, but not p38 activation, abolished the increased adhesiveness of PP2Ac (alpha)-depleted 293 cells to fibrinogen. Furthermore, knockdown of PP2A(calpha) expression in bone marrow-derived murine megakaryocytes increased soluble fibrinogen binding induced by protease-activated receptor 4-activating peptide. These studies demonstrate that PP2Ac (alpha) can negatively regulate integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) signaling by suppressing the ERK1/2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2009492692,"MDM2 is a key ubiquitin E3 ligase for p53 and its activity is critically regulated by a set of modulators, including ARF, p300, YY1 and recently by gankyrin, an oncoprotein frequently overexpressed in human heptocellular carcinomas. We have previously shown that MDM2 binds to and promotes retinoblastoma protein (Rb) degradation. Here we show that Rb inhibits MDM2 E3 ligase activity resulting in stabilization of p53. In addition, we demonstrated that Rb inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination in a gankyrin-dependent manner and the Rb-gankyrin interaction is critical for Rb-induced p53 stabilization. Furthermore, acute ablation of Rb facilitates gankyrin-mediated p53 destabilization, and desensitizes cancer cells for chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that Rb antagonizes gankyrin to inhibit MDM2-mediate p53 ubiquitination in cancer cells and suggest that the status of both p53 and Rb is important for efficacy of cancer chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2039257189,"Current theories on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia suggest altered brain plasticity such as decreased neural proliferation and migration, delayed myelination, and abnormal synaptic modeling, in the brain of subjects with schizophrenia. Though functional alterations in BDNF, which plays important role in neuroplasticity, are implicated in many abnormalities found in schizophrenia, the regulatory mechanism(s) involved in the abnormal signaling of BDNF in schizophrenia is not clear. The present study investigated whether Sprouty2, a regulator of growth factor signaling, is abnormally expressed in schizophrenia, and is associated with the changes in BDNF mRNA in this disorder. The potential effect of antipsychotic drugs on Sprouty2 expression was tested in adult rats.Sprouty2 and BDNF gene expression were analyzed in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from the Stanley Array Collection. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of RNA in 100 individuals (35 with schizophrenia, 31 with bipolar disorder, and 34 psychiatrically normal controls) showed significantly decreased expression of Sprouty2 and BDNF in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Moreover, a significant correlation between these two genes existed in control, schizophrenia and bipolar subjects. Long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs, haloperidol and olanzapine, showed differential effects on both Sprouty2 and BDNF mRNA and protein levels in the frontal cortex of rats.These findings demonstrating decreased expression of Sprouty2 associated with changes in BDNF, suggest the possibility that these decreases are secondary to treatment rather than to factors that are significant in the disease process of either schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder. Further exploration of Sprouty2-related signal transduction pathways may be helpful to design novel treatment strategies for these disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2146320426,"The commitment step to the aspartate pathway of amino acid biosynthesis is the phosphorylation of aspartic acid catalyzed by aspartokinase (AK). Most microorganisms and plants have multiple forms of this enzyme, and many of these isofunctional enzymes are subject to feedback regulation by the end products of the pathway. However, the archeal species Methanococcus jannaschii has only a single, monofunctional form of AK. The substrate l-aspartate binds to this recombinant enzyme in two different orientations, providing the first structural evidence supporting the relaxed regiospecificity previously observed with several alternative substrates of Escherichia coli AK (Angeles, T. S., Hunsley, J. R., and Viola, R. E. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 799–805). Binding of the nucleotide substrate triggers significant domain movements that result in a more compact quaternary structure. In contrast, the highly cooperative binding of the allosteric regulator l-threonine to multiple sites on this dimer of dimers leads to an open enzyme structure. A comparison of these structures supports a mechanism for allosteric regulation in which the domain movements induced by threonine binding causes displacement of the substrates from the enzyme, resulting in a relaxed, inactive conformation.

The aspartate biosynthetic pathway is responsible for the production of the amino acids lysine, threonine, methionine, and isoleucine in plants and microbes (1Viola R.E. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, several metabolic intermediates in this pathway play key roles in methylation reactions (2Roberts C.J. Selker E.U.

The absence of this pathway in humans makes it a good target for new pesticides and antibiotics. This pathway is exquisitely regulated to control the total output as well as the relative levels of each amino acid. Regulation is also needed to maintain levels of these essential nonprotein amino acid metabolites during periods of low protein synthesis. This pathway is subject to coordinated regulation by the end product amino acids, both by feedback inhibition and by repression at the genetic level (7Cohen, G. N. (1983) in Amino Acids: Biosynthesis and Genetic Regulation (Herrmann, K. M., and Somerville, R. L., eds) pp. 147-171, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MAGoogle Scholar). Depending on the organism, there are two basic control mechanisms at the protein level that regulate the commitment to the aspartate pathway: multivalent control of a single aspartokinase (AK) 2The abbreviations used are: AK, aspartokinase; AKI-HDHI, the threonine-sensitive bifunctional aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; mjAK, aspartokinase from M. jannaschii; TLS, translation-libation-screw. 2The abbreviations used are: AK, aspartokinase; AKI-HDHI, the threonine-sensitive bifunctional aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; mjAK, aspartokinase from M. jannaschii; TLS, translation-libation-screw. or individual control of multiple aspartokinases. These regulatory schemes allow the end products to modulate the flux through the initial commitment step in the pathway, with additional allosteric enzymes at each branch point providing further control over the final product levels. The recently determined structures of the lysine-sensitive monofunctional aspartokinases from Arabidopsis and Escherichia coli have provided some insights into the mechanism of allosteric regulation by lysine (8Mas-Droux C. Curien G. Robert-Genthon M. Laurencin M. Ferrer J.L. Dumas R. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1681-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Kotaka M. Ren J. Lockyer M. Hawkins A.R. Stammers D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31544-31552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysine binding induces a transition from a dimeric R-state to the tetrameric T-state, resulting in a rearrangement of the catalytic domain that blocks the ATP binding site. The bifunctional threonine-sensitive E. coli AKI-HDHI has been extensively characterized by equilibrium gel permeation (10Vickers L.P. Ackers G.K. Ogilvie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2155-2160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ultrafiltration (11Bearer C.F. Neet K.E. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3512-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and equilibrium dialysis and fluorescence binding studies (12Heck H.D. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which support the hypothesis that this cooperative tetramer also undergoes large conformational changes upon threonine binding. However, the detailed structure of this isoform has not been determined, and attempts to crystallize various complexes of this enzyme have not yet yielded diffraction quality crystals (13Janin J. FEBS Lett. 1974; 45: 318-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). 3C. R. Faehnle, X. Liu, and R. E. Viola, unpublished results. 3C. R. Faehnle, X. Liu, and R. E. Viola, unpublished results. The genome of the archael organism Methanococcus jannaschii contains only a single structural gene that encodes an aspartokinase (14Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. Fitzgerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.-F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M. Glodek A. Scott J.L.

Based on the monofunctional nature of this AK, the gene was designated as lysC, corresponding to the gene encoding the monofunctional AK found in E. coli that is feedback-inhibited by the end product amino acid l-lysine. However, recent studies of this enzyme have shown that, unlike the monofunctional E. coli AK, mjAK is not inhibited by l-lysine but is instead subject to allosteric inhibition by l-threonine (15Faehnle C.R. Liu X. Pavlovsky A. Viola R.E. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2006; 62: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Genomic analysis shows that M. jannaschii has only about 40% of the protein-encoding genes as compared with E. coli, and it appears that several amino acid pathways are not present in this archael species, including those for the biosynthesis of methionine and lysine (16Bono H. Ogata H. Goto S. Kanehisa M. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because of this simplified set of pathways, the multivalent regulation of AKs seen in other bacterial species is not required in M. jannaschii. The structure of mjAK has now been determined under three different transition states: ternary complex with MgAMP-PNP and l-aspartate, binary complex with l-aspartate, and binary complex in the presence of its allosteric inhibitor l-threonine, which therefore allows understanding of the mechanism of regulation by this end product amino acid. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—Gene cloning and enzyme expression were carried out as described previously (15Faehnle C.R. Liu X. Pavlovsky A. Viola R.E. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2006; 62: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), using the pET-41a vector (Novagen) and Rosetta (DE3) E. coli cells for protein expression. The resulting cells, harvested after overnight growth following isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, were suspended in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and were lysed by ultrasonication. The soluble crude protein fraction containing the overexpressed mjAK was separated from the cellular debris by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C. Incubation at 80-85 °C for 25 min resulted in significant denaturation of E. coli proteins without loss of the hyperthermophilic mjAK. The supernatant after centrifugation was treated with ammonium sulfate to 23% saturation for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant after centrifugation was then dialyzed overnight against the lysis buffer and then was subjected to two successive chromatography steps: first a high resolution anionic exchange resin (Source 30Q; GE Healthcare), followed by gel filtration column (Superdex 200; GE Healthcare) for the final purification. The resulted protein was shown by SDS-PAGE to be >99% pure and was confirmed to be a monodisperse sample with <14% polydispersity by dynamic light scattering. The pure mjAK was concentrated to 30 mg/ml by using a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Amicon concentrator. The activity of mjAK was measured by monitoring the conversion of NADPH to NADP at 340 nm by using an aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase-coupled assay. Crystallization of a Substrate Complex of mjAK—Crystallization of a ternary complex of mjAK with MgADP and l-aspartate has previously been reported (15Faehnle C.R. Liu X. Pavlovsky A. Viola R.E. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2006; 62: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To investigate the initial state of the forward reaction, a new ternary complex was constructed by incubating mjAK (12 mg/ml) with 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm AMP-PNP, and 30 mm l-aspartate overnight. Thick plate-shaped crystals grew at 20 °C from 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 800 mm ammonium formate with 13-15% polyethylene glycol 4000 as the precipitant. The crystals were cryoprotected by the direct addition of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol into the crystallization drop to 25% of the final volume prior to flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. Unexpectedly, the unharvested crystals remaining in the drop dissolved after several weeks, and a new crystal form grew at 4 °C within a week. Cryoprotection of this new crystal form was achieved by using an artificial solution containing 25% ethylene glycol in well solution. Crystallization of an Allosteric Inhibitor Complex of mjAK—To examine the effect of the allosteric inhibitor l-threonine on the structure of mjAK, a complex was formed by incubating 12 mg/ml mjAK with 6 mm l-threonine and 12 mm l-aspartate overnight at 4 °C. Initial crystal hits were obtained from available commercial screen kits, with the best crystals observed in the presence of 0.2 m KI and NH4I with 2.2 m ammonium sulfate as the precipitant from the Nextal AmSO4® screening kit. Optimization around the above starting condition yielded diffraction quality crystals of about 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm at 20 °C from 0.2 m KI with 1.4-1.6 m ammonium sulfate as the precipitant. These crystals were cryoprotected with an artificial solution consisting of 15% ethylene glycol in well solution prior to flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory). The data set for the ternary complex of mjAK with MgAMP-PNP and l-aspartate (crystal form I) was collected at the GM/CA 23ID beam line, whereas the second crystal form out of the same condition was collected at the IMCA 17ID beam line. Unfortunately, crystals of mjAK complexes with l-threonine diffracted quite weakly, and it was necessary to screen more than 100 crystals to find the optimal crystals for data collection. Seven data sets were collected at SER-CAT, of which merging three data sets collected at the 22ID beam line from a single crystal yielded the best data. Although this crystal decayed from a maximum diffraction of 2.7 Å to 3.0 Å after 100 frames, inclusion of the high resolution shell reflections did improve the electron density maps. All of the data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the HKL2000 program suite (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar), and the data collection statistics for each complex are reported in Table 1.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsParameterValueMgAMP-PNP/l-aspartatel-Aspartatel-ThreonineData collection statisticsTemperature (K)100100100Space groupP212121C2221P212121Unit cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)101.4, 104.5, 192.0107.5, 199.4, 95.7110.0, 144.3, 155.4α, β, γ (degrees)90.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.0Wavelength (Å)1.0001.0391.000Resolution (Å)50.00-2.30 (2.38-2.30)50.00-2.70 (2.77-2.70)50.00-2.70 (2.80-2.70)Total no. of reflections305988114452403684No. of unique reflections868203097456798RsymaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.0.058 (0.305)0.076 (0.395)0.091 (0.236)Output <I/σI>aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.18.5 (2.9)28.3 (3.0)18.1 (3.4)% completenessaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.95.7 (79.8)95.6 (96.6)83.6 (21.2)RedundancyaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.3.5 (2.9)3.7 (3.4)7.2 (2.0)Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)50.00-2.3050.00-2.7050.00-2.75Wilson B-factor (Å2)46.264.269.1No. of molecules/ASU424Rwork/Rfree (%)19.4/24.423.8/27.323.6/29.0No. of atomsProtein/ligands/formate/water14221/164/18/6227080/18/6/1313771/56/0/71<B-factors>Protein/ligands/water26.8/34.4/47.333.8/63.5/40.963.7/63.3/70.4Root mean square deviationsBond length (Å)/Bond angle (degrees)0.010/1.3360.009/1.1830.008/1.124Ramachandran plot92.0/7.7/0.3/0.188.6/9.9/1.5/088.2/10.9/0.9/0a Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The ternary complex structure with MgAMP-PNP and l-aspartate was solved by rigid body refinement with our published mjAK structure (Protein Data Bank code 2hmf) as the model in Refmac5 (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar), followed by restrained refinement with each subdomain as one noncrystallographic symmetry restraint. The structure was then further refined by a combination of TLS and restrained refinement with each subdomain as one TLS group. Manual model correction and ligand building in the Coot software package (19Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar) yielded a complete model with the exception of N-terminal methionine, residues 384-387, and C-terminal residues 471-473. In addition to the functional ligands MgAMP-PNP and l-aspartic acid, six formate ions from the crystallization setup were observed on the surface of the mjAK structure. The structure of the second crystal form was solved by molecular replacement in Phaser (20McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar) by using the first mjAK/MgAMP-PNP/l-aspartate structure as the search model. A molecular replacement search with a complete monomer failed to yield a solution, whereas a search performed with truncation of the C-terminal regulatory domain (residues 309-470) as the model led to a clear solution with a Z-score of 8.6. Next, a search with the N-terminal kinase domain (residues 2-300), omitting the flexible loops (residues 160-169 and 287-296), resulted in a clear solution for the kinase domain with a Z-score of 34.7. In contrast to the tetrameric structure of the mjAK complex with MgAMP-PNP and l-aspartate that is observed in the asymmetric unit, the initial model of this second crystal form appears as a dimer in one asymmetric unit. Two dimers are related by a 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis to form a tetramer. The structure was refined with rigid body refinement followed by restrained refinement, and the complete model was manually corrected in Coot. Although the enzyme was crystallized with both MgAMP-PNP and the substrate l-aspartate present in solution, electron density is only observed for l-aspartate in the active site of both monomers. Besides the missing density for MgAMP-PNP, two formate ions are found bound within the dimer interface. The structure of the mjAK complex with l-threonine was solved by molecular replacement by using a combination of Phaser and Molrep (21Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4137) Google Scholar). The searches in Phaser with the truncated N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain (residues 2-204) and the C-terminal regulatory domain (residues 310-470) yielded clear solutions for these two portions of the structure. However, a search with the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain (residues 205-300) failed to lead to a solution in Phaser, whereas a search for this portion of the structure resulted in a clear solution in Molrep. Therefore, the new model was generated by combination of the results from both Phaser and Molrep. The structure refinement was performed with rigid body refinement followed by restrained refinement after molecular replacement in Refmac5 associated with manual model building in Coot, resulting in Rcryst of 31.3% and Rfree of 38.2%. The restrained refinement was applied by dividing each subdomain into four loose noncrystallographic symmetry restraint regions (residues 2-165, 170-290, 300-389, and 406-469), and this resulted in an improved electron density map. Then TLS motion determination was utilized to identify the optimal groups in each subdomain for TLS refinement. Finally, the structure was further refined by a combination of TLS and restrained refinement associated with loose noncrystallographic symmetry restraints, yielding Rcryst of 23.6% and Rfree of 29.0% (Table 1). Although l-aspartate was included in the crystallization conditions, no electron density was observed for this substrate in the active site of this newly determined structure. Therefore, this initially constructed ternary complex of mjAK with l-aspartate and l-threonine became a binary mjAK/l-threonine complex upon crystallization. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—To obtain a direct measure of the binding affinity of l-threonine to mjAK the enzyme was titrated with the allosteric inhibitor in an ITC experiment carried out on a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). Purified mjAK enzyme was thoroughly dialyzed against 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The ITC experiments were performed at 30 °C with enzyme concentrations ranging from 20 μm for titration of the tight binding site to 100 μm for measurement of weaker binding, whereas the l-threonine concentration was increased from 0.3 mm for the tight site to 5 mm for the weaker binding interactions. The ligand was titrated into the mjAK solution, and each condition was repeated as least twice to ensure reproducible results. The data were fitted with the Origin software package. Overall Structures—To investigate the effect of l-threonine binding on the structure of mjAK, three different enzyme-ligand complexes were prepared. The ternary complex with the ATP analog AMP-PNP and l-aspartate was structurally determined with diffraction data collected at the highest resolution to date among the full-length aspartokinase structures. In addition, two binary complex structures, mjAK/l-aspartate and mjAK/l-threonine, were determined by molecular replacement using the ternary complex structure as the model. Identifying the appropriate search model ensemble was critical for the successful structure determination of the complex with l-threonine. The model structure was divided into three individual search components by hypothesizing that any domain movements are likely to be accommodated by bending hinges located within the long loops connecting each relatively rigid subdomain. This approach produced a good starting model for structural refinement. Determination of these three complex structures yielded excellent refined models, with the majority of the residues (greater than 88%) residing in favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot. Only one residue, Ile308 in monomer A of the ternary complex, falls into a disallowed region, but the modeled conformation of this residue is supported by clear electron density. An examination of the overall structures of these complexes of mjAK reveals that each are assembled into a dimer of dimers. Each monomer folds into an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain that consists of two ACT domains (22Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1023-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) connected by a 10-residue flexible loop (Fig. 1). This overall structure is similar to our previous determined mjAK structure of an abortive ternary complex with l-aspartate and the product ADP (15Faehnle C.R. Liu X. Pavlovsky A. Viola R.E. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2006; 62: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The interface within each dimer is quite extensive, comprising about 14-15% of the overall monomer surface area, whereas the interface between the two dimers involves less than 3% of the surface area (Table 2). Despite this small interdimeric interface, solution measurements on each enzyme complex indicate that this binding affinity is strong enough to sustain a stable dimer of dimers.TABLE 2Surface area comparison between the AK complexesEnzyme complexTotal surface areaMonomer surface areaInterface area within the dimerInterface area between two dimersAreaPercentage of surfaceAreaPercentage of surfaceÅ2Å2Å2%Å2%MgAMP-PNP/l-aspartate6759020546285713.95182.5l-Aspartate6950021152318415.14942.3l-Threonine7104021156288613.65102.4 Open table in a new tab Substrate Binding Sites—The ATP analog, AMP-PNP in the ternary complex, is bound in the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain at same site as was previously observed with ADP in an extended conformation with binding interactions between the enzyme and each structural component of the nucleotide. In contrast to the low resolution abortive ternary complex structure, the γ-phosphate of AMP-PNP provides complete information on nucleotide binding, and the higher resolution of this new complex structure allows more detailed insights into the substrate binding sites. The adenine ring is positioned in a hydrophobic pocket composed of Val235, Tyr236, Pro240, Ala265, and Val267 adjacent to a β-strand of the ACT2 domain. The ribose position is fixed through a hydrogen bond to the side-chain guanidino N atoms of Arg241 that is part of a 20-residue long flexible loop adjacent to an α-helix of the ACT2 domain. The phosphate groups coordinate the divalent cation, with the Mg2+ bridging across terminal O atoms from each phosphate group in a tridentate interaction in monomers A and D. Three water molecules complete the distorted octahedral geometry around the metal ion in these monomers (Fig. 2A). In monomer B, the terminal oxygen of the α-phosphate and the bridging oxygen between the α- and β-phosphate groups coordinate the Mg2+. In monomer C, the bound Mg2+ bridges between the α- and γ-phosphate groups in a bidentate interaction forming a planar coordination geometry along with two water molecules (Fig. 2A). In addition to the metal ion coordination, these phosphate groups are positioned in each active site through interactions with several side-chain functional groups. The β-phosphate is hydrogen-bonded to the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr230 in each monomer and to the side-chain amino group of Lys6 in monomers B and C. The γ-phosphate forms additional hydrogen bonds to the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser40 and the backbone amide N of Gly9 in each monomer and to the side-chain amino group of Lys6 in monomers B and C. In the ternary substrate complex structure, l-aspartate binds in the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain but with two different orientations in the dimer of dimers structure. In monomers A, B, and D, the α-carboxyl group of the amino acid substrate is positioned through an electrostatic interaction with the side-chain guanidino group of Arg207 and a hydrogen bond with a side-chain O atom from the carboxyl of Glu130, whereas the position of the α-amino group of l-aspartate is fixed through hydrogen bonds with Glu130 and Thr46. The β-carboxyl group of l-aspartate is positioned in a productive orientation toward the γ-phosphate that will be transferred from ATP in these monomers, which is further stabilized through two hydrogen bonds with the main-chain amide N of Ser210 and the main-chain carbonyl O of Gly208. l-Aspartate is found in the same substrate binding site in monomer C but, unexpectedly, binds with the opposite orientation from that present in the other active sites. Here it is the α-carboxyl group that points toward the γ-phosphate of ATP, whereas the β-carboxyl group is oriented away from the nucleotide. The carboxyl groups in this alternative substrate binding orientation are each stabilized by the same interactions that are accessible for l-aspartate in its normal, productive orientation (Fig. 2B). However, because of the one-carbon shift in the position of the α-amino group, it can no longer interact with enzyme through the same hydrogen bonds as in the other monomers but instead forms a relatively long and distorted hydrogen bond with the side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser210. The absence of a strong, compensating interaction with the α-amino group in this alternative orientation to replace the hydrogen bonding found in the “normal” substrate binding mode means that this orientation should have lower affinity and be less likely to occur. Attempts to model l-aspartate bound in the “normal” orientation in monomer C result in a much poorer fit to the Fo - Fc density generated from an omit map in this region (Fig. 2B). This incorrect model also caused an increase of 0.2% in the overall Rwork and Rfree values from those reported for this final structure in Table 1. Although this structure indicates that l-aspartate is bound in one subunit with the α-carboxyl group in position to be phosphorylated, there is no evidence showing that any α-phosphorylated aspartic acid is produced during the physiological reaction catalyzed by AK. However, in earlier kinetic studies, β-derivatized aspartic acids were found to be substrates of both the threonine-sensitive bifunctional AK (23Angeles T.S. Hunsley J.R. Viola R.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and the monofunctional AK of E. coli (24Keng Y.F. Viola R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and phosphorus-31 NMR spectra of the reaction mixtures showed that these alternative substrates were phosphorylated on the α-carboxyl group (23Angeles T.S. Hunsley J.R. Viola R.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The α-acyl phosphates produced from these alternative substrates are much less stable than β-aspartyl phosphates. It is possible that α-aspartyl phosphate is produced as a minor product during the physiological reaction, but this product is not stable enough to be easily detected in the presence of much higher levels of the β-phosphorylated product. Importantly, this new complex provides the first structural evidence showing how the relaxed substrate specificity previously observed with this enzyme family can actually occur through reversal of the regiospecificity of binding to synthesize an α-phosphorylated product. Effect of Nucleotide Binding—Structural comparisons between the binary l-aspartate complex and the ternary complex that includes l-aspartate and a nucleotide analog indicate that mjAK undergoes a significant conformation change upon nucleotide binding. As a consequence of this conformational rearrangement, the total surface area of the ternary complex decr"
https://openalex.org/W2077544389,"Background Type II DNA topoisomerases (topos) are essential enzymes needed for the resolution of topological problems that occur during DNA metabolic processes. Topos carry out an ATP-dependent strand passage reaction whereby one double helix is passed through a transient break in another. Humans have two topoII isoforms, α and β, which while enzymatically similar are differentially expressed and regulated, and are thought to have different cellular roles. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the enzyme has the most diversity, and has been implicated in regulation. We sought to investigate the impact of the CTD domain on activity. Methodology/Principle Findings We have investigated the role of the human topoII C-terminal domain by creating constructs encoding C-terminally truncated recombinant topoIIα and β and topoIIα+β-tail and topoIIβ+α-tail chimeric proteins. We then investigated function in vivo in a yeast system, and in vitro in activity assays. We find that the C-terminal domain of human topoII isoforms is needed for in vivo function of the enzyme, but not needed for cleavage activity. C-terminally truncated enzymes had similar strand passage activity to full length enzymes, but the presence of the opposite C-terminal domain had a large effect, with the topoIIα-CTD increasing activity, and the topoIIβ-CTD decreasing activity. Conclusions/Significance In vivo complementation data show that the topoIIα C-terminal domain is needed for growth, but the topoIIβ isoform is able to support low levels of growth without a C-terminal domain. This may indicate that topoIIβ has an additional localisation signal. In vitro data suggest that, while the lack of any C-terminal domain has little effect on activity, the presence of either the topoIIα or β C-terminal domain can affect strand passage activity. Data indicates that the topoIIβ-CTD may be a negative regulator. This is the first report of in vitro data with chimeric human topoIIs."
https://openalex.org/W2044477969,"The CHFR protein comprises fork head associated- (FHA) and RING-finger (RF) domain and is frequently downregulated in human colon and gastric cancers up to 50%. The loss of CHFR mRNA expression is a consequence of promoter methylation, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for this gene in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. In terms of the biological functions of CHFR, it has been shown to activate cell cycle checkpoint when cells are treated with microtubule depolymerizing agents. Furthermore, CHFR was reported to have E3 ligase activity and promote ubiquitination and degradation of oncogenic proteins such as Aurora A and polo-like kinase 1. However, molecular pathways involved in the tumor suppressive function of CHFR are not yet clear since the two established roles of this protein are likely to inhibit cell growth. In this study, we have identified that the FHA domain of CHFR protein is critical for growth suppressive properties, whereas the RF and cysteine rich domains (Cys) are not required for this function. In contrast, the RF and Cys domains are essential for E3 ligase activity of CHFR. By the use of a cell cycle checkpoint assay, we also confirmed that the FHA domain of CHFR plays an important role in initiating a cell cycle arrest at G2/M, indicating a functional link exists between the anti-proliferative effects and checkpoint function of this tumor suppressor protein via this domain. Collectively, our data show that the checkpoint function of the FHA domain of CHFR is a core component of anti-proliferative properties against the gastrointestinal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2074706105,"Ligand-induced homo- and hetero-dimer formation of ErbB receptors results in different biological outcomes irrespective of recruitment and activation of similar effector proteins. Earlier experimental research indicated that cells expressing both EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and the ErbB4 receptor (E1/4 cells) induced E1/4 cell-specific B-Raf activation and higher extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, followed by cellular transformation, than cells solely expressing EGFR (E1 cells) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Since our experimental data revealed the presence of positive feedback by ERK on upstream pathways, it was estimated that the cross-talk/feedback pathway structure of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade might affect ERK activation dynamics in our cell system. To uncover the regulatory mechanism concerning the ERK dynamics, we used topological models and performed parameter estimation for all candidate structures that possessed ERK-mediated positive feedback regulation of Raf. The structure that reliably reproduced a series of experimental data regarding signal amplitude and duration of the signaling molecules was selected as a solution. We found that the pathway structure is characterized by ERK-mediated positive feedback regulation of B-Raf and B-Raf-mediated negative regulation of Raf-1. Steady-state analysis of the estimated structure indicated that the amplitude of Ras activity might critically affect ERK activity through ERK-B-Raf positive feedback coordination with sustained B-Raf activation in E1/4 cells. However, Rap1 that positively regulates B-Raf activity might be less effective concerning ERK and B-Raf activity. Furthermore, we investigated how such Ras activity in E1/4 cells can be regulated by EGFR/ErbB4 heterodimer-mediated signaling. From a sensitivity analysis of the detailed upstream model for Ras activation, we concluded that Ras activation dynamics is dominated by heterodimer-mediated signaling coordination with a large initial speed of dimerization when the concentration of the ErbB4 receptor is considerably high. Such characteristics of the signaling cause the preferential binding of the Grb2-SOS complex to heterodimer-mediated signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2055112304,"Simultaneously dependent siblings often compete for parentally provided resources. This competition may lead to mortality, the probability of which may be a function, in part, of the individual offspring's production order. In birds, serial ovulation followed by hatching asynchrony of simultaneous dependents leads to differences in post-hatching survival that largely depend on ovulation (laying) order. This has led to the widespread assumption that early-laid eggs are of greater value and therefore should possess different maternally manipulated characteristics than later-laid eggs. However, this perspective ignores the potential effect of laying order on pre-hatching viability, an effect which some studies suggest should offset the effect of laying order on post-hatching viability. I examined the relationship between laying order and hatching and fledging probability in wild, free-living Lincoln's sparrows (Melospiza lincolnii). In broods with complete hatching success, first-laid and therefore first-hatched offspring had the highest probability of fledging, and fledging probability declined with increasing laying order. However, first-laid eggs were less likely than later-laid eggs to hatch. This effect of laying order on pre-hatching viability seemed to offset that on post-hatching viability, and, consistently, maternal investment in egg size varied little if at all with respect to laying order. These results suggest that ovulation order mediates a trade-off between pre-hatching and post-hatching viability and should encourage a re-evaluation of the solitary role post-embryonic survival often plays when researchers make assumptions about the value of propagules based on the order in which they are produced."

Screening for mutations in exons, exon-intron boundaries and regulatory sequences, we identified 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PIK3R1 gene region from exon 1 to the beginning of the 3' untranslated region (UTR). These SNPs defined haplotypes for the respective PIK3R1 region. Four haplotype tagging (ht)SNPs (rs706713, rs2302975, rs171649 and rs1043526), discriminating all haplotypes with a frequency >or=4.5% were identified. These htSNPs were used to genotype adolescents from the ""Mannheim Study of Risk Children"" (MARC). Transmission disequilibrium tests in these adolescents and their parents demonstrated sex-specific association of two SNPs, rs2302975 and rs1043526, with patterns of risky alcohol consumption in male adolescents, including lifetime prevalence of drunkenness (p = 0.0019 and 0.0379, respectively) and elevated maximum amount of drinking (p = 0.0020 and 0.0494, respectively), as a measure for binge drinking pattern.Our findings highlight a previously unknown relevance of PIK3R1 genotypes for alcohol use disorders and might help discriminate individuals at risk for alcoholism."
https://openalex.org/W2034292837,"The Aurora kinases comprise an evolutionarily conserved protein family that is required for a variety of cell division events, including spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Emerging evidence suggests that once phosphorylated, a subset of Aurora substrates can enhance Aurora kinase activity. Our previous work revealed that the Caenorhabditis elegans Tousled-like kinase TLK-1 is a substrate and activator of the AIR-2 Aurora B kinase in vitro and that partial loss of TLK-1 enhances the mitotic defects of an air-2 mutant. However, given that these experiments were performed in vitro and with partial loss of function alleles in vivo, a necessary step forward in our understanding of the relationship between the Aurora B and Tousled kinases is to prove that TLK-1 expression is sufficient for Aurora B activation in vivo. Here, we report that heterologous expression of wild-type and kinase-inactive forms of TLK-1 suppresses the lethality of temperature-sensitive mutants of the yeast Aurora B kinase Ipl1. Moreover, kinase-dead TLK-1 associates with and augments the activity of Ipl1 in vivo. Together, these results provide critical and compelling evidence that Tousled has a bona fide kinase-independent role in the activation of Aurora B kinases in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1992428239,"Precise localization of individual proteins is required for processes such as motility, chemotaxis, cell-cycle progression, and cell division in bacteria, but the number of proteins that are localized in bacterial species is not known. A screen based on transposon mutagenesis and fluorescence activated cell sorting was devised to identify large numbers of localized proteins, and employed in Caulobacter crescentus. From a sample of the clones isolated in the screen, eleven proteins with no previously characterized localization in C. crescentus were identified, including six hypothetical proteins. The localized hypothetical proteins included one protein that was localized in a helix-like structure, and two proteins for which the localization changed as a function of the cell cycle, suggesting that complex three-dimensional patterns and cell cycle-dependent localization are likely to be common in bacteria. Other mutants produced localized fusion proteins even though the transposon has inserted near the 5' end of a gene, demonstrating that short peptides can contain sufficient information to localize bacterial proteins. The screen described here could be used in most bacterial species."
https://openalex.org/W2033369854,"The introduction of molecular diagnostic methods is crucial for improved understanding of the aetiology and epidemiology of bacterial infections in communities in resource poor settings. A blood sample from a 7 month old patient diagnosed with malaria in 2001 in a Gambian outpatient clinic was reported as culture negative after it was subjected to traditional bacterial culture protocols. We re-addressed the analysis of the blood sample from this case more recently (after 6.5 years in archival storage) in pilot work establishing 16S rRNA PCR in our molecular laboratory. Initial 16S rRNA PCR results confirmed the presence of bacterial DNA in the sample. 16S rRNA sequence analysis identified the organism as Campylobacter spp. In light of the molecular evidence we successfully grew the organism using appropriate culture conditions and subsequently biochemically confirmed that the isolate was Campylobacter jejuni. PCR and DNA sequencing of a set of seven C. jejuni housekeeping genes and in silico Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) analysis revealed that the isolate exhibits a novel sequence type (ST) of C. jejuni (ST 2928) and belongs to ST-443 clonal complex. This study demonstrates the potential for molecular tools to enhance the diagnosis of bacterial infections, which remain a major killer globally, not least in children in the developing world. Improvements in diagnostics are needed, and will be important not only for sick individuals but also for populations, where better measures of disease burden will contribute significantly to the improvement of public health policy."
https://openalex.org/W2071279214,"Behavioural side-bias occurs in many vertebrates, including birds as a result of hemispheric specialization and can be advantageous by improving response times to sudden stimuli and efficiency in multi-tasking. However, behavioural side-bias can lead to morphological asymmetries resulting in reduced performance for specific activities. For flying animals, wing asymmetry is particularly costly and it is unclear if behavioural side-biases will be expressed in flight; the benefits of quick response time afforded by side-biases must be balanced against the costs of less efficient flight due to the morphological asymmetry side-biases may incur. Thus, competing constraints could lead to context-dependent expression or suppression of side-bias in flight. In repeated flight trials through an outdoor tunnel with obstacles, tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) preferred larger openings, but we did not detect either individual or population-level side-biases. Thus, while observed behavioural side-biases during substrate-foraging and copulation are common in birds, we did not see such side-bias expressed in obstacle avoidance behaviour in flight. This finding highlights the importance of behavioural context for investigations of side-bias and hemispheric laterality and suggests both proximate and ultimate trade-offs between species-specific cognitive ecology and flight biomechanics."
