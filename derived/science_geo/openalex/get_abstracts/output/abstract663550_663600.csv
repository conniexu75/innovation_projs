https://openalex.org/W3100475594,"The oxygen evolution reaction has an important role in many alternative-energy schemes because it supplies the protons and electrons required for converting renewable electricity into chemical fuels1–3. Electrocatalysts accelerate the reaction by facilitating the required electron transfer4, as well as the formation and rupture of chemical bonds5. This involvement in fundamentally different processes results in complex electrochemical kinetics that can be challenging to understand and control, and that typically depends exponentially on overpotential1,2,6,7. Such behaviour emerges when the applied bias drives the reaction in line with the phenomenological Butler–Volmer theory, which focuses on electron transfer8, enabling the use of Tafel analysis to gain mechanistic insight under quasi-equilibrium9–11 or steady-state assumptions12. However, the charging of catalyst surfaces under bias also affects bond formation and rupture13–15, the effect of which on the electrocatalytic rate is not accounted for by the phenomenological Tafel analysis8 and is often unknown. Here we report pulse voltammetry and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements on iridium oxide to show that the applied bias does not act directly on the reaction coordinate, but affects the electrocatalytically generated current through charge accumulation in the catalyst. We find that the activation free energy decreases linearly with the amount of oxidative charge stored, and show that this relationship underlies electrocatalytic performance and can be evaluated using measurement and computation. We anticipate that these findings and our methodology will help to better understand other electrocatalytic materials and design systems with improved performance. Spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction establish that reaction rates depend on the amount of charge stored in the electrocatalyst, and not on the applied potential."
https://openalex.org/W3101215304,"Particulate matter is a component of ambient air pollution that has been linked to millions of annual premature deaths globally1–3. Assessments of the chronic and acute effects of particulate matter on human health tend to be based on mass concentration, with particle size and composition also thought to play a part4. Oxidative potential has been suggested to be one of the many possible drivers of the acute health effects of particulate matter, but the link remains uncertain5–8. Studies investigating the particulate-matter components that manifest an oxidative activity have yielded conflicting results7. In consequence, there is still much to be learned about the sources of particulate matter that may control the oxidative potential concentration7. Here we use field observations and air-quality modelling to quantify the major primary and secondary sources of particulate matter and of oxidative potential in Europe. We find that secondary inorganic components, crustal material and secondary biogenic organic aerosols control the mass concentration of particulate matter. By contrast, oxidative potential concentration is associated mostly with anthropogenic sources, in particular with fine-mode secondary organic aerosols largely from residential biomass burning and coarse-mode metals from vehicular non-exhaust emissions. Our results suggest that mitigation strategies aimed at reducing the mass concentrations of particulate matter alone may not reduce the oxidative potential concentration. If the oxidative potential can be linked to major health impacts, it may be more effective to control specific sources of particulate matter rather than overall particulate mass. Observations and air-quality modelling reveal that the sources of particulate matter and oxidative potential in Europe are different, implying that reducing mass concentrations of particulate matter alone may not reduce oxidative potential."
https://openalex.org/W3101626761,"The modern description of elementary particles, as formulated in the Standard Model of particle physics, is built on gauge theories. Gauge theories implement fundamental laws of physics by local symmetry constraints. For example, in quantum electrodynamics, Gauss's law introduces an intrinsic local relation between charged matter and electromagnetic fields, which protects many salient physical properties including massless photons and a long-ranged Coulomb law. Solving gauge theories by classical computers is an extremely arduous task, which has stimulated a vigorous effort to simulate gauge-theory dynamics in microscopically engineered quantum devices. Previous achievements implemented density-dependent Peierls phases without defining a local symmetry, realized mappings onto effective models to integrate out either matter or electric fields, or were limited to very small systems. The essential gauge symmetry has not been observed experimentally. Here, we report the quantum simulation of an extended U(1) lattice gauge theory, and experimentally quantify the gauge invariance in a many-body system comprising matter and gauge fields. These are realized in defect-free arrays of bosonic atoms in an optical superlattice of 71 sites. We demonstrate full tunability of the model parameters and benchmark the matter--gauge interactions by sweeping across a quantum phase transition. Enabled by high-fidelity manipulation techniques, we measure the degree to which Gauss's law is violated by extracting probabilities of locally gauge-invariant states from correlated atom occupations. Our work provides a way to explore gauge symmetry in the interplay of fundamental particles using controllable large-scale quantum simulators."
https://openalex.org/W3098208509,"There is a contradiction at the heart of our current understanding of individual and collective mobility patterns. On one hand, a highly influential stream of literature on human mobility driven by analyses of massive empirical datasets finds that human movements show no evidence of characteristic spatial scales. There, human mobility is described as scale-free. On the other hand, in geography, the concept of scale, referring to meaningful levels of description from individual buildings through neighborhoods, cities, regions, and countries, is central for the description of various aspects of human behavior such as socio-economic interactions, or political and cultural dynamics. Here, we resolve this apparent paradox by showing that day-to-day human mobility does indeed contain meaningful scales, corresponding to spatial containers restricting mobility behavior. The scale-free results arise from aggregating displacements across containers. We present a simple model, which given a person's trajectory, infers their neighborhoods, cities, and so on, as well as the sizes of these geographical containers. We find that the containers characterizing the trajectories of more than 700,000 individuals do indeed have typical sizes. We show that our model generates highly realistic trajectories without overfitting and provides a new lens through which to understand the differences in mobility behaviour across countries, gender groups, and urban-rural areas."

https://openalex.org/W3101513431,"Dozens of genes contribute to the wide variation in human pigmentation. Many of these genes encode proteins that localize to the melanosome-the organelle, related to the lysosome, that synthesizes pigment-but have unclear functions1,2. Here we describe MelanoIP, a method for rapidly isolating melanosomes and profiling their labile metabolite contents. We use this method to study MFSD12, a transmembrane protein of unknown molecular function that, when suppressed, causes darker pigmentation in mice and humans3,4. We find that MFSD12 is required to maintain normal levels of cystine-the oxidized dimer of cysteine-in melanosomes, and to produce cysteinyldopas, the precursors of pheomelanin synthesis made in melanosomes via cysteine oxidation5,6. Tracing and biochemical analyses show that MFSD12 is necessary for the import of cysteine into melanosomes and, in non-pigmented cells, lysosomes. Indeed, loss of MFSD12 reduced the accumulation of cystine in lysosomes of fibroblasts from patients with cystinosis, a lysosomal-storage disease caused by inactivation of the lysosomal cystine exporter cystinosin7-9. Thus, MFSD12 is an essential component of the cysteine importer for melanosomes and lysosomes."

https://openalex.org/W3101828646,"Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are important calcium receptors, which play a crucial part in the process of sensing and decoding intracellular calcium signals during plant development and adaptation to various environmental stresses. In this study, a CDPK gene MdCPK1a , was isolated from apple ( Malus×domestica ) which contains 1701bp nucleotide and encodes a protein of 566 amino acid residues, and contains the conserved domain of CDPKs. The transient expression and western blot experiment showed that MdCPK1a protein was localized in the nucleus and cell plasma membrane. Ectopic expression of MdCPK1a in Nicotiana benthamiana increased the resistance of the tobacco plants to salt and cold stresses. The mechanism of MdCPK1a regulating cold resistance was further investigated. The overexpressed MdCPK1a tobacco plants had higher survival rates and longer root length than wild type (WT) plants under cold stress, and the electrolyte leakages (EL), the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were lower, and accordingly, antioxidant enzyme activities, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) were higher, suggesting the transgenic plants suffered less chilling injury than WT plants. Moreover, the transcript levels of ROS-scavenging and stress-related genes were higher in the transgenic plants than those in WT plants whether under normal conditions or cold stress. The above results suggest that the improvement of cold tolerance in MdCPK1a- overexpressed plants was due to scavenging ROS accumulation and modulating the expression of stress-related genes."
https://openalex.org/W3098771226,"Endothelial cells (ECs) are subjected to physical forces such as shear stress (SS) induced by blood flow that leads to significant changes in morphology, physiology and gene expression. The abnormal mechanical forces applied in the cardiovascular system can influence the development of conditions and diseases such as thrombosis, hypertension and atherosclerosis. This study investigated the expression of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteoglycans and extracellular matrix molecules in ECs exposed to normal and altered SS. ECs were exposed to SS of 12 dyn/cm 2 (artery physiological condition) and 4 dyn/cm 2 (artery pathological condition). Subsequently, ECs were subjected to immunofluorescence, qPCR, GAG biosynthesis analyses and cell-based assays. SS induced changes in ECs morphology. There were other pathological consequences of altered SS, including inhibited adhesion, stimulation of migration and capillary-like tube formation, as well as increases of GAG synthesis. We observed higher expression of syndecan-4, perlecan, decorin, fibronectin and collagen III α1 and growth factors, including VEGF-A and TGFβ-1. ECs exposed to SS displayed extracellular matrix remodeling as well as expression of cell-matrix and cell-cell interaction molecules. This study contributes to the understanding of how vascular biology is affected by mechanical forces and how these molecules can be affected in cardiovascular diseases."

Our purpose is to compare the per-lesion and per-patient detection rate of gadoxetic acid-(Gd-EOB) enhanced liver MRI and fast MR protocol including Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) and T2-W Fat Suppression sequence in the detection of liver metastasis in pre surgical setting. Methods One hundred and eight patients with pathologically proven liver metastases (756 liver metastases) underwent Gd-EOBMRI were enrolled in this study. Three radiologist independently graded the presence of liver lesions on a five-point confidence scale assessed only abbreviated protocol (DWI and sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolution (SPACE) fat suppressed sequence) and after an interval of more than 2 weeks the conventional study (all acquired sequences). Per-lesion and per-patient detection rate of metastases were calculated. Weighted к values were used to evaluate inter-reader agreement of the confidence scale regarding the presence of the lesion. Results MRI detected 732 liver metastases. All lesions were identified both by conventional study as by abbreviated protocol. In terms of per-lesion detection rate of liver metastasis, all three readers had higher detection rate both with abbreviated protocol and with standard protocol with Gd-EOB (96.8% [732 of 756] vs. 96.5% [730 of 756] for reader 1; 95.8% [725 of 756] vs. 95.2% [720 of 756] for reader 2; 96.5% [730 of 756] vs. 96.5% [730 of 756] for reader 3). Inter-reader agreement of lesions detection rate between the three radiologists was excellent (k range, 0.86–0.98) both for Gd-EOB MRI and for Fast protocol (k range, 0.89–0.99). Conclusion Abbreviated protocol showed the same detection rate than conventional study in detection of liver metastases."

https://openalex.org/W3098506483,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a severe incurable neurological disorder. It is mostly characterized by non-motor symptoms like fatigue, dementia, anxiety, speech and communication problems, depression, and so on. Electroencephalography (EEG) play a key role in the detection of the true emotional state of a person. Various studies have been proposed for the detection of emotional impairment in PD using filtering, Fourier transforms, wavelet transforms, and non-linear methods. However, these methods require a selection of basis and are confined in terms of accuracy. In this paper, tunable Q wavelet transform (TQWT) is proposed for the classification of emotions in PD and normal controls (NC). EEG signals of six emotional states namely happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust are studied. Power, entropy, and statistical moments based features are elicited from the highpass and lowpass sub-bands of TQWT. Six features selected by statistical analysis are classified with a k-nearest neighbor, probabilistic neural network, random forest, decision tree, and extreme learning machine. Three performance measures are obtained, maximum mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96.16%, 97.59%, and 88.51% for NC and 93.88%, 96.33%, and 81.67% for PD are achieved with a probabilistic neural network. The proposed method proved to be very effective such that it classifies emotions in PD and could be used as a potential tool for diagnosing emotional impairment in hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W3098303024,"The search for a suitable material to promote regeneration after long-distance peripheral nerve defects turned the spotlight on spider silk. Nerve conduits enriched with native spider silk fibers as internal guiding structures previously demonstrated a regenerative outcome similar to autologous nerve grafts in animal studies. Nevertheless, spider silk is a natural material with associated limitations for clinical use. A promising alternative is the production of recombinant silk fibers that should mimic the outstanding properties of their native counterpart. However, in vitro data on the regenerative features that native silk fibers provide for cells involved in nerve regeneration are scarce. Thus, there is a lack of reference parameters to evaluate whether recombinant silk fiber candidates will be eligible for nerve repair in vivo. To gain insight into the regenerative effect of native spider silk, our study aims to define the behavioral response of primary Schwann cells (SCs), nerve-associated fibroblasts (FBs), and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons cultured on native dragline silk from the genus Nephila and on laminin coated dishes. The established multi-color immunostaining panels together with confocal microscopy and live cell imaging enabled the analysis of cell identity, morphology, proliferation, and migration on both substrates in detail. Our findings demonstrated that native spider silk rivals laminin coating as it allowed attachment and proliferation and supported the characteristic behavior of all tested cell types. Axonal out-growth of DRG neurons occurred along longitudinally aligned SCs that formed sustained bundled structures resembling Bungner bands present in regenerating nerves. The migration of SCs along the silk fibers achieved the reported distance of regenerating axons of about 1 mm per day, but lacked directionality. Furthermore, rFBs significantly reduced the velocity of rSCs in co-cultures on silk fibers. In summary, this study (a) reveals features recombinant silk must possess and what modifications or combinations could be useful for enhanced nerve repair and (b) provides assays to evaluate the regenerative performance of silk fibers in vitro before being applied as internal guiding structure in nerve conduits in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3104903406,"Background Around 50% of hospital readmissions due to heart failure are preventable, with lack of adherence to prescribed self-care as a driving factor. Remote tracking and reminders issued by mobile health devices could help to promote self-care, which could potentially reduce these readmissions. Objective We sought to investigate two factors: (1) feasibility of enrolling heart failure patients in a remote monitoring regimen that uses wireless sensors and patient-reported outcome measures; and (2) their adherence to using the study devices and completing patient-reported outcome measures. Methods Twenty heart failure patients participated in piloting a remote monitoring regimen. Data collection included: (1) physical activity using wrist-worn activity trackers; (2) body weight using bathroom scales; (3) medication adherence using smart pill bottles; and (4) patient -reported outcomes using patient-reported outcome measures. Results We evaluated 150 hospitalized heart failure patients and enrolled 20 individuals. Two factors contributed to 50% (65/130) being excluded from the study: smartphone ownership and patient discharge. Over the course of the study, 60.0% of the subjects wore the activity tracker for at least 70% of the hours, and 45.0% used the scale for more than 70% of the days. The pill bottle was used less than 10% of the days by 55.0% of the subjects. Conclusions Our method of recruiting heart failure patients prior to hospital discharge may not be feasible as the enrollment rate was low. Once enrolled, the majority of subjects maintained a high adherence to wearing the activity tracker but low adherence to using the pill bottle and completing the follow-up surveys. Scale usage was fair, but it received positive reviews from most subjects. Given the observed usage and feedback, we suggest mobile health-driven interventions consider including an activity tracker and bathroom scale. We also recommend administering a shorter survey more regularly and through an easier interface."
https://openalex.org/W3104084407,"With the rapid development of big data and deep learning, breakthroughs have been made in phonetic and textual research, the two fundamental attributes of language. Language is an essential medium of information exchange in teaching activity. The aim is to promote the transformation of the training mode and content of translation major and the application of the translation service industry in various fields. Based on previous research, the SCN-LSTM (Skip Convolutional Network and Long Short Term Memory) translation model of deep learning neural network is constructed by learning and training the real dataset and the public PTB (Penn Treebank Dataset). The feasibility of the model’s performance, translation quality, and adaptability in practical teaching is analyzed to provide a theoretical basis for the research and application of the SCN-LSTM translation model in English teaching. The results show that the capability of the neural network for translation teaching is nearly one times higher than that of the traditional N-tuple translation model, and the fusion model performs much better than the single model, translation quality, and teaching effect. To be specific, the accuracy of the SCN-LSTM translation model based on deep learning neural network is 95.21%, the degree of translation confusion is reduced by 39.21% compared with that of the LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model, and the adaptability is 0.4 times that of the N-tuple model. With the highest level of satisfaction in practical teaching evaluation, the SCN-LSTM translation model has achieved a favorable effect on the translation teaching of the English major. In summary, the performance and quality of the translation model are improved significantly by learning the language characteristics in translations by teachers and students, providing ideas for applying machine translation in professional translation teaching."
https://openalex.org/W3105958856,"The tumor immune microenvironment is emerging as a critical player in predicting cancer prognosis and response to therapies. However, the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in Gingivo-Buccal Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (GBOSCC) and their association with tumor size or lymph node metastases status require further elucidation. To study the relationship of tumor-infiltrating immune cells with tumor size (T stage) and lymph node metastases (N stages), we analyzed the density of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in archived, whole tumor resections from 94 patients. We characterized these sections by immune-histochemistry using 12 markers and enumerated tumor-infiltrating immune cells at the invasive margins (IM) and centers of tumors (CT). We observed that a higher density of CD3 + cells in the IM and CT was associated with smaller tumor size (T1-T2 stage). Fewer CD3 + cells was associated with larger tumor size (T3-T4 stage). High infiltration of CD3 + and CD8 + cells in IM and CT as well as high CD4 + cell infiltrates in the IM was significantly associated with the absence of lymph node metastases. High infiltrates of CD3 + and CD8 + cells in CT was associated with significantly improved survival. Our results illustrate that the densities and spatial distribution of CD3 + and CD8 + cell infiltrates in primary GBOSCC tumors is predictive of disease progression and survival. Based on our findings, we recommend incorporating immune cell quantification in the TNM classification and routine histopathology reporting of GBOSCC. Immune cell quantification in CT and IM may help predict the efficacy of future therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3098043307,"Breast Cancer is the most common form of cancer in women worldwide, impacting nearly 2.1 million women each year. Identification of new biomarkers could be key for early diagnosis and detection. Vitronectin, a glycoprotein that is abundantly found in serum, extracellular matrix, and bone, binds to integrin αvβ3, and promotes cell adhesion and migration. Current studies indicate that patients with amplified vitronectin levels have lower survival rates than patients without amplified vitronectin levels. In this study, we focused on the role of vitronectin in breast cancer survival and its functional role as a non-invasive biomarker for early stage and stage specific breast cancer detection. To confirm that the expression of vitronectin is amplified in breast cancer, a total of 240 serum samples (n = 240), 200 from breast cancer patients and 40 controls were analyzed using the Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) technique. Of the 240 samples, 120 samples were of African American (AA) descent, while the other 120 were of White American (WA) descent. Data indicated that there were some possible racial disparities in vitronectin levels and, differences also seen in the recurrent patient samples. Next, we tried to uncover the underlying mechanism which plays a critical role in vitronectin expression. The cellular data from four different breast cancer cell lines- MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and HCC1599 indicated that the PI3K/AKT axis is modulating the expression of vitronectin. We believe that vitronectin concentration levels are involved and connected to the metastasis of breast cancer in certain patients, specifically based on recurrence or ethnicity, which is detrimental for poor prognosis. Therefore, in this current study we showed that the serum vitronectin levels could be an early marker for the breast cancer survival and we also determine the cellular signaling factors which modulate the expression and concentration of vitronectin."
https://openalex.org/W3099200429,"Introduction In recent decades, the incidence of Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has been increasing and posing a growing health problem because of the high costs to the healthcare system and society. The clinical manifestations are well studied but there is a lack of research analyzing the severity of the disease. Objective The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiology and clinical presentation of severe TBE, to identify the predictors for a severe disease course, and also predictors for meningoencephalomyelitic and severe meningoencephalitic/encephalitic forms. Methods A retrospective study was conducted in the Center of Infectious Diseases and the Center of Neurology at Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos in the years 2005–2017 to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of TBE in adults. Results 1040 patients were included in the study. A total of 152/1040 (14.6%) patients had a severe course. The highest proportion of severe cases, reaching 41.2%, was reported in the 70–79 year-old age group. A total of 36/152 (23.7%) severe patients presented meningoencephalomyelitis. Myelitic patients were older, were frequently infected in their living areas, and usually reported a monophasic disease course compared with severe meningoencephalitic/encephalitic patients. Severe meningoencephalitic/encephalitic patients, compared with non-severe meningoencephalitic/encephalitic, were older, less often noticed the tick bite, and often had a monophasic course. The sequelae on discharge were observed in 810/1000 (81%) of patients. Conclusions The prognostic factors associated with a severe disease course and severe meningoencephalitic form are: older age, comorbidities, a monophasic course, a fever of 40˚C and above, CRP more than 30 mg/l, CSF protein more than 1 g/l, delayed immune response of TBEV IgG, pathological findings in CT. Age above 60 years, presence of CNS disease, bulbar syndrome, pleocytosis 500x10 6 /l and above, and delayed immune response of TBEV IgG are predictors of the most severe myelitic form."
https://openalex.org/W3103536148,"Objectives Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant human tumors. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. In recent years, tumor gene therapy has emerged as a promising new approach for colorectal cancer therapy. Herein, we identify and analyze the role of COPB2 (coatomer protein complex, subunit beta 2) in proliferation and apoptosis of CRC cells. Methods To investigate the role of COPB2 in the proliferation and apoptosis of CRC cells, a shCOPB2 vector and a shCtrl vector were constructed for transfection into RKO and HCT116 cells. Cells proliferation was subsequently measured via cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and Celigo cell counting assay. Apoptosis was measured via flow cytometry. The activity level of Caspase 3/7 was measured. Finally, the level of several JNK/c-Jun apoptosis pathway-related proteins were measured to characterize the mechanism of apoptosis. Results Our results showed that the proliferation rate was decreased and the apoptosis rate was increased in shCOPB2-treated RKO and HCT116 cells compared to those in controls. After the silencing of COPB2, JNK/c-Jun signal pathway activation was increased, the expression levels of apoptosis pathway-related proteins, such as Bad, p53 and Caspase 3, were also increased. Conclusion COPB2 gene silencing can inhibit RKO and HCT116 cells proliferation and induce apoptosis via the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3105151271,"Background COVID-19 is frequently complicated by venous thromboembolism (VTE). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest—primarily usually conducted as low-dose, non-contrast enhanced CT—plays an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia. Performed as contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiography, it can reliably detect or rule-out pulmonary embolism (PE). Several imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia have been described for chest CT, but no study evaluated CT findings in the context of VTE/PE. Purpose In our retrospective study, we analyzed clinical, laboratory and CT imaging characteristics of 50 consecutive patients with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent contrast-enhanced chest CT at two tertiary care medical centers. Material and methods All patients with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 pneumonia and contrast-enhanced chest CT performed at two tertiary care hospitals between March 1st and April 20th 2020 were retrospectively identified. Patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities), symptoms, date of symptom onset, RT-PCR results, imaging results of CT and leg ultrasound, laboratory findings (C-reactive protein, differential blood count, troponine, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), fibrinogen, interleukin-6, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase muscle-brain (CKmb) and lactate,) and patient outcome (positive: discharge or treatment on normal ward; negative: treatment on intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or death) were analyzed. Follow-up was performed until May 10th. Patients were assigned to two groups according to two endpoints: venous thromboembolism (VTE) or no VTE. For statistical analysis, univariate logistic regression models were calculated. Results This study includes 50 patients. In 14 out of 50 patients (28%), pulmonary embolism was detected at contrast-enhanced chest CT. The majority of PE was detected on CTs performed on day 11–20 after symptom onset. Two patients (14%) with PE simultaneously had evidence of deep vein thrombosis. 15 patients (30%) had a negative outcome (need for intensive care, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or death), and 35 patients (70%) had a positive outcome (transfer to regular ward, or discharge). Patients suffering VTE had a statistically significant higher risk of an unfavorable outcome (p = 0.028). In univariate analysis, two imaging characteristics on chest CT were associated with VTE: crazy paving pattern (p = 0.024) and air bronchogram (n = 0.021). Also, elevated levels of NT-pro BNP (p = 0.043), CK (p = 0.023) and D-dimers (p = 0.035) were significantly correlated with VTE. Conclusion COVID-19 pneumonia is frequently complicated by pulmonary embolism (incidence of 28% in our cohort), remarkably with lacking evidence of deep vein thrombosis in nearly all thus affected patients of our cohort. As patients suffering VTE had an adverse outcome, we call for a high level of alertness for PE and advocate a lower threshold for contrast-enhanced CT in COVID-19 pneumonia. According to our observations, this might be particularly justified in the second week of disease and if a crazy paving pattern and / or air bronchogram is present on previous non-enhanced CT."
https://openalex.org/W3106102517,"Background Maintaining adherence to statins reduces the risk of an initial cardiovascular disease (CVD) event in high-risk individuals (primary prevention) and additional CVD events following the first event (secondary prevention). The effectiveness of statin therapy is limited by the level of adherence maintained by the patient. We undertook a nationwide study to compare adherence and discontinuation in primary and secondary prevention patients. Methods Dispensing data from New Zealand community pharmacies were used to identify patients who received their first statin dispensing between 2006 and 2011. The Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) and proportion who discontinued statin medication was calculated for the year following first statin dispensing for patients with a minimum of two dispensings. Adherence was defined as an MPR ≥ 0.8. Previous CVD was identified using hospital discharge records. Multivariable logistic regression was used to control for demographic and statin characteristics. Results Between 2006 and 2011 289,666 new statin users were identified with 238,855 (82.5%) receiving the statin for primary prevention compared to 50,811 (17.5%) who received it for secondary prevention. The secondary prevention group was 1.55 (95% CI 1.51–1.59) times as likely to be adherent and 0.67 (95% CI 0.65–0.69) times as likely to discontinue statin treatment than the primary prevention group. An early gap in statin coverage increased the odds of discontinuing statin treatment. Conclusion Adherence to statin medication is higher in secondary prevention than primary prevention. Within each group, a range of demographic and treatment factors further influences adherence."

In order to detect the effects of the invader on biodiversity and evaluate its suitable habitats and ecological distribution, we investigated the abundance, relative abundance, diversity indices, and the number of the invasive and native plants in paired invaded and non-invaded quadrats in four locations in North and Northeast China. We also analyzed the effects of monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity (%), and precipitations (mm). Strong positive significant ( P &lt; 0.01) correlation and maximum interspecific competition (41%) were found in Huailai between invaded and non-invaded quadrats. Shannon’s Diversity Index showed that non-invaded plots had significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) more diversified species than invaded ones. The significant ( P &lt; 0.05) Margalef’s Richness Index was found in Huailai and Zhangjiakou in non-invaded recorded heterogeneous nature of plant communities. Similarly, significant ( P &lt; 0.05) species richness found in Huailai and Zhangjiakou in non-invaded quadrats compared to invaded ones. Maximum evenness of Setaria feberi (0.47, 0.37), Seteria viridis (0.43) found in Fushun and Zhangjiakou recorded more stable in a community compared to other localities. Evenness showed positive relationship of Shannon Entropy within different plant species. The higher dissimilarity in plant communities found in Huailai (87.06%) followed by Yangyuan (44.43%), Zhangjiakou (40.13%) and Fushun (29.02%). The significant ( P &lt; 0.01) value of global statistics R (0.943/94.3%) showed high species diversity recorded in Huailai followed by Zhangjiakou recorded by non-metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity between invaded and non-invaded plots. At the end it was concluded that the diversity indices reduced significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) in invaded quadrats indicated that native plant species become less diverse due to X . strumarium invasion. The degrees of X . strumarium invasion affected on species richness resulted to reduce diversity indices significantly in invaded quadrats."

Our ‘Kemeny indicator’ is the value of the Kemeny constant in the new graph that is obtained when a node is removed from the original graph. We show that testing individuals who are associated with large values of the Kemeny indicator can help in efficiently intercepting new virus outbreaks, when they are still in their early stage. Extensive simulations provide promising results in early identification and in blocking the possible ‘super-spreaders’ links that transmit disease between different communities."

Despite this fact, fungal microbiome (mycobiome) studies compared to the bacterial microbiome studies have remained neglected. In the present study, using metagenomic sequencing, the mycobiomes of the vitreous of healthy control individuals (VC, n = 15) and individuals with post fever retinitis + non-PFR uveitis (PFR+, n = 9) were analysed and compared. The results indicated that Ascomycota was the most predominant phylum in both VC and PFR+ groups. Further, at the genera level it was observed that the abundance of 17 fungal genera were significantly different in post fever retinitis (PFR, n = 6) group compared to control group. Of these 17 genera, it was observed that 14 genera were relatively more abundant in PFR group and the remaining 3 genera in the VC group. Genus Saccharomyces , a commensal of the gut and skin, was predominantly present in the vitreous of both the cohorts, however it was significantly less abundant in PFR group. Further, significant increase in the genera that have a pathogenic interaction with the host were observed in PFR group. On the whole the mycobiome in both the groups differed significantly and formed two distinct clusters in the heatmap and Principal co-ordinate analysis. These results demonstrate significant changes in the mycobiome from the vitreous of post fever retinitis patients compared to healthy controls thus implying that dysbiotic changes in the fungal vitreous microbiome are associated with PFR."
https://openalex.org/W3102165088,"Difficult airways can be managed with a range of devices, with video laryngoscopes (VLs) being the most common. The C-MAC ® Video-Stylet (VS; Karl-Storz Germany), a hybrid between a flexible and a rigid intubation endoscope, has been recently introduced. The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of the VS compared to a VL (C-MAC Macintosh blade, Karl-Storz Germany) with regards to the learning curve for each device and its ability to manage a simulated difficult airway manikin. This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, crossover study involving twenty-one anesthesia residents performing intubations on a Bill 1 ™ (VBM, Germany) airway manikin model. After a standardized introduction, six randomized attempts with VL and VS were performed on the manikin. This was followed by intubation in a simulated difficult airway (cervical collar and inflated tongue) with both devices in a randomized fashion. The primary end-point of this study was the total time to intubation. All continuous variables were expressed as the median [interquartile range] and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. A 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used to compare both devices at each trial. All reported p values are two sided. The median total time to intubation on a simulated difficult airway was faster with the VS compared to VL (17 [13.5–25] sec vs 23 [18.5–26.5] sec, respectively; 95% CI; P = 0.031). Additionally, on a normal airway manikin, the VS has a comparable learning curve to the VL. In this manikin-based study, the novel VS was comparable to the VL in terms of learning curve in a normal airway. In a simulated difficult airway, the total time to intubation, though likely not clinically relevant, was faster with the VS to the VL. However, given the above findings, this study justifies further human clinical trials with the VS to see if similar benefits–faster time to intubation and similar learning curve to VL–are replicated clinically."
https://openalex.org/W3103413267,"Trying to meet the Sustainable Development Goals is challenging. Food supply chains may have to become more efficient to meet the increasing food requirement of 10 Billion people by 2050. At the same time, food and nutrition security are at risk from increasingly likely shocks like extreme climate events, market shocks, pandemics, changing consumer preferences, and price volatility. Here we consider some possibilities and limitations regarding the improvement of resilience (the capacity to deal with shocks) and efficiency (here interpreted as the share of produced food delivered to consumers) of food supply chains. We employ an Agent Based Model of a generic food chain network consisting of stylized individuals representing producers, traders, and consumers. We do this: 1/ to describe the dynamically changing disaggregated flows of crop items between these agents, and 2/ to be able to explicitly consider agent behaviour. The agents have implicit personal objectives for trading. We quantify resilience and efficiency by linking these to the fraction of fulfilment of the overall explicit objective to have all consumers meet their food requirement. We consider different types of network structures in combination with different agent interaction types under different types of stylized shocks. We find that generally the network structures with higher efficiency are also more sensitive to shocks, while less efficient network types display more resilience. At first glance these results seem to confirm the existence of a system-level trade-off between resilience and efficiency similar to what is reported in business management and ecology literature. However, the results are modified by the trading interactions and the type of shock. In our simulations resilience and efficiency are affected by ‘soft’ boundaries caused by the preference and trust of agents (i.e., social aspects) in trading. The ability of agents to switch between trading partners represents an important aspect of resilience, namely a capacity to reorganize. These insights may be relevant when considering the reorganization of real-life food chains to increase their resilience to meet future food and nutrition security goals."

Multi-channel urodynamic studies provide information about bladder pressure and urinary flow but offer little insight into changes in bladder anatomy and detrusor muscle function. Here we present a novel method for real time MRI during bladder voiding. This was performed in a small cohort of healthy men and men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms (BPH/LUTS) to demonstrate proof of principle; The MRI urodynamic protocol was successfully implemented, and bladder wall displacement and urine flow dynamics were calculated. Displacement analysis on healthy controls showed the greatest bladder wall displacement in the dome of the bladder while men with BPH/LUTS exhibited decreased and asymmetric bladder wall motion. Computational fluid dynamics of voiding showed men with BPH/LUTS had larger recirculation regions in the bladder. This study demonstrates the feasibility of performing MRI voiding studies and their potential to provide new insight into lower urinary tract function in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3103568036,"Stellar mergers are a brief but common phase in the evolution of binary star systems1,2. These events have many astrophysical implications; for example, they may lead to the creation of atypical stars (such as magnetic stars3, blue stragglers4 and rapid rotators5), they play an important part in our interpretation of stellar populations6 and they represent formation channels of compact-object mergers7. Although a handful of stellar mergers have been observed directly8,9, the central remnants of these events were shrouded by an opaque shell of dust and molecules10, making it impossible to observe their final state (for example, as a single merged star or a tighter, surviving binary11). Here we report observations of an unusual, ring-shaped ultraviolet (‘blue’) nebula and the star at its centre, TYC 2597-735-1. The nebula has two opposing fronts, suggesting a bipolar outflow of material from TYC 2597-735-1. The spectrum of TYC 2597-735-1 and its proximity to the Galactic plane suggest that it is an old star, yet it has abnormally low surface gravity and a detectable long-term luminosity decay, which is uncharacteristic for its evolutionary stage. TYC 2597-735-1 also exhibits Hα emission, radial-velocity variations, enhanced ultraviolet radiation and excess infrared emission—signatures of dusty circumstellar disks12, stellar activity13 and accretion14. Combined with stellar evolution models, the observations suggest that TYC 2597-735-1 merged with a lower-mass companion several thousand years ago. TYC 2597-735-1 provides a look at an unobstructed stellar merger at an evolutionary stage between its dynamic onset and the theorized final equilibrium state, enabling the direct study of the merging process. Observations and stellar evolution models of a blue ring nebula and its central star (TYC 2597-735-1) suggest that the remnant star merged with a lower-mass companion several thousand years ago."
https://openalex.org/W3008063097,"Deficient myelination of the brain is associated with neurodevelopmental delays, particularly in high-risk infants, such as those born small in relation to their gestational age (SGA). New methods are needed to further study this condition. Here, we employ Color Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (cSLIM), which uses a brightfield objective and RGB camera to generate pathlength-maps with nanoscale sensitivity in conjunction with a regular brightfield image. Using tissue sections stained with Luxol Fast Blue, the myelin structures were segmented from a brightfield image. Using a binary mask, those portions were quantitatively analyzed in the corresponding phase maps. We first used the CLARITY method to remove tissue lipids and validate the sensitivity of cSLIM to lipid content. We then applied cSLIM to brain histology slices. These specimens are from a previous MRI study, which demonstrated that appropriate for gestational age (AGA) piglets have increased internal capsule myelination (ICM) compared to small for gestational age (SGA) piglets and that a hydrolyzed fat diet improved ICM in both. The identity of samples was blinded until after statistical analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3102041543,"Introduction Studies show trabecular bone score (TBS) may provide information regarding bone quality independent of bone mineral density (BMD) in type 2 diabetes (DM2) patients. We analyzed our Southeast Asian severe osteoporotic hip fracture patients to study these differences. Methods We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of subjects admitted to Changi General Hospital, Singapore with severe osteoporotic hip fractures from 2014–2017 who had BMD performed. Electronic records were reviewed and subjects were classified as having diabetes according to the WHO 2019 criteria. DM2 patients were classified according to their HbA1c into well controlled (HbA1c &lt; 7%) and poorly controlled (HbA1c ≥ 7%) DM2. Results Elderly patients with hip fractures present with average femur neck T scores at the osteoporotic range, however those with DM2 had higher BMD and TBS values compared to non DM2 patients. These differences were statistically significant in elderly women—poorly controlled elderly DM2 women with hip fracture had the highest total hip T-score (-2.57 ± 0.86) vs (-2.76 ± 0.96) in well controlled DM2 and (-3.09 ± 1.01) in non DM2 women with hip fracture, p &lt; 0.001. In contrast, TBS scores were lower in poorly controlled DM2 women with hip fracture compared to well controlled DM2 women with hip fracture (1.22 ± 0.11) vs (1.24 ± 0.09), but these were still significantly higher compared to non DM2 women with hip fracture (1.19 ± 0.10), p &lt; 0.001. In elderly men with hip fractures, univariate analysis showed no statistically significant differences in TBS or hip or LS BMD between those with poorly controlled DM2, well controlled DM2 and non DM2. The differences in TBS and BMD remained significant in all DM2 women with hip fractures even after adjustments for potential confounders. Differences in TBS and BMD in poorly controlled DM2 men with hip fractures only became significant after accounting for potential confounders. However, upon inclusion of LS BMD into the multivariate model these differences were attenuated and remained significant only between elderly women with well controlled DM2 and non DM2 women with hip fractures. Conclusions Elderly patients with DM2 and severe osteoporosis present with hip fractures at a higher BMD and TBS values compared to non DM2 patients. These differences were significant after adjustment for confounders in all DM2 women and poorly controlled DM2 men with hip fractures, TBS differences were attenuated with the inclusion LS BMD. Further studies are needed to ascertain differences in BMD and TBS in older Southeast Asian DM2 patients with variable glycemic control and severe osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W3104995885,"Introduction Voice rest following phonotrauma or phonosurgery has a considerable clinical impact, but clinical recommendations are inconsistent due to inconclusive data. As biopsies of the vocal folds (VF) for molecular biology studies in humans are unethical, we established a new in vitro model to explore the effects of vibration on human vocal fold fibroblasts (hVFF) in an inflammatory and normal state, which is based on previously published models. Methods By using a phonomimetic bioreactor we were able to apply predefined vibrational stress patterns on hVFF cultured under inflammatory or normal conditions. Inflammatory and pro-fibrotic stimuli were induced by interleukin (IL)1β and transforming growth factor (TGF)β1, respectively. Mechanical stimulation was applied four hours daily, over a period of 72 hours. Outcome measurements comprised assessment of extracellular matrix (ECM)-related components, angiogenic factors, and inflammatory and fibrogenic markers on gene expression and protein levels. Results Under inflammatory conditions, the inflammatory cytokine IL11, as well as the myofibroblast marker alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were significantly reduced when additional vibration was applied. The desirable anti-fibrotic ECM component hyaluronic acid was increased following cytokine treatment, but was not diminished following vibration. Conclusion Our experiments revealed the effect of vibrational stress on hVFF in an inflammatory state. Elevated levels of certain pro-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic factors could be mitigated by additional vibrational excitation in an in vitro setting. These findings corroborate clinical studies which recommend early voice activation following an acute event."
https://openalex.org/W3098651615,"Crown roots constitute the main part of the rice root system. Several key genes involved in crown root initiation and development have been identified by functional genomics approaches. Nevertheless, these approaches are impaired by functional redundancy and mutant lethality. To overcome these limitations, organ targeted transcriptome analysis can help to identify genes involved in crown root formation and early development. In this study, we generated an atlas of genes expressed in developing crown root primordia in comparison with adjacent stem cortical tissue at three different developmental stages before emergence, using laser capture microdissection. We identified 3975 genes differentially expressed in crown root primordia. About 30% of them were expressed at the three developmental stages, whereas 10.5%, 19.5% and 12.8% were specifically expressed at the early, intermediate and late stages, respectively. Sorting them by functional ontology highlighted an active transcriptional switch during the process of crown root primordia formation. Cross-analysis with other rice root development-related datasets revealed genes encoding transcription factors, chromatin remodeling factors, peptide growth factors, and cell wall remodeling enzymes that are likely to play a key role during crown root primordia formation. This atlas constitutes an open primary data resource for further studies on the regulation of crown root initiation and development."
https://openalex.org/W3101765164,"Telepresence robots allow users to be spatially and socially present in remote environments. Yet, it can be challenging to remotely operate telepresence robots, especially in dense environments such as academic conferences or workplaces. In this paper, we primarily focus on the effect that a speed control method, which automatically slows the telepresence robot down when getting closer to obstacles, has on user behaviors. In our first user study, participants drove the robot through a static obstacle course with narrow sections. Results indicate that the automatic speed control method significantly decreases the number of collisions. For the second study we designed a more naturalistic, conference-like experimental environment with tasks that require social interaction, and collected subjective responses from the participants when they were asked to navigate through the environment. While about half of the participants preferred automatic speed control because it allowed for smoother and safer navigation, others did not want to be influenced by an automatic mechanism. Overall, the results suggest that automatic speed control simplifies the user interface for telepresence robots in static dense environments, but should be considered as optionally available, especially in situations involving social interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3103990860,"Cognitive control efficiency is susceptible to the emotional state of an individual. The aim of the current experiment was to search for the role of valence and arousal of emotion-laden words in a performance efficiency of a modified emotional Stroop task (EST) combined with the flanker task. Both paradigms allow for the measurement of the interference control, but interference appears on different stages of stimulus processing. In the flanker task, the interference is perceptual, while in EST, it is based on the emotional meaning of stimuli. We expected to find the effects of emotionality of words, that is, arousal and valence levels, for interference measured with EST. In a series of two experiments, the results confirmed that a high arousal level enlarges the reaction latencies to the EST. We also identified interaction between valence and arousal in shaping reaction latencies. We found the flanker congruency effect. We did not find interactions between emotional factors and flanker congruency. This suggests that interference measured with the EST and flanker task are in fact different from one another, and while using the modified EST combined with the flanker task, the word-meaning effects do not interfere with pure perceptual interferences."
https://openalex.org/W3098474034,"Background Aligned with global childhood tuberculosis (TB) road map, Ethiopia developed its own in 2015. The key strategies outlined in the Ethiopian roadmap are incorporating TB screening in Integrated Maternal, Neonatal and Child Illnesses (IMNCI) clinic for children under five years (U5) and intensifying contact investigations at TB clinic. However, these strategies have never been evaluated. Objective To evaluate the integration of tuberculosis (TB) screening and contact investigation into Integrated Maternal, Neonatal and Child Illnesses (IMNCI) and TB clinics in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods The study used mixed methods with stepped-wedge design where 30 randomly selected health care facilities were randomized into three groups of 10 during August 2016-November 2017. The integration of TB screening into IMNCI clinic and contact investigation in TB clinic were introduced by a three-day childhood TB training for health providers. An in-depth interview was used to explore the challenges of the interventions and supplemented data on TB screening and contact investigation. Results Overall, 180896 children attended 30 IMNCI clinics and145444 (80.4%) were screened for TB. A total of 688 (0.4%) children had presumptive TB and 47(0.03%) had TB. During the pre-intervention period, 51873 of the 85278 children (60.8%) were screened for TB as compared to 93570 of the 95618 children (97.9%) in the intervention (p&lt;0.001). This had resulted in 149 (0.30%) and 539 (0.6%) presumptive TB cases in pre-intervention and intervention periods (p&lt;0.001), respectively. Also, nine TB cases (6.0%) in pre-intervention and 38 (7.1%) after intervention were identified (p = 0.72). In TB clinics, 559 under-five (U5) contacts were identified and 419 (80.1%) were screened. In all, 51(9.1%) presumed TB cases and 12 (2.1%) active TB cases were identified from the traced contacts. TB screening was done for 182 of the 275 traced contacts (66.2%) before intervention and for 237 of the 284 of the traced (83.5%) under intervention (p&lt;0.001). Isoniazid prevention therapy (IPT) was initiated for 69 of 163 eligible contacts (42.3%) before intervention and for 159 of 194 eligible children (82.0%) under intervention (p&lt;0.001). Over 95% of health providers indicated that the integration of TB screening into IMNCI and contact investigation in TB clinic is acceptable and practical. Gastric aspiration to collect sputum using nasogastric tube was reported to be difficult. Conclusions Integrating TB screening into IMNCI clinics and intensifying contact investigation in TB clinics is feasible improving TB screening, presumed TB cases, TB cases, contact screening and IPT coverage during the intervention period. Stool specimen could be non-invasive to address the challenge of sputum collection."
https://openalex.org/W3101061271,"Conflicting data exists as to whether vitamin D receptor agonists (VDRa) are protective of arterial calcification. Confounding this, is the inherent physiological differences between human and animal experimental models and our current fragmented understanding of arterial vitamin D metabolism, their alterations in disease states and responses to VDRa’s. Herein, the study aims to address these problems by leveraging frontiers in human arterial organ culture models. Human arteries were collected from a total of 24 patients (healthy controls, n = 12; end-stage CKD, n = 12). Cross-sectional and interventional studies were performed using arterial organ cultures treated with normal and calcifying (containing 5mmol/L CaCl 2 and 5mmol/L β-glycerophosphate) medium, ex vivo . To assess the role of VDRa therapy, arteries were treated with either calcitriol or paricalcitol. We found that human arteries express a functionally active vitamin D system, including the VDR, 1α-hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase (24-OHase) components and these were dysregulated in CKD arteries. VDRa therapy increased VDR expression in healthy arteries (p&lt;0.01) but not in CKD arteries. Arterial 1α-OHase (p&lt;0.05) and 24-OHase mRNA and protein expression were modulated differentially in healthy and CKD arteries by VDRa therapy. VDRa exposure suppressed Runx2 and MMP-9 expression in CKD arteries, however only paricalcitol suppressed MMP-2. VDRa exposure did not modulate arterial calcification in all organ culture models. However, VDRa reduced expression of senescence associated β-galactosidase (SAβG) staining in human aortic-smooth muscle cells under calcifying conditions, in vitro . In conclusion, maladaptation of arterial vitamin D signaling components occurs in CKD. VDRa exposure can exert vasculo-protective effects and seems critical for the regulation of arterial health in CKD."
https://openalex.org/W3101308911,"Using a multilevel model, this study examined emotion dysregulation as a mediator between dispositional mindfulness and mental health among Chinese emerging adults. Participants were 191 Chinese emerging adults (female = 172) between 18 and 27 years old ( M = 21.06 years, SD = 2.01 years), who completed a questionnaire that assessed their dispositional mindfulness, emotion dysregulation, and mental health outcomes for three times over 12 months, with a three-month lag between each time point. Within-person analysis revealed that emotion dysregulation mediated between dispositional mindfulness and mental health outcomes, including subjective well-being and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Time was positively associated with emotion dysregulation and negatively associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Between-person analysis revealed that emotion dysregulation negatively mediated between dispositional mindfulness and symptoms of depression and anxiety, but not subjective well-being. These findings call attention to within-person versus between-person effects of emotion dysregulation as a mediator between dispositional mindfulness and psychological outcomes, particularly of symptoms of depression and anxiety. Attesting to the relations established in western societies, the relations are also applicable to emerging adults in the Chinese context. Evidence was thus advanced to inform translational research efforts that promote mindfulness and emotion regulation as assets of mental health."
https://openalex.org/W3104323208,"Objective Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention (PP) of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) are well-established but underutilized globally. The Improve SCA study has identified a cohort of patients called 1.5 primary prevention (1.5PP) based on PP patients with the presence of certain risk factors. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ICD therapy compared to no ICD among the PP population and the subset of 1.5PP patients in Taiwan. Methods A Markov model was run over a lifetime time horizon from the Taiwan payer perspective. Mortality and utility estimates were obtained from the literature (PP) and the IMPROVE SCA trial (1.5PP). Cost inputs were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA), Ministry of Health and Welfare. We used a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of NT$2,100,000, as established through standard WTP research methods and in alignment with World Health Organization recommendations. Results The total discounted costs for ICD therapy and no ICD therapy were NT$1,664,259 and NT$646,396 respectively for PP, while they were NT$2,410,603 and NT$905,881 respectively for 1.5PP. Total discounted QALYs for ICD therapy and no ICD therapy were 6.48 and 4.98 respectively for PP, while they were 10.78 and 7.71 respectively for 1.5PP. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was NT$708,711 for PP and NT$441,153 for 1.5PP, therefore ICD therapy should be considered cost effective for PP and highly cost effective for 1.5PP. Conclusions ICD therapy compared to no ICD therapy is cost-effective in the whole PP population and highly cost-effective in the subset 1.5PP population in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W3104914596,"Introduction Preoperative nasal decolonization of surgical patients with nasal povidone-iodine (PI) has potential to eliminate pathogenic organisms responsible for surgical site infections. However, data on implementation of PI for quality improvement in clinical practice is limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation feasibility, fidelity and acceptability of intranasal PI solution application by surgical nurses using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) conceptual framework. Materials and methods Using the i-PARIHS framework to frame questions and guide interview content areas, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews of pre- and post-operative care nurses in two facilities. We analyzed the data using deductive content analysis to evaluate nurses’ experience and perceptions on preoperative intranasal PI solution decolonization implementation. Open coding was used to analyze the data to ensure all relevant information was captured. Results Each facility adopted a different quality improvement implementation strategy. The mode of facilitation, training, and educational materials provided to the nurses varied by facility. Barriers identified included lack of effective communication, insufficient information and lack of systematic implementation protocol. Action taken to mitigate some of the barriers included a collaboration between the study team and nurses to develop a systematic written protocol. The training assisted nurses to systematically follow the implementation protocol smoothly to ensure PI administration compliance, and to meet the goal of the facilities. Nurses’ observations and feedback showed that PI did not cause any adverse effects on patients. Conclusions We found that PI implementation was feasible and acceptable by nurses and could be extended to other facilities. However further studies are required to ensure standardization of PI application."
https://openalex.org/W3105832239,"Children seek and like to engage in collaborative activities with their peers. This social motivation is hypothesized to facilitate their emerging social-cognitive skills and vice versa. Current evidence on the ontogeny of social motivation and its’ links to social cognition, however, is subject to a sampling bias toward participants from urban Western populations. Here, we show both cross-cultural variation and homogeneity in three- to eight-year-old children’s expressed positive emotions during and explicit preferences for peer collaboration across three diverse populations (urban German, rural Hai||om/Namibia, rural Ovambo/Namibia; n = 240). Children expressed more positive emotions during collaboration as compared to individual activity, but the extent varied across populations. Children’s preferences for collaboration differed markedly between populations and across ages: While German children across all ages sought collaboration, Hai||om children preferred to act individually throughout childhood. Ovambo children preferred individual play increasingly with age. Across populations, positive emotions expressed selectively during collaboration, predicted children’s social-cognitive skills. These findings provide evidence that culture shapes young children’s social motivation for dyadic peer collaboration. At the same time, the positive relation of social motivation and social cognition in early ontogeny appears cross-culturally constant."
https://openalex.org/W3100846343,"Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are members of the mitochondrial anion carrier superfamily that can mediate the transfer of protons into the mitochondrial matrix from the intermembrane space. We have previously reported UCP3 expression in thymocytes, mitochondria of total splenocytes and splenic lymphocytes. Here, we demonstrate that Ucp3 is expressed in peripheral naive CD4 + T cells at the mRNA level before being markedly downregulated following activation. Non-polarized, activated T cells (Th0 cells) from Ucp3 -/- mice produced significantly more IL-2, had increased expression of CD25 and CD69 and were more proliferative than Ucp3 +/+ Th0 cells. The altered IL-2 expression observed between T cells from Ucp3 +/+ and Ucp3 -/- mice may be a factor in determining differentiation into Th17 or induced regulatory (iTreg) cells. When compared to Ucp3 +/+ , CD4 + T cells from Ucp3 -/- mice had increased FoxP3 expression under iTreg conditions. Conversely, Ucp3 -/- CD4 + T cells produced a significantly lower concentration of IL-17A under Th17 cell-inducing conditions in vitro . These effects were mirrored in antigen-specific T cells from mice immunized with KLH and CT. Interestingly, the altered responses of Ucp3 -/- T cells were partially reversed upon neutralisation of IL-2. Together, these data indicate that UCP3 acts to restrict the activation of naive T cells, acting as a rheostat to dampen signals following TCR and CD28 co-receptor ligation, thereby limiting early activation responses. The observation that Ucp3 ablation alters the Th17:Treg cell balance in vivo as well as in vitro suggests that UCP3 is a potential target for the treatment of Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3105898173,"In 2008 the National Institutes of Health established the Research, Condition and Disease Categorization Database (RCDC) that reports the amount spent by NIH institutes for each disease. Its goal is to allow the public “to know how the NIH spends their tax dollars,” but it has been little used. The RCDC for 2018 was used to assess 428 schizophrenia-related research projects funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. Three senior psychiatrists independently rated each on its likelihood (“likely”, “possible”, “very unlikely”) of improving the symptoms and/or quality of life for individuals with schizophrenia within 20 years. At least one reviewer rated 386 (90%), and all three reviewers rated 302 (71%), of the research projects as very unlikely to provide clinical improvement within 20 years. Reviewer agreement for the “very unlikely” category was good; for the “possible” category was intermediate; and for the “likely” category was poor. At least one reviewer rated 30 (7%) of the research projects as likely to provide clinical improvement within 20 years. The cost of the 30 projects was 5.5% of the total NIMH schizophrenia-related portfolio or 0.6% of the total NIMH budget. Study results confirm previous 2016 criticisms that the NIMH schizophrenia-related research portfolio disproportionately underfunds clinical research that might help people currently affected. Although the results are preliminary, since the RCDC database has not previously been used in this manner and because of the subjective nature of the assessment, the database would appear to be a useful tool for disease advocates who wish to ascertain how NIH spends its public funds."

In this study, C57 mice were treated with RCO for 34 weeks. Organ coefficients of the liver, stomach, and kidney were found to be decreased. H&E staining revealed overt lesions in the pancreas, liver, kidney, esophagus, duodenum, and ileum of RCO-treated mice. Immunohistochemistry showed significant DNA damage in the duodenum and ileum and apoptosis in the lungs of the RCO-treated mice. Immunoblotting showed elevated levels of γ-H2AX, Bcl-2/Bax, TNFα, cleaved Caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and decreased levels of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were also detected. These findings suggest that long-term consumption of RCO produces various toxicities in mice with important implications for humans. DNA damage followed by mitochondria-associated apoptosis, and necrosis is likely to contribute to the toxicities."
https://openalex.org/W3102614980,"The present study aimed to adapt the Attitudes Toward Accompanied Driving Scale (ATADS) to a Chinese drivers sample and to examine its reliability and validity. Five hundred and seventy-two drivers aged 18 to 25 years old were asked to complete the ATADS and a validated Chinese version of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory. The factorial structure of the ATADS was examined using exploratory factor analysis ( N = 259) and confirmatory factor analysis ( N = 313). The validity of the scale was evaluated by examining the associations between the ATADS factors, demographic variables and driving styles. The results showed that both the findings of the EFA and CFA showed a five-factor structure of the ATADS, including tension, relatedness, avoidance, disapproval and anxiety. Second, significant gender differences were found in tension, relatedness, avoidance and anxiety. Third, tension, avoidance, disapproval and anxiety were moderately or weakly correlated with risky, anxious, angry and careful driving styles. Moreover, the number of traffic accidents after the accompanying phase was positively correlated with disapproval and avoidance. The findings supported the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the ATADS and highlighted the adverse effects of young drivers’ negative attitudes toward accompanied driving on their driving styles."
https://openalex.org/W3103842695,"The previous genetic characterization of the honeybee population of Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean) revealed an ongoing process of hybridization between the first established African subspecies Apis mellifera unicolor and recently imported European subspecies ( A . m . ligustica , A . m . carnica and A . m . mellifera ). This context offers the rare opportunity to explore the influence of hybridization between African and European honeybees on phenotypic traits out of the case largely studied of the Africanized honeybee (hybrid between A . m . scutellata from South Africa and European subspecies). We thus conducted geometric morphometric analyses on forewings of 283 workers genetically characterized at 14 microsatellite loci to evaluate (1) if the morphological variability coincides well with the neutral genetic variability, (2) if hybrids exhibited rather parental, intermediate or transgressive traits, and (3) to test if fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of size and shape, as a measure of developmental stability, was elevated in hybrids (due to genetic stress) and/or European bees (due to unsuitable environment) compared to African bees. A strong concordance was found between morphological variability and neutral genetic variability, especially for wing shape, based on partial least-square analyses (PLS). However, on average, the morphology of hybrids was more similar to the African bees, potentially reflecting the dynamics and direction of introgression. Significant FA for wing size as well as wing shape was detected, suggesting the overall presence of stress during the development of the studied individuals. In contrast, the asymmetry levels do not differ according to the ancestry (African, European or hybrid) of the individuals. Therefore, if ongoing hybridization contributed to increasing the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the populations and influences its adaptive potential, developmental stressors could not be identified and their evolutionary consequences remain uncertain."
