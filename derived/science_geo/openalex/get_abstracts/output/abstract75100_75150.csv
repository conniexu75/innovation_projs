https://openalex.org/W2002140212,"These observations indicate that the long-lasting trace of an experience is not completely fixed, consolidated, or coded at the time of the experience. Consolidation requires time, and under at least some circumstances the processes of consolidation appear to be susceptible to a variety of influences- both facilitating and impairing- several hours after the experience. There must be, it seems, more than one kind of memory trace process (31). If permanent memory traces consolidate slowly over time, then other processes must provide a temporary basis for memory while consolidation is occurring. The evidence clearly indicates that trial-to-trial improvement, or learning, in animals cannot be based completely on permanent memory storage. Amnesia can be produced by electroshock and drugs even if the animals are given the treatment long after they have demonstrated ""learning"" of the task. Of particular interest is the finding that retention of the inhibitory avoidance response increases with time. In a sense this should be expected, for it has long been known (and ignored) that, within limits, learning is facilitated by increasing the interval between repeated trials (7, 30). Our result may be the simplest case of such an effect. Since the improvement in retention with time seemed not to be due solely to consolidation (as indicated by electroshock effects), it would seem that the ""distribution of practice"" effect, as it is typically designated, may be due in part to a time-dependent temporary memory storage process. In our work with animals we have found no analog of human immediate memory such as that required for repeating digits (or finishing sentences). Animals tested immediately on the task described above after a trial typically showed no evidence of memory. It could be that the poor performance is due to excessive fright, but the ""distribution of practice effect"" is also typically observed in learning experiments in which food reward is used rather than shock avoidance. Since the retention tasks require the animals to change their behavior in some way, it could well be that the growth of retention over the first few minutes after a trial is due to time dependent processes involved in the organization of processes necessary for changing behavior, in addition to those involved in temporary storage and retrieval. It is worth pointing out that there is evidence of an analogous process in human memory (32). A complex picture of memory storage is emerging. There may be three memory trace systems: one for immediate memory (and not studied in our laboratory); one for short-term memory which develops within a few seconds or minutes and lasts for several hours; and one which consolidates slowly and is relatively permanent. The nature of the durability of the longterm memory trace (that is, the nature and basis of forgetting) is a separate but important issue. There is increasing evidence and speculation (20, 21, 33) that memory storage requires a ""tritrace"" system, and our findings are at least consistent with such a view. If there are, as seems possible, at least three kinds of traces involved in memory storage, how are they related? Is permanent memory produced by activity of temporary traces (31), or are the trace systems relatively independent? Although available findings do not provide an answer to this question, there does seem to be increasing evidence that the systems are independent. Acquisition can occur, as we have seen, without permanent consolidation, and both short-term and long-term memory increase with time. All this evidence suggests (but obviously does not prove) that each experience triggers activity in each memory system. Each repeated training trial may, according to this view, potentiate short-term processes underlying acquisition while simultaneously enhancing independent underlying long-term consolidation. Obviously, acceptance of these conclusions will require additional research. If this view is substantially correct, it seems clear that any search for the engram or the basis of memory is not going to be successful. Recognition of the possibility that several independent processes may be involved at different stages of memory may help to organize the search. A careful examination of the time course of retention and memory trace consolidation, as well as examination of the bases of the effects of memory-impairing and memory-facilitating treatments, may help to guide the search. It is clear that a complete theory of memory storage must eventually provide an understanding of time-dependent processes in memory. In 1930 Lashley wrote (2), ""The facts of both psychology and neurology show a degree of plasticity, of organization, and of adaptation and behavior which is far beyond any present possibility of explanation."" Although this conclusion is still valid, the current surge of interest in memory storage offers hope that this conclusion may soon need to be modified."
https://openalex.org/W1989456830,"The synthesis of bacterial protein in the rumen of lactating cows fed on purified carbohydrates, with urea and ammonium salts as the sole sources of nitrogen, can be increased, through feed adaptation, to a level adequate not only for the maintenance of the cow but also for a relatively high milk production. The best annual milkyield per cow on the experimental feedhas, so far, been 4217 kilograms, calculated as standard milk (684 kilocalories per kilogram of milk). The composition of the test milk is similar to that of normal fat- and proteinrich milk. Fractionation of casein and serum proteins of test milk and normal milk by different methods demonstrated the similarity of the proteins of the two milks. The normal or higher concentrations of the water-solublevitamins in test milk show that the biosynthesis of these vitamins in the rumen is vigorous. The flavor of the two milks is very similar-proof that biosynthesis of the effective flavor compounds of milk occurs in the body of the cow. The only component of test milk whose composition, when small amounts of vegetable oil have been fed, has differed from that of normal milk is the fat. The studies of milk production on the experimental feed have opened up new possibilities for investigating the biosynthesis of different milk components. The studies are also of practical importance: Since the vigorous biosynthesis of proteins from simple nitrogen compounds in the rumen of test-feed-adapted cows has been demonstrated, there are greater possibilities for studying the replacement of protein by urea. In countries where there are plenty of forests, part of the feed of cows can be made up of certain wood products-for instance, hemicellulose and cellulose of low quality. The new findings may also be of value in the dry areas of the globe, where milk would be of vital significance for improving the nutrition of the population."

https://openalex.org/W1964833831,"Horizontal cells in the retinas of cats and rabbits are morphologically similar; in both species, two types can be distinguished in Golgistained material. Horizontal cells and their processes are readily recognized in electron micrographs, and many of the horizontal cell processes appear to make synaptic contacts with dendrites and somata of bipolar cells, and probably with other horizontal cells. The synapses of the horizontal cell appear similar to chemical synaptic contacts described throughout the nervous system. With the finding of synaptic contacts, it seems clear that retinal horizontal cells should be classified as neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2093633151,"Although all tissues and organs of the body are normally subject to the growth-regulating influences of functional demands, some are potentially capable of unlimited growth while others are not. This depends on whether hyperplasia of their functional units ceases prior to maturity or can continue throughout life. In the former case, further growth is limited by the extent to which hypertrophy can enhance physiological efficiency. Some of the body's most vitally essential organs (heart, brain, kidney, lung) lack the ability to make additional structural units in the adult and are therefore handicapped in compensating for the depreciations of advancing age. Theoretically, at least, other organs (glands, renewing tissues) possess unlimited powers of regeneration because they never lose the capacity (latent or expressed) for hyperplasia. There is a strategy in the way growth mechanisms have evolved. It may be significant that the so-called ""hypertrophic"" organs lose the capability for hyperplasia, because not to do so might jeopardize their growth regulation. If size is determined by functional demands, then the latter must not operate continuously lest growth go on without interruption and lead to overproduction of functional units. Only renewing tissues can tolerate perpetual growth because they get rid of excess structures as fast as they are formed. Endocrine and exocrine glands are in most cases known to function discontinuously and are thus not in danger of being overstimulated. The heart, lungs, and kidneys (and brain?), however, must work incessantly. Were their functional units capable of hyperplasia and at the same time subject to control by functional demand, then overgrowth would seem to be inevitable. By giving up the potential for hyperplasia in favor of the necessity for constant function, these organs have adopted a strategy that enables them to become hypertrophic to a limited extent while doing their jobs efficiently. It is a curious fact that the unrestricted proliferation of biological structures cannot occur at all levels of organization. The counterpart of cancer, which is a cellular phenomenon, does not exist among molecules or cytoplasmic organelles, nor is it known to occur at the histological level of organization. Even in organs made up of histological units of function and having the potential for unlimited hyperplasia (for example, liver, exocrine glands, thyroid, ovary), the population of functional units never exceeds the number needed to fulfil the physiological requirements of the body. Above and below the level of the cell, therefore, structures are not permitted to escape the constraints of functional demands which control their production. The fact that cells can occasionally do so when they become neoplastic may reveal as much as it conceals about the problem of growth regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2084708773,"The relative effectiveness of changes in orientation and shape in producing perceptual grouping has been stuidied using a method based on threshold judgments. Statistical analyses of the threshold vallues show that rotating some of the figures in afield from a vertical position to a slant of 45 degrees facilitates segregating the field into separate perceptual groups. In contrast, changes in the shape or orientation of these figures, which leave their component lines vertical and hlorizontal, do not reliably aid grouipinig. The results also suggest that the simli-larity of the figures comtposing the field is not a good predictor of the degree to which the figures will cohere to form distinct perceptual groups."

Serologic activity appeared after irradiation of DNA at 270 mmicro and decreased upon irradiation at 235 mmicro. The antigenic determinants of the ultraviolet-treated DNA appear to be photoproducts associated primarily with thymine, as measured by direct dependence of serologic activity on the adenine-thymine content of the DNA, and by inhibition of the Serlolgic reaction by the irradiated di-,tri-,and tetra-(thymidine-5'-phosphate nucleotides."

These molecules associate with themselves, but from stronger complexes with each other. Earlier work showed that a similar association occurs between derivatives of adenine and of uracil. A study of all possible interactions of these purines and pyrimidines as pairs shows that guanosine and cytidine and adenine and uracil are the only associating, mixed dimer pairs. These interactions thus reinforce the geometrical specificity seen in the two-stranded nucleic acids."

Morpho logically these sites appear to be focal and to consist of an approximation of the plasma membranes of adjacent cells to within approximately 200 A. In the region of approximation both the extracellular space and the cytoplasm adjacent to the plasmalemma are increased in density. We have postulated a role for these sites in the maintenance of structural integrity."

When the gel plate was stained, galactose-6-phos phate being used as a substrate, this enzyme band stained intensely, but the sex-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydro genase failed to stain.

https://openalex.org/W2037803089,"Rabbit antiserums directed against a purified protein obtained from the catecholamine storage vesicles of the adrenal medulla of the cow were used to study the mechanism of secretion from the adrenal medulla. During secretion evoked by acetylcholine in isolated perfused adrenal glands, catecholamines and the specific intravesicular protein were released in relative amounts comparable to those present in the intact gland. Thus catecholamines are apparently released from the storage vesicles by a process resembling reverse pinocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W2070590620,"Electroconvulsive shock, administered for 5 to 7 days, reduced the daily rapid eye movement sleep time of seven cats to as little as 28 percent of base line levels. After day 4, eye movements during periods of cortical activation without tonic electromyographic activity were greatly reduced. Although partially deprived of rapid eye movements for as long as 7 days, the cats showed no compensatory rise in rapid eye movement time during the recovery period, but controls equally deprived gave significant rebounds. Rapid eye movement time of anesthetized cats was not affected by current that usually produces convulsions; it was lowered in animals convulsed with metrazol, but the same dosage of this drug, administered so as to avoid convulsions, had little effect. It appears that some aspect of the convulsion is responsible for lowering the rapid eye movement time."

https://openalex.org/W2153867305,Inhibition of rat brain acetylcholinesterase by 32 P-sarin in vivo results initially in 32 P-isopropylmethylphosphonylated enzyme. The percentage of inhibited enzyme that could not be reactivated by pyridinium aldoxime methochloride (aged enzyme) approximated the amount of radioactivity identified as 32 P-methylphosphonate. The 32 P-isopropyl methylphosphonate not released from the inhibited enzyme by the oxime accounted for 51 ± 10 percent (standard deviation) of the radioactivity fixed to brain tissue. It showed no correlation with aging and was probably bound to sites other than acetylcholinesterase.
