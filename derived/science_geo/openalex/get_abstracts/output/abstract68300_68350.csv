https://openalex.org/W1606146524,"Abstract Eighty per cent of the proteoglycan of bovine nasal cartilage can be recovered in a purified preparation known as proteoglycan subunit; the preparation contains 87% chondroitin sulfate, 6% keratan sulfate, and 7% protein. The physical properties of proteoglycan subunit are not affected by exposure to 4 m guanidinium chloride, to reducing agents, or to pH 2.7. Proteoglycan subunit contains a single class of macromolecules. However, the macromolecules are polydisperse because they exhibit a continuous distribution of sedimentation coefficients. At infinite dilution, 80% of the molecules have sedimentation velocities in 0.5 m guanidinium chloride between 15 and 35 S, with a weight average of 25 S. The macromolecules occupy large, approximately spherical domains in solution; as much as 55 ml of solvent is entrained per g of solute. Combined rheological and centrifugal analyses suggest that the molecular weight polydispersity of proteoglycan subunit is closely approximated by a Gaussian curve with a mean of 2.5 x 106 and a standard deviation of 1.2 x 106. A method is described by which the macromolecules of proteoglycan subunit can be partitioned into three major fractions with approximate average molecular weights of 1.8, 2.5, and 3.0 x 106. In 0.5 m guanidinium chloride, the limiting viscosity numbers of these fractions vary only as the 0.2 power of their molecular weight, a consequence of the fact that the macromolecules are highly branched polymers. Analyses of these fractions suggest that the proteoglycan subunit contains only one type of protein and that polydispersity is the result primarily of differences in the number of chondroitin sulfate chains attached to the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1535201878,"Abstract A method has been devised for the isolation of β-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase from jack bean meal in electrophoretically homogeneous and crystalline form. The procedure involves ammonium sulfate and alcohol fractionation followed by Sephadex G-200 filtration and chromatography on columns of DEAE-Sephadex and carboxymethyl-Sephadex. The molecular weight of this enzyme is estimated to be about 100,000 by gel filtration. The crystalline enzyme hydrolyzes both p-nitrophenyl β-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl β-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactopyranoside. For p-nitrophenyl β-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-dglucopyranoside, the pH optimum is between 5.0 and 6.0, Km is 0.64 mm and Vmax is 137.2 µmoles per min per mg. For p-nitrophenyl β-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactopyranoside, the pH optimum is between 3.5 and 4.0, Km is 0.31 mm and Vmax is 70.9 µmoles per min per mg. Studies of pH and thermal inactivation, mixed-substrate analysis, and the Ki values for several competitive inhibitors indicate that the β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and the β-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activities are catalyzed by the same enzyme at the same site. The crystalline enzyme liberates β-linked terminal N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine from various natural and synthetic substrates."

There is a concomitant reduction (50 percent) in aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase but not in tyrosine hydroxylase activity. A possible relation of this central catecholamine deficiency to the hypertension is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1762028152,"Abstract The galactosyl acceptor specificity of the highly purified A protein (galactosyltransferase) isolated from bovine milk was examined in the absence and presence of α-lactalbumin. α-Lactalbumin inhibits the transfer of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine but does not appreciably inhibit the transfer to oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine and other β-1,4 linked glycosides such as cellobiose, cellobiulose (glucosyl-β-1,4-fructose), β-d-methylglucose, glucosyl-β-1,4-mannose, indoxyl-β-d-glucose, and ovalbumin. α-Glycosides are poor substrates in the presence of α-lactalbumin but are not substrates in its absence. The biosynthesis of lactose and the formulation of the Gal-β-1,4-GlcNAc linkage in the carbohydrate side chain of glycoproteins are compatible and are carried out by the same galactosyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1567297335,"Abstract The number of goblet cells in the small intestine decreased in the vitamin A-deficient rat. Incorporation of 14C-d-glucosamine into a fucose-containing glycopeptide declined markedly. Ultracentrifugation of this glycopeptide in H2O gave only a single component, with a sedimentation value of 3.6 S, whereas, in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) two components appeared, with much higher sedimentation constants (6.2 S and 7.2 S). The glycopeptide was found to contain glucosamine, galactose, fucose, and sialic acid in the molar ratios of 3:3:1:0.25, respectively. Synthesis of the fucose-containing glycopeptide in vitro, using uridine-diphosphate-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-14C and 3H-serine, showed a 2- to 3-fold decrease in the incorporation of the labels by rough endoplasmic reticulum prepared from vitamin A-deficient animals as compared with normal animals."
https://openalex.org/W1555140230,"Abstract Seven metabolites were isolated by reversed phase partition chromatography and thin layer chromatography after incubation of tritium-labeled prostaglandin E2 with the soluble fraction of homogenates of guinea pig liver. The two major compounds (forming about 61% of the recovered radioactivity) were identified as 11α,15-dihydroxy-9-ketoprost-5-enoic acid and 11α-hydroxy-9,15-diketoprost-5-enoic acid. Three compounds (together about 26% of the recovered radioactivity) belonged to the F series of prostaglandins, and were identified as prostaglandin F2α, 9α,11α,15-trihydroxyprost-5-enoic acid, and 9α,11α-dihydroxy-15-keto-prost-5-enoic acid. The isolation of these compounds after incubation of prostaglandin E2 for the first time showed that prostaglandin Fα compounds can be formed from prostaglandin E compounds in animal tissue. Two minor compounds (together about 5% of the recovered radioactivity) were identified as 8-isoprostaglandin E2 and, tentatively, 8-isoprostaglandin F2α."
https://openalex.org/W1648643595,"Abstract The molar extinction coefficient at 390 nm of Clostridium acidi-urici ferredoxin was determined by three independent methods: dry weight determination, amino acid analysis, and amino acid release by carboxypeptidase A treatment. The value of e390 based on the latter method is 30,600 m-1 cm-1. The content of iron was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and the content of sulfide was determined from the amount of 35S-sulfide incorporated into ferredoxin in the reconstitution from apoferredoxin. Ferredoxin was found to contain 8 moles of both iron and sulfide."

A galactosyl hydrolase deficiency was demonstrated by the inability to cleave lactosyl ceramide labeled with tritium in the terminal galactose. The enzyme deficiency may be the primary cause of this previously unreported sphingolipidosis."
https://openalex.org/W1560174874,"Abstract 2-Carboxy-d-ribitol 1,5-diphosphate, an analogue of the proposed six-carbon intermediate in the reaction catalyzed by d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase, is a potent inhibitor of this enzyme. Tight binding of 2-carboxy-d-ribitol 1,5-diphosphate to d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase is observed only in the presence of divalent metal ions, e.g. Mn2+, Mg2+. The complex formed contains equimolar amounts of inhibitor and divalent metal ion when isolated by gel filtration. The extent of tight binding observed is dependent on the time of preliminary incubation prior to filtration. A similar increase in the extent of tight binding is observed on prolonged incubation of d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase with 14C-d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate, Mg2+ (or Mn2+), KHCO3, glutathione, and cyanide. The complex formed contains equimolar amounts of 14C-d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate and divalent metal ion. In several instances the maximal extent of tight binding of 2-carboxy-d-ribitol 1,5-diphosphate and of d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate (in the presence of cyanide) as estimated by gel filtration approximates the total number of binding sites for these ligands as estimated by ultrafiltration. These studies suggest a role for the divalent metal ion in formation or stabilization of the six-carbon intermediate which may result from condensation of d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate and CO2. The bound Cu2+ present in d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase has been removed by incubation with cyanide. The copper-free enzyme readily rebinds Cu2+. No significant kinetic or structural differences are observed between the native and the copper-free enzymes. Both enzyme species form the enzyme-d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate-cyanide ternary complex (Wishnick, M., and Lane, M. D., J. Biol. Chem., 244, 55 (1969)). Important differences are, however, observed in the extent and properties of the tight binding of 2-carboxy-d-ribitol 1,5-diphosphate and of d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate plus cyanide. Divalent metal ion is not required for binding of 2-carboxyribitol 1,5-diphosphate to the copper-free enzyme and, in most instances, the extent of binding of these ligands is greater for the copper-free as compared with the native enzyme. These studies suggest that the bound copper is involved in maintenance of a particular conformation of d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W2005143217,"Female parasitic insects in the genera Pleolophus, Endasys, and Mastrus (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) search the ground cover for hosts and avoid areas they have already inspected. Females respond to their own trail odor, and recognition occurs also between conspecific, congeneric, and intergeneric individuals. This is the first direct evidence for recognition between parasitoids at sites other than on the host itself, and between females of different species."
https://openalex.org/W1503562962,"Abstract Diketopiperazines have been used as a model system to evaluate the factors determining the shapes and intensities of the near ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) bands of the tyrosyl and tryptophanyl moieties in proteins. Cooling to 140°K or below brings out fine structure CD bands in all of the diketopiperazines examined. Studies with c-Gly-l-Tyr, c-l-Val-l-Tyr, and c-l-Phe-l-Tyr confirm that the tyrosyl 1lb CD spectrum normally has about the same shape as the absorption spectrum. The CD spectra of c-l-Tyr-l-Tyr, however, are somewhat distorted, because of a small exciton CD contribution superimposed on the normal tyrosyl CD spectrum. The shapes of the tryptophanyl CD bands cannot be determined as precisely due to overlap of the 1la and 1lb electronic bands. Nevertheless, the relative heights of the two major 1lb bands are similar in the CD spectra of c-Gly-l-Trp, c-l-Phe-l-Trp, c-l-Val-l-Trp, and c-d-Val-l-Trp. In the c-l-Trp-l-Trp CD spectra, however, a different ratio of 1lb intensities is observed, suggesting that c-l-Trp-l-Trp may also have a small exciton CD contribution. The tyrosyl and tryptophanyl 1lb fine structure CD bands evident at low temperature can be identified in the same diketopiperazine when these bands are much more intense than the 1la tryptophanyl bands, as is the case for c-l-Trp-l-Tyr. The identification is not as feasible when the 1lb intensities are low, as occurs in c-d-Trp-l-Tyr. The CD intensities are enhanced greatly in those diketopiperazines having two aromatic residues with the l configuration. This enhancement seems to result from coupling of the 1lb electronic transition in either a tyrosyl or tryptophanyl moiety with the far ultraviolet transitions in the second aromatic side chain. Conformational equilibria were examined by cooling the diketopiperazines. The increase in CD intensity upon cooling is much less for the diketopiperazines than for the noncyclic, monomeric tyrosine and tryptophan derivatives. This finding confirms that the diketopiperazines have fewer conformers than do the noncyclic derivatives. For diketopiperazines containing only a single aromatic residue, the conformer with the aromatic side chain folded over the diketopiperazine ring is dominant even at room temperature. In diketopiperazines having 2 aromatic residues with the l configuration, the most stable conformer has both aromatic side chains sharing the space over the diketopiperazine ring."
https://openalex.org/W1589952089,"Abstract Peroxisomes from spinach leaves contain three aminotransferases, a glutamate-glyoxylate, a serine-pyruvate and an aspartate aminotransferase. Five other enzymes previously described in leaf peroxisomes were measured, namely, catalase, glycolate oxidase, NADH-hydroxypyruvate reductase, and NAD-malate dehydrogenase. A NADPisocitrate dehydrogenase was also associated with isolated leaf peroxisomes, but its specific activity was much less than the other enzyme. Most of the NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was soluble. Serine-pyruvate aminotransferase activity in the particulate fraction was localized entirely in the peroxisomes. Isoenzymes of asparate aminotransferase were found in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. The activities of the chloroplast and mitochondrial forms of this aminotransferase were greater than the peroxisomal isoenzyme. The two peroxisomal serine-pyruvate and aspartate aminotransferases were separated by disc electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The aminotransferases had different substrate specificity. Other enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with the exception of an isoenzyme of NAD-malate dehydrogenase, were detected in mitochondria but not in the leaf peroxisomal fractions. Enzymes for the reductive amination of α-keto acids, the interconversion of C4 and C3 acids, hydroxyaspartate dehydratase, and the α and β oxidation systems for fatty acids could not be detected in leaf peroxisomes. Preliminary evidence is presented for a malate synthase in leaf mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1566733503,"Abstract The inhibition of reduced bovine milk xanthine oxidase by 4-hydroxypyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (4-HPP) and 4,6-dihydroxypyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (4,6-diHPP) is stoichiometric or titrating in type, i.e. the inhibition is virtually complete (g90%) at concentrations of inhibitor equimolar with that of the enzyme. The dissociation constant of the reduced enzyme-4,6-diHPP complex, determined by the method of Easson and Stedman (Proc. Roy. Soc. Ser. B Biol. Sci., 121, 142 (1936)), is 5.4 x 10-10 m. No decrease in the fractional inhibition is detectable on increasing the substrate concentration from 0.04 to 0.33 mm, or on 10-fold dilution of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The inhibitory properties of 4-HPP are virtually identical with those of 4,6-diHPP; this identity in behavior is the result of the conversion of 4-HPP to 4,6-diHPP by the enzyme. The rate of development of 4,6-diHPP inhibition is markedly temperature-dependent, more than 2 hours being required to reach maximal inhibition at 2°, but less than 1 min at 40°. The time required to reach maximal inhibition is not decreased by increasing the 4,6-diHPP level 100-fold, from 28 mµm to 2.8 µm; the inhibition appears, therefore, to be caused, not by the enzyme-inhibitor complex initially formed, but to a subsequent internal rearrangement of the latter to a less readily dissociable form."
https://openalex.org/W1554490272,"Abstract Purified thrombins are isolated from Parke-Davis thrombin topical and from bioactivated crude prothrombins obtained from single animal plasmas. Six thrombin components are present in the former by gel electrophoresis at pH 8.9, ionic strength 0.16, and 30°, but interband protein is high. Ultracentrifugation and gel filtration studies show that, as either ionic strength or temperature is decreased, reversible thrombin self-association and interaction with the gel matrix increase. Electrophoretic mobility and resolution decrease, the latter to give a single diffuse band. Partial fractionation of the six components, numbered according to increasing anodal mobility, was accomplished by differential elution from cellulose phosphate. T2 and T6 were isolated essentially in pure form. Specific activities and component abundances of fractions revealed that T1, T2, and T3 have significantly higher activities than T4, T5, and T6. Thrombins from 60 single animal plasmas contained only T1, T2, and T3, in two distribution types: I, having T1, T2, and T3 in a ratio of 1:2:1, or II, having T1 and T2 as a 1:1 ratio, with T3 absent or present at about 5% of total thrombin. Distribution type for pedigreed animals correlates (a) with age: below 8 months, only I was observed (5 animals); between 8 and 30 months, either I or II was observed (16 animals); and above 30 months, only II was observed (11 animals); and (b) with the two-stage clotting time of the original plasma, with the use of the corresponding serum to supply activators. Other correlations were not found. Component distribution is not a simple, genetically determined characteristic. During activation to produce Distribution I, T1 and T2 may first appear at a ratio of 1:2. An attractive model is as follows. Two prothrombins, P1 and P2, are present in equal amounts. P2 yields T2, and P1 yields T1 and T3, but not sequentially. As the animal ages, the pathway to T3 is lost. Reduction and alkylation of thrombin from thrombin topical results in a dispersion of five fragments between molecular weight of ∼32,000 and ∼5,000. Thrombins from single animal plasmas yield only these two. Probably T4, T5, and T6 are derived from T1, T2, and T3 as a result of peptide cleavages in the larger fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1523265752,"Abstract Cleavage of sperm whale myoglobin at arginine peptide bonds has been accomplished by tryptic hydrolysis of the protein after blocking the amino groups reversibly with citraconic anhydride. Peptides comprising the sequences 1 to 31, 46 to 118, and 119 to 139 were isolated and studied by optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism. In the free state, each peptide was much less helical than expected from its conformation in the intact protein. Thus Peptide 1–31 which, in the native protein, has 30 out of 31 residues in a helical configuration (i.e. 97% helical) was only 33% helical (from b0 values) in the free state. Helicity increased appreciably (to 54%) in 62% methanol. The longer Peptide 46–118, which is 62% helical in the intact protein, was 38% helical in the free state and helicity of this peptide was increased to about 50% in 62% methanol. This is a long peptide with an elaborate mode of folding which makes the contribution of long range interactions quite feasible. Peptide 119–139 occupies a region in the native protein which is 71% helical. However, its helical content in the free state (15%) was quite low, mainly due to minimal contribution of long range interactions and to some loss of contribution of short range interactions since it carries only a portion of a helix (helix H). Although helicity of this peptide increased (to 31%) in 62% methanol, it was still much lower than the corresponding value for the other two peptides in the same solvent. These studies show that the conformation of each of these peptides is less helical in the free form than expected from its location and configuration within the intact protein. Helicity increases as the probability of stabilization of folding by long range interactions improves. Also, the results indicate that two separated fragments of a helix will not be able to achieve a high degree of helicity. Furthermore, proteins may not start to assume native conformation during biosynthesis until virtually or entirely completed, depending on the extent of contribution to long range interactions (in the complete protein) of the yet unsynthesized portion."

https://openalex.org/W1560726277,"Abstract The crystalline glycosyl chloride obtained by treatment of α-chitobiose octaacetate with dry hydrogen chloride in acetyl chloride solution was treated with silver azide to give the crystalline β-1-azido derivative of peracetylated chitobiose. This compound was hydrogenated in the presence of platinum oxide into the crystalline β-1-amino derivative, which was condensed with 1-benzyl N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-l-aspartate to give the crystalline benzyl ester, N-(benzyloxycarbonyl), penta-O-acetyl derivative of 2-acetamido-4-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-1-N-(4-l-aspartyl)-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosylamine. The latter compound was obtained in crystalline form by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of palladium on charcoal, followed by saponification of the resulting crystalline amino acid derivative with lithium hydroxide. It was characterized by its melting point and optical rotation, by thin layer chromatography, and by mass spectrometry of the per(trimethylsilyl) derivative."

https://openalex.org/W1490339843,"Abstract Most determinations of the stoichiometric relationship between electron transport and phosphorylation have employed radioactive orthophosphate and have been based on the assumption that ADP-dependent incorporation of radioactivity can be safely equated to ATP synthesis. The validity of using this procedure to measure photophosphorylation in isolated chloroplasts has been challenged recently. However, the studies reported here show that estimates of photophosphorylation based on label incorporation are probably correct. 1. The amount of labeled orthophosphate incorporated does not differ significantly from the amount of orthophosphate which disappears from the medium. Thus, there is no evidence of an exchange reaction between orthophosphate and ADP or other unlabeled, phosphate-containing substances. 2. Nearly all of the incorporated 32P is found in ATP but a significant amount of label is sometimes found in ADP. However, the 32P in ADP is all or nearly all derived from AT32P, presumably through the action of the ATP:AMP phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.4.3) known to be present in chloroplast preparations. Therefore, the sum of the radioactivities of ATP and ADP should be used in estimating the extent of the phosphorylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1548032256,"ATP:urea amidolyase, a biotin-enzyme induced by growth of the urease-less yeast Candida utilis on urea as sole nitrogen source, exhibits a requirement for catalytic quantities of bicarbonate. Evidence is presented to show that the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme, viz. the ATP- and potassium ion-dependent cleavage of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia, represents yet another example of a biotin-mediated carboxylation process, one which, in this case, leads to fixation of CO2 at a nitrogen atom of urea. The resulting molecule of allophanate is then susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis at the amide carbon atom, a cleavage that requires neither ATP, potassium ion, nor the biotin-coenzyme portion of the lyase. A reaction sequence describing the possible molecular events occurring as integral parts of this new carboxylytic process of urea degradation in urease-negative organisms is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1534592062,"Abstract The administration of phenobarbital to rats resulted in about a 2- to 4-fold elevation of a number of hepatic microsomal oxidase activities within 24 hours. When animals were subjected to partial hepatectomy up to 3 hours after treatment with the inducer, the onset of the elevation of aniline hydroxylase activity was delayed, a 2-fold elevation being apparent only after about 40 hours. When the period between administration of the inducer and partial hepatectomy was extended to 9 hours, the operation had no effect on the time course of enzyme induction, indicating that only the early stages of the process of enzyme induction were sensitive to the proliferative demands which follow partial hepatectomy. Neither 12 hours nor 24 hours after either partial hepatectomy or phenobarbital administration were any detectable alterations observed in the quantity of microsomal protein, suggesting that the delay in the onset of phenobarbital-induced mixed oxidase activity in partially hepatectomized animals was not due to differences in the amount of endoplasmic reticulum. Selective inhibition of the process of liver regeneration by the withdrawal of protein from the diet resulted in inhibition of the synthesis of DNA in the regenerating liver and abolishment of the delay in the onset of enzyme induction caused by the requirement for cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W8923773,"Abstract Both free and membrane-bound reticulocyte ribosomes synthesize protein in the intact cell and the reticulocyte cell-free system. The soluble proteins synthesized by these two classes of ribosomes in the cell-free system were isolated and analyzed by ion exchange and gel chromatography and electrophoresis. In the cell-free system free reticulocyte ribosomes incorporate 70% of 14C-valine into the α and β chains of globin and the remainder into two non-globin protein fractions which are separable by Sephadex gel chromatography. In contrast, membrane-bound ribosomes incorporate only 11% of the radioactivity into globin subunits but synthesize primarily high molecular weight nonglobin proteins. The nonglobin proteins are resolved into multiple discrete subunits by electrophoresis in the presence of mercaptoethanol and urea. In the intact reticulocyte 14% of radioactive amino acids is incorporated into nonglobin proteins of the same character as the nonglobin proteins synthesized in the cell-free system. The data indicate that free ribosomes are primarily engaged in globin synthesis while membrane-bound ribosomes preferentially synthesize high molecular weight nonglobin proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1481843728,"Abstract Further study of the cold inactivation of argininosuccinase shows that a new, more slowly sedimenting component is formed which has an S value of about 5.6 as compared to 9.3 for the active enzyme. The two components can be resolved by high speed sedimentation in phosphate but not in Tris or imidazole buffers. The proportion of each component corresponded to the extent of inactivation. On resolution in a sucrose density gradient, the 5.6 S component was found to be enzymatically inactive. Activity was regained by thermal reactivation of the fractions in this peak. Thus, cold inactivation and thermal reactivation are accompanied by reversible dissociation of the enzyme into two, probably identical, subunits which are one-half the size of the active enzyme (molecular weight 202,000). The rate of dissociation followed first order kinetics and the velocity constants increased with increasing pH. Association followed first order or second order kinetics depending on the buffer. A mechanism for the reversible dissociation has been proposed in the light of the kinetic analysis. The kinetic patterns in the direction of association reveal temperature-dependent equilibria between the dimeric and monomeric forms of the enzyme. The equilibrium constant and the negative change in free energy decreased with a decrease in temperature. The enthalpy and entropy changes were found to be 46 kcal and 189 e.u., respectively, per mole of active enzyme. The negative temperature dependence for association and the large positive value for the entropy change suggests that the active form of the enzyme is stabilized by hydrophobic bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1524073645,"Abstract The incorporation of glucosamine-14C into plasma lipoproteins has been measured in the intact rat, in liver slices, and in the liver microsome fraction. The labeling of lipoprotein was studied in microsome subfractions, both in vivo with glucosamine-14C and in vitro with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-14C. After isolation of lipoproteins with the aid of carrier plasma, labeled lipoproteins were found in smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes, but not in rough endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes. Approximately 100 times as much smooth membrane protein as Golgi membrane protein was required to isolate the same total amount of labeled lipoprotein, in vivo as well as in vitro. High density lipoproteins had 3 times as much total label as low density lipoproteins, which may be related to the larger amount of the former molecules found in plasma. It is concluded that carbohydrate is attached to the lipoprotein after it has left the ribosome and that the Golgi apparatus plays a major role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2130976072,"Abstract Cytochrome b5 from the rabbit liver microsomes was solubilized with pancreatic lipase. The apoprotein of the predominant form of cytochrome b5 was hydrolyzed with trypsin and chymotrypsin and the resulting peptides were isolated. The complete amino acid sequences of these peptides were determined by the Edman degradation procedure. For the first 90 residues, this amino acid sequence is essentially the same as that reported by Tsugita et al. (Tsugita, A., Kobayashi, M., Kajihara, T., and Hagihara, B., J. Biochem (Tokyo)), 64, 727, 1968) for a trypsin-solubilized preparation of crystalline cytochrome b5 from rabbit liver microsomes. Heterogeneity at residues 10 and 95 was observed. Comparison of this rabbit protein sequence with that of calf cytochrome, the only other cytochrome b5 with a known primary structure, shows that the rabbit cytochrome is 4 residues longer at the NH2 terminus and differs in 10 other residue positions."
https://openalex.org/W1494774182,"Abstract A ribonucleotide reductase requiring 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin has been detected in Euglena gracilis var. bacillaris by measuring 3H exchange from labeled coenzyme to water. Extracts were partially purified by centrifugation, dialysis, and treatment with MnCl2. These extracts catalyzed the reduction of ribonucleoside triphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides as measured by colorimetric assay with the diphenylamine procedure. The enzyme required 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, a dithiol, and a ribonucleoside triphosphate for exchange activity and reduction. Monothiols could not replace the dithiol requirement. Ribonucleoside diphosphates were slightly active as substrates in both assay systems. Mg++, at low concentrations, did not affect the reaction; at concentrations greater than 2 mm, this ion was inhibitory. The reduction of ribonucleotides was inhibited by adding deoxyribonucleotides other than the immediate products; e.g. ATP reduction was inhibited by adding dGTP, dCTP, or dUTP, but not by dATP. dTTP inhibited the reduction of all ribonucleotides to the greatest extent. The molecular weight of this enzyme, determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, was approximately 145,000. Extracts of Ochromonas malhamensis and Ochromonas danica showed no activity in the 3H exchange assay under similar conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1566969796,"Abstract The mechanisms by which insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin cause cell differentiation and the induction of specific milk proteins in mammary cells were studied further in relation to the formation of ribosomes and their organization into polysomes. Insulin stimulated the formation of ribosomes and their organization into polysomes in mammary epithelial stem cells in vitro. The newly formed ribosomes were largely conserved in the daughter cells after cell division. In cells previously treated with insulin and hydrocortisone, insulin and prolactin acted synergistically to stimulate the formation of new ribosomes and polysome aggregations. The pre-formed and the newly formed ribosomes were equivalent in their distribution among monosomes and polysomes. Synthesis of specific casein proteins was undetectable in the cells formed in vitro until 4 to 6 hours of prolactin stimulation, at which time an increase in polysomal concentration and the initiation of 32P- or 14C-casein synthesis occurred concomitantly. This result is interpreted as the translation of casein messenger RNA in polysomes, an event which is coupled to preceding hormone-mediated increases in transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W18637124,"Abstract Aspartokinase has been purified approximately 1,300-fold from crude extracts of Bacillus polymyxa. Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels and equilibrium ultracentrifugation indicated that the purified enzyme was essentially homogeneous. Aged preparations of the enzyme exhibit two electrophoretic components which can be interconverted by treatment with the feedback inhibitors l-threonine and l-lysine or with MgCl2. The molecular weight and partial specific volume were determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation to be 116,000 and 0.751 ml per g, respectively. The amino acid composition of the enzyme was analyzed. Upon electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate or urea or after treatment with maleic anhydride, aspartokinase could be resolved into two components of molecular weights about 17,000 and 47,000, respectively. The two types of subunits could be separated be gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. It is concluded that aspartokinase is an oligomeric protein composed of at least two different types of polypeptide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1493900092,"Abstract Rats fed a diet lacking calcium adapt to this deprivation by increased active transport of this ion across the intestine. When the characteristics of the transport system were analyzed in vitro by use of saturation kinetics, increased net absorptive calcium transport appeared to be the result of an increased affinity (decrease in Kt from 1.12 to 0.59 mm) rather than an increase in the capacity or Vmax of the transport process. Adaptation through substrate induction in yeast results in an analogous increase in carrier affinity for sugar transport by a linkage to metabolic energy. Such a mechanism could account for the lowered dietary calcium effect, however the authors suggest that rather than an actual change in carrier affinity a second molecule (such as intestinal calcium-binding protein) could also alter carrier-substrate equilibria and produce a decrease in the observed Kt if access to the carrier were rate limiting at low substrate concentrations and this second molecule increased access of substrate. This model is consistent with the changes in calcium transport system characteristics and calcium-binding protein levels under conditions of restricted dietary calcium levels."
https://openalex.org/W1488706189,"Abstract A method for the purification of bovine thrombin (EC 3.4.4.13) from Parke-Davis topical thrombin is described. The purified preparation has a constant specific activity although it has previously been shown to contain at least two enzymatically active proteins of similar molecular weights and amino acid composition. The average molecular weight of this purified material as determined by gel filtration, sedimentation equilibrium, and reaction with 14C-diisopropyl-fluorophosphate is shown to be close to 34,000. The carbohydrate content of the purified material is approximately 10% of the protein content, but evidence is presented that this carbohydrate is probably an artifact of the purification procedure. The amino acid composition of the purified thrombin is reported based upon an assumed molecular weight of 34,000."
https://openalex.org/W1504249208,"Abstract The reaction of human CO hemoglobin with p,p'-difluorom,m'-dinitrodiphenylsulfone was shown to result in the formation of an intramolecular cross-link between the amino-terminal valine residues of the α chains. The cross-linked hemoglobin was isolated by gel filtration in 1 m MgCl2 and ion exchange chromatography. Oxygen dissociation studies on the purified cross-linked hemoglobin revealed that it had a high oxygen affnity (P50 = 0.82 mm) and exhibited no heme-heme interactions. Although the major reaction product was the species cross-linked between the amino-terminal residues of the α chain, it was shown that cross-links between αβ dimers were also formed at other, as yet unidentified, locations."
https://openalex.org/W1487341303,"Abstract ATP (CTP) transfer RNA nucleotidyltransferase was purified to homogeneity from homogenates of rabbit liver. The final specific activity for AMP incorporation was approximately 250 µmoles per hour per mg of protein under optimal conditions. The ratio of CMP to AMP incorporation remained constant over an approximately 7000-fold purification. The two activities had identical properties on acrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing, and had identical rates of heat inactivation at several temperatures. The data suggest that a single protein incorporates AMP and CMP into the -CCA terminus of tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1551228067,"Abstract Whole cells of Mycobacterium phlei, incubated with methyl-14C-l-methionine, synthesize a 6-O-methyl-d-glucose-containing lipopolysaccharide in which the methyl groups of the 6-O-methylglucose become extensively labeled. A soluble enzyme was obtained from sonically disrupted M. phlei cells which catalyzed the transfer of methyl groups from methyl-14C-S-adenosylmethionine to endogenous acceptor, yielding labeled lipopolysaccharide. Nucleotides containing 6-O-methylglucose could not be detected in such incubations or in incubations with whole cells. d-Gluco-oligosaccharides with α-(1 → 4)-linkages, prepared by partial acetolysis of amylose, were good acceptors in the methyltransferase system. The most active oligosaccharide fraction contained 7 to 10 glucose units, and the product of the methyltransferase reaction with such an acceptor contained methylated sequences of at least 6 glucose units. Oligosaccharides prepared from cellulose were not active as acceptors. The methyltransferase, with amylo-oligosaccharides as the acceptor, had a pH optimum of 7.0, was activated by ammonium and magnesium ions, and had an apparent Km of 10-4 m for S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Since the lipopolysaccharide of Mycobacterium species contains a sequence of about 10 α-(1 → 4)-linked 6-O-methyl-d-glucose units, and since the methyltransferase described here catalyzed the methylation of α-(1 → 4)-linked d-gluco-oligosaccharides, we conclude that the polysaccharide component of the lipopolysaccharide is probably methylated at the polymer level during its biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W96599385,"Abstract Through kinetic studies, evidence is presented to show that the substrates of ATP-AMP phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.4.3), yeast adenylate kinase, are MgADP and ADP in the forward reaction. Various analogues of the substrates were studied to ascertain binding and catalytic limitations. Inhibitors such as 2'-AMP were shown to react at both catalytic sites. The kinetic studies and the Haldane relationship were consistent with the rapid equilibrium, random mechanism proposed for yeast adenylate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1573585152,"Abstract The kinetics of transamination reactions catalyzed by pig heart branched chain amino aminotransferase was investigated. The activation of aged preparations by 2-mercaptoethanol, previously noted, was associated with increases in both the maximum velocity and enzyme-substrate affinities. This implies a protein conformational change. The sharp pH optimum observed with standard assay conditions reflects a change in the rate-limiting half-reaction from that of leucine with the phosphopyridoxal form of the enzyme to that of α-ketoglutarate with the phosphopyridoxamine form as the pH is raised. Whereas nonpolar monocarboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acids which are substrate analogues both inhibited strongly at the optimum pH of 8.3, only the monocarboxylic acids were effective at higher pH values. The kinetics of the reaction of l-leucine with α-ketoglutarate could be adequately described by a binary rate equation as would be expected for a transamination reaction. Exchange transamination reactions between homologous amino acid keto acid substrate pairs were also shown and found to proceed at rates comparable to that observed with leucine and α-ketoglutarate."
https://openalex.org/W1537148694,"Abstract 3,4-Dihydroxy-9,10-secoandrosta-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione-4,5-dioxygenase was purified to a state of apparent homogeneity from Nocardia restrictus. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be around 280,000 from sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocitydiffusion data. The physicochemical properties described include: sedimentation coefficient (s020,w = 10.42 S), diffusion coefficient (D020,w = 2.55 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1), frictional ratio (f/f0 = 1.47), and apparent partial specific volume (v = 0.733 ml g-1). The enzyme has an ultraviolet absorption maximum at 280 mµ, and the specific absorbance (E0.1%1 cm) is 0.93. Quantitative analytical data show 1.13 g-atoms of ferrous iron and 9 half-cystinyl residues per mole of the enzyme. Metal-chelating agents, including o-phenanthroline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and α,α'-dipyridyl, inhibited the enzyme, and the inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to both organic substrate and molecular oxygen. Sulfhydryl inhibitors also inhibited the enzyme at the concentration of 1 mm. Substrate specificity studies indicated that substitution of an alkyl group at a position adjacent to the dihydroxyl group was required for maximal activity. Introduction of a bulky alkyl group at other positions rendered the substrate less reactive."
https://openalex.org/W1589124881,"Abstract The formation of MS nucleotides during amino acid starvation in an RC-stringent leucine auxotroph of Escherichia coli was found to be inhibited by rifampicin, an inhibitor of chain initiation by RNA polymerase. By measuring the evel of charging of leucine-specific transfer RNA during rifampicin treatment, this inhibition was shown not to be mediated through an alleviation of amino acid starvation. This points to a dependence of MS formation on nascent RNA synthesis and the significance of these findings to the relationship between MS compounds and regulation of RNA synthesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1510271565,"Abstract Addition of oxidizable substrates to aerobic suspensions of Hemophilus parainfluenzae containing no endogenous substrate results in rapid reduction of b and c type cytochromes to the aerobic steady state. The extent of reduction depends upon the relative activities of the dehydrogenases and oxidases involved. Addition of oxygen to anaerobic cells containing substrate rapidly oxidizes the cytochromes to the aerobic steady state. The rapid kinetics observed on mixing with oxygen show no evidence that the initial rate of oxidation of part of the b or c type cytochromes is higher, even within bacteria with a large stoichiometric imbalance of these cytochrome types. Cytochrome a2 reacts rapidly enough with oxygen to be considered a terminal oxidase, and indirect evidence indicates that cytochrome o reacts as rapidly with oxygen as does the mammalian oxidase (pseudofirst order rate constant around 80 sec-1 at room temperature)."
https://openalex.org/W1512407573,"Native ferredoxin isolated from Clostridium acidi-urici cannot be acetylated and is not digested by carboxypeptidase A. However, apoferredoxin, free of iron and sulfide, can be acetylated and the COOH-terminal alanine and glutamine residues are quantitatively removed by carboxypeptidase A. Ferredoxin derivatives can be reconstituted from both modified proteins. The following derivatives were also prepared: N-Acetimido-, N-succinyl-, tetraiodo-, various N-aminoacyl derivatives (glycyl-, phenylalanyl-, lysyl-, glutamyl-, and methionyl-) and N-t-butyloxycarbonyl-. All modified apoferredoxins, except the N-succinyl- and the tetraiodo- derivatives, could be converted to the corresponding ferredoxin derivatives. These had both lower biological activity and stability than the native protein. Those with a positive charge at the NH2-terminal end were more stable than those with no charge (acetyl-, t-butyloxycarbonyl-). Steric effects of the added amino acid derivatives were also detected. It is concluded that both the NH2-terminal and the COOH-terminal amino acids are important for conferring stability to the ferredoxin structure."
https://openalex.org/W1545096824,"Abstract Kinetic studies with 3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-secoandrosta-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione-4,5-dioxygenase gave intersecting initial velocity plots that conform to a sequential mechanism. Linear noncompetitive product inhibition patterns were observed with respect to either substrate, indicating the formation of a dead end complex. 4-Isopropyl catechol, a structural analogue of the organic substrate, inhibited the enzyme competitively with respect to the organic substrate as expected, but inhibited the enzyme uncompetitively with respect to molecular oxygen. These results are consistent with an ordered Bi-Uni mechanism where molecular oxygen is added first, followed by organic substrate, and the product is then released. Detailed analysis of the kinetic data suggests the existence of a dead end enzyme-oxygen-product complex."
https://openalex.org/W1486674349,"Abstract Modification of the tyrosyl and amino groups of trypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) with N-acetylimidazole before and after their combination was used to assess the role of these amino acids in the binding process. Trypsin was inactivated by an excess of the inhibitor and the complex isolated by chromatography on Sephadex G-75, at pH 6.8. Prior to complex formation, trypsin and the inhibitor each possessed 4 reactive tyrosyl residues, but after complex formation only 4 of the expected 8 reacted with N-acetylimidazole. Trypsin and the inhibitor had four and three acetylatable amino groups, respectively, but only two of these were reactive in the complex. These results indicated that four tyrosyl and five amino groups had been prevented from reacting with N-acetylimidazole because of their involvement in the formation of the complex. Modified but fully active trypsin and inhibitor could be recovered from the acetylated complex by chromatography on sulfoethyl Sephadex at pH 2.6. Subsequent analysis of each of these isolated components revealed that 2 of the 4 shielded tryosyl residues of the complex had been derived from trypsin and 2 from the inhibitor. Of the five shielded amino groups in the complex, three were contributed by trypsin and two by the inhibitor."
