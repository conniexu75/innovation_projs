https://openalex.org/W2054273523,"THE chemotaxis of bracken spermatozoids, first demonstrated by Pfeffer1, has so far been investigated by introducing a concentrated source of a stimulating substance into a suspension of spermatozoids and observing their behaviour in the resultant chemical gradient. In Pfeffer's original method, a fine glass capillary containing a solution of sodium L-malate provided the source; in these conditions spermatozoids aggregate around the tip (Fig. 1). Such experiments have revealed the highly directional character of the response2, its chemical specificity (salts of L-malic acid and a few closely related dicarboxylic acids are active)3, and that the response depends on the ratio between the applied and background concentrations in the suspension1. To permit more quantitative study of bracken sperm chemotaxis, a search has been made for conditions experimentally more favourable than those obtained with the classical methods of establishing chemical gradients. Two new phenomena, closely related to ‘classical’ chemotaxis, have been observed."

Anti-Mia, the antibody necessary for the identification of the antigen, was made by a mother in response to immunization by her Mi(a +) fœtus which, as a result, had severe hæmolytic disease. The antigen was shown to be inherited as a dominant character. The antigen was evidently rare, for no example was found in testing 425 random people."

https://openalex.org/W2022500832,"IN 1950 Armstrong1 found that the period after injury during which a nerve fibre preserves a normal histological appearance may be surprisingly long in a poikilothermic animal kept at room temperature (15°–20° C.), but that the rate of degeneration is increased and the time after which the fibre eventually disappears is shortened by a comparatively small rise in temperature. This temperature effect is important, since one of the commonest methods for investigating pathways and connexions in the nervous system involves the interpretation of degenerative changes which follow experimental injury, and it is essential to know how long one must wait before it is possible to say that surviving nerve fibres, normal in appearance, cannot have been affected by the injury."

https://openalex.org/W2121957167,"DURING recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the role of the rumen ciliate protozoa in ruminant nutrition, particularly with regard to the fermentative activity of the holotrich protozoa which contribute to the production of lactic and volatile fatty acids1,2. It has, however, become evident that further progress in this direction cannot be made until the contribution of each component species of the rumen microfauna can be studied separately both in vitro and in vivo. Attempts to cultivate the rumen ciliates in vitro have hitherto not met with outstanding success. Gutierrez3 managed to separate the two holotrich genera in vitro but only to give a limited yield. The differences in fermentation reactions in vitro found by Gutierrez between Isotricha Stein and Dasytricha Schuberg (cf. Oxford2) seem to justify attempts to establish single species of holotrichs in vivo unmixed with other species. A method is required which would be as effective as, but less drastic than, the use of prolonged starvation and copper sulphate administration4. This objective has so far been reached by us in the one sheep used, to the extent that all three species of holotrichs and the large oligotrichs originally present were removed, leaving only the smaller oligotrich Diplodinium dentatum Stein and a few Entodinia spp. Following this, Dasytricha ruminantium has successfully been reestablished in the rumen so that fairly large ‘pure’ samples of this organism in the living state can now be obtained for in vitro studies, by the normal separation process of Heald, Oxford and Sugden5."

https://openalex.org/W2041138558,"IN a paper by one of us1, it was reported that intraperitoneal administration of 2 : 4-dinitrophenol produces a high degree of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria from several rat tissues. There were histological changes in these tissues, which showed mitochondrial swelling and cloudy swelling. In the case of the liver, we have found that very shortly after treatment, fat droplets appear in the cells, followed later by glycogen. Similar changes were observed by Fonnesu and Severi2,3, who found also that cloudy swelling is characterized by decrease of phosphorus/oxygen ratios. In addition, treated rats showed increase of body temperature, a condition which has been referred by many authors to the decline of phosphorylation4,5."

https://openalex.org/W2008279627,"MOON et al. 1–3 found that prolonged administration of growth hormone to rats results in more neoplasms arising in the pulmonary and lymphatic tissues, adrenal glands and reproductive organs than would be expected to occur spontaneously. They also showed that hypophysectomy prevents the development of spontaneous and growth hormone-induced tumours4 and effectively inhibits the carcinogenic effect of methyl cholanthrene5."
