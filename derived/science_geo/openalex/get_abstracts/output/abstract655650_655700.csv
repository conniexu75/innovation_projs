https://openalex.org/W3047144258,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly affected mortality worldwide1. There is unprecedented urgency to understand who is most at risk of severe outcomes, and this requires new approaches for the timely analysis of large datasets. Working on behalf of NHS England, we created OpenSAFELY—a secure health analytics platform that covers 40% of all patients in England and holds patient data within the existing data centre of a major vendor of primary care electronic health records. Here we used OpenSAFELY to examine factors associated with COVID-19-related death. Primary care records of 17,278,392 adults were pseudonymously linked to 10,926 COVID-19-related deaths. COVID-19-related death was associated with: being male (hazard ratio (HR) 1.59 (95% confidence interval 1.53–1.65)); greater age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); diabetes; severe asthma; and various other medical conditions. Compared with people of white ethnicity, Black and South Asian people were at higher risk, even after adjustment for other factors (HR 1.48 (1.29–1.69) and 1.45 (1.32–1.58), respectively). We have quantified a range of clinical factors associated with COVID-19-related death in one of the largest cohort studies on this topic so far. More patient records are rapidly being added to OpenSAFELY, we will update and extend our results regularly. OpenSAFELY, a new health analytics platform that includes data from over 17 million adult NHS patients in England, is used to examine factors associated with COVID-19-related death."
https://openalex.org/W3042021489,"Technologies such as batteries, biomaterials and heterogeneous catalysts have functions that are defined by mixtures of molecular and mesoscale components. As yet, this multi-length-scale complexity cannot be fully captured by atomistic simulations, and the design of such materials from first principles is still rare1–5. Likewise, experimental complexity scales exponentially with the number of variables, restricting most searches to narrow areas of materials space. Robots can assist in experimental searches6–14 but their widespread adoption in materials research is challenging because of the diversity of sample types, operations, instruments and measurements required. Here we use a mobile robot to search for improved photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water15. The robot operated autonomously over eight days, performing 688 experiments within a ten-variable experimental space, driven by a batched Bayesian search algorithm16–18. This autonomous search identified photocatalyst mixtures that were six times more active than the initial formulations, selecting beneficial components and deselecting negative ones. Our strategy uses a dexterous19,20 free-roaming robot21–24, automating the researcher rather than the instruments. This modular approach could be deployed in conventional laboratories for a range of research problems beyond photocatalysis. A mobile robot autonomously operates analytical instruments in a wet chemistry laboratory, performing a photocatalyst optimization task much faster than a human would be able to."
https://openalex.org/W3098533145,"Ferromagnetism and superconductivity typically compete with each other since the internal magnetic field generated in a magnet suppresses the formation of spin-singlet Cooper pairs in conventional superconductors. Only a handful of ferromagnetic superconductors are known in heavy fermion systems, where many-body electron interactions promoted by the narrow energy bands play a key role in stabilizing these emergent states. Recently, interaction-driven superconductivity and ferromagnetism have been demonstrated as separate phenomena in different density regimes of flat bands enabled by graphene moire superlattices. Combining superconductivity and magnetism in a single ground state may lead to more exotic quantum phases. Here, employing van der Waals heterostructures of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG), we realize a flat electron band that is tunable by perpendicular electric fields. Similar to the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene, TDBG exhibits energy gaps at the half and quarter filled flat bands, indicating the emergence of correlated insulating states. We find that the gaps of these insulating states increase with in-plane magnetic field, suggesting a ferromagnetic order. Upon doping the ferromagnetic half-filled insulator, superconductivity emerges with a critical temperature controlled by both density and electric fields. We observe that the in-plane magnetic field enhances the superconductivity in the low field regime, suggesting spin-polarized electron pairing. Spin-polarized superconducting states discovered in TDBG provide a new route to engineering interaction-driven topological superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W3098795176,"A central challenge in developing quantum computers and long-range quantum networks is the distribution of entanglement across many individually controllable qubits1. Colour centres in diamond have emerged as leading solid-state ‘artificial atom’ qubits2,3 because they enable on-demand remote entanglement4, coherent control of over ten ancillae qubits with minute-long coherence times5 and memory-enhanced quantum communication6. A critical next step is to integrate large numbers of artificial atoms with photonic architectures to enable large-scale quantum information processing systems. So far, these efforts have been stymied by qubit inhomogeneities, low device yield and complex device requirements. Here we introduce a process for the high-yield heterogeneous integration of ‘quantum microchiplets’—diamond waveguide arrays containing highly coherent colour centres—on a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). We use this process to realize a 128-channel, defect-free array of germanium-vacancy and silicon-vacancy colour centres in an aluminium nitride PIC. Photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals long-term, stable and narrow average optical linewidths of 54 megahertz (146 megahertz) for germanium-vacancy (silicon-vacancy) emitters, close to the lifetime-limited linewidth of 32 megahertz (93 megahertz). We show that inhomogeneities of individual colour centre optical transitions can be compensated in situ by integrated tuning over 50 gigahertz without linewidth degradation. The ability to assemble large numbers of nearly indistinguishable and tunable artificial atoms into phase-stable PICs marks a key step towards multiplexed quantum repeaters7,8 and general-purpose quantum processors9–12. An approach for integrating a large number of solid-state qubits on a photonic integrated circuit is used to construct a 128-channel artificial atom chip containing diamond quantum emitters."

https://openalex.org/W3041573255,"Population-based data on COVID-19 are urgently needed. We report on three rounds of probability sample household surveys in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), carried out in nine large municipalities using the Wondfo lateral flow point-of-care test for immunoglobulin M and G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (https://en.wondfo.com.cn/product/wondfo-sars-cov-2-antibody-test-lateral-flow-method-2/). Before survey use, the assay underwent four validation studies with pooled estimates of sensitivity (84.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 81.4–87.8%) and specificity (99.0%; 95% CI = 97.8–99.7%). We calculated that the seroprevalence was 0.048% (2/4,151; 95% CI = 0.006–0.174) on 11–13 April (round 1), 0.135% (6/4,460; 95% CI = 0.049–0.293%) on 25–27 April (round 2) and 0.222% (10/4,500; 95% CI = 0.107–0.408) on 9–11 May (round 3), with a significant upward trend over the course of the surveys. Of 37 family members of positive individuals, 17 (35%) were also positive. The epidemic is at an early stage in the state, and there is high compliance with social distancing, unlike in other parts of Brazil. Periodic survey rounds will continue to monitor trends until at least the end of September, and our population-based data will inform decisions on preventive policies and health system preparedness at the state level. Three separate rounds of serological surveys in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil from mid-April to mid-May 2020 show an increase in antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 over time."
https://openalex.org/W3041272472,"Active optical control over matter is desirable in many scientific disciplines, with prominent examples in all-optical magnetic switching1,2, light-induced metastable or exotic phases of solids3-8 and the coherent control of chemical reactions9,10. Typically, these approaches dynamically steer a system towards states or reaction products far from equilibrium. In solids, metal-to-insulator transitions are an important target for optical manipulation, offering ultrafast changes of the electronic4 and lattice11-16 properties. The impact of coherences on the efficiencies and thresholds of such transitions, however, remains a largely open subject. Here, we demonstrate coherent control over a metal-insulator structural phase transition in a quasi-one-dimensional solid-state surface system. A femtosecond double-pulse excitation scheme17-20 is used to switch the system from the insulating to a metastable metallic state, and the corresponding structural changes are monitored by ultrafast low-energy electron diffraction21,22. To govern the transition, we harness vibrational coherence in key structural modes connecting both phases, and observe delay-dependent oscillations in the double-pulse switching efficiency. Mode-selective coherent control of solids and surfaces could open new routes to switching chemical and physical functionalities, enabled by metastable and non-equilibrium states."
https://openalex.org/W3040406231,"Gastrointestinal enterochromaffin cells regulate bone and gut homeostasis via serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) production. A recent report suggested that gut microbes regulate 5-HT levels; however, the precise underlying molecular mechanisms are unexplored. Here, we reveal that the cation channel Piezo1 in the gut acts as a sensor of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) governing 5-HT production. Intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of mouse Piezo1 profoundly disturbed gut peristalsis, impeded experimental colitis, and suppressed serum 5-HT levels. Because of systemic 5-HT deficiency, conditional knockout of Piezo1 increased bone formation. Notably, fecal ssRNA was identified as a natural Piezo1 ligand, and ssRNA-stimulated 5-HT synthesis from the gut was evoked in a MyD88/TRIF-independent manner. Colonic infusion of RNase A suppressed gut motility and increased bone mass. These findings suggest gut ssRNA as a master determinant of systemic 5-HT levels, indicating the ssRNA-Piezo1 axis as a potential prophylactic target for treatment of bone and gut disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3041890001,"Facing a growing and more affluent world population, changing climate and finite natural resources, world food systems will have to change in the future. The aim of the Agrimonde-Terra foresight study was to build global scenarios linking land use and food security, with special attention paid to overlooked aspects such as nutrition and health, in order to help explore the possible future of the global food system. In this article, we seek to highlight how the resulting set of scenarios contributes to the debate on land use and food security and enlarges the range of possible futures for the global food system. We highlight four main contributions. Combining a scenario building method based on morphological analysis and quantitative simulations with a tractable and simple biomass balance model, the proposed approach improves transparency and coherence between scenario narratives and quantitative assessment. Agrimonde-Terra’s scenarios comprise a wide range of alternative diets, with contrasting underlying nutritional and health issues, which accompany contrasting urbanization and rural transformation processes, both dimensions that are lacking in other sets of global scenarios. Agrimonde-Terra’s scenarios share some similarities with existing sets of global scenarios, notably the SSPs, but are usually less optimistic regarding agricultural land expansion up to 2050. Results suggest that changing global diets toward healthier patterns could also help to limit the expansion in agricultural land area. Agrimonde-Terra’s scenarios enlarge the scope of possible futures by proposing two pathways that are uncommon in other sets of global scenarios. The first proposes to explore possible reconnection of the food industry and regional production within supranational regional blocs. The second means that we should consider that a ‘perfect storm’, induced by climate change and an ecological crisis combined with social and economic crises, is still possible. Both scenarios should be part of the debate as the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic shows."
https://openalex.org/W3038630761,"Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) form a highly specialized microvasculature that plays a critical role in liver function and disease. To better understand this role, we developed a strategy to generate LSECs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) by first optimizing the specification of arterial and venous angioblasts and derivative endothelial populations. Induction of a LSEC-like fate by hypoxia, cyclic AMP (cAMP) agonism, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) inhibition revealed that venous endothelial cells responded more rapidly and robustly than the arterial cells to upregulate LSEC markers and functions in vitro. Upon intrahepatic transplantation in neonates, venous angioblasts engrafted the liver and generated mature, fenestrated LSECs with scavenger functions and molecular profiles of primary human LSECs. When transplanted into the liver of adult mice, angioblasts efficiently gave rise to mature LSECs with robust factor VIII (FVIII) production. Humanization of the murine liver with hPSC-derived LSECs provides a tractable system for studying the biology of this key liver cell type."
https://openalex.org/W3041233297,"Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), also known as acetolactate synthase, is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-, thiamine diphosphate- and magnesium-dependent enzyme that catalyses the first step in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids1. It is the target for more than 50 commercial herbicides2. AHAS requires both catalytic and regulatory subunits for maximal activity and functionality. Here we describe structures of the hexadecameric AHAS complexes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and dodecameric AHAS complexes of Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the regulatory subunits of these AHAS complexes form a core to which the catalytic subunit dimers are attached, adopting the shape of a Maltese cross. The structures show how the catalytic and regulatory subunits communicate with each other to provide a pathway for activation and for feedback inhibition by branched-chain amino acids. We also show that the AHAS complex of Mycobacterium tuberculosis adopts a similar structure, thus demonstrating that the overall AHAS architecture is conserved across kingdoms. Structures of the acetohydroxyacid synthase complexes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana provide insights into the biosynthesis of and feedback inhibition by branched-chain amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W3041734038,"Drought is an important factor which limits growth of sugarcane. To elucidate the physiological and biochemical mechanisms of tolerance, a pot experiment was conducted at Sugarcane Research Institute, Kaiyuan, China. Two genotypes (Yuetang 93-159-sensitive and Yunzhe 05-51-tolerant), were subjected to three treatments; 70±5% (control), 50±5% (moderate drought) and 30±5% (severe drought) of soil field capacity. The results demonstrated that drought induced considerable decline in morpho-physiological, biochemical and anatomical parameters of both genotypes, with more pronounced detrimental effects on Yuetang 93–159 than on Yunzhe 05–51. Yunzhe 05–51 exhibited more tolerance by showing higher dry biomass, photosynthesis and antioxidant enzyme activities. Compared with Yuetang 93–159, Yunzhe 05–51 exhibited higher soluble sugar, soluble protein and proline contents under stress. Yunzhe 05–51 illustrated comparatively well-composed chloroplast structure under drought stress. It is concluded that the tolerance of Yunzhe 05–51 was attributed to improved antioxidant activities, osmolyte accumulation and enhanced photosynthesis. These findings may provide valuable information for future studies on molecular mechanism of tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3041263217,"Microbial colonization of bone is an important mechanism of postmortem skeletal degradation. However, the types and distributions of bone and tooth colonizing microbes are not well characterized. It is unknown if microbial communities vary in abundance or composition between bone element types, which could help explain differences in human DNA preservation. The goals of the present study were to (1) identify the types of microbes capable of colonizing different human bone types and (2) relate microbial abundances, diversity, and community composition to bone type and human DNA preservation. DNA extracts from 165 bone and tooth samples from three skeletonized individuals were assessed for bacterial loading and microbial community composition and structure. Random forest models were applied to predict operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with human DNA concentration. Dominant bacterial bone colonizers were from the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes. Eukaryotic bone colonizers were from Ascomycota, Apicomplexa, Annelida, Basidiomycota, and Ciliophora. Bacterial loading was not a significant predictor of human DNA concentration in two out of three individuals. Random forest models were minimally successful in identifying microbes related to human DNA concentration, which were complicated by high variability in community structure between individuals and body regions. This work expands on our understanding of the types of microbes capable of colonizing the postmortem human skeleton and potentially contributing to human skeletal DNA degradation."
https://openalex.org/W3041629649,"Aspergillus tamarii grows abundantly in naturally composting waste fibers of the textile industry and has a great potential in biomass decomposition. Amongst the key (hemi)cellulose-active enzymes in the secretomes of biomass-degrading fungi are the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). By catalyzing oxidative cleavage of glycoside bonds, LPMOs promote the activity of other lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. Here, we analyzed the catalytic potential of two of the seven AA9-type LPMOs that were detected in recently published transcriptome data for A. tamarii, namely AtAA9A and AtAA9B. Analysis of products generated from cellulose revealed that AtAA9A is a C4-oxidizing enzyme, whereas AtAA9B yielded a mixture of C1- and C4-oxidized products. AtAA9A was also active on cellopentaose and cellohexaose. Both enzymes also cleaved the β-(1→4)-glucan backbone of tamarind xyloglucan, but with different cleavage patterns. AtAA9A cleaved the xyloglucan backbone only next to unsubstituted glucosyl units, whereas AtAA9B yielded product profiles indicating that it can cleave the xyloglucan backbone irrespective of substitutions. Building on these new results and on the expanding catalog of xyloglucan- and oligosaccharide-active AA9 LPMOs, we discuss possible structural properties that could underlie the observed functional differences. The results corroborate evidence that filamentous fungi have evolved AA9 LPMOs with distinct substrate specificities and regioselectivities, which likely have complementary functions during biomass degradation."
https://openalex.org/W3041797451,"Factors contributing to foodborne illnesses in Malaysia were identified as insanitary food handling procedures and lack of hygiene in food preparation area. Food safety at home is a critical point as consumers represent the final step in food preparation and prevention of foodborne diseases. This study aims to investigate the food safety knowledge, attitude and self-reported practices among consumers in Malaysia. An online survey was conducted, and data were analysed using descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis. A model linking food safety knowledge and attitude and their direct effects on practices were confirmed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The proposed model fulfilled the goodness of fit indices and is deemed acceptable. Respondents demonstrate good level of food safety knowledge and positive attitudes and self-reported practices. Food safety knowledge has a negative and insignificant relationship with food safety practices (β1 = -0.284, p>0.05) while attitude significantly affects food safety practices (β1 = 0.534, p<0.05). The findings clearly indicate that food safety knowledge does not directly affect food safety practices This is also the first study to provide new empirical findings on thermometer usage among consumers in Malaysia. This study establishes an important point of reference where consumers use visual appearances to determine if food is thoroughly cooked and practice washing raw chicken prior to cooking. Food safety practices at home play a critical role in protecting consumers in reducing risks of foodborne illnesses."
https://openalex.org/W3041956866,"We aimed to build a machine learning predictive model to predict the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) for patients with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).This study included TBI patients who were hospitalized in a level 1 trauma center between January 2014 and February 2019. Data were analyzed for all adult patients who received mechanical ventilation following TBI with abbreviated injury severity (AIS) score for the head region of ≥ 3. This study designed three sets of machine learning models: set A defined PMV to be greater than 7 days, set B (PMV > 10 days) and set C (PMV >14 days) to determine the optimal model for deployment. Patients' demographics, injury characteristics and CT findings were used as predictors. Logistic regression (LR), Artificial neural networks (ANN) Support vector machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and C.5 Decision Tree (C.5 DT) were used to predict the PMV.The number of eligible patients that were included in the study were 674, 643 and 622 patients in sets A, B and C respectively. In set A, LR achieved the optimal performance with accuracy 0.75 and Area under the curve (AUC) 0.83. SVM achieved the optimal performance among other models in sets B with accuracy/AUC of 0.79/0.84 respectively. ANNs achieved the optimal performance in set C with accuracy/AUC of 0.76/0.72 respectively. Machine learning models in set B demonstrated more stable performance with higher prediction success and discrimination power.This study not only provides evidence that machine learning methods outperform the traditional multivariate analytical methods, but also provides a perspective to reach a consensual definition of PMV."
https://openalex.org/W3041260925,"Urban biodiversity offers important benefits to residents and may be crucial to reaching global biodiversity conservation targets, but little research has been conducted on how cities actually plan for biodiversity. In this study, we conducted a mixed methods content analysis of biodiversity plans by 39 cities around the world to determine whether they measured their actions, how they did so (via quantitative indicators and qualitative outputs), and what topics these actions and measures covered. We based our analytical framework on the Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity (also known as the City Biodiversity Index), a widely applied 23-indicator index that helps cities track their progress in biodiversity planning. The Singapore Index groups its indicators into the following three core components: native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and governance and management. For actions and measures not classifiable by the Singapore Index, we inductively derived additional categories. Across all plans, we identified 2,231 actions, 346 indicators, and 444 outputs. We found that all of the plans included actions, while 82% included measures (67% included indicators and 72% included outputs). Only 29% of actions were associated with a measure. Overall, the plans covered all of the categories in the Singapore Index, particularly within the core components of native biodiversity and governance and management, though some plans had a narrower focus. The 20 additional urban biodiversity topics that were not covered by the Singapore Index framework included socioeconomic considerations, data collection, genetic diversity, urban agriculture and forestry, green infrastructure, human-wildlife conflicts, indigenous concerns, and citizen science. Indicators were the most common measures for native biodiversity and ecosystem service topics, while outputs were the most common measures for governance and management. Our results may inform the revision and development of urban biodiversity indicators in the post-2020 framework and of other initiatives that guide cities in contributing to local and global biodiversity goals."
https://openalex.org/W3041245012,"During type 1 immune responses, CD4 T helper 1 (Th1) cells and CD8 T cells are activated via IL-12 and contribute to the elimination of intracellular pathogens through interferon gamma (IFNγ) production. In this study, we identified Placenta-specific 8 (Plac8) as a gene that is uniquely expressed in Th1 CD4 T cells relative to other CD4 T cell subsets and hypothesized that Plac8 may represent a novel therapeutic target in Th1 CD4 T cells. First, we determined that Plac8 mRNA in CD4 T cells was induced following IL-12 stimulation via an indirect route that required new protein synthesis. Upon evaluating the functional relevance of Plac8 expression in Th1 CD4 T cells, we discovered that Plac8 was important for suppressing IFNγ mRNA and protein production by CD4 T cells 24 hours after IL-12 stimulation, however Plac8 did not contribute to pathogenic CD4 T cell function during two models of intestinal inflammation. We also noted relatively high basal expression of Plac8 in CD8 T cells which could be further induced following IL-12 stimulation in CD8 T cells. Furthermore, Plac8 expression was important for establishing an optimal CD8 T cell response against influenza A virus via a T cell-intrinsic manner. Altogether, these results implicate Plac8 as a potential regulator of Th1 CD4 and CD8 T cell responses during Th1 T cell-driven inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3042173284,"Alterations in the cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit might underlie the diversity of symptoms in schizophrenia. However, molecular changes in cerebellar neuronal circuits, part of this network, have not yet been fully determined. Using LC-MS/MS, we screened altered candidates in pooled grey matter of cerebellum from schizophrenia subjects who committed suicide (n = 4) and healthy individuals (n = 4). Further validation by immunoblotting of three selected candidates was performed in two cohorts comprising schizophrenia (n = 20), non-schizophrenia suicide (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 21). We found 99 significantly altered proteins, 31 of them previously reported in other brain areas by proteomic studies. Transport function was the most enriched category, while cell communication was the most prevalent function. For validation, we selected the vacuolar proton pump subunit 1 (VPP1), from transport, and two EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, calmodulin and parvalbumin, from cell communication. All candidates showed significant changes in schizophrenia (n = 7) compared to controls (n = 7). VPP1 was altered in the non-schizophrenia suicide group and increased levels of parvalbumin were linked to antipsychotics. Further validation in an independent cohort of non-suicidal chronic schizophrenia subjects (n = 13) and non-psychiatric controls (n = 14) showed that parvalbumin was increased, while calmodulin was decreased in schizophrenia. Our findings provide evidence of calcium-binding protein dysregulation in the cerebellum in schizophrenia, suggesting an impact on normal calcium-dependent synaptic functioning of cerebellar circuits. Our study also links VPP1 to suicide behaviours, suggesting a possible impairment in vesicle neurotransmitter refilling and release in these phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3041021151,"Physiology-based differentiation of SH genes and Hemileia vastatrix races is the principal method employed for the characterization of coffee leaf rust resistance. Based on the gene-for-gene theory, nine major rust resistance genes (SH1-9) have been proposed. However, these genes have not been characterized at the molecular level. Consequently, the lack of molecular data regarding rust resistance genes or candidates is a major bottleneck in coffee breeding. To address this issue, we screened a BAC library with resistance gene analogs (RGAs), identified RGAs, characterized and explored for any SH related candidate genes. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of a gene (gene 11), which shares conserved sequences with other SH genes and displays a characteristic polymorphic allele conferring different resistance phenotypes. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the two RGAs belonging to CC-NBS-LRR revealed more intense diversifying selection in tomato and grape genomes than in coffee. For the first time, the present study has unveiled novel insights into the molecular nature of the SH genes, thereby opening new avenues for coffee rust resistance molecular breeding. The characterized candidate RGA is of particular importance for further biological function analysis in coffee."
https://openalex.org/W3041429461,"Here we present and justify an approach for minimal-destructive DNA extraction from historic insect specimens for next generation sequencing applications. An increasing number of studies use insects from museum collections for biodiversity research. However, the availability of specimens for molecular analyses has been limited by the degraded nature of the DNA gained from century-old museum material and the consumptive nature of most DNA extraction procedures. The method described in this manuscript enabled us to successfully extract DNA from specimens as old as 241 years using a minimal-destructive approach. The direct comparison of the DNeasy extraction Kit and the Monarch® PCR & DNA Clean-up Kit showed a significant increase of 17.3-fold higher DNA yield extracted with the Monarch Oligo protocol on average. By using an extraction protocol originally designed for oligonucleotide clean-up, we were able to combine overcoming the restrictions by target fragment size and strand state, with minimising time consumption and labour-intensity. The type specimens used for the minimal-destructive DNA extraction exhibited no significant external change or post-extraction damage, while sufficient DNA was retrieved for analyses."

They play a crucial role in setting the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability. These channels form homodimers; however, a few examples of heterodimerization have also been reported. The K2P channel subunits TRESK and TREK-2 provide the predominant background potassium current in the primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. A recent study has shown that a TRESK mutation causes migraine because it leads to the formation of a dominant negative truncated TRESK fragment. Surprisingly, this fragment can also interact with TREK-2. In this study, we determined the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the TRESK/TREK-2 heterodimer using a covalently linked TRESK/TREK-2 construct to ensure the assembly of the different subunits. The tandem channel has an intermediate single-channel conductance compared with the TRESK and TREK-2 homodimers. Similar conductance values were recorded when TRESK and TREK-2 were coexpressed, demonstrating that the two subunits can spontaneously form functional heterodimers. The TRESK component confers calcineurin-dependent regulation to the heterodimer and gives rise to a pharmacological profile similar to the TRESK homodimer, whereas the presence of the TREK-2 subunit renders the channel sensitive to the selective TREK-2 activator T2A3. In trigeminal primary sensory neurons, we detected single-channel activity with biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to the TRESK/TREK-2 tandem, indicating that WT TRESK and TREK-2 subunits coassemble to form functional heterodimeric channels also in native cells.

A frameshift mutation (F139WFsX24), which leads to the expression of a nonfunctional TRESK subunit and causes neuronal hyperexcitability, has been identified in a family suffering from migraine (23Lafrenière R.G.

Since then, another missense TRESK mutation (C110R) has been identified (25Andres-Enguix I. Shang L. Stansfeld P.J. Morahan J.M. Sansom M.S. Lafrenière R.G. Roy B. Griffiths L.R. Rouleau G.A.

Rep. 2012; 2 (22355750): 23710.1038/srep00237Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the C110R mutant TRESK did not influence neuronal excitability, despite having a dominant negative effect on TRESK in heterologous expression systems (26Guo Z. Liu P. Ren F. Cao Y.Q. Nonmigraine-associated TRESK K+ channel variant C110R does not increase the excitability of trigeminal ganglion neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 112 (24805079): 568-57910.1152/jn.00267.2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that TRESK can interact with TREK channels in heterologous expression systems (27Royal P. Andres-Bilbe A. Avalos Prado P. Verkest C. Wdziekonski B. Schaub S. Baron A. Lesage F. Gasull X. Levitz J. Sandoz G. Migraine-associated TRESK mutations increase neuronal excitability through alternative translation initiation and inhibition of TREK.Neuron. 2019; 101 (30573346): 232-245.e610.1016/j.neuron.2018.11.039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the frameshift mutation creates an alternative translation initiation site in the TRESK mRNA, which results in the translation of two nonfunctional TRESK fragments (MT1 and MT2). The pathogenic TRESK frameshift mutation has a dominant negative effect on both TRESK and TREK channels. The N-terminal fragment (MT1) exerts a dominant negative effect on TRESK, whereas the MT2 fragment inhibits TREK channels. The expression of the C-terminal fragment (MT2) was sufficient to induce hyperexcitability in trigeminal ganglion neurons and mechanical allodynia in rat models of migraine (27Royal P. Andres-Bilbe A. Avalos Prado P. Verkest C. Wdziekonski B. Schaub S. Baron A. Lesage F. Gasull X. Levitz J. Sandoz G.

In this paper, we used whole-cell and single-channel electrophysiology to investigate the heterodimerization of WT and different constitutively active or silenced mutant versions of TRESK and TREK-2 subunits. We report that the TRESK/TREK-2 heterodimer has distinctive biophysical, pharmacological, and regulatory properties compared with TRESK and TREK-2 homodimers. Based on these unique features of the heterodimeric channel, we show that WT TRESK and TREK-2 subunits also coassemble to form functional heterodimers in trigeminal ganglion neurons. Mouse TREK-2 channel was expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Background K+ currents were estimated at −100 mV in 80 mm K+ after subtraction of the nonspecific leak current measured in 2 mm K+. TREK-2 current was activated by T2A3 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Application of 10 μm T2A3 activated TREK-2 current 15.5 ± 7.2-fold (n = 7 oocytes), whereas 30 μm T2A3 increased the current 43.2 ± 25.8-fold (n = 7 oocytes). The concentration–response relationship is summarized in Fig. 1B. T2A3 was reported to have no effect on the currents of the closely related TREK-1 channel (28Dadi P.K. Vierra N.C. Days E. Dickerson M.T. Vinson P.N. Weaver C.D. Jacobson D.A. Selective small molecule activators of TREK-2 channels stimulate dorsal root ganglion c-fiber nociceptor two-pore-domain potassium channel currents and limit calcium influx.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2017; 8 (27805811): 558-56810.1021/acschemneuro.6b00301Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of the effect of T2A3 on TREK-2 in the whole K2P subfamily, we applied 10 and 30 μm T2A3 on several mouse K2P channels: TASK-1, TASK-2, TASK-3, TREK-1, TREK-2, TRAAK, TASK-1, TASK-2, TASK-3, TALK-1, THIK-1, and TRESK. Among all examined K2P channels, the stimulatory effect of T2A3 was the most robust in the case of TREK-2. TASK-2 was also stimulated by the compound (1.6 ± 0.4-fold at 10 μm and 3.1 ± 1.8-fold at 30 μm, n = 5 oocytes); however, the degree of stimulation was significantly smaller than that of TREK-2. All other K2P channels were unaffected by the compound. For the summary of the results of our selectivity screening, see Fig. 1 (C and D). A recent study (27Royal P. Andres-Bilbe A. Avalos Prado P. Verkest C. Wdziekonski B. Schaub S. Baron A. Lesage F. Gasull X. Levitz J. Sandoz G. Migraine-associated TRESK mutations increase neuronal excitability through alternative translation initiation and inhibition of TREK.Neuron. 2019; 101 (30573346): 232-245.e610.1016/j.neuron.2018.11.039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) has shown that the migraine-causing TRESK frameshift mutation leads to the generation of nonfunctional TRESK fragments, which have dominant negative effects on both TRESK and TREK current. To examine the interaction between TREK-2 and the full-length TRESK subunit, we generated a loss-of-function, dominant negative (DN) TRESK subunit by mutating the second glycine residue of the first pore domain to glutamate (TRESK G131E, “TRESKDN”). Similar mutations were previously used to generate dominant negative subunits in other K2P channels (17Blin S. Ben Soussia I. Kim E.J. Brau F. Kang D. Lesage F. Bichet D.

In the present study, we first verified that TRESKDN exerted a dominant negative effect when coexpressed with WT TRESK. In these experiments, the target channel (WT TRESK) and the dominant negative mutant were expressed at a ratio of 1:3 while keeping the total amount of DNA fixed at 2 µg. Coexpression of TRESK and the control pCD8 plasmid resulted in a large conductance (44.7 ± 23.1 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 9 cells; Fig. 2A). The coexpression of TRESK and TRESKDN-pCD8 efficiently decreased the current (11.5 ± 5.6 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 9 cells; Fig. 2A). The effect of TRESKDN-pCD8 expression on TRESK current is summarized in Fig. 2 (B and C). The decrease in current was statistically significant (p = 0.003). In the next set of experiments, the effect of TRESKDN on the TREK-2 current was examined. When TREK-2 and the control pCD8 plasmid were expressed, a large whole-cell conductance was recorded (44.6 ± 30.4 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 9 cells; Fig. 2D). Coexpression of TREK-2 and TRESKDN-pCD8 lead to greatly decreased current (5.2 ± 2.4 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 8 cells; Fig. 2D) compared with the control plasmid. The current recorded in these cells is similar to the endogenous currents recorded in HEK293T cells that have been transfected with control pCD8 plasmid (5.9 ± 1.7 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 10 cells; Fig. S1). The effect of TRESKDN-pCD8 expression on TREK-2 current is summarized in Fig. 2 (E and F). The decrease in current was statistically significant (p = 8 × 10−5), showing that TRESKDN has a dominant negative effect on TREK-2. The inhibitory effect of TRESKDN on both TRESK and TREK-2 current could be a consequence of decreased expression of the WT channel due to increased competition for the translational and processing machinery of the cell. To rule out this possibility, we examined the effect of TRESKDN coexpression on the current amplitude of a distantly related potassium channel, Kv1.3. When Kv1.3 and the control pCD8 plasmids were expressed, a large voltage-sensitive conductance was recorded (62.4 ± 36.6 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 9 cells; Fig. 2G). Coexpression of Kv1.3 and TRESKDN-pCD8 lead to whole-cell currents with a similar amplitude (69.1 ± 37.8 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 9 cells; Fig. 2G). TRESKDN-pCD8 expression had no effect on Kv1.3 current (p = 0.86), as summarized in Fig. 2 (H and I). Previous work from both our and other laboratories has shown that assembly of K2P channel heterodimers can be forced by using a “tandem” construct in which the two different subunits are covalently linked (16Lengyel M. Czirják G. Enyedi P. Formation of functional heterodimers by TREK-1 and TREK-2 two-pore domain potassium channel subunits.J. Biol.

To study the properties of the TRESK/TREK-2 heterodimer, we assembled a TRESK/TREK tandem channel by joining the N terminus of the mouse TREK-2 subunit to the C terminus of the TRESK channel using a 2-amino acid linker. When the tandem construct was expressed in HEK293T cells, we were able to record a potassium conductance (62.6 ± 41.2 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 9 cells; Fig. 2J). When we introduced the G131E mutation into the tandem channel, the current was negligible (7.5 ± 3.3 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 9 cells; Fig. 2J), similar to the endogenous currents recorded in HEK293T cells that have been only transfected with pCD8 plasmid without channel DNA (5.9 ± 1.7 pA/pF at 0 mV, n = 10 cells; Fig. S1). The decrease in current caused by the mutation was statistically significant (p = 4 × 10−5). The current of the tandem constructs is summarized in Fig. 2 (K and L). Similar results were observed when these constructs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes (data not shown). Accordingly, the tandem construct can be considered as an appropriate model for heterodimerization of TRESK and TREK-2 and was used to determine the pharmacological and biophysical properties of the TRESK/TREK-2 heterodimer. The TRESK channel is activated via dephosphorylation by the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin. When the oocytes expressing the TRESK/TREK-2 tandem construct were stimulated with ionomycin (0.5 μm), the activation of the K+ current was observed (8.7 ± 3.2-fold, n = 7 oocytes; Fig. 3A). The degree of activation by ionomycin was similar to previously reported values for TRESK and the TRESK/TREK-1 tandem channel (5Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P.

We have recently reported that an analog (A2764) of the selective TRESK activator cloxyquin inhibits TRESK (9Lengyel M. Erdélyi F. Pergel E. Bálint-Polonka Á. Dobolyi A. Bozsaki P. Dux M. Király K.

The application of A2764 (100 μm) to oocytes expressing the tandem channel inhibited the TRESK/TREK-2 current (24 ± 11% inhibition, n = 6 oocytes; Fig. 3B). When the current was activated by ionomycin before the application of A2764, the inhibition was significantly more pronounced (70 ± 7%, n = 6 oocytes; Fig. 3C; p = 8 × 10−6). The effect of T2A3 on the TRESK/TREK-2 tandem was examined as described in Fig. 1 Application of T2A3 (10 μm) increased the current of the tandem channel 8.2 ± 6.2-fold (n = 7 oocytes; Fig. 3D), whereas a higher concentration of T2A3 (30 μm) evoked an even more substantial, 47.1 ± 22.3-fold activation. In the next set of experiments, we applied T2A3 to previously activated tandem channels. In the experiment shown on Fig. 3E, channels were first activated by ionomycin (9.8 ± 3.7-fold, n = 8 oocytes). Application of 10 μm T2A3 stimulated the current a further 2.6 ± 0.6-fold (n = 8), leading to a final activation of 25.6 ± 8.6-fold, compared with the basal current. In a separate set of experiments, oocytes expressing the tandem channel were stimulated with the selective TRESK activator cloxyquin (100 μm), resulting in a 4.8 ± 1.1-fold activation of the current (n = 6 oocytes), as seen on Fig. 3F. Subsequent application of T2A3 further increased the current (2.5 ± 0.6-fold, n = 6). The final activation compared with the unstimulated current was 12.1 ± 1.2-fold.

TRESK channels were expressed in HEK293T cells, and the currents were recorded in symmetrical high-K+ solutions in excised inside-out patches at −60, 0, and +60 mV. To obtain channels in the dephosphorylated state, cells were treated with 0.5 μm ionomycin prior to patch excision (Fig. 4A). We observed the unique asymmetric single-channel gating of TRESK (5Czirják G. Tóth Z.E. Enyedi P. The two-pore domain K+ channel, TRESK, is activated by the cytoplasmic calcium signal through calcineurin.J. Biol.

For ease of analysis, we determined the single-channel conductance and open probability (Po) at +60 mV. The single-channel conductance of the channel was 15.1 ± 2.8 pS (n = 6 patches), which is similar to previously reported values. The open probability of the dephosphorylated channel was 0.24 ± 0.08 (n = 6 patches). When channels were maintained in the phosphorylated state before recording by overnight treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (1 μm), the channel activity was much lower (Fig. 4B). The single-channel conductance under these conditions was 13.8 ± 0.7 pS (n = 6 patches), which was not significantly different from the conductance of the ionomycin-pretreated channels (p = 0.27). In contrast, the open probability of the cyclosporine-pretreated channels was significantly lower (Po = 0.008 ± 0.007, n = 6 patches) than the Po of the ionomycin-pretreated group (p = 9 × 10−4). For the summary of our results, see Fig. 4 (C and D). In two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments, we have shown that similarly to the TRESK homodimer, the TRESK/TREK-2 tandem channel can also be activated by ionomycin application. The calcineurin-dependent regulation of the TRESK/TREK-2 single channels were examined by a similar approach as used for the homodimeric TRESK channel.

For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes a specific, large-fold increase in the steady-state abundance of intracellular desmosterol, an immediate precursor of cholesterol, resulting in increased fluidity of the membrane where HCV RNA replication occurs. Here, we establish the mechanism responsible for HCV's effect on intracellular desmosterol, whereby the HCV NS3-4A protease controls activity of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol. Our cumulative evidence for the proposed mechanism includes immunofluorescence microscopy experiments showing co-occurrence of DHCR24 and HCV NS3-4A protease; formation of an additional, faster-migrating DHCR24 species (DHCR24*) in cells harboring a HCV subgenomic replicon RNA or ectopically expressing NS3-4A; and biochemical evidence that NS3-4A cleaves DHCR24 to produce DHCR24* in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that NS3-4A cleaves DHCR24 between residues Cys91 and Thr92 and show that this reduces the intracellular conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol. Together, these studies demonstrate that NS3-4A directly cleaves DHCR24 and that this results in the enrichment of desmosterol in the membranes where NS3-4A and DHCR24 co-occur.

Both proteomic and lipidomic profiling by targeted liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have shown that HCV perturbs multiple host lipid biosynthetic pathways (14Diamond D.L. Syder A.J.

Additionally, unbiased lipidomic MS profiling by our laboratory previously discovered that HCV causes a 10-fold increase in intracellular desmosterol, an immediate precursor to cholesterol, without affecting the abundance of cholesterol (15Rodgers M.A. Villareal V.A.

We demonstrated that the HCV-induced accumulation of desmosterol is functionally important for HCV replication, as evidenced by strong reduction of accumulated HCV RNA when desmosterol is depleted from cells and restoration of HCV RNA levels upon addition of exogenous desmosterol but not cholesterol (15Rodgers M.A. Villareal V.A.

However, how HCV regulates host metabolism to cause an increase in the steady-state abundance of desmosterol remains unknown. Here, we establish a mechanism used by HCV to regulate desmosterol abundance. The mechanism involves post-translational regulation of the key enzyme in desmosterol metabolism, 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), which converts desmosterol to cholesterol. Our study reveals that DHCR24 is proteolytically cleaved between Cys91 and Thr92 by HCV NS3-4A protease, resulting in inactivation of DHCR24 and accumulation of desmosterol in the replication membranes where NS3-4A and DHCR24 co-reside. This, in turn, is associated with robust HCV replication. Together, our studies suggest a model in which the HCV NS3-4A protease remodels the host lipid membrane by directly interacting with and cleaving a host biosynthetic enzyme to generate a chemical environment that promotes increased viral RNA replication. Desmosterol is produced in the Bloch branch of late-stage cholesterol biosynthesis by reduction of 7-dehydrodesmosterol by 7-dehydrodesmosterol reductase (DHCR7). Under normal physiological conditions, desmosterol does not accumulate and is rapidly converted to cholesterol by DHCR24 (Fig. 1A). Because HCV has no known gene products capable of catalyzing lipid synthesis or metabolism, we investigated whether HCV perturbs the expression of DHCR7 and DHCR24. For these experiments, we used autonomously replicating RNAs encoding either the full-length HCV polyprotein (full-length genomic replicon, or FGR) or encoding only the NS3-5B proteins (subgenomic replicon, or SGR) (Fig. 1B) (18Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Furusaka A. Tokushige K. Mizokami M. Wakita T. Efficient replication of the genotype 2a hepatitis C virus subgenomic replicon.Gastroenterology. 2003; 125 (14724833): 1808-181710.1053/j.gastro.2003.09.023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). These and other replicon systems are well-established models for studying HCV gene expression and RNA replication in the absence of the complicating effects of viral entry, assembly, or egress. We first quantified DHCR7 and DHCR24 transcripts by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay and found that the abundance of these transcripts is unaffected by the presence or absence of the HCV full-genomic and subgenomic replicon RNAs (Fig. 1C). This finding is consistent with transcript profiling studies showing that HCV infection induces no changes in DHCR7 or DHCR24 mRNA abundance (19Blackham S. Baillie A. Al-Hababi F. Remlinger K. You S. Hamatake R. McGarvey M.J. Gene expression profiling indicates the roles of host oxidative stress, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and intracellular transport genes in the replication of hepatitis C virus.J.

Next, we examined the steady-state abundance of DHCR7 or DHCR24 proteins by immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates and detected no differences between cells harboring HCV replicon RNAs and negative control cells (Fig. 1D). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that noncoding RNAs might regulate translation of DHCR7 and/or DHCR24 mRNAs, this does not appear to happen to a significant extent based on the steady-state abundance of DHCR7 and DHCR24 proteins. These data show that HCV's effect on desmosterol homeostasis does not involve changes in the expression or abundance of DHCR7 and DHCR24. This led us to consider the possibility that HCV increases intracellular desmosterol by either increasing DHCR7 activity or decreasing DHCR24 activity. Because neither enzyme is known to be rate-determining for the pathway and because desmosterol is rapidly converted to cholesterol under normal physiological conditions, we deemed a virus-associated reduction in the DHCR24-catalyzed conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol to be the more likely scenario. To investigate this possibility, cells harboring HCV replicon RNAs and negative control cells were treated with medium containing deuterated desmosterol (desmosterol-d6), and conversion of the desmosterol-d6 to cholesterol-d6 was monitored over time by LC-MS analysis of extracted lipidomes. Conversion of desmosterol-d6 to cholesterol-d6 was reduced in cells harboring the HCV subgenomic replicon or treated with U18666A, a small molecule known to inhibit DHCR24's enzymatic activity and intracellular sterol transport (21Takano T.

This observation supports the proposal that HCV negatively regulates DHCR24 activity. Because HCV has no effect on DHCR7 or DHCR24 expression or abundance yet appears to affect the DHCR24-catalyzed reaction in cells, we next investigated whether DHCR24 is post-translationally modified in the presence of the virus. Immunoblot analysis of cells transfected with a C-terminal FLAG-tagged DHCR7 or DHCR24 (DHCR7–FLAG and DHCR24–FLAG respectively) revealed an additional, faster-migrating DHCR24-FLAG species in the presence of HCV SGR (Fig. 2A). We confirmed that formation of this faster-migrating DHCR24 species (DHCR24*) was not an artifact of ectopic expression of DHCR24–FLAG by demonstrating that DHCR24* is detected when endogenous DHCR24 is immunoprecipitated from cells harboring the SGR (Fig. 2B). To map which of the HCV proteins expressed by the subgenomic replicon (NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is sufficient to induce formation of DHCR24*, we first co-expressed NS3-4A and NS5A individually with DHCR24–FLAG (Fig. 2C). NS3 contains a C-terminal helicase domain and an N-terminal serine protease domain that requires its cofactor NS4A for catalytic activity (25Raney K.D. Sharma S.D. Moustafa I.M. Cameron C.E.

Although no inherent enzymatic function has been reported for NS5A, it is known to affect host lipids through interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase α (8Reiss S. Rebhan I. Backes P.

We found that expression of the NS3-4A protease is sufficient to induce formation of DHCR24*–FLAG. Production of DHCR24*–FLAG requires active protease activity because no DHCR24*–FLAG is produced in the presence of the NS3-4A inhibitor danoprevir or when NS3 is expressed alone without NS4A. Further, production of DHCR24* is lost when a catalytic residue in the protease active site is mutated (NS3-4A–H57A) (28Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M.

Together, these results demonstrate that formation of DHCR24* requires the active NS3-4A serine protease domain. We further validated that the active NS3-4A protease is sufficient to generate DHCR24* by immunoprecipitating DHCR24–FLAG from uninfected cells and incubating this protein with recombinant NS3-4A. This successfully recapitulated formation of DHCR24*–FLAG in vitro (Fig. 2E). This in vitro reaction is blocked in the presence of telaprevir, a Food and Drug Administration–approved NS3-4A inhibitor, or a competitive peptide mimetic (31Lin C. Kwong A.D. Perni R.B. Discovery and development of VX-950, a novel, covalent, and reversible inhibitor of hepatitis C virus NS3.4A serine protease.Infect. Disord.

Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the NS3-4A protease causes production of DHCR24*. To examine the possibility that NS3-4A directly cleaves DHCR24, we isolated the two DHCR24 species observed by SDS-PAGE following incubation of immunoprecipitated DHCR24–FLAG with recombinant NS3-4A protease in vitro. “Bottom-up” LC-MS/MS analysis of the isolated species demonstrated that both bear the FLAG-derived DYKDDDDK sequence and thus are derived from DHCR24–FLAG (Fig. S1). Likewise, LC-MS/MS analysis of endogenous DHCR24 immunoprecipitated from cells harboring the HCV subgenomic replicon verified that both products are derived from DHCR24 (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that DHCR24 is a substrate for NS3-4A–mediated proteolysis. Due to several technical issues, including difficulty in driving complete conversion of immunoprecipitated DHCR24 to DHCR24*, poor ionization of the reaction products, and limited recovery of recombinant DHCR24 proteins due to high hydrophobicity, we were unable to identify the position of the cleavage site by LC-MS/MS. To facilitate expression and purification of DHCR24, we fused it to a maltose-binding protein (MBP) at its N terminus. We then expressed the MBP–DHCR24 fusion with a bacteria-derived cell-free, in vitro translation system (33Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Cell-free translation reconstituted with purified components.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19 (11479568): 751-75510.1038/90802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar) and purified it by using magnetic amylose resin. Incubation of recombinant NS3-4A with the MBP–DHCR24 from this heterologous expression system produced a species akin to DHCR24* from HCV replicon cells (Fig. S2). Immunoblotting with an antibody that recognizes an epitope in the region between 68 and 85 of DHCR24 suggested that the cleavage site is located between the putative transmembrane region (residue 52) and the catalytic region (residue 110) of DHCR24 (Fig. 3A). To specifically investigate the 56–110 region of DHCR24 as a substrate for NS3-4A, a surrogate peptide spanning this region was expressed as a fusion between the soluble proteins MBP and GFP, with a FLAG tag at the C terminus (Fig. 3B). Incubation of this purified test substrate with recombinant NS3-4A produces cleavage fragments (Fig. 3C) that are not observed in the absence of NS3-4A or in the presence of the NS3-4A inhibitor telaprevir. Next, we used two 15-mer surrogate peptides corresponding to residues 52–66 (Fig. 3D) and 85–99 (Fig. 3E) of DHCR24 to map the NS3-4A proteolysis site. Reaction of recombinant NS3-4A with the substrate spanning residues 85–99 led to two distinct products and a proportionate decrease in the full-length substrate. We purified the two product species and subjected them to N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation. This revealed an N-terminal sequence of TGRPG, corresponding to the sequence of DHCR24 beginning at Thr92, and suggested that the peptide bond between residues Cys91 and Thr92 is the target of NS3-4A cleavage (Fig. 3E). Consistent with this hypothesis, NS3-4A is well-known to have a strong preference for Cys in the P1 site, and we found that replacement of Pro with Cys, a substitution known to inhibit proteolysis of membrane-bound enzymes by proteases (34Frey S. Görlich D. A new set of highly efficient, tag-cleaving proteases for purifying recombinant proteins.J. Chromatogr.

To examine the effect of proteolysis of DHCR24 by NS3-4A on the conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol in cells, we performed genome editing to “knock out” DHCR24 expression in Huh7.5 cells (Fig. S3) and then monitored the fate of desmosterol-d6 in cells ectopically expressing DHCR24–FLAG. As expected, WT DHCR24–FLAG supports conversion of desmosterol-d6 to cholesterol-d6 in Huh7.5-DHCR24KO cells. Co-expression of recombinant NS3-4A reduces the conversion of desmosterol-d6 to cholesterol-d6 to approximately half of the conversion observed in the control cells expressing only DHCR24–FLAG (Fig. 4A). This reduction in intracellular DHCR24 activity is furthermore associated with proteolytic cleavage of DHCR24 by the viral protease, as reflected by the appearance of a species corresponding to DHCR24*-FLAG (Fig. 4B). Importantly, the conversion of desmosterol-d6 to cholesterol-d6 is far less affected when telaprevir is used to inhibit NS3-4A protease activity or when the inactive NS3(H57A)-4A mutant is expressed (Fig. 4A). Conversion of desmosterol-d6 to cholesterol-d6 in these protease-inhibited samples does not differ in a statistically significant manner from the control samples in which DHCR24-FLAG is expressed alone without NS3-4A present. In contrast, the telaprevir-treated and NS3(H57A)-4A mutant samples do exhibit significantly reduced conversion of desmosterol-d6 to cholesterol-d6 compared to the samples in which NS3-4A and DHCR24 are co-expressed. These data thus provide a link between proteolytic activity of NS3-4A, cleavage of DHCR24, and changes in the DHCR24-catalyzed conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol. Since cleavage of DHCR24 between Cys91 and Thr92 is predicted to separate the N-terminal membrane-associated domain from the FAD-binding and catalytic domain, we hypothesized that this might affect DHCR24-catalyzed conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol by releasing the catalytic domain from the ER membrane.

Age and nutritional intake are major factors that contribute to osteoporosis prevalence. This study examined the relationship between markers of poverty with calcium / vitamin D intake and osteoporosis. A cross-sectional analysis of the United States population was performed using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2007-2010 and 2013-2014 for older US adults (n = 3,901 participants, 50 years old and older). Odds of inadequate calcium / vitamin D intake and dietary supplement use and risk of probable osteoporosis were calculated in order to determine the relative difference and possible associations between household income, the Family Monthly Poverty Level Index, food security, and participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). A sub-analysis of ethnic disparities and biological sex was also performed. In general, women age 50 and older consistently have inadequate calcium intake, regardless of economic level including poverty. While inadequate calcium intake has a larger prevalence among women, markers of poverty increased the risk of inadequate calcium intake in all men and risk of osteoporosis among some subgroups, with the exception of SNAP program participation. Over one fourth of Non-Hispanic black men in the US are below the poverty line. Approximately half of this population has inadequate calcium (58.9%) and vitamin D (46.7%) intake. Typically, osteoporosis risk is relatively low for Non-Hispanic Black males, however considering poverty status, risk is significantly increased (Relative Risk Ratio [RR]: 2.057 ± 0.012) for those with low income suggesting that calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be of benefit for this population."
https://openalex.org/W3041367363,"Compared to the osteological record of herbivorous dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous Prince Creek Formation of northern Alaska, there are relatively fewer remains of theropods. The theropod record from this unit is mostly comprised of isolated teeth, and the only non-dental remains known can be attributed to the troodontid cf. Troodon and the tyrannosaurid Nanuqsaurus. Thus far, the presence of members of Dromaeosauridae has been limited to isolated teeth. Here we describe a symphyseal portion of a small dentary with two ziphodont teeth. Based on tooth shape, denticle morphology, and the position of the Meckelian groove, we attribute this partial dentary to a saurornitholestine dromaeosaurid. The fibrous bone surface, small size, and higher number of mesial denticles compared to distal ones point to a juvenile growth stage for this individual. Multivariate comparison of theropod teeth morphospace by means of principal component analysis reveals an overlap between this dentary and Saurornitholestinae dromaeosaurid morphospace, a result supported by phylogenetic analyses. This is the first confirmed non-dental fossil specimen from a member of Dromaeosauridae in the Arctic, expanding on the role of Beringia as a dispersal route for this clade between Asia and North America. Furthermore, the juvenile nature of this individual adds to a growing body of data that suggests Cretaceous Arctic dinosaurs of Alaska did not undergo long-distance migration, but rather they were year-round residents of these paleopolar latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W3038263342,"The xbp-1 mRNA encodes the XBP-1 transcription factor, a critical part of the unfolded protein response. Here we report that an RNA fragment produced from xbp-1 mRNA cleavage is a biologically active non-coding RNA (ncRNA) essential for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that the xbp-1 ncRNA acts independently of the protein-coding function of the xbp-1 transcript as part of a dual output xbp-1 mRNA stress response axis. Structural analysis indicates that the function of the xbp-1 ncRNA depends on a single RNA stem; this stem forms only in the cleaved xbp-1 ncRNA fragment. Disruption of this stem abolishes the non-coding, but not the coding, function of the endogenous xbp-1 transcript. Thus, cleavage of the xbp-1 mRNA bifurcates it into a coding and a non-coding pathway; modulation of the two pathways may allow neurons to fine-tune their response to injury and other stresses."
https://openalex.org/W3040889248,"Most European fishing fleets will need to drastically reduce their unwanted catches to comply with new rules of the common fisheries policy. A more practical way to avoid increasing on-board sorting time and issues linked to storage capacity is to prevent unwanted catches in the first place. We assessed the selectivity properties of an experimental fishing gear that combined a 100 mm T90 cylinder with 130 meshes in the extension and a 100 mm T90 codend of 33 meshes (experimental gear) compared to a 100 mm diamond mesh extension and codend (control gear) during commercial trips using twin trawls. Analysis of the relative size composition of catches indicated a significantly higher escapement of small fish of several target species (e.g. Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis, Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Raja spp, and Lophius spp) and non-target species (e.g. Capros aper and Gurnards spp) from the T90 experimental trawl compared to the control trawl (n = 49 hauls), resulting in a significant reduction of unwanted catches of Gadidae, Triglidae, and Caproidae. In contrast, non-negligible commercial losses of small grade target gadoid species were observed. Mixed general linear models showed that the proportion of ray, haddock and anglerfish retained per length class decreased with increased tow duration. The T90 experimental gear will perform at a commercial level when targeting monkfish, megrim, rays and large haddock, however fishers are not likely to use this gear when targeting smaller-bodied species such as cephalopods, small haddock, whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and hake (Merluccius merluccius), because the gear is likely to allow large numbers to escape. Selectivity studies often focus on a short list of target species; however, catches of non-target species under quota can be problematic for some fisheries. For example, under the implementation of the Landing Obligation catches of boarfish could choke the French whitefish demersal fisheries in the Celtic sea, as France has no national quota for that species. The device tested constitutes an efficient solution to mitigate catches for such non-target schooling fish."

It is resistant to Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae infection, the causative agent of mycoplasma ovipneumonia, a chronic respiratory disease that is harmful to the sheep industry. To date, knowledge regarding the mechanisms responsible for M. ovipneumoniae pathogenesis in scant. Herein, we report the results of transcriptome profiling of lung tissues from Bashbay sheep experimentally infected with an M. ovipneumoniae strain at 4 and 14 days post-infection, in comparison to mock-infected animals (0 d). Transcriptome profiling was performed by deep RNA sequencing, using the Illumina platform. The analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed to determine concomitant gene-specific temporal patterns of mRNA expression in the lungs after M. ovipneumoniae infection. We found 1048 differentially expressed genes (575 up-regulated, 473 down-regulated) when comparing transcriptomic data at 4 and 0 days post-infection, and 2823 (1362 up-regulated, 1461 down-regulated) when comparing 14 versus 0 days post-infection. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes at 4 and 14 versus 0 days post-infection were enriched in 245 and 287 pathways, respectively, and the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway was considered most closely related to MO infection (p < 0.01). Two pathways (LAMP-TLR2/TLR6-MyD88-MKK6-AP1-IL1B and LAMP-TLR8MyD88-IRF5-RANTES) were identified based on the TLR signaling pathway from differentially expressed genes related M. ovipneumoniae infection. Gene Ontology analysis showed that differentially expressed genes in different groups were enriched for 1580 and 4561 terms, where those most closely related to M. ovipneumoniae infection are positive regulators of inflammatory responses (p < 0.01). These results could aid in understanding how M. ovipneumoniae infection progresses in the lungs and may provide useful information regarding key regulatory pathways."

In yeast, LiCl treatment is reported to reduce the activity and alters the expression of PGM2, a gene that encodes a phosphoglucomutase involved in sugar metabolism. Reduced activity of phosphoglucomutase in the presence of galactose causes an accumulation of intermediate metabolites of galactose metabolism leading to a number of phenotypes including growth defect. In the current study, we identify two understudied yeast genes, YTA6 and YPR096C that when deleted, cell sensitivity to LiCl is increased when galactose is used as a carbon source. The 5'-UTR of PGM2 mRNA is structured. Using this region, we show that YTA6 and YPR096C influence the translation of PGM2 mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W3041541944,"Understanding how bees use resources at a landscape scale is essential for developing meaningful management plans that sustain populations and the pollination services they provide. Bumblebees are important pollinators for many wild and cultivated plants, and have experienced steep population declines worldwide. Bee foraging behavior can be influenced by resource availability and bees’ lifecycle stage. To better understand these relationships, we studied the habitat selection of Bombus pauloensis by tracking 17 queen bumblebees with radio telemetry in blueberry fields in Entre Ríos province, Argentina. To evaluate land use and floral resources used by bumblebees, we tracked bees before and after nest establishment and estimated home ranges using minimum convex polygons and kernel density methods. We also classified the pollen on their bodies to identify the floral resources they used from the floral species available at that time. We characterized land use for each bee as the relative proportion of GPS points inside of each land use. Bumblebees differed markedly in their movement behavior in relation to pre and post nest establishment. Bees moved over larger areas, and mostly within blueberry fields, before nest establishment. In contrast, after establishing the nest, the bees preferred the edges near forest plantations and they changed the nutritional resources to prefer wild floral species. Our study is the first to track queen bumblebee movements in an agricultural setting and relate movement changes across time and space with pollen resource availability. This study provides insight into the way bumblebee queens use different habitat elements at crucial periods in their lifecycle, showing the importance of mass flowering crops like blueberry in the first stages of queen’s lifecycle, and how diversified landscapes help support bee populations as their needs changes during different phases of their lifecycle."
https://openalex.org/W3041103600,"Recent reviews on sexual dichromatism in frogs included Mannophryne trinitatis as the only example they could find of dynamic dichromatism (males turn black when calling) within the family Aromobatidae and found no example of ontogenetic dichromatism in this group. We demonstrate ontogenetic dichromatism in M. trinitatis by rearing post-metamorphic froglets to near maturity: the throats of all individuals started as grey coloured; at around seven weeks, the throat became pale yellow in some, and more strongly yellow as development proceeded; the throats of adults are grey in males and variably bright yellow in females, backed by a dark collar. We demonstrated the degree of throat colour variability by analysing a large sample of females. The red: green (R:G) ratio ranged from ~1.1 to 1.4, reflecting variation from yellow to yellow/orange, and there was also variation in the tone and width of the dark collar, and in the extent to which the yellow colouration occurred posterior to the collar. Female M. trinitatis are known to be territorial in behaviour. We show a positive relationship between throat colour (R:G ratio) and escape performance, as a proxy for quality. Our field observations on Tobago’s M. olmonae showed variability in female throat colour and confirmed that males in this species also turn black when calling. Our literature review of the 20 Mannophryne species so far named showed that all females have yellow throats with dark collars, and that male colour change to black when calling has been reported in eight species; in the remaining 12 species, descriptions of males calling are usually lacking so far. We predict that both dynamic and ontogenetic sexual dichromatism are universal in this genus and provide discussion of the ecological role of dichromatism in this genus of predominantly diurnal, non-toxic frogs, with strong paternal care of offspring."

The mechanical properties of biodegradable stent materials play a key role in the safety and efficacy of treatment. In particular, insufficient creep resistance of the stent material could result in premature stent collapse or narrowing. Commercially available biodegradable self-expandable SX-ELLA stents made of polydioxanone monofilament were tested. A new, simple, and affordable method to measure the shear modulus of tiny viscoelastic wires is presented. The important mechanical parameters of the polydioxanone filament were obtained: the median Young’s modulus was = 958 (922, 974) MPa and the shear modulus was = 357 (185, 387) MPa, resulting in a Poisson’s ratio of ν = 0.34. The SX-ELLA stents exhibited significant force relaxation due to the stress relaxation of the polydioxanone monofilament, approximately 19% and 36% 10 min and 48 h after stent application, respectively. However, these results were expected, and the manufacturer and implanting clinician should be aware of the known behavior of these biodegradable materials. If possible, a biodegradable stent should be designed considering therapeutic force rather than initial force. Additionally, new and more advanced biodegradable shape-memory polymers should be considered for future study and use."

The recent acceleration of research into sexual orientation, gender identity, and mental health has generally been conducted without sufficient understanding of the opinions of sexual and gender minorities (SGM) toward this research. We surveyed 768 individuals, with an enrichment of LGBTQ+ stakeholders, for their opinions regarding genetic research of SGM and mental health. We found that the key predictors of attitudes toward genetic research specifically on SGM are 1) general attitudes toward genetic and mental health research 2) tolerance of SGM and associated behaviors and 3) age of the participant. Non-heterosexual stakeholder status was significantly associated with increased willingness to participate in genetic research if a biological basis for gender identity were discovered. We also found that heterosexual, cisgender participants with a low tolerance for SGM indicated their SGM views would be positively updated if science showed a biological basis for their behaviors and identities. These findings represent an important first step in understanding and engaging the LGBTQ+ stakeholder community in the context of genetic research."

In addition, these devices are generic and do not adapt to the users’ grasping behavior. Potentially, a human-oriented design process could generate an improved design. While current research done on human grasping was aimed at finding common properties within the research population, we investigated the dynamic patterns that make human grasping behavior distinct rather than generalized, i.e. subject specific. Experiments were conducted on 31 subjects who performed grasping tasks on five different objects. The kinematics and kinetics parameters were measured using a motion capture system and force sensors. The collected data was processed through a pipeline of dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms. Using finger joint angles and reaction forces as our features, we were able to classify these tasks with over 95% success. In addition, we examined the effects of the objects’ mechanical properties on those patterns and the significance of the different features for the differentiation. Our results suggest that grasping patterns are, indeed, subject-specific; this, in turn, could suggest that a device capable of providing personalized feedback can improve the user experience and, in turn, increase the usability in different applications. This paper explores an undiscussed aspect of human dynamic patterns. Furthermore, the collected data offer a valuable dataset of human grasping behavior, containing 1083 grasp instances with both kinetics and kinematics data."
https://openalex.org/W3040751011,"Sugar alcohols (polyols) are abundant carbohydrates in lichen-forming algae and transported to other lichen symbionts, fungi, and bacteria. Particularly, ribitol is an abundant polyol in the lichen Cetraria sp. Polyols have important physiological roles in lichen symbiosis, but polyol utilization in lichen-associated bacteria has been largely unreported. Herein, we purified and characterized a novel ribitol dehydrogenase (RDH) from a Cetraria sp.-associated bacterium Sphingomonas sp. PAMC 26621 grown on a minimal medium containing D-ribitol (the RDH hereafter referred to as SpRDH). SpRDH is present as a trimer in its native form, and the molecular weight of SpRDH was estimated to be 39 kDa by SDS-PAGE and 117 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. SpRDH converted D-ribitol to D-ribulose using NAD+ as a cofactor. As far as we know, SpRDH is the first RDH belonging to the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. Multiple sequence alignments indicated that the catalytic amino acid residues of SpRDH consist of Cys37, His65, Glu66, and Glu157, whereas those of short-chain RDHs consist of Ser, Tyr, and Lys. Furthermore, unlike other short-chain RDHs, SpRDH did not require divalent metal ions for its catalytic activity. Despite SpRDH originating from a psychrophilic Arctic bacterium, Sphingomonas sp., it had maximum activity at 60°C and exhibited high thermal stability within the 4–50°C range. Further studies on the structure/function relationship and catalytic mechanism of SpRDH will expand our understanding of its role in lichen symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W3040946608,"Background Non-Invasive Venous waveform Analysis (NIVA) is novel technology that captures and analyzes changes in venous waveforms from a piezoelectric sensor on the wrist for hemodynamic volume assessment. Complex cranial vault reconstruction is performed in children with craniosynostosis and is associated with extensive blood loss, potential life-threatening risks, and significant morbidity. In this preliminary study, we hypothesized that NIVA will provide a reliable, non-invasive, quantitative assessment of intravascular volume changes in children undergoing complex cranial vault reconstruction. Objective To present proof-of-concept results of a novel technology in the pediatric population. Methods The NIVA prototype was placed on each subject’s wrist, and venous waveforms were collected intraoperatively. Estimated blood loss and fluid/blood product administration were recorded in real time. Venous waveforms were analyzed into a NIVA value and then correlated, along with mean arterial pressure (MAP), to volume changes. Concordance was quantified to determine if the direction of change in volume was similar to the direction of change in MAP or change in NIVA. Results Of 18 patients enrolled, 14 had usable venous waveforms, and there was a significant correlation between change in NIVA value and change in volume. Change in MAP did not correlate with change in volume. The concordance between change in MAP and change in volume was less than the concordance between change in NIVA and change in volume. Conclusion NIVA values correlate more closely to intravascular volume changes in pediatric craniofacial patients than MAP. This initial study suggests that NIVA is a potential safe, reliable, non-invasive quantitative method of measuring intravascular volume changes for children undergoing surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3041285140,"Vaccine temperature control failures represent a significant public and private healthcare cost. Vaccines damaged by excessive heat or freezing lose their effectiveness, putting public health at risk. Some vaccine administration programs recommend placing water bottles inside domestic refrigerators used for vaccine storage as a thermal ballast, to mitigate temperature excursion risks. However, the effect of variable thermal ballast loading on refrigerator performance has not been thoroughly quantified or documented, and generalized programmatic recommendations are subject to end-user interpretation. Here we show that a thermal ballast load comprising ten to fifteen percent of the total refrigerator storage volume provides a measurable effect on domestic refrigerator temperature stability during power outage events, maintaining vaccine temperatures between 2 °C and 8 °C for 4 to 6 hours without power. Thermal ballast usage does not reliably reduce the frequency or severity of temperature excursions caused by repeated door opening, accidental ""door left open"" events, or refrigerator defrost cycle activation. Use of a moderate thermal ballast load is a practical strategy for mitigating temperature excursions risks in areas with frequent or protracted power outages, but the practice has limited benefit in other adverse scenarios. Empowering providers to make informed decisions about the use of thermal ballast materials supports better, safer vaccine management."

Thus prevent social exclusion of poor slum communities in Bangladesh with regard to safe motherhood and essential newborn care (ENC). This cross-sectional study was conducted, during March–July, 2015 in slums of Chittagong, Dhaka and Sylhet city corporations of Bangladesh. A census was conducted among 25,700 households covering 10 branch offices of MANOSHI to identify women with a delivery outcome in the preceding three years of the survey. A total of 1100 respondents were interviewed randomly through a structured questionnaire. These women were stratified into three categories-1, 2 & 3, consisting of 497, 205 and 398 women respectively. Women in category-1 did not receive any ANC checkup from the BRAC CHWs, while women in category-2 and category-3 received one to three and ≥four ANC checkups from BRAC CHWs respectively. Data was analysed using STATA Version 13 (Chicago Inc.). Findings revealed that women, who received ≥four ANC checkups from BRAC CHWs, are 25% more likely to avail facility delivery [adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR) 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.01–1.54)] compared to the women who did not receive any ANC from BRAC CHWs. Women in category-2 [aPR3.64; 95% CI (1.76–7.54)] and in category-3 [aPR5.92; 95% CI (3.04–11.53)] respectively had four and six folds higher tendency to receive postnatal care (PNC) within 48 hours after delivery. Furthermore, facility delivery improved PNC assisted by medically trained providers (MTPs) within 48 hours after delivery and ENC in both categories 2 & 3. The evidence shows that at least four ANC visits of BRAC CHWs can increase institutional delivery, and which can further facilitate PNC and ENC visits. At present, the BRAC MANOSHI programme needs to implement feasible strategies to include pregnant women in the slums in receiving at least four ANC checkups by BRAC CHWs for ensuring safe motherhood and newborn care."
https://openalex.org/W3041966995,"Evaluation studies of outcomes used in clinical research and their consistency are appearing more frequently in the literature, as a key part of the core outcome set (COS) development. Current guidance suggests such evaluation studies should use systematic review methodology as their default. We aimed to examine the methods used. We searched the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) database (up to May 2019) supplementing it with additional resources. We included evaluation studies of outcome consistency in clinical studies across health subjects and used a subset of A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 (items 1–9) to assess their methods. Of 93 included evaluation studies of outcome consistency (90 full reports, three summaries), 91% (85/93) reported performing literature searches in at least one bibliographic database, and 79% (73/93) was labelled as a “systematic review”. The evaluations varied in terms of satisfying AMSTAR 2 criteria, such that 81/93 (87%) had implemented PICO in the research question, whereas only 5/93 (6%) had included the exclusions list. None of the evaluation studies explained how inconsistency of outcomes was detected, however, 80/90 (88%) concluded inconsistency in individual outcomes (66%, 55/90) or outcome domains (20%, 18/90). Methods used in evaluation studies of outcome consistency in clinical studies differed considerably. Despite frequent being labelled as a “systematic review”, adoption of systematic review methodology is selective. While the impact on COS development is unknown, authors of these studies should refrain from labelling them as “systematic review” and focus on ensuring that the methods used to generate the different outcomes and outcome domains are reported transparently."
https://openalex.org/W2769475975,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by speech impairment, intellectual disability, ataxia, and epilepsy. AS is caused by mutations in the maternal copy of UBE3A located on chromosome 15q11-13. UBE3A codes for E6AP (E6 Associated Protein), a prominent member of the HECT (Homologous to E6AP C-Terminus) E3 ubiquitin ligase family. E6AP catalyzes the posttranslational attachment of ubiquitin via its HECT domain onto various intracellular target proteins to regulate DNA repair and cell cycle progression. The HECT domain consists of an N-lobe, required for E2~ubiquitin recruitment, while the C-lobe contains the conserved catalytic cysteine required for ubiquitin transfer. Previous genetic studies of AS patients have identified point mutations in UBE3A that result in amino acid substitutions or premature termination during translation. An AS transversion mutation (codon change from ATA to AAA) within the region of the gene that codes for the catalytic HECT domain of E6AP has been annotated (I827K), but the molecular basis for this loss of function substitution remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the I827K substitution destabilizes the 3D fold causing protein aggregation of the C-terminal lobe of E6AP using a combination of spectropolarimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Our fluorescent ubiquitin activity assays with E6AP-I827K show decreased ubiquitin thiolester formation and ubiquitin discharge. Using 3D models in combination with our biochemical and biophysical results, we rationalize why the I827K disrupts E6AP-dependent ubiquitylation. This work provides new insight into the E6AP mechanism and how its malfunction can be linked to the AS phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3041516569,"Instruments are often deployed at depth for weeks to years for a variety of marine applications. In many cases, divers can be deployed to retrieve instruments, but divers are constrained by depth limitations and safety concerns. Acoustic release technology can also be employed but can add considerable expense and acoustic releases will at times fail. Here, we report a simple method that utilizes a commercially available mooring hook integrated with a mini remotely operated vehicle to attach lines to instruments deployed on the sea floor, which can then be winched to the surface. The mooring hook apparatus was tested in a pool setting and then used to retrieve acoustic telemetry receiver bases (50 kg) or fish traps (30–50 kg) from the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf at depths between 28 and 80 m. During 2013–2019, 539 retrievals (100% success rate) were made of receiver bases (n = 239) and traps (n = 300) on 30 sea days using this approach. This method could easily be applied to other types of instruments, or recovery and salvage of objects that are too deep for standard diving operations."
https://openalex.org/W3041240095,"Dependent peptide searching is a method for discovering covalently-modified peptides–and therefore proteins–in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics experiments. Being more permissive than standard search methods, it has the potential to discover novel modifications (e.g., post-translational modifications occurring in vivo, or modifications introduced in vitro). However, few studies have explored dependent peptide search results in an untargeted way. In the present study, we sought to evaluate dependent peptide searching as a means of characterising proteins that have been modified in vitro. We generated a model data set by analysing N-ethylmaleimide-treated bovine serum albumin, and performed dependent peptide searches using the popular MaxQuant software. To facilitate interpretation of the search results (hundreds of dependent peptides), we developed a series of visualisation tools (R scripts). We used the tools to assess the diversity of putative modifications in the albumin, and to pinpoint hypothesised modifications. We went on to explore the tools’ generality via analyses of public data from studies of rat and human proteomes. Of 19 expected sites of modification (one in rat cofilin-1 and 18 across six different human plasma proteins), eight were found and correctly localised. Apparently, some sites went undetected because chemical enrichment had depleted necessary analytes (potential ‘base’ peptides). Our results demonstrate (i) the ability of the tools to provide accurate and informative visualisations, and (ii) the usefulness of dependent peptide searching for characterising in vitro protein modifications. Our model data are available via PRIDE/ProteomeXchange (accession number PXD013040)."
https://openalex.org/W3042149868,"Background The Extended Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) instrument is a commonly used patient reported outcome (PRO) tool in prostate cancer clinical trials. Summary scores for EPIC subscales are calculated by averaging patient scores for attributes (e.g., side effects), implying equal weighting of the attributes in the absence of evidence showing otherwise. Methods We estimated patient preferences for each of the attributes included in the bowel subscale of the EPIC instrument using best-worst (B-W) scaling among a cohort of men with prostate cancer. Patients were presented with multiple tasks in which they were asked to indicate which attribute they would find most and least bothersome at different levels of severity. Analysis utilized both (simple) B-W counts and scores to estimate patient preferences for each attribute as well as attribute levels. Results A total of 174 respondents from two institutions participated in the survey. Preference estimates for each of the five attributes included in the EPIC-26 bowel subscale showed wide variation preferences: ‘losing control of bowel movements’ was found to be the most bothersome attribute, with a B-W score of -0.48, followed by bowel urgency which also had negative B-W score (-0.04). Increased frequency of bowel movements was the least bothersome attribute, with a B-W score of +0.33, followed by bloody stools (+0.12), and pelvic/rectal pain (+0.06). Analysis of preference weights for attribute bother levels showed preference estimates be linear. Conclusions We provide novel evidence on patient preferences for side effect reduction following prostate radiotherapy. Within the bowel sub-scale of the EPIC-26 short form, we found that bowel incontinence was perceived to be the most bothersome treatment effect, while increased bowel frequency was least bothersome to patients."
https://openalex.org/W3041184813,"In front-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), prior studies suggest that concordant but not discordant involvement of the bone marrow (BM) portends a poor prognosis. The prognostic impact of bone marrow infiltration (BMI) in recurrent or refractory DLBCL (r/rDLBCL) and transformed indolent lymphoma (r/rTRIL) patients is less clear. Thus, we examined the prognostic significance of the infiltration of bone marrow (BMI) by concordant, large B-cells (conBMI) and discordant, small B-cells (disBMI) in this patient group. We performed a single center retrospective analysis of the prognostic impact of BMI diagnosed before start of second-line treatment as well as multiple clinicopathologic variables in 82 patients with r/rDLBCL or r/rTRIL intended to treat with autologous SCT. Twenty-five of 82 patients (30.5%) had BMI. Out of these, 19 (76%) had conBMI and 6 (24%) had disBMI. In patients with conBMI but not disBMI, uni- and multivariate analysis revealed inferior progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to patients without BMI (median PFS, 9.2 vs 17.45 months, log rank: p = 0.049; Hazard Ratio, 2.34 (Confidence Interval, 1.24–4.44), p = 0.009; median OS 14.72 vs 28.91 months, log rank: p = 0.017; Hazard Ratio, 2.76 (Confidence Interval, 1.43–5.31), p = 0.002). ConBMI was strongly associated with nonGCB subtype as classified by the Hans algorithm (82.4% vs 17.6%, p = 0.01). ConBMI comprised an independent predictor of poor prognosis in primary and secondary r/rDLBCL. Incorporating conBMI in the pretherapeutic risk assessment for r/rDLBCL and r/rTRIL patients may be useful for prognostication, for stratification in clinical trials, and to assess new therapies for this high-risk patient subset that might not benefit from SCT in second-line treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3041206698,"In real music, the original melody may appear intact, with little elaboration only, or significantly modified. Since a melody is most easily perceived in music, hearing significantly modified melody may change a brain connectivity. Mozart KV 265 is comprised of a theme with an original melody of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" and its significant variations. We studied whether effective connectivity changes with significantly modified melody, between bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFGs) and Heschl's gyri (HGs) using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Among the 12 connectivities, the connectivity from the left IFG to the right HG was consistently increased with significantly modified melody compared to the original melody in 2 separate sets of the same rhythmic pattern with different melody (p = 0.005 and 0.034, Bonferroni corrected). Our findings show that the modification of an original melody in a real music changes the brain connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W3041790094,"High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remains the deadliest form of epithelial ovarian cancer and despite major efforts little improvement in overall survival has been achieved. Identification of recurring “driver” genetic lesions has the potential to enable design of novel therapies for cancer. Here, we report on a study to find such new therapeutic targets for HGSOC using exome-capture sequencing approach targeting all kinase genes in 127 patient samples. Consistent with previous reports, the most frequently mutated gene was TP53 (97% mutation frequency) followed by BRCA1 (10% mutation frequency). The average mutation frequency of the kinase genes mutated from our panel was 1.5%. Intriguingly, after BRCA1, JAK3 was the most frequently mutated gene (4% mutation frequency). We tested the transforming properties of JAK3 mutants using the Ba/F3 cell-based in vitro functional assay and identified a novel gain-of-function mutation in the kinase domain of JAK3 (p.T1022I). Importantly, p.T1022I JAK3 mutants displayed higher sensitivity to the JAK3-selective inhibitor Tofacitinib compared to controls. For independent validation, we re-sequenced the entire JAK3 coding sequence using tagged amplicon sequencing (TAm-Seq) in 463 HGSOCs resulting in an overall somatic mutation frequency of 1%. TAm-Seq screening of CDK12 in the same population revealed a 7% mutation frequency. Our data confirms that the frequency of mutations in kinase genes in HGSOC is low and provides accurate estimates for the frequency of JAK3 and CDK12 mutations in a large well characterized cohort. Although p.T1022I JAK3 mutations are rare, our functional validation shows that if detected they should be considered as potentially actionable for therapy. The observation of CDK12 mutations in 7% of HGSOC cases provides a strong rationale for routine somatic testing, although more functional and clinical characterization is required to understand which nonsynonymous mutations alterations are associated with homologous recombination deficiency."
