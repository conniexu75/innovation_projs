https://openalex.org/W2060995182,"THE mechanism of calcification has been considerably clarified recently1. Collagen fibrils were shown to possess in vitro the property of nucleating hydroxyapatite precipitation and of triggering mineralization1–3. But why does only part of the collagen present in the organism calcify ? Recently, we suggested that the activating sites of collagen and crystal growth could be blocked in the organism by a plasma inhibitor4. Indeed we showed plasma to contain one or several substances highly inhibitory to apatite precipitation. The technique used was to determine in vitro, at physiological conditions, the minimum ion product (Ca) × (P) necessary for hydroxyapatite precipitation. After addition of plasma, the rise of this minimum product revealed the presence of inhibitors. As the inhibitor was shown to be destroyed by alkaline phosphatase, and the polyphosphates to have a strong inhibitory activity at concentrations as low as 10−7 M, we suggested this inhibitor to be a polyphosphate. However, to our knowledge, no such compound has so far been demonstrated in plasma or in urine."

Ligaturing off the head abolishes tanning. Tanning is initiated by a signal from neurosecretory cells in the brain, transmitted to the thorax via both the central and stomatogastric nervous system. Blood from a 15-minute-old fly induces tanning when injected into the body of a head-ligatured fly. The active factor in blood is probably neither a substrate nor an enzyme necessary for tanning. It could be a new hormone, because it is neither ecdyson, nor the juvenile hormone, nor a brain hormone. This factor is entirely unspecific, being present in newly molted cockroaches (Periplaneta) and newly emerged adults of the beetle Tenebrio. A mechanism that inhibits tanning also plays a role in this reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1968260435,Stimulation of the caudate nucleus modifies inputs to the visual system of the cat. The modification of such sensory information is similar to the modification seen on stimulation of the thalamus and brain stem reticular formation. Preliminary stimulation of the caudate nucleus at different intervals prior to the afferent input may have facilitatory or inhibitory effects on both evoked potentials and unitary responses of the visual cortex.

https://openalex.org/W2785142401,"IT is now well established that in the solid state many preparations of synthetic polypeptides form stable helical structures which correspond closely to the α-helix described by Pauling, Corey and Branson1. With other preparations, however, the α-helical configuration appears to be less stable, apparently due either to a low degree of polymerization2 or to the nature of the side-chain3. In the case of poly-β-benzyl-L-aspartate4,5 steric interference between the side-chain and main-chain renders the α-helical configuration comparatively unstable, and on heating films in vacua the molecules adopt a new helical form resembling the 413 configuration described by Bragg, Kendrew and Perutz6. The new configuration, which has been termed the ω-helix, has a pitch of 5.30 Å. with four residues per turn and is believed to be of opposite screw sense to the α-helix. We are at present investigating synthetic polypeptides with side-chains which are derivatives of cysteine and wish to report the discovery of a second example of a four residue per turn helix which closely resembles, but is not identical with, that found in poly-β-benzyl-L-aspartate."

https://openalex.org/W2019915076,"Iodine-125 has the relatively long half-life of 60 days, and emits 27.3- to 35.5-kev photon radiation, permitting counting in an ordinary well crystal scintillation counter with 30 to 40 percent efficiency. The emission of low-energy electrons having the same general energy range as tritium beta radiation electrons allows high-resolution autoradiography. These properties, together with the other advantages of radioactive iodine, make this nuclide a particularly satisfactory label for immunologically active proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1979839077,Levels of zinc-65 in oysters from selected sites in the Thames River (Connecticut) have been determined for a 12-month period. The highest levels of radioactivity were in oysters from a bed situated opposite the United States submarine base in March 1961 (1637 micromicrocuries per kilogram of moist tissue). None of the samples assayed showed sufficient amounts of radioactivity to represent a health hazard.

https://openalex.org/W2070759076,"In learning a black-white discrimination response, the efficiency of rhesus monkeys with lesions of the anterior frontal cortex varies inversely with the spatial separation of the discriminative stimuli from the places of response and reward. Though there is a similar relationship in intact animals, impairment of learning due to discontiguity is greater in the animals with brain lesions."

https://openalex.org/W2005824492,"Details of a test developed for estimating the extent of reversion of bacteriophage T4B from rII to r+ induced by ultravolet irradiation are given. T4rII mutants were obtained by ultraviolet irradiation of T4Br phage, and 12 hr cultures of E. coli and K-12 ( lambda ) were used in assays of rII and r+ phage, respectively. The phage were diluted and irradiated in media which contained, per liter ion-free water, 10 g tryptone, 8 g sodium chloride, and 1 g glucose. Each of 12 rII mutant stocks was assayed on B and on K-12 ( lambda ) to determine accurately the titer of total and of r+ phage. It was found that 5 of the 12 mutants revert to r+ when irradiated with ultravolet. The extent of reversion ranges from 1.81 to 4.2 x 105 r+ per 106 survivors."

https://openalex.org/W2094272503,"THREE reports have described an abnormally small chromosome (Ph1) replacing one of the four smallest, acrocentric autosomes in the chromosome complement of cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukæmia1–3. The Ph1 chromosome has been found in cultured peripheral blood or bone marrow cells from twenty patients with chronic myeloid leukæmia, ranging from untreated cases to those in terminal, acute stages, and a causal relationship between the chromosome abnormality and the disease has been suggested. Tough et al.3 failed to find the Ph1 chromosome in five cases of this leukæmia. Two of these had entered an acute leukæmia phase where diverse chromosome changes can be expected, whereas the other three cases had in common an unusually long history after diagnosis and followed a relatively benign course. Two of these latter cases had a previous history of radiotherapy for ankylosing spondylitis and there was a high probability that these leukæmias were radiation induced."

https://openalex.org/W2062682391,"ENRICHMENT of a medium supporting slow, balanced growth of bacteria (Aerobacter aerogenes1 or Salmonella typhimurium2) is followed by a period of accelerating growth during which the ribonucleic acid (RNA): protein ratio of the bacterial protoplasm increases considerably. It has recently been stated in papers from this laboratory1 and elsewhere2 that the rate of RNA synthesis during this adjustment period is even higher than it will be later when the new, high growth-rate is established. (The phrase, ‘rate of RNA synthesis’, refers to the rate of accumulation of total RNA, of which approximately 80 per cent is ribosomal. In the conditions of growth employed in the experiments being discussed, measurements of total accumulation are essentially measurements of ribosome synthesis, since turnover is slight.) This assertion is based on the fact that when the logarithm of RNA per ml. of culture is plotted against time, the slope immediately after enrichment of the culture is usually greater than that which will be maintained afterwards."

https://openalex.org/W2978524604,"DR. J. C. JONES1 has reported that “anæsthesia … interferes in some important way with the obtainment of a lethal dose of DDT” by larvæ of Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say. If this effect were involved with the metabolic processes of the insect, one might make a case for the intriguing concept of ‘active’ uptake of this poison. If, however, the effect is simply one of producing a lower exposure to the insecticide by decreasing the physical activity of the larvæ, it is, obviously, worth no further investigation. On the basis of the following evidence: “…anæsthetized larvæ which are drawn about within the [DDT] suspension by cardboard tips are entirely comparable to those left completely quiescent”, Jones ruled out the latter possibility."
