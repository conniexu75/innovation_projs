https://openalex.org/W4284690107,"Neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade has shown promising clinical activity. Here, we characterized early kinetics in tumor-infiltrating and circulating immune cells in oral cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 in a clinical trial (NCT02919683). Tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells that clonally expanded during immunotherapy expressed elevated tissue-resident memory and cytotoxicity programs, which were already active prior to therapy, supporting the capacity for rapid response. Systematic target discovery revealed that treatment-expanded tumor T cell clones in responding patients recognized several self-antigens, including the cancer-specific antigen MAGEA1. Treatment also induced a systemic immune response characterized by expansion of activated T cells enriched for tumor-infiltrating T cell clonotypes, including both pre-existing and emergent clonotypes undetectable prior to therapy. The frequency of activated blood CD8 T cells, notably pre-treatment PD-1-positive KLRG1-negative T cells, was strongly associated with intra-tumoral pathological response. These results demonstrate how neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade induces local and systemic tumor immunity."

Herein, we found that human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) binding affinity to the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the four early Omicron sub-variants (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3) follows the order BA.1.1 > BA.2 > BA.3 ≈ BA.1. The complex structures of hACE2 with RBDs of BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 reveal that the higher hACE2 binding affinity of BA.2 than BA.1 is related to the absence of the G496S mutation in BA.2. The R346K mutation in BA.1.1 majorly affects the interaction network in the BA.1.1 RBD/hACE2 interface through long-range alterations and contributes to the higher hACE2 affinity of the BA.1.1 RBD than the BA.1 RBD.

These results reveal the structural basis for the distinct hACE2 binding patterns among BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 RBDs. Omicron (B.1.1.529), which is the SARS-CoV-2 variant with most mutations, was defined as the fifth variant of concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on November 26, 2021 (Kandeel et al., 2022Kandeel M. Mohamed M.E.M. Abd El-Lateef H.M. Venugopala K.N. El-Beltagi H.S. Omicron variant genome evolution and phylogenetics.J. Med. Virol. 2022; 94: 1627-1632https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27515Google Scholar). The Omicron variants were recently divided into four sub-variants, i.e., BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 (PAHO and WHO, 2022PAHOWHOSublineages of SARS-CoV-2 VOC omicron.2022https://www.paho.org/en/documents/sublineages-sars-cov-2-voc-omicronGoogle Scholar). The BA.2 sub-variant was suggested to have a growth advantage over other circulating variants and is more transmissible than the BA.1 sub-variant. Statistical analysis shows that the effective reproduction number of BA.2 is 1.4-fold higher than that of BA.1 (Yamasoba et al., 2022Yamasoba D. Kimura I. Nasser H. Morioka Y. Nao N. Ito J. Uriu K. Tsuda M. Zahradnik J. Shirakawa K. et al.Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike.Cell. 2022; 185 (2103.e19–2115.e19)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.04.035Google Scholar). During the revision of this manuscript, some more Omicron sub-variants are emerging, e.g., BA.2.12.1, BA.4, BA.5, etc. The growth advantage of BA.2 was thought to be related to its higher capacity for immune escape. However, the difference between the level of neutralizing antibodies against BA.1 and BA.2 in individuals who accepted vaccination or experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection was small, so it is difficult to explain the higher transmissibility of BA.2 than BA.1 (Bruel et al., 2022Bruel T.

SARS-CoV-2 binding to its receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), is a critical step for initiating the infection. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the interactions between hACE2 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike (S) protein of the virus. There are 15–16 amino acid (aa) mutations in the RBD of Omicron sub-variants compared with the prototype (PT) virus (Lu et al., 2020bLu R. Zhao X. Li J. Niu P. Yang B. Wu H. Wang W. Song H. Huang B.

Previously, we solved both the crystal and cryo-EM structures of the Omicron BA.1 RBD in complex with hACE2, revealing that although some mutations in the BA.1 RBD increase the affinity to hACE2, the others attenuate it. Consequently, the affinity of Omicron BA.1 RBD is similar to that of the PT strain RBD (Han et al., 2022Han P. Li L. Liu S. Wang Q. Zhang D. Xu Z. Han P. Li X. Peng Q. Su C. et al.Receptor binding and complex structures of human ACE2 to spike RBD from omicron and delta SARS-CoV-2.Cell. 2022; 185 (630.e10–640.e10)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.01.001Google Scholar). In this report, we evaluated the binding properties of BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 RBDs to hACE2 and explored the structural basis for the difference in their binding affinities. Among the SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, there are 15 aa mutations in BA.1 and 16 in BA.1.1 with an extra mutation at R346K. BA.2 and BA.3 contain 16 and 15 aa mutations, correspondingly (Figure 1A). As of April 28, 2022, there have been 75 Pango Omicron sub-variants. Among these sub-variants, BA.1.1 is the globally dominant Omicron sub-variant, accounting for approximately 26.62% (874,168) of the total Omicron genomes. The other top 10 sub-variants are BA.2.9, BA.2, BA.1.17.2, BA.1.15, BA.1.16, BA.1, BA.1.1.1, BA.2.10, and BA.1.14, accounting for approximately 10.55% (346,329), 8.83% (290,135), 6.50% (213,581), 6.34% (208,159), 4.80% (157,468), 4.59% (150,661), 2.73% (89,652), 2.46% (80,763), and 2.37% (77,890) of the total Omicron genomes, correspondingly (Figure 1B) (outbreak.info, 2022outbreak.infoOmicron variant report.2022https://outbreak.info/situation-reports/omicron?loc=ZAF&loc=GBR&loc=USA&selected=ZAFGoogle Scholar). We assessed the binding affinities between hACE2 and RBDs from the four Omicron sub-variants (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3), together with the other earlier four VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta), and the PT virus (Lu et al., 2020aLu R.

Our results showed that the KD values for the binding of the PT RBD to hACE2 is 24.4 nM, similar to what was previously reported (Han et al., 2022Han P. Li L. Liu S. Wang Q. Zhang D. Xu Z. Han P.

Commun. 2021; 12: 4195https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24326-yGoogle Scholar), whereas those of Omicron sub-variants, BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3, were 19.5, 5.9, 10.0, and 22.1 nM, correspondingly. Compared with BA.1 RBD, the KD values of BA.1.1 and BA.2 were 3.3- and 2.0-fold lower, respectively, indicating that their affinities to hACE2 were a bit higher than that of the PT RBD. However, the affinity of BA.3 to hACE2 was very close to BA.1. The KD values of the RBDs binding to hACE2 in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants were 6.7, 19.7, 16.0, and 25.1 nM, correspondingly, suggesting that only Alpha RBD showed a comparable affinity with BA.1.1. The increased affinity of the BA.1.1 and BA.2 compared with BA.1 is consistent with the high frequencies of these two sub-variants in GISAID. We further detected the binding capacity of the above RBDs to hACE2 expressed on the surface of BHK-21 cells by flow cytometry (Figure S1). These results suggested that all the RBDs tested could efficiently bind to hACE2 on the cell surface. In order to detect the entry efficiency of the Omicron sub-variants, we prepared the VSV-backbone pseudoviruses expressing the S proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 PT and the VOCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and the four Omicron sub-variants. The entry efficiency of the pseudoviruses into Vero cells was evaluated (Figure 1D). All Omicron sub-variants were able to enter the cells efficiently. The relative entry efficiencies of Omicron sub-variants are consistent with the recent research (Saito et al., 2022Saito A. Irie T. Suzuki R. Maemura T. Nasser H. Uriu K. Kosugi Y. Shirakawa K. Sadamasu K. Kimura I. et al.Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation.Nature. 2022; 602: 300-306https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04266-9Google Scholar). The crystal structures of BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 RBDs in the complex with hACE2 have been solved at resolutions of 3.0, 2.9, and 2.7 Å, correspondingly, in this study (Table S1). We performed an interface analysis of the three complex structures with the cutoff for the atom contact distance being 4.5 Å (the cutoff distance for hydrogen bonds and salt bridges being 3.5 Å) and made a comparison with the interaction interface in the BA.1 RBD/hACE2 structure we previously solved (Han et al., 2022Han P. Li L. Liu S. Wang Q. Zhang D. Xu Z. Han P. Li X. Peng Q. Su C. et al.Receptor binding and complex structures of human ACE2 to spike RBD from omicron and delta SARS-CoV-2.Cell. 2022; 185 (630.e10–640.e10)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.01.001Google Scholar). The results show that the same 21 hACE2 residues are involved in constituting the binding interface with 20 BA.1 RBD residues, 21 BA.1.1 RBD residues, 21 BA.2 RBD residues, and 19 BA.3 RBD residues in the four complexes, correspondingly. The interaction atom pairs and numbers of interface atom contacts, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges are listed in Tables S2 and S3. Among the BA.1 RBD/hACE2, BA.2 RBD/hACE2, and BA.3 RBD/hACE2 complexes, the BA.2 RBD/hACE2 complex interface has the largest total number of atom contacts and hydrogen bonds, which might correlate with the higher hACE2 affinity of the BA.2 RBD compared with BA.1 and BA.3. However, the BA.1.1 RBD with the highest hACE2 affinity forms a less total number of atom contacts and hydrogen bonds with hACE2 than BA.2 RBD, but it has two more salt bridges than BA.2 RBD (Figure S2; Table S3). Therefore, the descending order of BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.1, and BA.3 RBD affinity to hACE2 can be partly explained by the different number of total atomic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges, although other factors including the strength of individual interactions, especially those of critical mutation sites also play a role. This is consistent with our previous report that the lower affinity of dog ACE2 (dACE2) to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD than hACE2 can be explained by fewer interface atom contacts, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges of dACE2 with RBD (Zhang et al., 2021Zhang Z. Zhang Y. Liu K. Li Y. Lu Q. Wang Q. Zhang Y. Wang L. Liao H. Zheng A. et al.The molecular basis for SARS-CoV-2 binding to dog ACE2.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 4195https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24326-yGoogle Scholar). The contact interfaces between hACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 or the Omicron sub-variant BA.1 RBD are distributed over two patches (Han et al., 2022Han P. Li L. Liu S. Wang Q. Zhang D. Xu Z. Han P. Li X. Peng Q. Su C. et al.Receptor binding and complex structures of human ACE2 to spike RBD from omicron and delta SARS-CoV-2.Cell. 2022; 185 (630.e10–640.e10)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.01.001Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2020Wang Q. Zhang Y. Wu L. Niu S. Song C. Zhang Z. Lu G. Qiao C. Hu Y. Yuen K.Y. et al.Structural and functional basis of SARS-CoV-2 entry by using human ACE2.Cell. 2020; 181 (894–904.e9)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.03.045Google Scholar). As Patch 1 in the BA.1 RBD/hACE2 complex, which we previously reported (Han et al., 2022Han P. Li L. Liu S. Wang Q. Zhang D. Xu Z. Han P. Li X. Peng Q. Su C. et al.Receptor binding and complex structures of human ACE2 to spike RBD from omicron and delta SARS-CoV-2.Cell. 2022; 185 (630.e10–640.e10)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.01.001Google Scholar), all Patch 1 of the three complexes solved here contains 5 hACE2 residues (S19, Q24, H34, E35, and Y83), which form hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with RBD residues, but Patch 1 of the BA.1.1 complex has an extra hACE2 D38, forming a hydrogen bond and a salt bridge with BA.1.1 RBD S496 and R493, correspondingly (Figures 2A–2D, upper panels). Unlike the BA.1.1 complex, hACE2 D38 in the BA.1 RBD, BA.2 RBD, and BA.3 RBD complexes forms a hydrogen bond and a salt bridge with RBD Y449 and R498, correspondingly, in all the three complexes. In addition to hACE2 D38, Patch 2 of the BA.1.1 complex contains Y41, K353, and D355, whereas that of the three complexes contains hACE2 Y41, Q42, and K353. The hydrogen bonds network in Patch 2 of the BA.2 RBD complex is the most extensive, whereas that of the BA.1.1 RBD complex is the weakest (Figures 2A–2D, lower panels). The binding interface residues of RBDs in the four complexes shown in (Figures 2E–2H) are evidently different. The two patches of the BA.1 and BA.1.1 RBDs are connected, whereas the boundaries of those in the BA.2 and BA.3 are distinguishable. Among all the mutations in the four RBDs, only the G496S is located in the binding interface. Notably, T415 of BA.2 RBD forms a hydrogen bond with hACE2 N90-glycan, which is discussed later (Figure 2G). The affinity of BA.2 RBD to hACE2 is a little bit higher, if any, than that of the BA.1/BA.3 RBDs. The difference between the BA.2 RBD and the BA.1 RBD is that BA.2 contains S371F, T376A, D405N, and R408S mutations, but BA.1 RBD does not, whereas BA.1 contains the G446S and G496S mutations, but BA.2 does not. Among these mutations, only the G496S mutation is in the RBD/hACE2 interface. In the BA.1 RBD/hACE2, BA.2 RBD/hACE2, and BA.3 RBD/hACE2 complexes, hACE2 D38 forms a salt bridge and hydrogen bond networks with RBD R498 and Y449. However, the side chains of these residues appear less compact in the BA.1 RBD/hACE2 complex with the G496S mutation, whereas in the BA.1.1 complex with the same mutation, this interaction network is disrupted (Figure 3A). Therefore, we speculate that S496 may disturb the polar interaction network formed between hACE2 D38 and RBD R498/Y449. To verify the effects of G496S on receptor binding, we first evaluated the reverse mutation of S496G in BA.1.1 RBD on the ACE2 affinity. Our results indicate that the S496G site mutation induces an approximately 3.6-fold affinity increase, whereas the G496S mutation in BA.2 RBD induces an approximately 1.5-fold decrease in hACE2 binding affinity (Figure S3). Therefore, the SPR measurements support that G496S attenuates RBD binding. To further explore the mechanism for the reduced binding associated with the G496S mutation, we performed molecular dynamics (MDs) simulations and examined the effect of the G496S mutation on the free energy of BA.1 RBD binding. Our results indicate that the molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) free energy of the BA.1 RBD with G496 binding to hACE2 is 5.34 kcal/mol (ΔΔEBinding) lower than that with S496 (Table S4). Representative snapshots clustered from the MD trajectories suggested that the more compact intra-chain hydrogen bonding networks formed by the hydroxyl side chain of S496 within RBD reduce the inter-chain interactions between BA.1 RBD and ACE2 (Figure S4). For control, we also performed the simulations of S446 BA.1 versus G446 BA.1 binding, showing that ΔΔEBinding between S446 and G446 is only 1.15 kcal mol−1, which is much lower than the ΔΔEBinding between S496 and G496. These results also support that the G496S mutation attenuates the binding affinity of RBDs to hACE2. Interestingly, the visibility of the electronic densities of the hACE2 N90-linked glycans was very different in the four complexes. The densities for the first three glycan residues (N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine [NAG], NAG, and Beta-D-mannose [BMA]) of the hACE2 N90-linked glycan in the BA.2 RBD/hACE2 complex were sharp and clear, but only the densities of the first residues (NAG) of ACE2 N90-glycan in the BA.1 RBD/hACE2 and BA.1.1 RBD/hACE2 complexes and the first two residues (NAG and NAG) of ACE2 N90-glycan in the BA.3 RBD/hACE2 complex were visible (Figure 3B). More importantly, in the BA.2 RBD/hACE2 complex, the third residue (BMA) of the hACE2 N90-glycan chain forms a hydrogen bond with BA.2 T145, which stabilizes the glycan chain (Figures 3B and S5) and presumably increases the affinity of the BA.2 RBD to hACE2. The unique mutation of BA.2 is R408S. We hypothesized that the large side chain of R408 in RBDs of BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.3 has steric clashes with the N90-glycan chain. With the R408S mutation in BA.2, the steric clashes decrease, and therefore, the N90-glycan has a higher probability to get close and bind to T415. The glycosylation of viral envelope proteins together with receptors has a wide range of functions, including regulating viral tropism (Tian et al., 2021Tian W. Li D. Zhang N. Bai G. Yuan K. Xiao H. Gao F. Chen Y. Wong C.C.L. Gao G.F. O-glycosylation pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reveals an “O-Follow-N” rule.Cell Res. 2021; 31: 1123-1125https://doi.org/10.1038/s41422-021-00545-2Google Scholar). Here, we present a molecular insight into how glycosylation regulates virus receptor binding. To test the role of the R408S mutation on RBD/hACE2 interaction, we assessed the hACE2 affinity of BA.2 RBD with the S408R mutation, showing that the KD values of the BA.2 RBD (15.67 nM) and BA.2 RBD with the S408R mutation (16.37 nM) were also similar (Figure S6). These results suggest that the R408S mutation has very limited RBD binding to hACE2. Our SPR data showed that the affinity of the BA.1.1 RBD to hACE2 is higher than the BA.1 RBD. Sequence alignment indicated that there is only one substitution residue (R346K) located far away from the receptor-binding motif (RBM) between BA.1 RBD and BA.1.1 RBD. Although this residue does not contact with hACE2 directly (Figure 4A), the binding affinity of BA.1.1 RBD with hACE2 was enhanced compared with BA.1 RBD with hACE2 (Figure 1C). To explore the underlying molecular mechanism, we determined the structure of the BA.1.1 RBD/hACE2 complex. In the BA.1 RBD/hACE2 complex, R346 “pushes” N450 and changes the conformation of the corresponding loop to hACE2. Then, Y449 on the same loop contacts with D38 of hACE2 (Figure 4, Figure 4A, 4B, and 4D). When R346 was substituted by K346, it points to the opposite side and does not influence N450, the corresponding loop springs back, and the Y449 no longer contacts with D38 of hACE2. D38 of hACE2 points to the other side and loses the interactions with Y449 and R498 (Figure 4, Figure 4A, 4C, and 4E) and contacts with R493 of BA.1.1 RBD instead. Consequently, BA.1.1 RBD R493 forms salt bridges with E35 and D38 of hACE2, and it also forms contacts with H34 of hACE2. In addition, BA.1.1 RBD S496 forms a hydrogen bond with hACE2 D38. Therefore, these residues form a hub that generates strong interface interactions (Figures 4C and 4E). In summary, although R346K is far away from the RBM region, it also enhances the binding affinity of BA.1.1 RBD with hACE2 through long-distance “conduction” interactions like the “butterfly effect” (Figure 4E). Since its first appearance, SARS-CoV-2 Omicron disseminated rapidly and became the dominant circulating variant globally. Although only four Omicron sub-variants (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3) were defined as of February 3, 2022 (PAHO and WHO, 2022PAHOWHOSublineages of SARS-CoV-2 VOC omicron.2022https://www.paho.org/en/documents/sublineages-sars-cov-2-voc-omicronGoogle Scholar), the Omicron family of viruses continues to grow in complexity. Over the past few months, several new Omicron sub-variants are gaining attention, including BA.2.12.1, which is spreading widely in the Northeast United States, and BA.4 and BA.5, which are growing rapidly to dominate South Africa (Haseltine, 2022Haseltine W.A.

These sub-variants can evolve mutations to specifically evade humoral immunity (Cao et al., 2022Cao Y. Yisimayi A. Jian F. Song W. Xiao T. Wang L. Du S. Wang J. Li Q.

Previous studies showed that hACE2 affinities of Omicron (B.1.1.529 or BA.1) S proteins/RBDs are comparable with those of PT S proteins/RBDs (Han et al., 2022Han P. Li L. Liu S. Wang Q. Zhang D.

In this study, we showed that RBDs from other two Omicron sub-variants, BA.1.1 and BA.2, have higher hACE2 affinities than that of BA.1 and gave structural explanations for the difference in binding ability. First, we propose that the absence of the G496S mutation is related to the enhanced affinity of BA.2 RBD. Here, we observed that S496 disturbs the local interaction networks in hACE2 D38, RBD R498, and Y449. Our SPR data and MD simulations of BA.1.1 RBD S496G mutants confirmed that the G496S mutation reduces RBD affinity. Our results are consistent with previous findings showing that G496S mutation attenuates the affinity of the RBD to hACE2 in deep mutational scanning studies (Starr et al., 2020Starr T.N. Greaney A.J. Hilton S.K. Ellis D. Crawford K.H.D. Dingens A.S. Navarro M.J. Bowen J.E.

An intriguing finding of this study is that hACE2 N90-glycan forms a hydrogen bond with BA.2 T415. The explicit binding of BA.2 T415 to hACE2 N90-glycan and the enhanced hACE2 affinity of BA.2 RBD led us to propose that N90-glycan/T415 interaction is favorable to the binding of BA.2 RBD to hACE2. However, Chan et al. reported that hACE2 N90-glycosylation inhibits PT RBD binding to hACE2 (Chan et al., 2020Chan K.K. Dorosky D. Sharma P. Abbasi S.A. Dye J.M. Kranz D.M. Herbert A.S. Procko E. Engineering human ACE2 to optimize binding to the spike protein of SARS coronavirus 2.Science. 2020; 369: 1261-1265https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abc0870Google Scholar). Solving this paradox, we propose that the binding of hACE2 N90-glycan to BA.2 RBD T415 alleviates the inhibitory effect of N90-glycan on RBD/hACE2 binding. Because of the adjacency of the R408S mutation to T415, we hypothesized that the binding of hACE2 N90-glycan to T415 is related to the R408S mutation in BA.2. However, the SPR results showed that the R408S mutation in BA.1.1 RBD and the S408R reverse mutation in BA.2 RBD had little effect on the hACE2 affinity. Therefore, either the R408S mutation has indeed no effect on the glycan/T415 binding, or the effect is too weak to be detected by SPR, i.e., the limitation of the method used. Anyway, here we provide evidence showing that hACE2 glycan is involved in SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding. Another interesting finding is that the R346K mutation induces major alterations at the RBD/hACE2 interface through long-distance conduction interactions. Mutations located outside of the binding interface affecting the affinity via long-range conduction effects have been reported previously (Joughin et al., 2005Joughin B.A. Green D.F. Tidor B. Action-at-a-distance interactions enhance protein binding affinity.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1363-1369https://doi.org/10.1110/ps.041283105Google Scholar; Unal et al., 2013Unal H. Jagannathan R.

Chem. 2013; 288: 540-551https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M112.392514Google Scholar). Actually, the “push” configuration induced by the R346K mutation captured by crystallography may represent one of the dynamic states for BA.1.1. Collectively, the available evidence warns against the misleading concept suggesting that only interface residues determine affinity and explain the role of SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations. Receptor binding is the initial step for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we focused on the interaction between the RBDs of four Omicron sub-variants and hACE2. The transmissibility of a virus is affected by multiple factors of complex nature, such as viral stability, receptor-binding affinity, fus"

Aim To explore the potential association between clinical data and 25-point CT score and investigate their predictive significance in COVID-19-positive patients at Fayoum University Hospital in Egypt. Methods This study was conducted on 252 Egyptian COVID-19 patients at Fayoum University Hospital in Egypt. The patients were classified into two groups: a mild group (174 patients) and a severe group (78 patients). The results of clinical laboratory data, and CT scans of severe and mild patients, were collected, analyzed, and compared. Results The severe group show high significance levels of CRP, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, urea, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil percent, and heart rate (HR) than the mild group. Lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, and decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2) were the most observed abnormalities in severe COVID-19 patients. Lymphopenia, low SpO2 and albumin levels, elevated serum LDH, ferritin, urea, and CRP levels were found to be significantly correlated with severity CT score ( P &lt;0.0001). Conclusion The clinical severity of COVID-19 and the CT score are highly correlated. Our findings indicate that the CT scoring system can help to predict COVID-19 disease outcomes and has a strong correlation with clinical laboratory testing."

Here, we performed single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq in 22 treatment-naive MBMs and 10 extracranial melanoma metastases (ECMs) and matched spatial single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor (TCR)-seq. Cancer cells from MBM were more chromosomally unstable, adopted a neuronal-like cell state, and enriched for spatially variably expressed metabolic pathways. Key observations were validated in independent patient cohorts, patient-derived MBM/ECM xenograft models, RNA/ATAC-seq, proteomics, and multiplexed imaging. Integrated spatial analyses revealed distinct geography of putative cancer immune evasion and evidence for more abundant intra-tumoral B to plasma cell differentiation in lymphoid aggregates in MBM. MBM harbored larger fractions of monocyte-derived macrophages and dysfunctional TOX+CD8+ T cells with distinct expression of immune checkpoints. This work provides comprehensive insights into MBM biology and serves as a foundational resource for further discovery and therapeutic exploration."

https://openalex.org/W4284973934,"Dynamin mediates fission of vesicles from the plasma membrane during endocytosis. Typically, dynamin is recruited from the cytosol to endocytic sites, requiring seconds to tens of seconds. However, ultrafast endocytosis in neurons internalizes vesicles as quickly as 50 ms during synaptic vesicle recycling. Here, we demonstrate that Dynamin 1 is pre-recruited to endocytic sites for ultrafast endocytosis. Specifically, Dynamin 1xA, a splice variant of Dynamin 1, interacts with Syndapin 1 to form molecular condensates on the plasma membrane. Single-particle tracking of Dynamin 1xA molecules confirms the liquid-like property of condensates in vivo. When Dynamin 1xA is mutated to disrupt its interaction with Syndapin 1, the condensates do not form, and consequently, ultrafast endocytosis slows down by 100-fold. Mechanistically, Syndapin 1 acts as an adaptor by binding the plasma membrane and stores Dynamin 1xA at endocytic sites. This cache bypasses the recruitment step and accelerates endocytosis at synapses."

However, it remains unknown how H3K9me3 is reprogrammed during human early embryo development. Here, we profiled genome-wide H3K9me3 in human oocytes and early embryos and discovered stage-specific H3K9me3 deposition on long terminal repeats (LTRs) at the 8-cell and blastocyst stages. We found that 8-cell-specific H3K9me3 was temporarily established in enhancer-like regions, whereas blastocyst-specific H3K9me3 was more stable. DUX and multiple Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger proteins(KRAB-ZNFs) were identified as potential factors for establishing 8C- and blastocyst-specific H3K9me3, respectively. Intriguingly, our analysis showed that stage-specific H3K9me3 allocation was attenuated by either Dux knockout or Zfp51 knockdown in mouse early embryos. Moreover, we observed the existence of H3K4me3/H3K9me3 and H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent chromatin domains in human blastocysts, priming for lineage differentiation.

These antibodies induced severe encephalitis by directly inhibiting GABAA function, resulting in nervous-system hyperexcitability. The structures reveal mechanisms of GABAA inhibition and pathology. One antibody directly competes with a neurotransmitter and locks the receptor in a resting-like state. The second antibody targets the subunit interface involved in binding benzodiazepines and antagonizes diazepam potentiation.

https://openalex.org/W4284889952,"Reprogramming of H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin is required for early development. How H3K9me3 is involved in early human development remains, however, largely unclear. Here, we resolve the temporal landscape of H3K9me3 during human preimplantation development and its regulation for diverse hominoid-specific retrotransposons. At the 8-cell stage, H3K9me3 reprogramming at hominoid-specific retrotransposons termed SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) facilitates interaction between certain promoters and SVA-derived enhancers, promoting the zygotic genome activation. In trophectoderm, de novo H3K9me3 domains prevent pluripotent transcription factors from binding to hominoid-specific retrotransposons-derived regulatory elements for inner cell mass (ICM)-specific genes. H3K9me3 re-establishment at SVA elements in the ICM is associated with higher transcription of DNA repair genes, when compared with naive human pluripotent stem cells. Our data demonstrate that species-specific reorganization of H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin at hominoid-specific retrotransposons plays important roles during early human development, shedding light on how the epigenetic regulation for early development has evolved in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W4284689810,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) adapt their metabolism to maintenance and proliferation; however, the mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrated that homeostatic HSCs exhibited high amino acid (AA) catabolism to reduce cellular AA levels, which activated the GCN2-eIF2α axis, a protein synthesis inhibitory checkpoint to restrain protein synthesis for maintenance. Furthermore, upon proliferation conditions, HSCs enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for higher energy production but decreased AA catabolism to accumulate cellular AAs, which inactivated the GCN2-eIF2α axis to increase protein synthesis and coupled with proteotoxic stress. Importantly, GCN2 deletion impaired HSC function in repopulation and regeneration. Mechanistically, GCN2 maintained proteostasis and inhibited Src-mediated AKT activation to repress mitochondrial OXPHOS in HSCs. Moreover, the glycolytic metabolite, NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR), accelerated AA catabolism to activate GCN2 and sustain the long-term function of HSCs. Overall, our study uncovered direct links between metabolic alterations and translation control in HSCs during homeostasis and proliferation."

We show that uncertainty-directed exploration is sensitive to the prospective benefit offered by new information, whereas novelty-directed exploration is maintained regardless of its potential advantage. Using a computational framework in conjunction with fMRI, we show that uncertainty-directed choice is rooted in an adaptive bias indexing the prospective utility of exploration. In contrast, novelty persistently promotes exploration by optimistically inflating reward expectations while simultaneously dampening uncertainty signals. Our results identify separable neural substrates charged with balancing the explore/exploit trade-off to foster a manageable decomposition of an otherwise intractable problem."

However, how neurons undergo synaptic changes and become recruited during motor learning to form a memory engram remains unknown. Here, we train mice on a motor learning task and use a genetic approach to identify and manipulate behavior-relevant neurons selectively in the primary motor cortex (M1). We find that the degree of M1 engram neuron reactivation correlates with motor performance. We further demonstrate that learning-induced dendritic spine reorganization specifically occurs in these M1 engram neurons. In addition, we find that motor learning leads to an increase in the strength of M1 engram neuron outputs onto striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and that these synapses form clusters along SPN dendrites.

Here, we defined an optimal set of molecules secreted by the epiblast (inducers) that captures in vitro stable, highly self-renewing mouse trophectoderm stem cells (TESCs) resembling the blastocyst stage. When exposed to suboptimal inducers, these stem cells fluctuate to form interconvertible subpopulations with reduced self-renewal and facilitated differentiation, resembling peri-implantation cells, known as TR stem cells (TSCs). TESCs have enhanced capacity to form blastoids that implant more efficiently in utero due to inducers maintaining not only local TR proliferation and self-renewal, but also WNT6/7B secretion that stimulates uterine decidualization. Overall, the epiblast maintains sustained growth and decidualization potential of abutting TR cells, while, as known, distancing imposed by the blastocyst cavity differentiates TR cells for uterus adhesion, thus patterning the essential functions of implantation."

Probit regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.Only 62.7% of the respondents indicated that they will accept the COVID-19 vaccine if provided. The regression results revealed that the decision to accept the COVID-19 vaccine was influenced by occupation, perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits and attitudes towards the vaccines.The findings suggest that government must implement strategies to enhance positive attitudes toward vaccines, increase the risk perception of contracting the virus and also educate the populace about the benefits of the vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4284962716,"Introduction COVID-19 vaccination effectively reduces severe disease and death from COVID-19. However, both vaccine uptake and intention to vaccinate differ amongst population groups. Vaccine hesitancy is highest amongst specific ethnic minority groups. There is very limited understanding of the barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccine uptake in Black and South Asian ethnicities. Therefore, we aimed to explore COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in primary care patients from South Asian (Bangladeshi/Pakistani) and Black or Black British/African/Caribbean/Mixed ethnicities. Methods Patients from the above ethnicities were recruited using convenience sampling in four London general practices. Telephone interviews were conducted, using an interpreter if necessary, covering questions on the degree of vaccine hesitancy, barriers and potential facilitators, and decision-making. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Data collection and analysis occurred concurrently with the iterative development of the topic guide and coding framework. Key themes were conceptualised through discussion with the wider team. Results Of thirty-eight interviews, 55% (21) of these were in Black or Black British/African/Caribbean/Mixed ethnicities, 32% (12) in Asian / British Asian and 13% (5) in mixed Black and White ethnicities. Key themes included concerns about the speed of vaccine roll-out and potential impacts on health, mistrust of official information, and exposure to misinformation. In addition, exposure to negative messages linked to vaccination appears to outweigh positive messages received. Facilitators included the opportunity to discuss concerns with a healthcare professional, utilising social influences via communities and highlighting incentives. Conclusion COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted ethnic minority groups. Vaccination is an effective strategy for mitigating risk. We have demonstrated factors contributing to vaccine reluctance, hesitancy and refusal and highlighted levers for change."

High PFKFB3 expression in cancer stem cells promotes glycolysis and survival in the tumor microenvironment. Inhibition of PFKFB3 by the glycolytic inhibitor PFK158 and by shRNA stable knockdown in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cell lines inhibited glycolysis, proliferation, spheroid formation, and the expression of cancer stem cell markers CD133, Aldh1, CD44, Sox2, and ABCG2. These factors are also associated with chemotherapy resistance. We found that PFK158 treatment and PFKFB3 knockdown enhanced the ABCG2-interacting drugs doxorubicin, etoposide, and 5-fluorouracil in reducing cell viability under conditions of enriched cancer stem cells (CSC). Additionally, PFKFB3 inhibition attenuated the invasion/migration of SCLC cells by downregulating YAP/TAZ signaling while increasing pLATS1 via activation of pMST1 and NF2 and by reducing the mesenchymal protein expression. PFKFB3 knockdown and PFK158 treatment in a H1048 SCLC cancer stem cell-enriched mouse xenograft model showed significant reduction in tumor growth and weight with reduced expression of cancer stem cell markers, ABCG2, and YAP/TAZ.

However, their activity is compromised by the rising prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), which are especially marked in the Indian subcontinent. In Pakistan, previous reports have warned about the possible spread of CPE in the community, but data are still partial. This study was carried out to analyse the prevalence of CPE, the genetic characterisation, and phylogenetic links among the spreading CPE in the community. In this cohort study, we collected 306 rectal swabs from patients visiting Benazir Bhutto hospital, Rawalpindi. CPEs were screened by using ertapenem-supplemented MacConkey agar. Identification was performed by using conventional biochemical tests, and genomes were sequenced using Illumina chemistry. Antibiotic resistance genes, plasmid incompatibility groups, and Escherichia coli phylogroups were determined in silico. Sequence types were determined by using MLST tool. The prevalence of CPE carriage observed was 14.4% (44/306 samples). The most common carbapenemase-encoding gene was bla-NDM-5 (n = 58) followed by blaNDM-1 (n = 7), blaNDM (non-assigned variant, n = 4), blaOXA-181 (n = 3), blaOXA-232 (n = 3) and blaNDM-7 (n = 1). Most of the CPE were E. coli (55/64, 86%), and the genomic analysis revealed a pauciclonal diffusion of E. coli with ST167 (n = 14), 405 (n = 10), 940 (n = 8), 648 (n = 6) and 617 (n = 5). We obtained a second sample from 94 patients during their hospital stay in whom carriage was negative at admission and found that 7 (7.4%) acquired a CPE. Our results indicate that the prevalence of CPE carriage in the Pakistani urban community was high and driven by the dissemination of some E. coli clones, with ST167 being the most frequent. The high CPE carriage in the community poses a serious public health threat and calls for implementation of adequate preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W4284975444,"Psychological research, including research into adult reading, is frequently based on convenience samples of undergraduate students. This practice raises concerns about the external validity of many accepted findings. The present study seeks to determine how strong this student sampling bias is in literacy and numeracy research. We use the nationally representative cross-national data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies to quantify skill differences between (i) students and the general population aged 16–65, and (ii) students and age-matched non-students aged 16–25. The median effect size for the comparison (i) of literacy scores across 32 countries was d = .56, and for comparison (ii) d = .55, which exceeds the average effect size in psychological experiments (d = .40). Numeracy comparisons (i) and (ii) showed similarly strong differences. The observed differences indicate that undergraduate students are not representative of the general population nor age-matched non-students."
https://openalex.org/W4284968016,"Vaccine hesitancy and refusal remain a major concern for healthcare professionals and policymakers. Hence, it is necessary to ascertain the underlying factors that promote or hinder the uptake of vaccines. Authorities and policy makers are experimenting with vaccine promotion messages to communities using loss and gain-framed messages. However, the effectiveness of message framing in influencing the intention to be vaccinated is unclear. Based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this study analysed the impact of individual attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination, direct and indirect social norms, perceived behavioural control and perceived threat towards South Indian millennials' intention to get vaccinated. The study also assessed the effect of framing vaccine communication messages with gain and loss framing. Data was collected from 228 Millennials from South India during the COVID-19 pandemic from September to October 2021 and analysed using PLS path modelling and Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA). The findings reveal that attitudes towards vaccination, perceived threat and indirect social norms positively impact millennials' intention to take up vaccines in both message frames. Further, independent sample t-test between the framing groups indicate that negative (loss framed message) leads to higher vaccination intention compared to positive (gain framed message). A loss-framed message is thus recommended for message framing to promote vaccine uptake among millennials. These findings provide useful information in understanding the impact of message framing on behavioural intentions, especially in the context of vaccine uptake intentions of Millennials in South India."
https://openalex.org/W4284963198,"Given that skill variety is widely regarded a key component of entrepreneurial human capital, gender differences in entrepreneurship could be rooted in the formation of such skill variety. Analyzing 12-year longitudinal data following 1,321 Finnish adolescents into adulthood, we study whether gender differences in skill variety open up early in the vocational development of entrepreneurs vs. non-entrepreneurs, thereby contributing to the persisting gender gap in entrepreneurship in adulthood. Specifically, structural equation modeling was used to test and compare the mediating effect of early skill variety in adolescence vs. education- and work-related skill variety in early adulthood on the gender gap in entrepreneurial intentions in adulthood. We find that education- and work-related skill variety indeed operate as an obstacle for women entrepreneurship, despite women outperforming men in early skill variety in adolescence. Hence, we identify a critical turning point in early adulthood where women fall behind in their development of entrepreneurial human capital."
https://openalex.org/W4284886929,"Malaria and other apicomplexan-caused diseases affect millions of humans, agricultural animals, and pets. Cell traversal is a common feature used by multiple apicomplexan parasites to migrate through host cells and can be exploited to develop therapeutics against these deadly parasites. Here, we provide insights into the mechanism of the Cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites (CelTOS), a conserved cell-traversal protein in apicomplexan parasites and malaria vaccine candidate. CelTOS has previously been shown to form pores in cell membranes to enable traversal of parasites through cells. We establish roles for the distinct protein regions of Plasmodium vivax CelTOS and examine the mechanism of pore formation. We further demonstrate that CelTOS dimer dissociation is required for pore formation, as disulfide bridging between monomers inhibits pore formation, and this inhibition is rescued by disulfide-bridge reduction. We also show that a helix-destabilizing amino acid, Pro127, allows CelTOS to undergo significant conformational changes to assemble into pores. The flexible C terminus of CelTOS is a negative regulator that limits pore formation. Finally, we highlight that lipid binding is a prerequisite for pore assembly as mutation of a phospholipids-binding site in CelTOS resulted in loss of lipid binding and abrogated pore formation. These findings identify critical regions in CelTOS and will aid in understanding the egress mechanism of malaria and other apicomplexan parasites as well as have implications for studying the function of other essential pore-forming proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4284888282,"The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system serves to translocate folded proteins across energy-transducing membranes in bacteria, archaea, plastids, and some mitochondria. In Escherichia coli, TatA, TatB, and TatC constitute functional translocons. TatA and TatB both possess an N-terminal transmembrane helix (TMH) followed by an amphipathic helix. The TMHs of TatA and TatB generate a hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane, as the helices comprise only 12 consecutive hydrophobic residues; however, the purpose of this mismatch is unclear. Here, we shortened or extended this stretch of hydrophobic residues in either TatA, TatB, or both and analyzed effects on translocon function and assembly. We found the WT length helices functioned best, but some variation was clearly tolerated. Defects in function were exacerbated by simultaneous mutations in TatA and TatB, indicating partial compensation of mutations in each by the other. Furthermore, length variation in TatB destabilized TatBC-containing complexes, revealing that the 12-residue-length is important but not essential for this interaction and translocon assembly. To also address potential effects of helix length on TatA interactions, we characterized these interactions by molecular dynamics simulations, after having characterized the TatA assemblies by metal-tagging transmission electron microscopy. In these simulations, we found that interacting short TMHs of larger TatA assemblies were thinning the membrane and-together with laterally-aligned tilted amphipathic helices-generated a deep V-shaped membrane groove. We propose the 12 consecutive hydrophobic residues may thus serve to destabilize the membrane during Tat transport, and their conservation could represent a delicate compromise between functionality and minimization of proton leakage."
https://openalex.org/W4284963606,"The suborder Gobioidei is among the most diverse groups of vertebrates, comprising about 2310 species. In the fossil record gobioids date back to the early Eocene (c. 50 m.y. ago), and a considerable increase in numbers of described species is evident since the middle Miocene (c. 16 m.y. ago). About 40 skeleton-based gobioid species and > 100 otolith-based species have been described until to date. However, assignment of a fossil gobioid species to specific families has often remained tentative, even if well preserved complete specimens are available. The reasons are that synapomorphies that can be recognized in a fossil skeleton are rare (or absent) and that no phylogenetic framework applicable to gobioid fossils exists. Here we aim to overcome this problem by developing a phylogenetic total evidence framework that is suitable to place a fossil skeleton-based gobioid at family level. Using both literature and newly collected data we assembled a morphological character matrix (48 characters) for 29 extant species, representing all extant gobioid families, and ten fossil gobioid species, and we compiled a multi-gene concatenated alignment (supermatrix; 6271 bp) of published molecular sequence data for the extant species. Bayesian and Maximum Parsimony analyses revealed that our selection of extant species was sufficient to achieve a molecular 'backbone' that fully conforms to previous molecular work. Our data revealed that inclusion of all fossil species simultaneously produced very poorly resolved trees, even for some extant taxa. In contrast, addition of a single fossil species to the total evidence data set of the extant species provided new insight in its possible placement at family level, especially in a Bayesian framework. Five out of the ten fossil species were recovered in the same family as had been suggested in previous works based on comparative morphology. The remaining five fossil species had hitherto been left as family incertae sedis. Now, based on our phylogenetic framework, new and mostly well supported hypotheses to which clades they could belong can be presented. We conclude that the total evidence framework presented here will be beneficial for all future work dealing with the phylogenetic placement of a fossil skeleton-based gobioid and thus will help to improve our understanding of the evolutionary history of these fascinating fishes. Moreover, our data highlight that increased sampling of fossil taxa in a total-evidence context is not universally beneficial, as might be expected, but strongly depends on the study group and peculiarities of the morphological data."
https://openalex.org/W4284975320,"Worldwide, cervical cancer is a real health issue, however, gaps exist in the public's awareness of the causal role of Human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of this disease. This study aims to determine the level of awareness, knowledge and the associated factors on HPV among university students in Morocco. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a descriptive and analytical aim, among students attending Ibn Zohr University, in Agadir, Morocco. An interview questionnaire was used to collect information about the participants: demographic data, awareness and level of knowledge on HPV infection, and awareness of cervical cancer. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the associated factors with awareness and level of knowledge on HPV. A total of 479 students participated in this study (mean age 21.82 ± 2.091). Most participants n = 391 (81.6%) were aware of cervical cancer, while only n = 7 (1.5%) identified HPV as a sexually transmitted infection. Among students, 10.0% (n = 48) were aware of HPV but only half of them n = 23 (47.9%) confirmed that HPV is associated with cervical cancer, and n = 29 (60.4%) showed low knowledge on HPV. Multivariate analysis revealed that HPV awareness has a strong association with a higher level of education (OR 4.04; 95% CI: 1.92-8.52), and with being a biology student (OR 5.20; 95% CI: 2.12-12.73), while high HPV knowledge was only associated with the female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI: 1.01-13.92). The data suggest that university students in Morocco did not show sufficient knowledge of HPV infection and its consequences. This supports that earlier incorporation of sexual health education programs, especially related to HPV and cervical cancer, must be implemented in the university to reduce the burden of HPV-associated diseases among the population at risk."

After eleven days, all treated mice bearing the size of 5-8 mm (in diameter) tumor were administered CpG + anti-OX40 or LPS + anti-OX40 three times with a three-day lap between each treatment. Mice in the control group did not receive any treatment.All the specimens from the control and LPS + anti-OX40 groups have died by the sixtieth day of the observation period, however, five mice from the CpG + anti-OX40 group were still alive. The experiment lasted until the last surviving mouse died, which occurred on the 357th day after tumor implantation.The treatment with LPS did not make anti-OX40 more potent and did not increase the survival times. However, CpG + anti-OX40 has shown increased antitumor activity compared to the other two groups."
https://openalex.org/W4284964235,"China's Loess Plateau regions have experienced severe soil erosion for many decades due to fragmented landscapes, steep slopes, and concentrated rainfall storm-events. Restoring sub-optimal or marginal farming fields, mostly on steep, hilly terrain, to plantation forests has been a long-standing strategic policy in China aimed at rehabilitating degraded environments and reducing soil and water erosion. While there are numerous studies that have focused on the effects of forests at controlling soil erosion at relatively short time scales, few have addressed longer-term effects of plantation forests on reducing runoff and the mechanisms that inhibit erosion. Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) has been widely planted in abandoned or reclaimed lands that were formerly farmed in Northwest China; however, there is limited knowledge about the effectiveness of the tree species at reducing soil and water erosion. In this study, we examined reduction rates of runoff and erosion by Chinese pine plantation in comparison with agricultural land as a control (i.e., wheat, a dominant agricultural commodity in the region), based on long-term monitoring of modified standard erosion plots with slopes of 10°, 15°, and 20°. Results showed that as the slope of the land increased, rates of erosion increased for both plantation and agricultural land use. However, the runoff and soil erosion rates under Chinese pine plantation forest were about 11% and 60% lower, respectively, than those under agricultural land use of the same slope. Scaling with the slope, the highest reduced runoff and erosion rates by Chinese pine forest were 17% and 72%, respectively, on 20° slope. Also, it was found that runoff rates from the forested land were positively related to erosive rainfall (i.e., rainfall when runoff generated), and varied with forest canopy coverage. The rates of runoff and erosion can be well model led with multiple regression models. Taken together, this study provides insight into the importance and potential of Chinese pine plantations in the conservation of soil and water in China's Loess Plateau."

Most of our knowledge about the function of Fox genes comes from vertebrate research, and for arthropods the only comprehensive gene expression analysis is that of the fly Drosophila melanogaster. For other arthropods, only selected Fox genes have been investigated. In this study, we provide the first comprehensive gene expression analysis of arthropod Fox genes including representative species of all main groups of arthropods, Pancrustacea, Myriapoda and Chelicerata. We also provide the first comprehensive analysis of Fox gene expression in an onychophoran species. Our data show that many of the Fox genes likely retained their function during panarthropod evolution highlighting their importance in development. Comparison with published data from other groups of animals shows that this high degree of evolutionary conservation often dates back beyond the last common ancestor of Panarthropoda."
https://openalex.org/W4284899634,"Dendritic computations have a central role in neuronal function, but it is unknown how cell-class heterogeneity of dendritic electrical excitability shapes physiologically engaged neuronal and circuit computations. To address this, we examined dendritic integration in closely related classes of retinal ganglion cells (GCs) using simultaneous somato-dendritic electrical recording techniques in a functionally intact circuit. Simultaneous recordings revealed sustained OFF-GCs generated powerful dendritic spikes in response to visual input that drove action potential firing. In contrast, the dendrites of transient OFF-GCs were passive and did not generate dendritic spikes. Dendritic spike generation allowed sustained, but not transient, OFF-GCs to signal into action potential output the local motion of visual stimuli to produce a continuous wave of action potential firing in adjacent cells as images moved across the retina. Conversely, this representation was highly fragmented in transient OFF-GCs. Thus, a heterogeneity of dendritic excitability defines the computations executed by classes of GCs."
https://openalex.org/W4284958933,"Lingonberry ( Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) extract contains various active ingredients with strong inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth. HepG2 cells were treated with various concentrations of lingonberry extract, cell inhibition rate was measured by CCK-8 assay, and apoptosis rate by annexin-propidium iodide double-staining assay. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry, and cell migration and invasion by transwell assay. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR and western blotting were employed to analyze the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CXCL3). Ki-67, TUNEL, and transwell assays were used to verify the relationship between CXCL3 expression and cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. The composition of lingonberry extract was: 37.58% cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, 10.96% kaempferol 3-O-arabinoside, 4.52% epicatechin, 4.35% chlorogenic acid, 3.83% catechinic acid, 1.54% isoquercitrin, 1.05% 4-hydroxycinnamon acid, 1.03% cyanidin chloride, 0.85% 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 0.55% quercetin, 0.36% D-(-)-quininic acid, 0.96% caffeic acid, 0.16% ferulic acid, 0.12% oleanolic acid, and 0.03% ursolic acid. Lingonberry extract inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. After 48 h exposure to 100 μg/mL extract the inhibition rate and IC 50 were 80.89±6.05% and 22.62 μg/mL, respectively. Lingonberry extract promoted late apoptosis in HepG2 cells and arrested the cell cycle at G2/M and S phases. Lingonberry extract also promoted the apoptosis of HepG2 cancer cells, inhibiting their proliferation, migration, and invasion by regulating the expression of CXCL3. This study offers new insight into the antihepatoma activity of lingonberry extract and provides a basis for the development of pilot antitumor drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4284958980,"Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provides a technical platform for nanoscopic mapping of biological structures. Correct preparation of SEM samples can provide an unprecedented understanding of the nexus between cellular morphology and topography. This comparative study critically examines two coating methods for preparing biological samples for scanning electron microscopy, while also providing novel advice on how to prepare in vitro epithelial or endothelial samples for high-resolution scanning-electron microscopy (HR-SEM). Two obstacles often confront the biologist when investigating cellular structures grown under tissue culture conditions, namely., how to prepare and present the biological samples to the HR-SEM microscope without affecting topographical membrane and cellular structural alterations. Firstly, our use of the Millicell cellulose inserts on which to grow our cellular samples in preparation for HR-SEM is both novel and advantageous to comparing the permeability function of cells to their morphological function. Secondly, biological material is often non-conducting, thermally sensitive and fragile and, therefore, needs to be fixed correctly and coated with thin conducting metal to ensure high-resolution detail of samples. Immortalized mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd5) was used as a basis for describing the preferences in the use of the protocol. We compare two biological sample coating modalities for the visualizing and analysis of texturized, topographical, membranous ultrastructures of brain endothelial cell (BEC) confluent monolayers, namely, carbon and gold:palladium (Au:Pd) sputter coating in preparation for HR-SEM. BEC monolayers sputter-coated with these two modalities produced three-dimensional micrographs which have distinctly different topographical detail from which the nanostructural cellular data can be examined. The two coating methods display differences in the amount of nanoscopic detail that could be resolved in the nanosized membrane cytoarchitecture of BEC monolayers. The micrographical data clearly showed that Au:Pd sputter-coated samples generate descript imagery, providing useful information for profiling membrane nanostructures compared to carbon-coated samples. The recommendations regarding the contrast in two modalities would provide the necessary guidance to biological microscopists in preparing tissue culture samples for HR-SEM."

However, the antibiotic resistance crisis and/or inability to treat chronic biofilm infections remains to be a formidable and increasing health threat. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that plant essential oils (PEOs) with anti-staphylococcal qualities could inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus (a major etiological agent of periprosthetic joint infection) in agar pour plates when infused in calcium sulfate beads. To begin, we conducted a screen of 57 single plant PEOs for anti-staphylococcal activity via disk diffusions assays. We observed that 55/57 of the PEOs had significant growth inhibitory activity compared to the null hypothesis, and 41/57 PEOs exhibited activity similar-to-or-higher-than a vancomycin minimum inhibitory control. When PEOs were infused in beads, we observed that 17/57 PEOs tested exhibited significant bacterial growth inhibition when encased in S . aureus -seeded agar compared to a null hypothesis of six millimeters (bead size). However, none of the PEO-beads had activity similar to a vancomycin bead control made according to a clinically relevant formula. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report and screen of PEOs for growth inhibitory activity when infused in lab-made calcium sulfate beads. These data indicate that antibacterial PEOs warrant further investigations, and may be useful in developing new treatment strategies for periprosthetic joint infection."
https://openalex.org/W4284962452,"Class II myosin complexes are responsible for muscle contraction as well as other non-sarcomeric contractile functions in cells. Myosin heavy chain molecules form the core of these structures, while light chain molecules regulate their stability and function. MYL9 is a light chain isoform that is thought to regulate non-sarcomeric myosin. However, whether this in only in specific cell types or in all cells remains unclear. To address this, we generated MYL9 deficient mice. These mice die soon after birth with abnormalities in multiple organs. All mice exhibited a distended bladder, shortening of the small intestine and alveolar overdistension in the lung. The Myl9 allele in these mice included a LacZ reporter knockin that allowed for mapping of Myl9 gene expression. Using this reporter, we show that MYL9 expression is restricted to the muscularis propria of the small intestine and bladder, as well as in the smooth muscle layer of the bronchi in the lung and major bladder vessels in all organs. This suggests that MYL9 is important for the function of smooth muscle cells in these organs. Smooth muscle dysfunction is therefore likely to be the cause of the abnormalities observed in the intestine, bladder and lung of MYL9 deficient mice and the resulting neonatal lethality."

However, this has not been fully investigated in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Using a cohort consisting of mostly Asian population, we enrolled 87,567 adult patients who underwent cancer surgery from March 2010 to December 2019. They were divided into three groups according to body mass index (BMI): 53,980 (61.6%) in the normal (18.5-25 kg/m2), 2,787 (3.2%) in the low BMI (<18.5 kg/m2), and 30,800 (35.2%) in the high BMI (≥25 kg/m2) groups. The high BMI group was further stratified into overweight (25-30 kg/m2) and obese (≥30 kg/m2) groups. The primary outcome was mortality during three years after surgery. Following adjustment by inverse probability weighting, mortality during three years after surgery was significantly lower in the high BMI group than the normal (4.8% vs. 7.0%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.77; p < 0.001) and low BMI (4.8% vs. 13.0%; HR: 0.38; CI: 0.35-0.42; p < 0.001) groups. The mortalities of the overweight and obese groups were lower than that of the normal group (7.0% vs. 5.0%; HR: 0.72; CI: 0.67-0.77; p < 0.001 and 7.0% vs. 3.3%; HR: 0.57; CI: 0.50-0.65; p < 0.001, respectively).

Objective Our goal was to measure the accuracy of two brands of dental radiometers in reporting the power (mW) from twelve brands of contemporary LCUs compared to a ‘gold standard’ (GS) reference value obtained from an integrating sphere attached to a fiberoptic spectroradiometer. Methods The power output was measured from two units of 12 brands of LCUs, five times on the ‘‘GS” system, five times on two Bluephase Meter II dental radiometers, and five times on two Mini Gig hand-held spectroradiometers. The emission spectrum was also recorded using the ‘GS’ integrating sphere. The power values reported by each meter were subjected to t-tests to compare the two examples of each LCU, and 3-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc tests. Regression analyses were also performed to determine the relationship between the data from the hand-held radiometers and the ‘GS’ integrating sphere. Results There was a large difference in the power values (mW) and the emission spectra from the 12 brands of LCUs on their standard-settings (p&lt;0.001). Except for one LCU (Dental Spark @ 15.1%), the differences between the two LCUs of the same brand were less than 5.3% when measured using the ‘GS’ integrating sphere. Regression analyses showed a highly significant agreement between the power values reported from the two brands of radiometers and the ‘GS’ integrating sphere (R 2 &gt; 98%). Conclusion We concluded that the power values reported from both brands of dental radiometers we tested were accurate, provided that the light source did not emit wavelengths of light that were beyond the radiometer’s detection limit."

https://openalex.org/W4284991174,"Terpene indole alkaloids (TIAs) are plant-derived specialized metabolites with widespread use in medicine. Species-specific pathways derive various TIAs from common intermediates, strictosidine or strictosidinic acid, produced by coupling tryptamine with secologanin or secologanic acid. The penultimate reaction in this pathway is catalyzed by either secologanin synthase (SLS) or secologanic acid synthase (SLAS) according to whether plants produce secologanin from loganin or secologanic acid from loganic acid. Previous work has identified SLSs and SLASs from different species, but the determinants of selectivity remain unclear. Here, combining molecular modeling, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and biochemical methodologies, we identified key residues that toggle SLS and SLAS selectivity in two CYP72A (cytochrome P450) subfamily enzymes from Camptotheca acuminata. We found that the positions of foremost importance are in substrate recognition sequence 1 (SRS1), where mutations to either of two adjacent histidine residues switched selectivity; His131Phe selects for and increases secologanin production whereas His132Asp selects for secologanic acid production. Furthermore, a change in SRS3 in the predicted substrate entry channel (Arg/Lys270Thr) and another in SRS4 at the start of the I-helix (Ser324Glu) decreased enzyme activity toward either substrate. We propose that the Camptotheca SLASs have maintained the broadened activities found in a common asterid ancestor, even as the Camptotheca lineage lost its ability to produce loganin while the campanulid and lamiid lineages specialized to produce secologanin by acquiring mutations in SRS1. The identification here of the residues essential for the broad substrate scope of SLASs presents opportunities for more tailored heterologous production of TIAs."

In Experiment 1, we measured the influence of upper limbs activity (movement speed and distance) on step counts of wristband-type and waist holder-type PAT in two upper limb tasks. In Experiment 2, we verified the measurement accuracy of two sleep times by wristband-type PAT using a self-reported survey for 3 days. Results The results of Experiment 1 revealed that the step counts using wristband-type PAT were influenced by upper limbs activity depending on movement distance (F (1, 19) = 31.705, p &lt; 0.001) but not speed (F (1, 19) = 2.669, p &lt; 0.117). Whereas, there was no relationship between step counts and upper limb activity in waist holder-type PAT. The results of Experiment 2 showed that the sleep times of wristband-type and self-report had a strong correlation (coefficient value = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions This PAT is useful for capturing changes in the amount of physical activity and the daily rhythm within the individual. It can be expected to be used for rehabilitation support centered on upper limb activity and daily rhythm."

However, research on the structural stability of the evolving developer collaboration network in OSS communities is relatively insufficient. In this paper, according to the software version sequence, we construct the corresponding developer collaboration network of the Angular OSS community and then analyse this network’s structural stability during network evolution. The results show that the network always presents an economical modular small-world structure during its evolution. The maintenance of the structure is related to a cohesive core, which is composed of two types of nodes (i.e., hubs and connectors). The hubs organize noncore nodes to form modules, while connectors facilitate the formation of inter-module connections. The overall results highlight the important role of core developers in the sustainable development of OSS communities and may provide a reference for community initiators to implement protection strategies for core developers."

Our research aimed to assess the influence of gender difference on social support, information preference, biological rhythm, psychological distress, and the possible interaction among these factors during the COVID-19 pandemic.In this cross-sectional study, 3,237 respondents aged 12 years and older finished the online survey. Levels of social support, information preference, biological rhythm, and psychological distress were assessed using validated scales. A path analysis was conducted to explore possible associations among these variables.The path analysis indicated that women with high levels of social support had a lower possibility of biological rhythm disorders and lower levels of somatization symptoms of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The influence of social support on somatization symptoms was exerted via biological rhythm. Women tended to believe both negative and positive information, while men preferred more extreme information.Our results highlighted gender difference in study variables during the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of social support in alleviating psychological distress and biological rhythm disorders. Moreover, we confirmed that information preference differed significantly by somatization symptoms of psychological distress, suggesting extra efforts to provide more individualized epidemic information. Longitudinal research is required to further explore casual inferences."
https://openalex.org/W4284966529,"One of the world's most serious environmental issues is solid waste management. It is critical for researchers to understand the intention to comply with solid waste management. Thus, we aim to determine the intention to comply with solid waste management practice among households in Butajira Town using the Theory of Planned Behavior.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 422 households in Butajira from June 1 to June 30, 2020. The constructs and principles of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) were measured. We selected using a systematic sampling method and collected data by using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. The predictors of intention to practice solid waste management were identified using a multivariable linear regression model. A P-value of less than 5% was considered to declare a significant association.The findings demonstrated that intention to practice solid waste management explained 86% of the variance explained by all predictors. The perceived behavioral control construct had the greatest impact on households' behavioral intentions to comply with solid waste management practice (β = 0.16; CI (0.14, 0.18), followed by attitude (β = 0.15; CI (0.11, 0.21) and subjective norms (β = 0.12; CI (0.06, 0.17).Our study also found that intention has a substantial influence on the behavior of solid waste management practices. Therefore, there is a need to enhance service utilization for solid waste management and to improve outdoor solid waste dropping behavior through door-to-door collection services by municipality. Furthermore, further longitudinal research should be done through intervention mapping."

From 2015 to 2019, the Accessing Safe Deliveries in Tanzania project was implemented to study how to improve access to CEmONC services in underserved rural areas. Methods A five-year longitudinal cohort study was implemented in seven health centres (HCs) and 21 satellite dispensaries in Morogoro region. Five of the health centres received CEmONC interventions and two served as controls. Forty-two associate clinicians from the intervention HCs were trained in teams for three months in CEmONC and anaesthesia. Managers of 20 intervention facilities, members of the district and regional health management teams were trained in leadership and management. Regular supportive supervision was conducted. Results Interventions resulted in improved responsibility and accountability among managers. In intervention HCs, the mean monthly deliveries increased from 183 (95% CI 174–191) at baseline (July 2014 –June 2016) to 358 (95% CI 328–390) during the intervention period (July 2016 –June 2019). The referral rate to district hospitals in intervention HCs decreased from 6.0% (262/4,392) with 95% CI 5.3–6.7 at baseline to 4.0% (516/12,918) with 95% CI 3.7–4.3 during the intervention period while it increased in the control group from 0.8% (48/5,709) to 1.5% (168/11,233). The obstetric case fatality rate decreased slightly from 1.5% (95% CI 0.6–3.1) at baseline to 1.1% (95% CI 0.7–1.6) during the intervention period (not statistically significant). Active engagement strategies and training in leadership and management resulted in uptake and improvement of CEmONC and anaesthesia curricula, and contributed to scale up of CEmONC at health centre level in the country. Conclusions Integration of leadership and managerial capacity building, with CEmONC-specific interventions was associated with health systems strengthening and improved quality of services."
https://openalex.org/W4284989691,"The β-cells of the islets of Langerhans are the sole producers of insulin in the human body. In response to rising glucose levels, insulin-containing vesicles inside β-cells fuse with the plasma membrane and release their cargo. However, the mechanisms regulating this process are only partly understood. Previous evidence indicated reductions in α-catenin elevate insulin release, while reductions in β-catenin decrease insulin release. α- and β-catenin contribute to cellular regulation in a range of ways but one is as members of the adherens junction complex. Therefore, we investigated the effects of adherens junctions on insulin release. We show in INS-1E β-cells knockdown of either E- or N-cadherin had only small effects on insulin secretion, but simultaneous knockdown of both cadherins resulted in a significant increase in basal insulin release to the same level as glucose-stimulated release. This double knockdown also significantly attenuated levels of p120 catenin, a cadherin-binding partner involved in regulating cadherin turnover. Conversely, reducing p120 catenin levels with siRNA destabilized both E- and N-cadherin, and this was also associated with an increase in levels of insulin secreted from INS-1E cells. Furthermore, there were also changes in these cells consistent with higher insulin release, namely reductions in levels of F-actin and increased intracellular free Ca2+ levels in response to KCl-induced membrane depolarization. Taken together, these data provide evidence that adherens junctions play important roles in retaining a pool of insulin secretory vesicles within the cell and establish a role for p120 catenin in regulating this process."
