https://openalex.org/W1980046754,"Barbados provides a possibly unique opportunity for reconstruction of the times and elevations of late-Pleistocene high stands of the sea. The island appears to be rising from the sea at a uniform rate that is fast enough to separate in elevation coral-reef tracts formed at successive high stands of the sea. Unaltered coral found in the lower terraces enables high-precision Th(230): U(234) and Pa(231): U(235) dating. Three distinct high stands of the sea are found about 122,000, 103,000, and 82,000 years ago. New Pa(231) and Th(230) dates from a deep-sea core also indicate that Ericson's W-X cold-to-warm climatic change occurred close to 126,000 years ago. These data show a parallelism over the last 150,000 years between changes in Earth's climate and changes in the summer insolation predicted from cycles in the tilt and precession of Earth's axis."
https://openalex.org/W2048900411,"Territorial behavior of the Uganda kob, Adenota kob thomasi (P. L. Sclater), is largely the defense of small, fixed territories within a central area of concentrated territorial activity. This area is surrounded by a zone of more widely spaced territories. Females enter the territorial ground throughout the year for the purpose of breeding."

https://openalex.org/W2090848529,"The reaction of calcite with hydrogen was investigated over a range of pressure, temperature, and time. The reaction initiates at about 500 degrees C. Its primarily temperature-dependent rateproceeds in a crystallographically anisotropic manner, and reaction products are CaO, Ca(OH)(2), H(2)O, CO, CH(4), C2H(6), and C (graphite), plus a black solid residue that may be hydrocarbon."

A possible decrease in frequency of 150 cycles per second was detected, which cannot be caused by general relativity or by the plasma around Sun."
https://openalex.org/W1996254233,"Olivine compositions in pallasites exhibit a bimodal distribution and indicate a high degree of internal equilibrium. Cooling rates measured in the metal phases are uniform and consistently lower than those of most iron meteorites. These factors suggest that the pallasites were derived from few parent bodies, and that they crystallized in a highly insulated site-presumably the core of their parent body. Most iron meteorites were derived either from isolated areas closer to the surface or from other parent bodies."

https://openalex.org/W2090424251,"Bioluminescence measurements made by stimulation of the organisms in a jet of water directed at the face of a phototube have increased the sensitivity of data by a factor of 1000 over ""spontaneous"" luminescence measurements. In light-baffled cells it has been possible to map the surface bioluminescence of large areas continuously in broad daylight. Measurements of intensity versus depth during both day and night do not show any appreciable diurnal variation in maximum intensity, although there does appear to be a vertical migration of intensity."

https://openalex.org/W2020492399,"Various workers have shown that the Luck√© carcinoma, a transmissible kidney tumor of the leopard frog, occurs spontaneously at low incidence (6.7 percent maximum). However, we have consistently observed much higher incidences (50 percent maximum), a finding of probable significance in the epidemiology and natural transmission of the tumor. Age, metabolic level, and cross infection are being investigated as possible factors in determining the tumor incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2080471304,"Fluorescence spectra of algae and higher plants show two bands, ascribable to monomer and aggregate forms of chlorophyll. At low temperature, the long wavelength emission is greatly enhanced and often appears as a new band. Photosynthetic bacteria, on the other hand, show no new bands at low temperature, within the spectral coverage and sensitivity of these measurements. A green fluorescence is also found in algae, which we attribute to carotenoids."

https://openalex.org/W2037065096,"The gem-grade jet found in Upper Cretaceous rocks of the Jet Basin, Wayne County, Utah, has been shown to be a vitrinitic, high-volatile B bituminous coal with aberrant chemical constitution. The residual structure is entirely that of taxodiaceous conifer wood. The abnormally high volatile content (62 percent) and low reflectance (0.25 percent) of Utah jet compared with other vitrinites of similar rank is produced by the unusual derivatives of cellulose and lignin of which the woody structure is composed."

https://openalex.org/W2034825388,"If Mercury has been rotating with, a period exactly two-thirds of the period of orbital revolution for at least 60,000 years, there exist two permanent thermal bulges on opposite sides of Mercury's surface that alternately face Sun at every perihelion. The bulges increase the strength of the resonance lock and tend to prevent drifting out."

Under these conditions Earth appear very heavily covered by clouds. Since details on the surface of Earth can be recorded from Earth orbit, it may be possible to phiotograph protions of the surface of Venus, through openings in the clouds, from an orbiting satellite."
