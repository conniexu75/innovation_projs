https://openalex.org/W2092062478,"Signal-to-noise ratio, the ratio between signal and noise, is a quantity that has been well established for MRI data but is still subject of ongoing debate and confusion when it comes to fMRI data. fMRI data are characterised by small activation fluctuations in a background of noise. Depending on how the signal of interest and the noise are identified, signal-to-noise ratio for fMRI data is reported by using many different definitions. Since each definition comes with a different scale, interpreting and comparing signal-to-noise ratio values for fMRI data can be a very challenging job. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing definitions. Further, the relationship with activation detection power is investigated. Reference tables and conversion formulae are provided to facilitate comparability between fMRI studies."
https://openalex.org/W2171397342,"Today, most wild tigers live in small, isolated Protected Areas within human dominated landscapes in the Indian subcontinent. Future survival of tigers depends on increasing local population size, as well as maintaining connectivity between populations. While significant conservation effort has been invested in increasing tiger population size, few initiatives have focused on landscape-level connectivity and on understanding the effect different landscape elements have on maintaining connectivity. We combined individual-based genetic and landscape ecology approaches to address this issue in six protected areas with varying tiger densities and separation in the Central Indian tiger landscape. We non-invasively sampled 55 tigers from different protected areas within this landscape. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian genetic assignment tests indicate long-range tiger dispersal (on the order of 650 km) between protected areas. Further geo-spatial analyses revealed that tiger connectivity was affected by landscape elements such as human settlements, road density and host-population tiger density, but not by distance between populations. Our results elucidate the importance of landscape and habitat viability outside and between protected areas and provide a quantitative approach to test functionality of tiger corridors. We suggest future management strategies aim to minimize urban expansion between protected areas to maximize tiger connectivity. Achieving this goal in the context of ongoing urbanization and need to sustain current economic growth exerts enormous pressure on the remaining tiger habitats and emerges as a big challenge to conserve wild tigers in the Indian subcontinent."
https://openalex.org/W2163611331,"Transplantation of endothelial cells (ECs) for therapeutic vascularization or tissue engineering is a promising method for increasing tissue perfusion. Here, we report on a new approach for enhanced EC transplantation using targeted nanoparticle transfection to deliver proangiogenic microRNA-132 (miR-132) to cultured ECs before their transplantation, thereby sensitizing cells to the effects of endogenous growth factors. We synthesized biodegradable PLGA polymer nanoparticles (NPs) that were loaded with miR-132 and coated with cyclic RGD (cRGD) peptides that target integrin αvβ3 expressed on cultured human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs), increasing NP uptake through clathrin-coated pits. Unlike previously reported NPs for miR delivery, these NPs slowly release RNA for several weeks. The endocytosed NPs remain in clathrin-coated vesicles from which they mediate intracellular delivery of siRNA or miRNA. Transfection of HUVECs with miR-132 enhances growth factor-induced proliferation and migration in 2D culture, producing a 1.8- and 5-fold increase, respectively. However, while the effects of conventional transfection were short-lived, NP transfection produced protein knockdown and biological effects that were significantly longer in duration (≥6 d). Transfection of HUVECs with miR-132 NP resulted in a 2-fold increase in the number of microvessels per square millimeter compared to lipid after transplantation into immunodeficient mice and led to a higher number of mural cell-invested vessels than control transfection. These data suggest that sustained delivery of miR-132 encapsulated in a targeted biodegradable polymer NP is a safe and efficient strategy to improve EC transplantation and vascularization.—Devalliere, J., Chang, W.

Previous studies have suggested that a reduction in the expression of certain miRs, or an overall decrease in miR processing through the partial depletion of Dicer, can promote enhanced metastatic potential. We show here that Dicer depletion can promote the invasive behavior of cells that is reflected in enhanced recycling and activation of the growth factor receptors Met and EGF receptor. These responses are also seen in response to the expression of tumor-derived mutant p53s, and we show that mutant p53 can down-regulate Dicer expression through both direct inhibition of the TAp63-mediated transcriptional activation of Dicer and a TAp63-independent control of Dicer protein expression. Our results delineate a clear relationship between mutant p53, TAp63, and Dicer that might contribute to the metastatic function of mutant p53 but, interestingly, also reveal TAp63-independent functions of mutant p53 in controlling Dicer activity.

MicroRNAs (miRs) 2The abbreviations used are:miRmicroRNApri-miRprimary miRpre-miRprecursor miRTAtransactivationRCPRab coupling proteinEGFREGF receptorHGFhepatocyte growth factorqRT-PCRquantitative PCREVempty vector. are short hairpin RNA structures that are transcribed from DNA as primary (pri)-miRs and then cleaved by Drosha to generate precursor (pre)-miRs. These pre-miRs are further processed by Dicer to generate mature miRs that can either block translation or promote the degradation of target mRNA (1.Filipowicz W. Bhattacharyya S.N. Sonenberg N. Mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs. Are the answers in sight?.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (4157) Google Scholar). In the last decade, several studies have demonstrated an important role for miRs in various diseases, including cancer, where miRs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors (2.Ventura A. Jacks T. MicroRNAs and cancer. Short RNAs go a long way.Cell. 2009; 136: 586-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). MicroRNA profiling studies demonstrated a decreased global expression of mature miRs in human and murine cancers (3.Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A.

The p53-related proteins (comprising p53, p63, and p73) are transcription factors that regulate the expression of a large variety of miRs. p53 binding elements are present in the promoters of several microRNA processing proteins, including Dicer (5.Boominathan L.

Furthermore, murine Dicer has been shown to be a transcriptional target of TAp63 (6.Su X. Chakravarti D. Cho M.S. Liu L. Gi Y.J. Lin Y.L. Leung M.L. El-Naggar A. Creighton C.J. Suraokar M.B.

Studies in TA domain- or ΔN-specific knockout mice have identified distinct and separate roles for each isoform, with embryonic lethality of ΔNp63−/− mice because of severe skin defects (7.Romano R.A.

Interestingly, loss of TAp63 coincided with decreased Dicer expression and a concomitant decrease in the expression of mature miRs (6.Su X. Chakravarti D. Cho M.S. Liu L. Gi Y.J. Lin Y.L. Leung M.L.

Similar results were observed in cell systems where decreased Dicer expression resulted in a down-regulation of mature miRs with a consequent promotion of extracellular matrix and invasion (11.Martello G.

Kang C.S. Downregulation of Dicer enhances tumor cell proliferation and invasion.Int. J. Oncol. 2010; 37: 299-305PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to decreased Dicer expression, many metastatic cancers acquire mutations in the tumor suppressor p53, leading to the loss of p53 or the expression of a mutant p53 protein. Mutant p53 proteins may exert a dominant negative function over wild-type p53 but also acquire novel functions to promote tumorigenesis. Although the mechanisms through which mutant p53 functions are still under investigation, some of the tumor-associated mutations promote the binding of mutant p53 to proteins such as transcription factors, transcription enhancers, or kinases. These interactions are not always seen with wild-type p53, and they allow mutant p53 to acquire an oncogenic role (13.Muller P.A. Vousden K.H. p53 mutations in cancer.Nat.

Briefly, Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was diluted in PBS to a protein concentration of 6 mg/ml, supplemented with 25 ng/ml fibronectin (Sigma), and polymerized in transwell inserts. After polymerization, the transwells were inverted, and 2.5 × 104 (H1299) or 3.5 × 104 (MDA MB 231) cells were seeded on the membrane. After settling for 4–6 h, the transwells were placed in serum-free medium, and the upper chamber was filled with 100 μl of medium supplemented with 10% FBS and EGF (25 ng/ml) or HGF (10 ng/ml for H1299 and 30 ng/ml for MDA MB231). Invasion was monitored by staining the cells with 4 nm calcein and was visualized by confocal microscopy (Leica 2) in serial sections of 15 μm throughout the Matrigel plug. Invasion was quantified using ImageJ and the plugin area calculation, in which the total intensity of all slides beyond 30 μm was determined as a percentage of invasion in all slides. Scatter assays were performed as described previously (23.Muller P.A. Trinidad A.G. Timpson P. Morton J.P. Zanivan S. van den Berghe P.V. Nixon C. Karim S.A. Caswell P.T. Noll J.E. Coffill C.R.

Cells were seeded sparsely and transfected as described elsewhere. After 6 h, H1299 cells were washed and allowed to form colonies for 48 h. HT29 cells were washed after 6 h and incubated in HGF for 72 h to induce scattering. Phase-contrast images of scattered cells were taken with an Olympus CKX41 microscope, and lysates were harvested to verify knockdown. Scattering was quantified by counting the number of “scattered” or “unscattered” cells per image in each experiment using the ImageJ plugin “cell counter,” and the proportion of scattered cells was plotted. Scattered H1299 cells were defined as cells that were growing in colonies of four cells or less. In HT29 cells, cells were defined as scattered if they were only touching one other neighboring cell. H1299 cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 1% BSA in PBS, followed by incubation in Dicer (1:50, Abcam) and ZO-1 (1:75, Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After three PBS washes, cells were incubated in secondary mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody for 1 h at room temperature and supplemented with DAPI (Sigma, 0.5 μg/ml). Cells were washed five times with PBS and mounted on microscope slides. Confocal images were made using a Zeiss 710 microscope. Recycling assays were performed as described previously (23.Muller P.A.

Biotinylated receptors were allowed to recycle back to the plasma membrane for 0, 15, or 30 min, after which the percentage of intracellular biotinylated receptors was determined using capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RNA for detection of miR, pri-miR, or mRNA was isolated using TRIzol according to the protocol of the manufacturer. For mRNA and pri-miR detection, cDNA was generated using oligo(dT) and a first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For the RT-PCR reaction, 5 μl of the 40×-diluted cDNA was used in combination with 10 ml of SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Scientific), 1 μl of each oligo (10 μm), and 3 μl of H2O with the following PCR conditions: 94 °C annealing for 2 min, 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a 10-min 72 °C incubation. A melting curve was then generated to check for specificity of the oligos. mRNA expression of GAPDH was used as a reference. The oligos used were as follows: GAPDH, 5′-GCA GAG ATG ATG ACC CTT TTG GCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGA AGC TCG GAG TCA ACG GAT TTG GT-3′ (reverse); p63, 5′-TTC TTA GCG AGG TTG GGC TG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAT CGC ATG TCG AAA TTG CTC-3′ (reverse); Dicer, 5′ AGC TGT CCT ATC AGA TCA GGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAT TCA AGG CGA CAT AGC AAG T-3′ (reverse); pri-miR-130b, 5′-CCT GTT GCA CTA CTA TAG GCC G-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGC CCT TTT AAC ATT GCA CTG-3′ (reverse); and pri-miR-206, 5′-ACA TGC TTC TTT ATA TCC CCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAA CCA CAC ACT TCC TTA CAT TC-3′ (reverse).

We found a similar effect following incomplete siRNA-mediated depletion of Dicer in H1299 cells, which showed enhanced invasion toward HGF in response to partial Dicer depletion (Fig. 1a). As shown previously, this invasive capacity was lost following a more efficient knockdown of Dicer (Fig. 1a), probably because of sensitization of cells to apoptosis or cell death (11.Martello G. Rosato A. Ferrari F. Manfrin A. Cordenonsi M. Dupont S. Enzo E. Guzzardo V. Rondina M. Spruce T. Parenti A.R. Daidone M.G. Bicciato S. Piccolo S.

To avoid artifacts caused by cell death, all experiments hereafter were performed with 15 pmol siRNA of Dicer. Enhanced invasion of H1299 cells toward HGF following Dicer depletion was dependent on the HGF receptor MET, as invasion was opposed by simultaneous transfection of MET siRNA with siRNAs targeting Dicer (Fig. 1b). MET signaling can drive cell scattering, and we found that a siRNA-mediated reduction in Dicer expression promoted scattering in a MET-dependent manner (Fig. 1c). Concomitant with scattering, loss of ZO-1 from the cell-cell junctions was apparent after knockdown of Dicer (Fig. 1d). Our previous studies showed expression of mutant p53 in H1299 cells that do not express any p53 protein endogenously, enhanced scattering and invasion by promoting MET receptor recycling that is driven by α5β1 integrin and the Rab11 effector protein RCP (23.Muller P.A.

Depletion of RCP in Dicer knockdown cells prevented invasion (Fig. 1b) and scattering (c), indicating that RCP is important in mediating invasion and scattering after reduced Dicer expression. To investigate whether Dicer can play a role in regulating RCP-driven recycling, we initially investigated the interaction between RCP and α5 integrin. Knockdown of Dicer enhanced the association between RCP and α5 integrin, whereas the known interaction between RCP and Rab11 remained unchanged (Fig. 2a). Mutant p53 expression also increased the RCP-α5 integrin association, consistent with our previous results (16.Muller P.A. Caswell"

The NLRP3 inflammasome, a protein complex controlling maturation of important pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, is also involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis of various cancers. Methodology/Principal Findings To clarify whether M.hy promoted tumor development via inflammasome activation, we analyzed monocytes for IL-1β and IL-18 production upon M.hy challenge. When exposed to M.hy, human monocytes exhibited rapid and robust IL-1β and IL-18 secretion. We further identified that lipid-associated membrane protein (LAMP) from M.hy was responsible for IL-1β induction. Applying competitive inhibitors, gene specific shRNA and gene targeted mice, we verified that M.hy induced IL-1β secretion was NLRP3-dependent in vitro and in vivo. Cathepsin B activity, K+ efflux, Ca2+ influx and ROS production were all required for the NLRP3 inflammasome activation by M.hy. Importantly, it is IL-1β but not IL-18 produced from macrophages challenged with M.hy promoted gastric cancer cell migration and invasion. Conclusions Our data suggest that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by M.hy may be associated with its promotion of gastric cancer metastasis, and anti-M.hy therapy or limiting NLRP3 signaling could be effective approach for control of gastric cancer progress."
https://openalex.org/W2003523666,"In a previous study we have shown that public buses in Oporto, the second largest city in Portugal, were highly contaminated with MRSA. Here we describe the results of a similar study performed in another urban area of Portugal-Lisbon, the capital. Between May 2011 and May 2012, hand touched surfaces of 199 public buses in Lisbon were screened for MRSA contamination. Subsequently, the hands of 575 passengers who frequently use these bus lines were also screened. All hand carriers of MRSA were further screened for nasal carriage. The isolates were characterized by PFGE, staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec typing, spa typing, MLST and were tested for the presence of mecA, Panton-Valentine leukocidin and arginine catabolic mobile element genes. MRSA contamination was shown in 72 buses (36.2%). The majority of the isolates belonged to three major clones: Clone A was identified as EMRSA-15 defined by pattern PFGE A, spa types t2357/t747/t025/t379/t910, ST22, and SCCmec IVh (n = 21; 29%). Clone B was the New York/Japan clone characterized by PFGE B-t002/t10682-ST5-II (n = 15; 21%). Clone C included isolates with characteristics of the international community-acquired USA300 or related clones, PFGE C-t008-ST8-IVa/IVc/IVg/IVnt/VI (n = 19; 26%). The first two clones are currently the two major lineages circulating in Portuguese hospitals. The hands of 15 individuals were contaminated with MRSA belonging to the nosocomial clones A or B. Eleven of these individuals were not nasal carriers of MRSA and all but one had travelled by public transportation, namely by bus, prior to sampling. In conclusion, public buses in two major cities in Portugal are often contaminated with MRSA representing clones dominant in hospitals in the particular geographic area. MRSA contamination of public transport and the transfer of the bacteria to the hands of passengers may represent a route through which hospital-acquired MRSA clones may spread to the community."
https://openalex.org/W2132900722,"The resection of DNA double strand breaks initiates homologous recombination (HR) and is critical for genomic stability. Using direct measurement of resection in human cells and reconstituted assays of resection with purified proteins in vitro, we show that DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a classic nonhomologous end joining factor, antagonizes double strand break resection by blocking the recruitment of resection enzymes such as exonuclease 1 (Exo1). Autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs promotes DNA-PKcs dissociation and consequently Exo1 binding. Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase activity can compensate for DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation and promote resection under conditions where DNA-PKcs catalytic activity is inhibited. The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex further stimulates resection in the presence of Ku and DNA-PKcs by recruiting Exo1 and enhancing DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation, and it also inhibits DNA ligase IV/XRCC4-mediated end rejoining. This work suggests that, in addition to its key role in nonhomologous end joining, DNA-PKcs also acts in concert with MRN and ataxia telangiectasia-mutated to regulate resection and thus DNA repair pathway choice."

Mitochondrial proteomic analysis at the initial phase of degeneration in the model detected lowered expression of 80 mitochondrial proteins including subunits of respiratory complexes, ATP machinery, fatty acid metabolism, and Krebs cycle, which further decreased in expression during the peak degenerative phase. The mass spectrometry (MS) data were supported by enzyme assays, Western blot, and histochemistry. The CTX model also displayed markers of oxidative stress and a lowered glutathione reduced/oxidized ratio (GSH/GSSG) similar to MDs, human myopathies, and neurogenic atrophies. MS analysis identified 6 unique oxidized proteins from Duchenne muscular dystrophy samples (n = 6) (versus controls; n = 6), including two mitochondrial proteins. Interestingly, these mitochondrial proteins were down-regulated in the CTX model thereby linking oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W1995370380,"Langerin, a C-type lectin on Langerhans cells, mediates carbohydrate-dependent uptake of pathogens in the first step of antigen presentation to the adaptive immune system. Langerin binds a diverse range of carbohydrates including high mannose structures, fucosylated blood group antigens, and glycans with terminal 6-sulfated galactose. Mutagenesis and quantitative binding assays indicate that salt bridges between the sulfate group and two lysine residues compensate for the nonoptimal binding of galactose at the primary Ca(2+) site. A commonly occurring single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in human langerin results in change of one of these lysine residues, Lys-313, to isoleucine. Glycan array screening reveals that this amino acid change abolishes binding to oligosaccharides with terminal 6SO4-Gal and enhances binding to oligosaccharides with terminal GlcNAc residues. Structural analysis shows that enhanced binding to GlcNAc may result from Ile-313 packing against the N-acetyl group. The K313I polymorphism is tightly linked to another SNP that results in the change N288D, which reduces affinity for glycan ligands by destabilizing the Ca(2+)-binding site. Langerin with Asp-288 and Ile-313 shows no binding to 6SO4-Gal-terminated glycans and increased binding to GlcNAc-terminated structures, but overall decreased binding to glycans. Altered langerin function in individuals with the linked N288D and K313I polymorphisms may affect susceptibility to infection by microorganisms."

https://openalex.org/W2005042236,"The human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes produces pili that are essential for adhesion to host surface receptors. Cpa, the adhesin at the pilus tip, was recently shown to have a thioester-containing domain. The thioester bond is believed to be important in adhesion, implying a mechanism of covalent attachment analogous to that used by human complement factors. Here, we have characterized a second active thioester-containing domain on Cpa, the N-terminal domain of Cpa (CpaN). Expression of CpaN in Escherichia coli gave covalently linked dimers. These were shown by x-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry to comprise two CpaN molecules cross-linked by the polyamine spermidine following reaction with the thioester bonds. This cross-linked CpaN dimer provides a model for the covalent attachment of Cpa to target receptors and thus the streptococcal pilus to host cells. Similar thioester domains were identified in cell wall proteins of other Gram-positive pathogens, suggesting that thioester domains are more widely used and provide a mechanism of adhesion by covalent bonding to target molecules on host cells that mimics that used by the human complement system to eliminate pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2061050099,"Setting The dual epidemics of HIV-TB including MDR-TB are major contributors to high morbidity and mortality rates in South Africa. Rifampicin (RIF) resistance is regarded as a proxy for MDR-TB. Currently available molecular assays have the advantage of rapidly detecting resistant strains of MTB, but the GeneXpert does not detect isoniazid (INH) resistance and the GenoTypeMTBDRplus(LPA) assay may underestimate resistance to INH. Increasing proportions of rifampicin mono-resistance resistance (RMR) have recently been reported from South Africa and other countries. Objective This laboratory based study was conducted at NHLS TB Laboratory, Durban, which is the reference laboratory for culture and susceptibility testing in KwaZulu-Natal. We retrospectively determined, for the period 2007 to 2009, the proportion of RMR amongst Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates, that were tested for both RIF and INH, using the gold standard of culture based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). Gender and age were also analysed to identify possible risk factors for RMR. Design MTB culture positive sputum samples from 16,748 patients were analysed for susceptibility to RIF and INH during the period 2007 to 2009. RMR was defined as MTB resistant to RIF and susceptible to INH. For the purposes of this study, only the first specimen from each patient was included in the analysis. Results RMR was observed throughout the study period. The proportion of RMR varied from a low of 7.3% to a high of 10.0% [overall 8.8%]. Overall, males had a 42% increased odds of being RMR as compared to females. In comparison to the 50 plus age group, RMR was 37% more likely to occur in the 25–29 year age category. Conclusion We report higher proportions of RMR ranging from 7.3% to 10% [overall 8.8%] than previously reported in the literature. To avoid misclassification of RMR, detected by the GeneXpert, as MDR-TB, culture based phenotypic DST must be performed on a second specimen, as recommended by the SA NDOH TB guidelines as well as WHO. We suggest that two sputum samples should be obtained at the first visit. The second sputum sample should be stored at 4°C. The latter sample is then readily available for performing additional DST (phenotypic or genotypic) for 2nd lines drugs, resulting in a decreased waiting period for DST results to become available."
https://openalex.org/W2001236607,"To explore the extent to which patients have a directing role in decisions about chemotherapy in the palliative phase of cancer and (want to) anticipate on the last stage of life.Qualitative interview study.In depth-interviews with 15 patients with advanced colorectal or breast cancer at the medical oncology department in a Dutch teaching hospital; interviews were analysed following the principles of thematic content-analysis.All patients reported to know that the chemotherapy they received was with palliative intent. Most of them did not express the wish for information about (other) treatment options and put great trust in their physicians' treatment advice. The more patients were aware of the severity of their disease, the more they seemed to 'live their life' in the present and enjoy things besides having cancer. Such living in the present seemed to be facilitated by the use of chemotherapy. Patients often considered the 'chemotherapy-free period' more stressful than periods when receiving chemotherapy despite their generally improved physical condition. Chemotherapy (regardless of side-effects) seemed to shift patients' attention away from the approaching last stage of life. Interestingly, although patients often discussed advance care planning, they were reluctant to bring on end-of-life issues that bothered them at that specific moment. Expressing real interest in people 'as a person' was considered an important element of appropriate care.Fearing their approaching death, patients deliberately focus on living in the present. Active (chemotherapy) treatment facilitates this focus, regardless of the perceived side-effects. However, if anxiety for what lies ahead is the underlying reason for treatment, efforts should be made in assisting patients to find other ways to cope with this fear. Simultaneously, such an approach may reduce the use of burdensome and sometimes costly treatment in the last stage of life."

We clarified the predictive factors in glucose metabolism for progression of hepatic fibrosis in patients with NAFLD by the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (75gOGTT) and a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). One hundred sixty-nine patients (68 female and 101 male patients) with biopsy-proven NAFLD with performance with 75gOGTT were enrolled and divided into four groups according to the stage of hepatic fibrosis (F0-3). The proportion of patients with T2DM significantly gradually increased, HbA1c and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were significantly elevated, and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) was remarkably decreased with the progression of fibrosis. In the 75gOGTT, both plasma glucose and insulin secretion were remarkably increased with the progression of fibrosis. The only factor significantly associated with advanced fibrosis was 1,5-AG (P = 0.008) as determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. We next evaluated the changes in blood glucose during 24 hours by monitoring with the CGMS to confirm the relationship between glycemic variability and progression of fibrosis. Variability of median glucose, standard deviation of median glucose (P = 0.0022), maximum blood glucose (P = 0.0019), and ΔMin-max blood glucose (P = 0.0029) were remarkably higher in severe fibrosis than in mild fibrosis.Hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, especially glycemic variability, are important predictive factors in glucose impairment for the progression of hepatic fibrosis in NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2049251698,"Children who are exposed to environmental respiratory insults often develop asthma that persists into adulthood. In this study, we used a neonatal mouse model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation to understand the long-term effects of early childhood insults on airway structure and function. We showed that OVA sensitization and challenge in early life led to a 2-fold increase in airway smooth muscle (ASM) innervation (P<0.05) and persistent airway hyperreactivity (AHR). In contrast, OVA exposure in adult life elicited short-term AHR without affecting innervation levels. We found that postnatal ASM innervation required neurotrophin (NT)-4 signaling through the TrkB receptor and that early-life OVA exposure significantly elevated NT4 levels and TrkB signaling by 5- and 2-fold, respectively, to increase innervation. Notably, blockade of NT4/TrkB signaling in OVA-exposed pups prevented both acute and persistent AHR without affecting baseline airway function or inflammation. Furthermore, biophysical assays using lung slices and isolated cells demonstrated that NT4 was necessary for hyperreactivity of ASM induced by early-life OVA exposure. Together, our findings show that the NT4/TrkB-dependent increase in innervation plays a critical role in the alteration of the ASM phenotype during postnatal growth, thereby linking early-life allergen exposure to persistent airway dysfunction."

Here we investigated the ability of participants with BPD to make social inferences from faces. Method 20 participants with BPD and 21 healthy controls were shown a series of faces and asked to judge these according to one of six characteristics (age, distinctiveness, attractiveness, intelligence, approachability, trustworthiness). The number and direction of errors made (compared to population norms) were recorded for analysis. Results Participants with a diagnosis of BPD displayed significant impairments in making judgements from faces. In particular, the BPD Group judged faces as less approachable and less trustworthy than controls. Furthermore, within the BPD Group there was a correlation between scores on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and bias towards judging faces as unapproachable. Conclusion Individuals with a diagnosis of BPD have difficulty making appropriate social judgements about others from their faces. Judging more faces as unapproachable and untrustworthy indicates that this group may have a heightened sensitivity to perceiving potential threat, and this should be considered in clinical management and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2114276022,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is believed to arise from leukemic stem-like cells (LSC) making understanding the biological differences between LSC and normal stem cells (HSC) or common myeloid progenitors (CMP) crucial to understanding AML biology. To determine if protein expression patterns were different in LSC compared to other AML and CD34+ populations, we measured the expression of 121 proteins by Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA) in 5 purified fractions from AML marrow and blood samples: Bulk (CD3/CD19 depleted), CD34-, CD34+(CMP), CD34+CD38+ and CD34+CD38-(LSC). LSC protein expression differed markedly from Bulk (n =31 cases, 93/121 proteins) and CD34+ cells (n = 30 cases, 88/121 proteins) with 54 proteins being significantly different (31 higher, 23 lower) in LSC than in either Bulk or CD34+ cells. Sixty-seven proteins differed significantly between CD34+ and Bulk blasts (n = 69 cases). Protein expression patterns in LSC and CD34+ differed markedly from normal CD34+ cells. LSC were distinct from CD34+ and Bulk cells by principal component and by protein signaling network analysis which confirmed individual protein analysis. Potential targetable submodules in LSC included the proteins PU.1(SP1), P27, Mcl1, HIF1α, cMET, P53, Yap, and phospho-Stats 1, 5 and 6. Protein expression and activation in LSC differs markedly from other blast populations suggesting that studies of AML biology should be performed in LSC."
https://openalex.org/W1983264618,"Brief but severe asphyxia in late gestation or at the time of birth may lead to neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and is associated with long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. We undertook this study to examine the consequences of transient in utero asphyxia in late gestation fetal sheep, on the newborn lamb after birth. Surgery was undertaken at 125 days gestation for implantation of fetal catheters and placement of a silastic cuff around the umbilical cord. At 132 days gestation (0.89 term), the cuff was inflated to induce umbilical cord occlusion (UCO), or sham (control). Fetal arterial blood samples were collected for assessment of fetal wellbeing and the pregnancy continued until birth. At birth, behavioral milestones for newborn lambs were recorded over 24 h, after which the lambs were euthanased for brain collection and histopathology assessments. After birth, UCO lambs displayed significant latencies to (i) use all four legs, (ii) attain a standing position, (iii) find the udder, and (iv) successfully suckle--compared to control lambs. Brains of UCO lambs showed widespread pathologies including cell death, white matter disruption, intra-parenchymal hemorrhage and inflammation, which were not observed in full term control brains. UCO resulted in some preterm births, but comparison with age-matched preterm non-UCO control lambs showed that prematurity per se was not responsible for the behavioral delays and brain structural abnormalities resulting from the in utero asphyxia. These results demonstrate that a single, brief fetal asphyxic episode in late gestation results in significant grey and white matter disruption in the developing brain, and causes significant behavioral delay in newborn lambs. These data are consistent with clinical observations that antenatal asphyxia is causal in the development of neonatal encephalopathy and provide an experimental model to advance our understanding of neuroprotective therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2051245225,"Parasitic helminths present one of the most pervasive challenges to grazing herbivores. Many macro-parasite transmission models focus on host physiological defence strategies, omitting more complex interactions between hosts and their environments. This work represents the first model that integrates both the behavioural and physiological elements of gastro-intestinal nematode transmission dynamics in a managed grazing system. A spatially explicit, individual-based, stochastic model is developed, that incorporates both the hosts' immunological responses to parasitism, and key grazing behaviours including faecal avoidance. The results demonstrate that grazing behaviour affects both the timing and intensity of parasite outbreaks, through generating spatial heterogeneity in parasite risk and nutritional resources, and changing the timing of exposure to the parasites' free-living stages. The influence of grazing behaviour varies with the host-parasite combination, dependent on the development times of different parasite species and variations in host immune response. Our outputs include the counterintuitive finding that under certain conditions perceived parasite avoidance behaviours (faecal avoidance) can increase parasite risk, for certain host-parasite combinations. Through incorporating the two-way interaction between infection dynamics and grazing behaviour, the potential benefits of parasite-induced anorexia are also demonstrated. Hosts with phenotypic plasticity in grazing behaviour, that make grazing decisions dependent on current parasite burden, can reduce infection with minimal loss of intake over the grazing season. This paper explores how both host behaviours and immunity influence macro-parasite transmission in a spatially and temporally heterogeneous environment. The magnitude and timing of parasite outbreaks is influenced by host immunity and behaviour, and the interactions between them; the incorporation of both regulatory processes is required to fully understand transmission dynamics. Understanding of both physiological and behavioural defence strategies will aid the development of novel approaches for control."

Mice deficient in KL are normal throughout development, but rapidly degenerate and display a variety of aging-associated abnormalities that eventually lead to decreased life expectancy. While multiple genetic association studies have identified KL polymorphisms linked with changes in disease risk, there is a paucity of concrete mechanistic data to explain how these amino acid substitutions alter KL protein function. The KLVS polymorphism is suggested to lead to changes in protein trafficking although the mechanism is unclear. Our studies have sought to further investigate the functional differences in the KLVS variant that result in increased risk of many age-related diseases. Our findings suggest that the F352V and C370S substitutions lead to alterations in processing as seen by differences in shedding and half-life. Their co-expression in KLVS results in a phenotype resembling wild-type, but despite this intragenic complementation there are still changes in homodimerization and interactions with FGFR1c. Taken together, these studies suggest that KLVS leads to altered homodimerization that indirectly leads to changes in processing and FGFR1c interactions.

Contrary to the other effects, heterozygosity for KLVS increases the risk of BRCA1 associated breast and ovarian cancer and decreases the risk in homozygous patients from an Ashkenazi Jewish population, but not in a larger cohort of European ancestry (28Wolf I.

Despite many genetic association studies on the KLVS allele, there is limited information on the molecular mechanism behind the KLVS association with altered longevity and risk of disease. Given the increased risk of disease development and complex association with longevity, a thorough understanding of the mechanistic difference associated with KLVS is important in understanding the role of KL in humans. To understand how changes in KL could affect human longevity and disease risk, we generated plasmid constructs of transmembrane KL with individual (V for F352V, and S for C370S) substitutions and one containing the double substitution (VS, F352V/C370S) as observed in humans to examine how KL dimerization, half-life, shedding, and FGF co-receptor function are altered by the presence of the KLVS polymorphism. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Full-length KL, KL tagged at its C terminus with GFP or V5 in pcDNA3.1 plasmids were constructed as previously described (7Chen C.D. Podvin S. Gillespie E. Leeman S.E. Abraham C.R. Insulin stimulates the cleavage and release of the extracellular domain of Klotho by ADAM10 and ADAM17.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19796-19801Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). To construct polymorphic variants containing F352V, C370S, or both, site-directed mutagenesis was performed per the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA) using the following sense and antisense primers (Integrated DNA Technologies): KL C370S: 5′-AGGTGGGTCCAAAGCTAAGAGCAAAAAAGTC-3′ and 5′-GACTTTTTTGCTCTTAGCTTTGGACCCACCT-3′; KL F352V: 5′-TCTCAGATTCAGTAACATCAGGCAGAATAGA-3′ and 5′-TCTATTCTGCCTGATGTTACTGAATCTGAGA-3′. Mouse FGF receptor (FGFR1c) plasmid with a V5 tag was a gift from Dr. Makoto Kuro-o, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX. HEK 293 cells were maintained in DMEM (Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and 5% penicillin-streptomycin (Mediatech Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with a total of 0.5 μg of DNA per ml of medium. Total DNA was consistent across all experimental conditions with pcDNA3.1 empty vector (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) used as a control in experiments with multiple plasmid transfections. Cells were transfected using Attractene per manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valecina, CA). Cells were transfected with full-length wild type KL (KLWT) or KL containing either one or both of the mutations. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Mediatech Inc.) and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. Medium was collected, debris was removed by centrifugation, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to adjust to a final protein concentration of 10 μg/ml. Cold (4 °C) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to a final concentration of 25%. The mixture was incubated at −20 °C for 5 min and then at 4 °C overnight. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was removed. The resulting pellet was washed three times with ice-cold acetone with 5-min centrifugations. The pellet was dried at 98 °C for 5 min and then dissolved in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Half of the TCA-precipitated protein resolubilized in Laemmli buffer was loaded onto 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels. After the media collection, cells are washed twice with DPBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris pH 7.5) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Mannheim GE). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected for 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. HEK 293 cells were transfected as described above. Twenty-four hours later, cells were washed twice with DPBS and incubated with a 1 mm solution of cell permeable NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) containing 0.1% DMSO for 30 min at room temperature. Afterward, biotinylation was quenched by washing the cells twice with serum-free DMEM. Cells were returned to DMEM containing serum and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time points. At each time point, the medium was aspirated from the cells and cell lysates were collected as described above. After collection and centrifugation, the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) was used to determine the protein concentration of the samples. Then 100 μg of protein from each sample were incubated at 4 °C with neutravidin beads (Thermo Scientific, Rockford IL) overnight to pull-down all biotinylated proteins. The bound protein was then eluted from the beads by incubating in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and separated on 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Blue Native gel electrophoresis was performed to separate proteins without denaturation. The Invitrogen NativePAGE Novex 4–16% Bis-Tris Gel system was used in accordance to the manufacturer's protocol for the outlined experiments. Briefly, HEK 293 cells transfected as described above were solubilized in NativePAGE sample buffer containing 1% digitonin and complete protease inhibitor without EDTA (Roche) at 4 °C. After determining protein concentration, an equal amount of protein from each sample was prepared for separation by mixing with 5% Coomassie G-250 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) to reach a final concentration of 1% Coomassie G-250. Pre-chilled anode and cathode buffers (dark blue and light blue) were used to run the gel. The dark blue cathode buffer was used until the dye front had moved through 1/3 of the gel and then was exchanged for the light blue cathode buffer until the completion of the run. After separation, the proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon 0.4 μm PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica MA). To fix the proteins, the resulting PVDF membranes were incubated in 8% acetic acid and then the membranes were destained with methanol. Concomitantly, the same samples were run in reducing conditions on 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels to compare total expression of the transfected proteins. Afterward, both membranes were processed for Western blotting as described below. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with combinations of KLWT and KLVS containing a V5 or GFP tag or with combinations of FGFR1c-V5 and EV, KLWT-GFP or KLVS-GFP. Other HEK 293 cells were transfected with V5 or GFP-tagged KLWT or KLVS alone. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold DPBS and collected in IP lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.01 m EDTA, 0.05 m NaCl, 0.05 m NaF, pH 7.2) containing protease inhibitors. After protein concentration was measured by BCA as described above, 100 μg of protein was loaded onto pre-washed V5-conjugated Sepharose beads (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. An identical set of lysates containing equal protein were incubated with anti-GFP (Roche) for 1 h at 4 °C before adding pre-washed protein A/G beads (Pierce) and incubating overnight at 4 °C. Another set of samples for the experiments using FGFR1c-V5 were also prepared and incubated with mouse IgG (mIgG) for 1 h at 4 °C before adding p"
https://openalex.org/W1966165156,"The genetic characterization of hepatitis A virus (HAV) strains is commonly accomplished by sequencing subgenomic regions, such as the VP1/P2B junction. HAV genome is not extensively variable, thus presenting opportunity for sharing sequences of subgenomic regions among genetically unrelated isolates. The degree of misrepresentation of phylogenetic relationships by subgenomic regions is especially important for tracking transmissions. Here, we analyzed whole-genome (WG) sequences of 101 HAV strains identified from 4 major multi-state, food-borne outbreaks of hepatitis A in the Unites States and from 14 non-outbreak-related HAV strains that shared identical VP1/P2B sequences with the outbreak strains. Although HAV strains with an identical VP1/P2B sequence were specific to each outbreak, WG were different, with genetic diversity reaching 0.31% (mean 0.09%). Evaluation of different subgenomic regions did not identify any other section of the HAV genome that could accurately represent phylogenetic relationships observed using WG sequences. The identification of 2–3 dominant HAV strains in 3 out of 4 outbreaks indicates contamination of the implicated food items with a heterogeneous HAV population. However, analysis of intra-host HAV variants from eight patients involved in one outbreak showed that only a single sequence variant established infection in each patient. Four non-outbreak strains were found closely related to strains from 2 outbreaks, whereas ten were genetically different from the outbreak strains. Thus, accurate tracking of HAV strains can be accomplished using HAV WG sequences, while short subgenomic regions are useful for identification of transmissions only among cases with known epidemiological association."
https://openalex.org/W2165649360,"Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and ultra small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles have been developed as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Iron oxide nanoparticles, that become superparamagnetic if the core particle diameter is ~ 30 nm or less, present R1 and R2 relaxivities which are much higher than those of conventional paramagnetic gadolinium chelates. Generally, these magnetic particles are coated with biocompatible polymers that prevent the agglomeration of the colloidal suspension and improve their blood distribution profile. In spite of their potential as MRI blood contrast agents, the biomedical application of iron oxide nanoparticles is still limited because of their intravascular half-life of only few hours; such nanoparticles are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream by macrophages of the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). To increase the life span of these MRI contrast agents in the bloodstream we proposed the encapsulation of SPIO nanoparticles in red blood cells (RBCs) through the transient opening of cell membrane pores. We have recently reported results obtained by applying our loading procedure to several SPIO nanoparticles with different chemical physical characteristics such as size and coating agent. In the current investigation we showed that the life span of iron-based contrast agents in the mice bloodstream was prolonged to 12 days after the intravenous injection of murine SPIO-loaded RBCs. Furthermore, we developed an animal model that implicates the pretreatment of animals with clodronate to induce a transient suppression of tissue macrophages, followed by the injection of human SPIO-loaded RBCs which make it possible to encapsulate nanoparticle concentrations (5.3-16.7 mM Fe) higher than murine SPIO-loaded RBCs (1.4-3.55 mM Fe). The data showed that, when human RBCs are used as more capable SPIO nanoparticle containers combined with a depletion of tissue macrophages, Fe concentration in animal blood is 2-3 times higher than iron concentration obtained by the use of murine SPIO-loaded RBCs."
https://openalex.org/W2012815395,"Deep sequencing of transcriptomes has become an indispensable tool for biology, enabling expression levels for thousands of genes to be compared across multiple samples. Since transcript counts scale with sequencing depth, counts from different samples must be normalized to a common scale prior to comparison. We analyzed fifteen existing and novel algorithms for normalizing transcript counts, and evaluated the effectiveness of the resulting normalizations. For this purpose we defined two novel and mutually independent metrics: (1) the number of ""uniform"" genes (genes whose normalized expression levels have a sufficiently low coefficient of variation), and (2) low Spearman correlation between normalized expression profiles of gene pairs. We also define four novel algorithms, one of which explicitly maximizes the number of uniform genes, and compared the performance of all fifteen algorithms. The two most commonly used methods (scaling to a fixed total value, or equalizing the expression of certain 'housekeeping' genes) yielded particularly poor results, surpassed even by normalization based on randomly selected gene sets. Conversely, seven of the algorithms approached what appears to be optimal normalization. Three of these algorithms rely on the identification of ""ubiquitous"" genes: genes expressed in all the samples studied, but never at very high or very low levels. We demonstrate that these include a ""core"" of genes expressed in many tissues in a mutually consistent pattern, which is suitable for use as an internal normalization guide. The new methods yield robustly normalized expression values, which is a prerequisite for the identification of differentially expressed and tissue-specific genes as potential biomarkers."

The Tangier disease W590S ABCA1 mutation has defective PS floppase activity and diminished cholesterol efflux activity. Here, we report that depletion of sphingomyelin by inhibitors or sphingomyelinase caused plasma membrane remodeling, leading to defective flip (inward translocation) of PS, higher PS exposure, and higher cholesterol efflux from cells by both ABCA1-dependent and ABCA1-independent mechanisms. Mechanistically, sphingomyelin was connected to PS translocation in cell-free liposome studies that showed that sphingomyelin increased the rate of spontaneous PS flipping. Depletion of sphingomyelin in stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing the Tangier disease W590S mutant ABCA1 isoform rescued the defect in PS exposure and restored cholesterol efflux to apoAI. Liposome studies showed that PS directly increased cholesterol accessibility to extraction by cyclodextrin, providing the mechanistic link between cell surface PS and cholesterol efflux.

ABCA1 is a multiple transmembrane domain protein that assembles lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoAI) with cellular lipids to generate nascent high density lipoprotein (HDL) that is released from the cell surface, and thus mediates the cellular efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids. ABCA1 has three distinct activities: PS floppase, apoAI binding, and partial unfolding of the apoAI N-terminal helix bundle, all of which are required for the efficient lipidation of apoAI and generation of nascent HDL (7Davidson W.S.

Maintenance of proper levels of HDL is important, as many studies have shown that low levels of HDL are associated with higher incidences of cardiovascular disease. Elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in plasma lead to deposition of cholesterol-laden lipoproteins within the arterial wall, leading to the formation of macrophage foam cells, a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Macrophages accumulate large amounts of cholesterol due to their inability to down-regulate modified LDL uptake (16Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. ATP-Binding cassette cholesterol transporters and cardiovascular disease.Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar).

In the present study, we report that reduction of cellular sphingomyelin (SM) levels by either decreased synthesis or increased catabolism led to increased cholesterol efflux by ABCA1-independent and -dependent pathways. We found that the inward translocation (flip) of phospholipids was diminished upon SM reduction leading to enhanced exposure of PS on the outer leaflet. We found that SM depletion by myriocin or sphingomyelinase (SMase) treatment could compensate for the defective PS floppase activity of the mutant W590S-ABCA1 isoform, restoring its cholesterol efflux activity to apoAI. Overall, our data indicates that SM depletion led to a redistribution of anionic phospholipids across the plasma membrane, decreased lipid rafts, increased cholesterol availability to cyclodextrin by a non-ABCA1 mediated pathway, and enhanced ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoAI. All cell culture incubations were performed at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated, in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were grown in DMEM with added antibiotics and 10% FBS. Drugs were added to growth media at the indicated concentrations and an equivalent amount of vehicle was added as control. Myriocin, sphingomyelin (catalog number S0756, from chicken egg yolk), methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and sphingomyelinase (from Staphylococcus aureus) were obtained from Sigma; fumonisin B1 was from Cayman Chemicals; and 18:1 NBD-PS, 18:1 NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 25-NBD-cholesterol, NBD-sphingosine, and C2-dihydroceramide were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Human apoAI was purified from human plasma as previously described (32Wu Z. Gogonea V. Lee X. May R.P. Pipich V. Wagner M.A. Undurti A. Tallant T.C. Baleanu-Gogonea C. Charlton F. Ioffe A.

On day 2, the cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol in 1% FBS in DMEM. To induce Abca1 expression in RAW264.7 cells, 0.3 mm 8-Br-cAMP (Sigma) was added on the evening of day 2. On day 3, the cells were washed and chased for 4 to 6 h in serum-free DMEM in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml of apoAI. The radioactivity in the chase media was determined after a brief centrifugation to pellet any residual debris. Radioactivity in the cells was determined by extraction in hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2) with the solvent evaporated in a scintillation vial prior to counting. The percent of cholesterol efflux was calculated as 100 × (medium dpm)/(medium dpm + cell dpm). DMPC dissolved in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) plus 0.2 mol % DPH was dried in a stream of nitrogen onto the sides of a glass culture tube and kept in vacuum overnight. The DMPC film was rehydrated at 5 mg/ml in PBS by extensive vortexing and alternating freeze/thaw in a dry ice/ethanol and 37 °C water bath. The resulting DMPC-DPH multilamellar vesicles (MLV) were warmed to 37 °C and extruded 11 times through a polycarbonate membrane using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) to derive large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of 100 nm diameter. DMPC:DPH (100:0.2 mol ratio) or DMPC:SM:DPH (75:25:0.2) LUVs were subjected to anisotropy measurements using a fluorimeter (PerkinElmer LS-50B) with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 430 nm. Measurements were performed over a temperature range (10–40 °C) in a water jacketed cuvette holder with a circulating chilling/heating water bath. The assay was adapted from an earlier study (33John K. Schreiber S. Kubelt J. Herrmann A. Müller P. Transbilayer movement of phospholipids at the main phase transition of lipid membranes. Implications for rapid flip-flop in biological membranes.Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) describing rapid flip-flop of phospholipids in biological membranes. DMPC or DMPC:SM (75:25) LUVs were prepared as described above. Liposomes (120 μg of lipid/ml) were incubated with 25 μm NBD-PS for 5 min at 4 °C. To start the reaction, the labeled liposomes in 200-μl aliquots were transferred to a 96-well plate and incubated at 23 °C, the phase transition temperature of DMPC. At various time points NBD-PS fluorescence was measured after addition of either 20 μl of freshly prepared 1 m sodium dithionite (quench resistant signal) or 20 μl of 100 mm Tris, pH 10.0 (total signal). The fluorescent signal from samples was recorded using a fluorescent plate reader with excitation and emission wavelengths 470 and 530 nm, respectively. The quench-resistant signal resides on the inner leaflet of the LUV, and the percent of NBD-PS translocated was calculated as 100 × (quench resistant signal)/(total signal), and plotted against time to determine the rate of NBD-PS translocation. To assess NBD-lipid trafficking, RAW264.7 cells were grown in 24-well plates for 24 h in growth media with 10 μm myriocin or DMSO vehicle. The cells were washed gently with PBS and incubated with fresh phenol red-free DMEM containing 25 μm NBD-labeled phospholipids at 37 °C for the indicated time period. The cells were washed and media was replaced with PBS followed immediately by epifluorescent microscopy. To assess lipid rafts, RAW cells grown in the presence of 10 μm myriocin (16 h pretreatment) or treated with SMase (treatment for 1 h with 3 units of SMase/ml media) were incubated with 1 μg/ml of cholera toxin B (CTB):Alexa 647 for 5 min at 37 °C prior to PBS washing and fluorescent microscopy at room temperature. All images were captured using an Olympus IX51 inverted epifluorescent microscope, Olympus LUCPlanFl ×40/0.6 lens, with a Q-Image EXi aqua camera and Olympus cellSens Dimension version 1.7 software. Post-imaging processing was performed in Adobe Photoshop CS2. To measure cell surface PS, cells were cultured in 6-well plates in growth media, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of Annexin V binding buffer plus 1 μl of Annexin V-Cy5 (Biovision). The samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in the dark. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a BD Biosciences LSRFortessa cytometer using a 639-nm excitation laser and emission at 650–670 nm; and, data were analyzed using FlowJo software. To measure the inward translocation of various NBD-labeled phospholipids, RAW cells were incubated with phenol red-free DMEM containing 25 μm NBD-PS or NBD-PE for 5–15 min at 37 °C or RT. For neutral lipids, 2.5 μm NBD cholesterol and 50 μm NBD sphingosine was used. The media was then replaced with PBS. The cells were gently scraped and subjected to flow cytometry analysis first without sodium dithionite to calculate total NBD fluorescence, and then 5 min after the addition of 30 μl of a freshly prepared 1 m sodium dithionite solution to determine the fraction of the signal resistant to quenching (translocated signal). Flow cytometry analysis was performed as above using a 488-nm laser for excitation and emission at 505–525 nm. To measure cell surface lipid rafts, CTB binding was assessed. RAW cells were treated with DMSO vehicle, 10 μm myriocin (16 h pretreatment), or 3 units of SMase/ml of media (1 h pretreatment) at 37 °C. These cells were then washed twice with PBS and gently scraped in 1.5 ml of PBS. Alexa 647:CTB was added at final concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated for 1 min prior to flow cytometry as described above using a 639-nm excitation laser and emission at 650–670 nm. The levels of SM were determined by using the enzymatic assay described earlier (34Hojjati M.R. Jiang X.C.

Alkaline phosphatase was used to convert phosphorylcholine to choline, which was then oxidized by choline oxidase and further acted upon peroxidase in the presence of DAOS (N-ethyl-N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl)-3,5-dimethoxyaniline, sodium salt), H2O2, and 4-aminoantipyrine to generate a blue colored dye. The SM standard solution was prepared by dissolving 5 mg of SM in 10 ml of 2% Triton X-100 in ethanol. Cells grown in 24-well plates were treated with 10 μm myriocin for 6 h or 3 units of SMase for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of Reagent 1 (2 units of SMase, 4.86 units of alkaline phosphatase, 2 mm DAOS, and 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.66 mm calcium chloride, pH 8). The cell suspension was then gently mixed by pipetting up and down several times and was transferred to a 96-well plate for a 20-min incubation at 37 °C. 100 μl of Reagent 2 (0.07 units choline oxidase, 3 units peroxidase, 0.72 mm 4-aminoantipyrine, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 1 mm calcium chloride, pH 8) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Absorption was measured at 620 nm using a plate spectrophotometer. The amount of SM was calculated by comparing it to a standard curve of SM and plotted per mg of cell protein determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). MLVs containing DMPC or DMPC:SM (3:1 mol ratio) were prepared as described above. 20 μg of these MLVs in Tris-buffered saline:EDTA, pH 7.5, were incubated with 1 μg of human apoAI at 25 °C in a final volume of 200 μl. MLV solubilization by human apoAI was monitored by measuring sample turbidity (absorbance) at 325 nm using a plate spectrophotometer. RAW267.4 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and treated with or without 300 μm 8-Br-cAMP to induce Abca1 for 16 h. Cells were incubated with apoAI (5 μg/ml) in the presence of either vehicle or 10 μm myriocin (4 h) or 3 units/ml of SMase (4 h, plus 1 h pretreatment). The cells were then incubated for 30 min on ice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mg/ml of sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce). The PBS-washed cell pellet was lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris phosphate, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% protease inhibitor). Cell surface ABCA1 was determined by purifying biotinylated proteins by overnight incubation of 250 μg of cell protein with 75 μl of UltraLink Plus Immobilized Streptavidin gel (Pierce) at 4 °C on a platform shaker in a final volume of 200 μl in PBS. The beads were spun down, washed, and resuspended by boiling in 100 μl of 1× NuPAGE LDS Sample buffer (Invitrogen). 45 μl of the bound protein samples along with 20 μg of total protein were run on NuPAGE 3–8% Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Invitrogen). Blots were incubated sequentially with 1:500 mouse monoclonal antibody raised against ABCA1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number AC10) and 1:15,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). The signal was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). RAW267.4 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and allowed to grow further in the presence of glucose or 2 mm deoxy-d-glucose for 4 h. Cell lysates were prepared using a buffer containing Nonidet P-40 and the postnuclear supernatant was assayed immediately using an ATP determination kit (Invitrogen, catalogue number A22066), per the manufacturer's protocol. Cellular ATP was calculated from an ATP standard curve and the levels of ATP were normalized by the supernatant protein content. We assessed the effects of myriocin, a potent inhibitor of the first step in sphingolipid synthesis on cholesterol efflux to apoAI, a process that is mediated by ABCA1, in stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing equivalent levels of wild type (WT) murine and two mutant ABCA1 isoforms (15Wang S.

https://openalex.org/W2106415707,"Background In order to assess the importance of environmental and genetic risk on transition from health to psychotic disorder, a prospective study of individuals at average (n = 462) and high genetic risk (n = 810) was conducted. Method A three-year cohort study examined the rate of transition to psychotic disorder. Binary measures indexing environmental exposure (combining urban birth, cannabis use, ethnicity and childhood trauma) and proxy genetic risk (high-risk sibling status) were used to model transition. Results The majority of high-risk siblings (68%) and healthy comparison subjects (60%) had been exposed to one or more environmental risks. The risk of transition in siblings (n = 9, 1.1%) was higher than the risk in healthy comparison subjects (n = 2, 0.4%; ORadj = 2.2,95%CI:5–10.3). All transitions (100%) were associated with environmental exposure, compared to 65% of non-transitions (p = 0.014), with the greatest effects for childhood trauma (ORadj = 34.4,95%CI:4.4–267.4), cannabis use (OR = 4.1,95%CI:1.1, 15.4), minority ethnic group (OR = 3.8,95%CI:1.2,12.8) and urban birth (OR = 3.7,95%CI:0.9,15.4). The proportion of transitions in the population attributable to environmental and genetic risk ranged from 28% for minority ethnic group, 45% for urban birth, 57% for cannabis use, 86% for childhood trauma, and 50% for high-risk sibling status. Nine out of 11 transitions (82%) were exposed to both genetic and environmental risk, compared to only 43% of non-transitions (p = 0.03). Conclusion Environmental risk associated with transition to psychotic disorder is semi-ubiquitous regardless of genetic high risk status. Careful prospective documentation suggests most transitions can be attributed to powerful environmental effects that become detectable when analysed against elevated background genetic risk, indicating gene-environment interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1964794704,"Although the roles of acids in bone metabolism are well characterized, the function of proton-sensing receptors in bone metabolism remains to be explored. In this study, we evaluated the role of proton-sensing receptor T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8) in osteoclastic activity during bone loss after ovariectomy. Through observations of bone mineral content, we found that pathological bone resorption was significantly exacerbated in mice homozygous for a gene trap mutation in the Tdag8 gene. Furthermore, osteoclasts from the homozygous mutant mice resorbed calcium in vitro more than the osteoclasts from the heterozygous mice did. Impaired osteoclast formation under acidic conditions was ameliorated in cultures of bone marrow cells by Tdag8 gene mutation. Extracellular acidification changed the cell morphology of osteoclasts via the TDAG8-Rho signaling pathway. These results suggest that the enhancement of TDAG8 function represents a new strategy for preventing bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W1966010352,"Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs, chain length >C20) exist in tissues throughout the body and are synthesized by repetition of the fatty acid (FA) elongation cycle composed of four successive enzymatic reactions. In mammals, the TER gene is the only gene encoding trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, which catalyzes the fourth reaction in the FA elongation cycle. The TER P182L mutation is the pathogenic mutation for nonsyndromic mental retardation. This mutation substitutes a leucine for a proline residue at amino acid 182 in the TER enzyme. Currently, the mechanism by which the TER P182L mutation causes nonsyndromic mental retardation is unknown. To understand the effect of this mutation on the TER enzyme and VLCFA synthesis, we have biochemically characterized the TER P182L mutant enzyme using yeast and mammalian cells transfected with the TER P182L mutant gene and analyzed the FA elongation cycle in the B-lymphoblastoid cell line with the homozygous TER P182L mutation (TER(P182L/P182L) B-lymphoblastoid cell line). We have found that TER P182L mutant enzyme exhibits reduced trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase activity and protein stability, thereby impairing VLCFA synthesis and, in turn, altering the sphingolipid profile (i.e. decreased level of C24 sphingomyelin and C24 ceramide) in the TER(P182L/P182L) B-lymphoblastoid cell line. We have also found that in addition to the TER enzyme-catalyzed fourth reaction, the third reaction in the FA elongation cycle is affected by the TER P182L mutation. These findings provide new insight into the biochemical defects associated with this genetic mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2015376870,"p38-interacting protein (p38IP) is a component of the GCN5 histone acetyltransferase-containing coactivator complex (GCN5-SAGA complex). It remains unclear whether p38IP or GCN5-SAGA is involved in cell cycle regulation. Using RNA interference to knock down p38IP, we observed that cells were arrested at the G2/M phase, exhibiting accumulation of cyclins, shrunken spindles, and hypoacetylation of α-tubulin. Further analysis revealed that knockdown of p38IP led to proteasome-dependent degradation of GCN5. GCN5 associated with and acetylated α-tubulin, and recovering GCN5 protein levels in p38IP knockdown cells by ectopic expression of GCN5 efficiently reversed α-tubulin hypoacetylation and G2/M arrest. During the G2/M transition, the association of α-tubulin with GCN5 increased, and the acetylation of α-tubulin reached a peak. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that the interaction between p38IP and GCN5 depended on the p38IP N terminus (1–381 amino acids) and GCN5 histone acetyltransferase domain and bromodomain. The p38IP N terminus could effectively reverse p38IP depletion-induced GCN5 degradation, thus recovering α-tubulin acetylation and G2/M progression. p38IP-mediated suppression of GCN5 ubiquitination most likely occurs via nuclear sequestration of GCN5. Our data indicate that the GCN5-SAGA complex is required for G2/M progression, mainly because p38IP promotes the acetylation of α-tubulin by preventing the degradation of GCN5, in turn facilitating the formation of the mitotic spindle. p38-interacting protein (p38IP) is a component of the GCN5 histone acetyltransferase-containing coactivator complex (GCN5-SAGA complex).

In mammalian cells, there are two evolutionarily diverged GCN5 acetylase complexes: SAGA and ATAC (Ada2a or Ada Two-A-containing); both have their own specific subunits while they share a common GCN5 catalytic subunit (14Spedale G. Timmers H.T. Pijnappel W.W. ATAC-king the complexity of SAGA during evolution.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These complexes have essential but distinct functions in transcription, histone modification, signaling pathways, and cell cycle regulation (14Spedale G. Timmers H.T. Pijnappel W.W. ATAC-king the complexity of SAGA during evolution.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). p38IP (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting protein) was first identified in a search for p38 binding partners using the yeast two-hybrid system (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) accession number AF093250). p38IP is required for the down-regulation of E-cadherin during mouse gastrulation via its activation of p38 (15Zohn I.E.

Using mass spectrometry, p38IP was identified as a novel specific subunit of the human GCN5-SAGA and is highly similar to yeast Spt20 (ySpt20), which is a subunit of yeast SAGA (ySAGA) (16Nagy Z.

Recently, p38IP has been discovered to participate in starvation-induced autophagy via its regulation of mammalian Atg9 trafficking (19Webber J.L. Tooze S.A. Coordinated regulation of autophagy by p38α MAPK through mAtg9 and p38IP.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These results suggest that p38IP is a multifunctional protein. However, so far, studies on p38IP are very limited, and it is unclear whether p38IP is involved in cell cycle regulation. Recently, upon the ablation of its specific subunit Ada2a, the ATAC-GCN5 complex has been proven to be essential for cell cycle mitotic progression; by contrast, disruption of SAGA complex by knockdown of p38IP, a specific subunit of the GCN5-SAGA complex, did not lead to a cell cycle defect (20Orpinell M. Fournier M. Riss A. Nagy Z. Krebs A.R. Frontini M. Tora L. The ATAC acetyl transferase complex controls mitotic progression by targeting non-histone substrates.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2381-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This study suggests that the ATAC complex endows GCN5 with its role in the G2/M transition, but ruled out the possibility of regulatory functions of p38IP as well as SAGA complex in the cell cycle progression (14Spedale G. Timmers H.T. Pijnappel W.W. ATAC-king the complexity of SAGA during evolution.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Orpinell M. Fournier M. Riss A. Nagy Z.

In other words, p38IP may obstruct GCN5 regulation of the cell cycle progression. In this study, we demonstrated that p38IP plays an essential role in G2/M progression. In the absence of p38IP, cells showed a retardation of the G2/M phase progression, abnormal spindle formation, and a hypoacetylation of α-tubulin. We discovered that p38IP maintained GCN5 stability by suppressing ubiquitination-induced degradation of GCN5. GCN5 associated with α-tubulin independent of p38IP. During G2/M progression, the association of GCN5 with α-tubulin increased, thus promoting acetylation of α-tubulin and facilitating G2/M progression. The N terminus (1–381 amino acids) of p38IP was identified as the key domain for interacting with and inhibiting the ubiquitination of GCN5, and correspondingly the p38IP N terminus could promote the nuclear translocation of cytosolic GCN5 HAT&BD truncated construct, whereas knockdown of p38IP increased the ratio of cytosolic to nuclear localization of GCN5, suggesting that p38IP may stabilize GCN5 via nuclear sequestration of GCN5. Our results demonstrate the essential roles and underlying mechanism of p38IP and the GCN5-SAGA complex in cell cycle regulation. p38IP was amplified from HeLa cDNA and introduced into the pYFP-C1 and pCMV5-HA vectors using the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. p38IP-N (1–381 amino acids) and p38IP-C (380–733 amino acids) were cloned into pEYFP-C1 using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. GCN5 was amplified by PCR from the cDNA of HeLa cells and cloned into the EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites of pFlag-CMV2 (Sigma). GCN5ΔBD, GCN5ΔHAT&BD, and GCN5HAT&BD were also cloned into pFlag-CMV2 using the same sites. The scrambled control short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (5′-CGCTAATTCGACTCGGATA-3′) and the p38IP mRNA-specific (shp38IP) (NM_001014286) shRNAs (shp38IP-1, target sequences, 5′-GCTTGTTATGCAAGAGACT-3′, ORF, and shp38IP-2, target sequences, 5′-ACACAAGAGCACTGAATCA-3′, 3′-UTR) were inserted into the RNA interference expression vector pSUPER.Retro.Neo-GFP (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) for RNAi expression in cells. siRNA duplexes targeting human p38IP (sip38IP-1, 5′-CAAACAGACUGCUCUAUAAdTdT-3′, ORF), (sip38IP-2, 5′-GCUUGUUAUGCAAGAGACUdTdT-3′, ORF), and GCN5 (siGCN5, 5′-GGAAAUGCAUCCUGCAGAUdTdT-3′) were obtained from RiboBio Co. Ltd (Guangzhou, China). Thymidine and nocodazole were purchased from Sigma. Cycloheximide and MG132 were from Calbiochem. α-Tubulin (T5168) and FLAG (M2) were from Sigma; anti-acetyl-α-tubulin (ab24610) was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); HA (12CA5) was from Roche Applied Science; GCN5 (C26A10) (3305) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); and actin (5A7) was from Abmart (Shanghai, China).

Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 594-, and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). As GFP (B-2) is also reactive against YFP, it was used for detection of YFP. HeLa, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. shp38IP HeLa cells, which were transfected with short hairpin RNA against p38IP and sorted for GFP fluorescence after 24 h, were cultured in the above conditions with the addition of 0.5 mg/ml G418 and were maintained for a few generations. Transient transfection of HeLa and 293T cells was carried out using TurboFect transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. For synchronization at G1/S, HeLa cells were incubated with 2 mm thymidine for 18 h, released into thymidine-free medium for 9 h, then recultured in the presence of 2 mm thymidine for another 17 h. S, G2, and M phase cells were harvested sequentially at 4, 8, and 10 h after release from thymidine block. MCF-7 cells were incubated for 24 h in culture with 2 mm thymidine for G1/S synchronization. For G2/M arrest, cells were treated with nocodazole (100 ng/ml) for 16 h. Equal numbers of control and p38IP-deficient cells were seeded and harvested at the indicated time points. Cell number was calculated by using a Z1 single threshold particle counter (Beckman Coulter). For flow cytometric analysis, cells were trypsinized, fixed overnight in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and then washed with PBS, incubated in RNase (100 μg/ml) for 10 min, stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature, and analyzed with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software. ModFit and FlowJo software were used for data analysis. Total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed into cDNAs followed by real-time PCR (quantitative PCR) using SYBR Green (Roche Applied Science). Relative quantitative RNA was normalized with the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Primer sequences used for the reactions were as follows: GCN5 (sense, 5′-CTGAAGACCATGACTGAGCGG-3′, antisense, 5′-TCGGCCACAAAGAGCTTCC-3′), GAPDH (sense, 5′-ACGGATTTGGTCGTATTGGG-3′, antisense, 5′-TGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCGC-3′). Monolayer cells were harvested with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 mm NaPPi, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 1 mm PMSF, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin each). For ubiquitin samples, 0.1% SDS was added. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g to remove cell debris, the supernatant was denatured in 1×SDS loading buffer, boiled, and run on denaturing gels. Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes at 400 mA. After blocking in 4% BSA for 1 h, membranes were incubated in primary antibodies with 2% BSA overnight at 4 °C followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. For immunoprecipitations, after overnight incubation with the indicated antibodies, proteins were immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for an additional 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated beads were washed with lysis buffer at least three times, denatured by boiling in 2× SDS loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Cells were plated at 50∼70% densities on glass slides. At the indicated time points, cells were collected, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. After blocking with 2% BSA for 1 h, cells were incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and then incubated in Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 594-, or Alexa Fluor 647-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, mounted in mounting medium, and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg GmbH, Leica SP5 microscope confocal). Laser excitations at 405, 488, 550, and 633 nm were used in the research. Spindle length was taken as the distance between two mitotic centrosomes; the spindle width was defined as the largest distance over which kinetochores spread out (21den Elzen N. Buttery C.V.

For calculation of z distance between mitotic centrosomes, one centrosome was marked as Z1 followed by scanning along the z axis of the microscope at 0.2-μm increments until reaching the other centrosome (Z2), and thus the z distance is the vertical distance between two mitotic centrosomes, which were labeled by γ-tubul in (22Samora C.P.

Specifically, the total immunofluorescence intensity of GCN5 in the whole cell (WI) or in the nucleus (NI), as well as in areas of the cell (WA) or the nucleus (NA), were quantified separately, and then the cytosol area-average fluorescence intensity (C) was obtained by the formula (WI − NI)/(WA − NA), whereas the nucleus area-average fluorescence intensity (N) was obtained by the formula NI/NA. Finally the ratio C/N was obtained to present the area-average fluorescence intensity ratio of cytosolic GCN5 to nuclear GCN5. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and resuspended in five packed-cell volumes of cytosolic extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.54% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin each). After centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min, pelleted nuclei were washed in cytosolic extraction buffer and then lysed with nuclear extraction buffer (250 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin each) for 10 min at 4 °C. After freezing and thawing three times, nuclear extracts were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. All experiments presented were repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test (GraphPad Prism V5.0; GraphPad Software). ySpt20, the homologue of p38IP in yeast, regulates yeast cell proliferation by stabilizing the integrity of the SAGA complex; however, the detailed mechanism underlying this phenomenon is still unclear. Furthermore, whether p38IP exhibits an evolutionarily conserved function in the modulation of mammalian cell proliferation has not been shown. If so, how it participates in this process remains unknown. To address these questions, we checked the cell proliferation rate after knockdown of p38IP. HeLa cells expressing p38IP-specific short hairpin RNAs showed remarkably impaired cell proliferation (Fig. 1A) (shp38IP-1 and shp38IP-2, targeting the reading frame and the 3′-UTR of p38IP, respectively; shp38IP-1 was used in the following experiments and is referred to as shp38IP). Depletion of p38IP in MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells using specific small interfering RNAs (sip38IP-1 and sip38IP-2, targeting different coding regions) also decreased cell proliferation (Fig. 1, B and C). To further understand this phenomenon, flow cytometric analysis was employed to examine cell cycle distribution. As shown in Fig. 1D, p38IP depletion resulted in a significant increase in the number of cells in G2/M phase. After synchronization at the G1/S boundary using a thymidine double block at the indicated time points after release, p38IP-depleted cells showed an obvious cell cycle arrest in G2/M and a slight retardation at the G1/S transition. It was found that HeLa control cells synchronously entered S phase at 4 h after release, whereas p38IP-deficient cells proceeded into S phase and a small percentage (∼5.8%) lagged in G1 phase. At 10 h after release, ∼46% of the control cells and only 16% of the shp38IP cells underwent cell mitosis with 2N DNA content (Fig. 1E). Similar results were also observed in MCF-7 cells expressing the p38IP-specific short hairpin RNAs (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that p38IP is critical for cell cycle G2/M progression. Because degradation of mitotic cyclins was closely correlated with cell cycle G2/M progression (24Gavet O. Pines J. Progressive activation of CyclinB1-Cdk1 coordinates entry to mitosis.Dev.

Pines J. Cyclin a is destroyed in prometaphase and can delay chromosome alignment and anaphase.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), we further examined the protein levels of mitotic cyclins in shp38IP cells and found that the protein abundance of cyclin A and cyclin B was significantly enhanced after p38IP depletion (Fig. 1G). We synchronized the cells at G1/S or G2/M using thymidine or nocodazole, respectively. After the control cells were released from the G1/S boundary, cyclin A exhibited an increase and then a subsequent decrease at 10 h and a disappearance at 12 h. By contrast, cyclin A levels were sustained at 12 h in p38IP-depleted cells (Fig. 1H). A similar pattern of cyclin B was also observed. Similarly, delayed degradation of cyclin A and B was also observed in shp38IP cells released from G2/M phase (Fig. 1I). Analysis of the protein half-lives using cycloheximide showed that cyclin A and B had prolonged half-lives in p38IP-depleted cells (Fig. 1, J and K). Thus, the cell cycle-dependent degradation of cyclins was impaired. Interestingly, knockdown of p38IP resulted in a smaller cell size at metaphase (Fig. 2, A and B). In metaphase, most of the control cells were ∼17–19 μm in diameter, whereas the majority of the p38IP-depleted cells exhibited a much smaller diameter between 14 and 16 μm (Fig. 2C). A similar phenomenon was observed in mitotic spindles. When compared with control cells, where the majority had approximate dimensions of 10–11 μm in length and no less than 7 μm in width, p38IP-deficient cells displayed a shrunken spindle shape, with the majority of the spindles being 8–9 μm in length and no more than 7 μm in width (Fig. 2, D–F). (Spindle length and width were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.”) Moreover, the microscopic observation of α-tubulin revealed that knockdown of p38IP resulted in a high proportion of defective spindle formation, which was characterized by aberrant spindle fibers (Fig. 2G). The proportion of irregular spindles in the p38IP-deficient cells was approximately twice that of normal cells (Fig. 2H). Furthermore, centrosomal γ-tubulin was stained to indicate the spindle poles and the vertical or z distance (measured as described under “Materials and Methods”) between the mitotic spindle poles and was measured in control and shp38IP cells. p38IP-deficient cells at metaphase tended to display an increased vertical distance between the two centrosomes. ∼43.5% were greater than 1.5 μm and ∼4.7% reached 2.6∼3 μm, whereas only ∼14.1% of the control cells were greater than 1.5 μm, and none reached 2.6–3 μm (Fig. 2, I and J); thus, the control and shp38IP cells had a significant difference in their vertical centrosome distances (Fig. 2K). Altogether, spindle assembly and orientation were both impaired upon p38IP depletion. A schematic of the control and p38IP-deficient cells at metaphase is shown in Fig. 2L. The mitotic spindle is a highly dynamic microtubule-based structure that consists of polymerized α/β-tubulin heterodimers. Acetylation of α-tubulin is closely related with microtubule stabilization, although the mechanism is still unclear (27Wickström S.A. Masoumi K.C. Khochbin S. Fässler R. Massoumi R.

It is also unknown how binding of NO to heme in guanylate cyclase is communicated to the catalytic domain. In the current study the conformational change of guanylate cyclase on activation by NO was studied using FRET. Endogenous tryptophan residues were used as donors, the substrate analog 2'-Mant-3'-dGTP as acceptor. The enzyme contains five tryptophan residues distributed evenly over all four functional domains. This provides a unique opportunity to detect the movement of the functional domains relative to the substrate-binding catalytic region. FRET measurements indicate that NO brings tryptophan 22 in the αB helix of the β1 heme NO binding domain and tryptophan 466 in the second short helix of the α1 coiled-coil domain closer to the catalytic domain. We propose that the respective domains act as a pair of tongs forcing the catalytic domain into the nitric oxide-activated conformation."

https://openalex.org/W2035688841,"Alcohol abuse is a major cause of pancreatitis in people, but the mechanism is unknown. It has been recently demonstrated that transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) activation causes neurogenic inflammation and plays an important role in acute pancreatitis. Moreover, TRPV1 is activated by ethanol. We examined the direct effects of ethanol on acute pancreatitis. Acute inflammation of the pancreas was produced by injection of ethanol and palmitoleic acid (POA), a nonoxidative metabolite of ethanol, in wild-type C57BL/6J mice and Trpv1-knockout C57BL/6J mice. Inflammatory indexes were analyzed 24 h later. Injection of ethanol + POA produced acute pancreatitis indicated by significant increases in histopathological damage, serum amylase levels, and pancreatic MPO concentrations (P<0.05-0.001). All parameters of pancreatitis were blocked by pretreatment with the TRPV1 antagonist drug AMG9810. In addition, ethanol + POA administration to Trpv1knockout mice did not produce pancreatic inflammation. Treatment with vehicle, ethanol alone, or POA alone had no inflammatory effects. TRPV1 partially mediates inflammation induced by ethanol + POA in the mouse pancreas, consistent with the ability of ethanol to activate TRPV1. We propose that ethanol may contribute to alcohol-induced pancreatitis by a neurogenic mechanism."

In addition, antigen-antibody interaction-based method cannot be used for the detection of influenza viruses with major antigenic change. In this study, we established the use of fluorescent immunochromatography (FLIC) to detect a broad spectrum of H5 subtype influenza A viruses. This method has improved sensitivity 10–100 fold higher than traditional IC because of the use of fluorescent conjugated beads. Our Type-E FLIC kit detected all of the H5 subtype influenza viruses that were examined, as well as recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins (rHAs) belonging to the Eurasian H5 subtype viruses and the Type-N diagnosed North American H5 subtype influenza A viruses. Thus, this kit has the improved potential to detect H5 subtype influenza viruses of different clades with both Type-E and Type-N FLIC kits. Compared with PCR-based diagnosis, FLIC has a strong advantage in usability, because the sample preparation required for FLIC is only mix-and-drop without any additional steps such as RNA extraction. Our results can provide new strategies against the spread and transmission of HPAI H5N1 viruses in birds and mammals including humans."
https://openalex.org/W1964396541,"Basic literacy skills underlie much future adult functioning, and are targeted in children through a variety of means. Children with reading problems were exposed either to a self-paced computer programme that focused on improving phonetic ability, or underwent a classroom-based reading intervention. Exposure was limited to 3 40-min sessions a week, for six weeks. The children were assessed in terms of their reading, spelling, and mathematics abilities, as well as for their externalising and internalising behaviour problems, before the programme commenced, and immediately after the programme terminated. Relative to the control group, the computer-programme improved reading by about seven months in boys (but not in girls), but had no impact on either spelling or mathematics. Children on the programme also demonstrated fewer externalising and internalising behaviour problems than the control group. The results suggest that brief exposure to a self-paced phonetic computer-teaching programme had some benefits for the sample."
https://openalex.org/W2073807730,"We investigated the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatase α (PTPα) in regulating signaling by the ErbB2 oncoprotein in mammary epithelial cells. Using this model, we demonstrated that activation of ErbB2 led to the transient inactivation of PTPα, suggesting that attenuation of PTPα activity may contribute to enhanced ErbB2 signaling. Furthermore, RNAi-induced suppression of PTPα led to increased cell migration in an ErbB2-dependent manner. The ability of ErbB2 to increase cell motility in the absence of PTPα was characterized by prolonged interaction of GRB7 with ErbB2 and increased association of ErbB2 with a β1-integrin-rich complex, which depended on GRB7-SH2 domain interactions. Finally, suppression of PTPα resulted in increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase on Tyr-407, which induced the recruitment of vinculin and the formation of a novel focal adhesion kinase complex in response to ErbB2 activation in mammary epithelial cells. Collectively, these results reveal a new role for PTPα in the regulation of motility of mammary epithelial cells in response to ErbB2 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2040586395,"p24 family proteins are evolutionarily conserved transmembrane proteins involved in the early secretory pathway. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has 8 known p24 proteins that are classified into four subfamilies (p24α, -β, -γ, and -δ). Emp24 and Erv25 are the sole members of p24β and -δ, respectively, and deletion of either destabilizes the remaining p24 proteins, resulting in p24 null phenotype (p24Δ). We studied genetic and physical interactions of p24α (Erp1, -5, and -6) and γ (Erp2, -3, and -4). Deletion of the major p24α (Erp1) partially inhibited p24 activity as reported previously. A second mutation in either Erp5 or Erp6 aggravated the erp1Δ phenotype, and the triple mutation gave a full p24Δ phenotype. Similar genetic interactions were observed among the major p24γ (Erp2) and the other two γ members. All the p24α/γ isoforms interacted with both p24β and -δ. Interaction between p24β and -δ was isoform-selective, and five major α/γ pairs were detected. These results suggest that the yeast p24 proteins form functionally redundant αβγδ complexes. We also identified Rrt6 as a novel p24δ isoform. Rrt6 shows only limited sequence identity (∼15%) to known p24 proteins but was found to have structural properties characteristic of p24. Rrt6 was induced when cells were grown on glycerol and form an additional αβγδ complex with Erp3, Erp5, and Emp24. This complex was mainly localized to the Golgi, whereas the p24 complex containing Erv25, instead of Rrt6 but otherwise with the same isoform composition, was found mostly in the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2000666593,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model system for studies of genes controlling development and disease. However, its applicability to physiological systems is less clear because of metabolic differences between insects and mammals. Insulin signaling has been studied in mammals because of relevance to diabetes and other diseases but there are many parallels between mammalian and insect pathways. For example, deletion of Drosophila Insulin-Like Peptides resulted in ‘diabetic’ flies with elevated circulating sugar levels. Whether this situation reflects failure of sugar uptake into peripheral tissues as seen in mammals is unclear and depends upon whether flies harbor the machinery to mount mammalian-like insulin-dependent sugar uptake responses. Here we asked whether Drosophila fat cells are competent to respond to insulin with mammalian-like regulated trafficking of sugar transporters. Transgenic Drosophila expressing human glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4), the sugar transporter expressed primarily in insulin-responsive tissues, were generated. After expression in fat bodies, GLUT4 intracellular trafficking and localization were monitored by confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). We found that fat body cells responded to insulin with increased GLUT4 trafficking and translocation to the plasma membrane. While the amplitude of these responses was relatively weak in animals reared on a standard diet, it was greatly enhanced in animals reared on sugar-restricted diets, suggesting that flies fed standard diets are insulin resistant. Our findings demonstrate that flies are competent to mobilize translocation of sugar transporters to the cell surface in response to insulin. They suggest that Drosophila fat cells are primed for a response to insulin and that these pathways are down-regulated when animals are exposed to constant, high levels of sugar. Finally, these studies are the first to use TIRFM to monitor insulin-signaling pathways in Drosophila, demonstrating the utility of TIRFM of tagged sugar transporters to monitor signaling pathways in insects."
https://openalex.org/W2080183145,"Melanins are an important factor determining the vulnerability of mammalian skin to UV radiation and thus to UV-induced skin cancers. Transgenic mice overexpressing hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) have extra-follicular dermal melanocytes, notably in the papillary upper dermis, and are susceptible to UV-induced melanoma. Pigmented HGF/SF neonatal mice are more susceptible than albino HGF/SF animals to UVA -induced melanoma, indicating an involvement of melanin in melanoma formation. This raises the question of the effect of transgenic HGF/SF on melanization. We developed a methodology to accurately quantitate both the production of melanin and the efficiency of melanogenesis in normal, and HGF/SF transgenic mice in vivo. Skin and hair shafts of 5 day old and adult (3 week old) C57BL/6-HGF/SF and corresponding C57BL/6 wild type mice were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) to quantitate melanin, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for the presence of melanosomes, and by standard histology and by Western blotting and zymography to determine the expression and activity of melanogenesis-related proteins. Eumelanin but no phaeomelanin was detected in transgenic C57BL/6-HGF and C57BL/6 wild type mice. Transgenic HGF/SF overexpression did not change the type of melanin produced in the skin or hair, did not affect the terminal content of melanin production in standard samples of hair and did not influence hair cycle/morphogenesis-related changes in skin thickness. No melanocytes were found in the epidermis and no melanosomes were found in epidermal keratinocytes. HGF/SF transgenic mice thus lack the epidermal melanin UV-protection found in constitutively dark human skin. We conclude that melanocytes in the HGF/SF transgenic mouse, particularly in the papillary dermis, are vulnerable to UVA which interacts with eumelanin but not phaeomelanin to induce melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2098577439,"Implantable neural interfaces are designed to provide a high spatial and temporal precision control signal implementing high degree of freedom real-time prosthetic systems. The development of a Radio Frequency (RF) wireless neural interface has the potential to expand the number of applications as well as extend the robustness and longevity compared to wired neural interfaces. However, it is well known that RF signal is absorbed by the body and can result in tissue heating. In this work, numerical studies with analytical validations are performed to provide an assessment of power, heating and specific absorption rate (SAR) associated with the wireless RF transmitting within the human head. The receiving antenna on the neural interface is designed with different geometries and modeled at a range of implanted depths within the brain in order to estimate the maximum receiving power without violating SAR and tissue temperature elevation safety regulations. Based on the size of the designed antenna, sets of frequencies between 1 GHz to 4 GHz have been investigated. As expected the simulations demonstrate that longer receiving antennas (dipole) and lower working frequencies result in greater power availability prior to violating SAR regulations. For a 15 mm dipole antenna operating at 1.24 GHz on the surface of the brain, 730 uW of power could be harvested at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) SAR violation limit. At approximately 5 cm inside the head, this same antenna would receive 190 uW of power prior to violating SAR regulations. Finally, the 3-D bio-heat simulation results show that for all evaluated antennas and frequency combinations we reach FCC SAR limits well before 1 °C. It is clear that powering neural interfaces via RF is possible, but ultra-low power circuit designs combined with advanced simulation will be required to develop a functional antenna that meets all system requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2095545272,"Background/Aims The elderly constitute an increasing proportion of admitted patients worldwide. We investigate the determinants of hospital length of stay and outcomes in patients aged 90 years and older. Methods We retrospectively analyzed all admitted patients aged >90 years from the general medical wards in a tertiary referral medical center between August 31, 2009 and August 31, 2012. Patients’ clinical characteristics, admission diagnosis, concomitant illnesses at admission, and discharge diagnosis were collected. Each patient was followed until discharge or death. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to study factors associated with longer hospital length of stay (>7 days) and in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 283 nonagenarian in-patients were recruited, with 118 (41.7%) hospitalized longer than one week. Nonagenarians admitted with pneumonia (p = 0.04) and those with lower Barthel Index (p = 0.012) were more likely to be hospitalized longer than one week. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with lower Barthel Index (odds ratio [OR] 0.98; p = 0.021) and those with heart failure (OR 3.05; p = 0.046) had hospital stays >7 days, while patients with lower Barthel Index (OR 0.93; p = 0.005), main admission nephrologic diagnosis (OR 4.83; p = 0.016) or acute kidney injury (OR 30.7; p = 0.007) had higher in-hospital mortality. Conclusion In nonagenarians, presence of heart failure at admission was associated with longer hospital length of stay, while acute kidney injury at admission predicted higher hospitalization mortality. Poorer functional status was associated with both prolonged admission and higher in-hospital mortality."

In this study, the preservation of fertility with TAE using NBCA for massive haemorrhage during pregnancy or the peripartum period and the utility of this therapy were investigated.Cases from January 2005 to October 2010 in which TAE was performed for massive haemorrhage in pregnant women, particularly during the peripartum period, were investigated.TAE was performed in 27 pregnant women. The embolic agent used was GS only in five cases, NBCA only in 19 cases, and additional embolization with NBCA when the effect with GS was insufficient in three cases, one each of abruptio placentae, cervical pregnancy, and uterine atony.A comparison of mean blood loss when each embolic agent was used for haemostasis showed a significant difference between cases in which GS only was used and cases in which NBCA only was used. In a comparison of mean transfusion volume, a significant difference was seen between cases in which both GS and NBCA were used and cases in which NBCA only was used. In a postoperative follow-up survey, menses resumed in eight patients, including four patients who later became pregnant and three who delivered.TAE with NBCA, which has an embolic effect unrelated to clotting dysfunction for massive haemorrhage during the peripartum period, is a minimally invasive and very effective treatment method for patients with severe DIC."
https://openalex.org/W2036671927,"There is currently limited understanding of the contribution of biological N2 fixation (diazotrophy) to the N budget of large river systems. This natural source of N in boreal river systems may partially explain the sustained productivity of river floodplains in Northern Europe where winter fodder was harvested for centuries without fertilizer amendments. In much of the world, anthropogenic pollution and river regulation have nearly eliminated opportunities to study natural processes that shaped early nutrient dynamics of large river systems; however, pristine conditions in northern Fennoscandia allow for the retrospective evaluation of key biochemical processes of historical significance. We investigated biological N2 fixation (diazotrophy) as a potential source of nitrogen fertility at 71 independent floodplain sites along 10 rivers and conducted seasonal and intensive analyses at a subset of these sites. Biological N2 fixation occurred in all floodplains, averaged 24.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and was down regulated from over 60 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) to 0 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) by river N pollution. A diversity of N2-fixing cyanobacteria was found to colonize surface detritus in the floodplains. The data provide evidence for N2 fixation to be a fundamental source of new N that may have sustained fertility at alluvial sites along subarctic rivers. Such data may have implications for the interpretation of ancient agricultural development and the design of contemporary low-input agroecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2022989363,"Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), famous for their ability to precisely and efficiently modify specific genomic loci, have been employed in numerous transgenic model organism and cell constructions. Here we employ the ZFNs technology, with homologous recombination (HR), to construct sequence-specific Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) knock-in cells. With the use of ZFNs, we established APP knock in cell lines with gene-modification efficiencies of about 7%. We electroporated DNA fragment containing the promoter and the protein coding regions of the zinc finger nucleases into cells, instead of the plasmids, to avoid problems associated with off target homologous recombination, and adopted a pair of mutated FokI cleavage domains to reduce the toxic effects of the ZFNs on cell growth. Since over-expression of APP, or a subdomain of it, might lead to an immediately lethal effect, we used the Cre-LoxP System to regulate APP expression. Our genetically transformed cell lines, w5c1 and s12c8, showed detectable APP and Amyloid β (Aβ) production. The Swedish double mutation in the APP coding sequence enhanced APP and Aβ abundance. What is more, the activity of the three key secretases in Aβ formation could be modulated, indicating that these transgenic cells have potential for drug screening to modify amyloid metabolism in cells. Our transformed cells could readily be propagated in culture and should provide an excellent experimental medium for elucidating aspects of the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, especially those concerning the amyloidogenic pathways involving mutations in the APP coding sequence. The cellular models may also serve as a tool for deriving potentially useful therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2029590423,"HPV4 is the most expensive vaccine requiring three appropriately timed doses to provide maximal efficacy against two oncogenic HPV types. The primary purpose of this study is to quantify the use of HPV4 vaccine in a safety net health care system in terms of its inefficiencies.A retrospective study of HPV4 dosing from 2006-2009, among females 10-26 years old who sought care in a safety net health care system was conducted to determine dose usage patterns among those at highest risk for cervical cancer. Dose descriptors abstracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) included timing and number in series as well as characteristics of the person to whom and visit at which the dose was given. Dose inefficiencies were separated into ""less than three doses"" and ""mistimed doses"" for analysis.The majority (66%) of HPV4 doses administered were insufficient to induce the maximal immune response necessary for HPV infection prevention. Among on-time doses, 58% were singleton or doublet doses. Mistimed doses accounted for 19% of all doses administered with late intervals being more common than early intervals among those receiving more than one dose (9% vs. 4%, p<0.001). Third doses were mistimed twice as often as second doses (10% vs. 5%, p<0.001). Black women were more likely to have a mistimed second dose and Hispanic women more likely to have a mistimed third dose compared to white women (OR = 1.70 (95% CI: 1.11, 2.61 and 2.44 (1.19, 5.00), respectively). The HPV4-only visit type at which HPV4 was initiated was the most significant predictor of on-time doublet completion.In a safety net health care system the large inefficiencies associated with HPV4 vaccination must be addressed in order to maximize our patient's cervical cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2055025812,"Our previous study suggested the presence of a novel cone-specific redox reaction that generates 11-cis-retinal from 11-cis-retinol in the carp retina. This reaction is unique in that 1) both 11-cis-retinol and all-trans-retinal were required to produce 11-cis-retinal; 2) together with 11-cis-retinal, all-trans-retinol was produced at a 1:1 ratio; and 3) the addition of enzyme cofactors such as NADP(H) was not necessary. This reaction is probably part of the reactions in a cone-specific retinoid cycle required for cone visual pigment regeneration with the use of 11-cis-retinol supplied from Müller cells. In this study, using purified carp cone membrane preparations, we first confirmed that the reaction is a redox-coupling reaction between retinals and retinols. We further examined the substrate specificity, reaction mechanism, and subcellular localization of this reaction. Oxidation was specific for 11-cis-retinol and 9-cis-retinol. In contrast, reduction showed low specificity: many aldehydes, including all-trans-, 9-cis-, 11-cis-, and 13-cis-retinals and even benzaldehyde, supported the reaction. On the basis of kinetic studies of this reaction (aldehyde-alcohol redox-coupling reaction), we found that formation of a ternary complex of a retinol, an aldehyde, and a postulated enzyme seemed to be necessary, which suggested the presence of both the retinol- and aldehyde-binding sites in this enzyme. A subcellular fractionation study showed that the activity is present almost exclusively in the cone inner segment. These results suggest the presence of an effective production mechanism of 11-cis-retinal in the cone inner segment to regenerate visual pigment."
https://openalex.org/W1994115796,"Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the most effective class of drugs in the endocrine treatment of breast cancer, with an approximate 50% treatment response rate. Our objective was to determine whether intratumoral expression levels of estrogen-related genes are predictive of AI responsiveness in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Primary breast carcinomas were obtained from 112 women who received AI therapy after failing adjuvant tamoxifen therapy and developing recurrent breast cancer. Tumor ERα and PR protein expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of 5 estrogen-related genes-AKR1C3, aromatase, ERα, and 2 estradiol/ERα target genes, BRCA1 and PR-were measured by real-time PCR. Tumor protein and mRNA levels were compared with breast cancer progression rates to determine predictive accuracy. Responsiveness to AI therapy-defined as the combined complete response, partial response, and stable disease rates for at least 6 months-was 51%; rates were 56% in ERα-IHC-positive and 14% in ERα-IHC-negative tumors. Levels of ERα, PR, or BRCA1 mRNA were independently predictive for responsiveness to AI. In cross-validated analyses, a combined measurement of tumor ERα and PR mRNA levels yielded a more superior specificity (36%) and identical sensitivity (96%) to the current clinical practice (ERα/PR-IHC). In patients with ERα/PR-IHC-negative tumors, analysis of mRNA expression revealed either non-significant trends or statistically significant positive predictive values for AI responsiveness. In conclusion, expression levels of estrogen-related mRNAs are predictive for AI responsiveness in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, and mRNA expression analysis may improve patient selection."
