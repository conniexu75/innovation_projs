https://openalex.org/W1968925554,"Production in the western Bering Strait is estimated at 324 grams of carbon per square meter per year over 2.12x 10(4) square kilometers. An ice-reduced growing season makes this large amount of primary production unexpected, but it is consistent with the area's large upper trophic level stocks. The productivity is fueled by a cross-shelf flow of nutrient-rich water from the Bering Sea continental slope. This phytoplankton production system from June through September is analogous to a laboratory continuous culture."
https://openalex.org/W2034105201,"Research during the last 15 years has shown that there is order in large-scale air-sea interactions, so that space scales of abnormalities of the lower atmosphere's circulation and the upper oceanic thermal structure are comparable. Because of this air-sea coupling, each oceanic or atmospheric pattern can be reasonably well specified by the other. Patterns of oceanic thermal anomalies are about an order of magnitude more persistent than those of atmospheric circulations, and empirical studies have had some success in using sea surface temperature patterns in long-range weather prediction. In addition to empirical studies, efforts continue in the development of numerical-dynamical models in order to understand the complex linkages of the large-scale air-sea system."
https://openalex.org/W2057436490,A major objective in the remote sensing of convective storms by radar is the clear and reliable differentiation between regions of hail and regions of rainfall. This report describes the application of the differential reflectivity (Z(DR)) radar technique to the problem of hail detection. The procedure is based on the markedly different polarization-dependent backscatter characteristics of rain and hail. Field experiments conducted in Colorado during the spring of 1983 provide significant evidence of hail detection with this new radar technique.
https://openalex.org/W2037107383,Direct measurements of shell growth of an unclassified mussel from active hydrothermal vents along the Galápagos Rift reveal growth rates of approxmately 1 centimeter per year for mature specimens. The largest mussel collected (with shell length of 18.4 centimeters) was estimated to be 19 +/- 7 years old at the time of sampling. Recorded growth rates are among the highest documented for deep-sea species.
https://openalex.org/W2066538303,"Side-scan sonar was used to map and measure feeding pits of the California gray whale over 22,000 square kilometers of the northeastern Bering Sea floor. The distribution of pits, feeding whales, ampeliscid amphipods (whale prey), and a fine-sand substrate bearing the amphipods were all closely correlated. The central Chirikov Basin and nearshore areas of Saint Lawrence Island supply at least 6.5 percent of the total gray whale food resource in summer. While feeding, the whales resuspend at least 1.2 × 108 cubic meters of sediment annually; this significantly affects the geology and biology of the region."
https://openalex.org/W2085763662,"The analysis of inorganic atomic species is greatly facilitated by the coupling of lasers with mass spectrometers. A tunable dye laser, alone or in combination with a pump laser, ionizes atoms by resonant excitation processes; the ions are then analyzed in the mass spectrometer. The laser-mass spectrometer system promises to overcome traditional limits of sensitivity and selectivity and to have diverse applications in analytical chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1981062411,"The progress of instrumentation and measurement science in the next decade will be marked by three major trends. First, as the average instrument achieves a rather considerable level of intelligence, ""dumb"" systems will become the exception, and we will eventually begin to become proficient in exploiting the resulting capabilities. Second, more sophisticated understanding of measurement science and of actual measurement needs will drive instrumentation design advances such as miniaturized sensors and yet more ""hyphenated"" instruments and ""mapping"" instruments. Third, the combination of sensor-based instrumentation and microminiaturization will make possible distributed measurement by allowing point-of-use measurements by nonexperts."
https://openalex.org/W2025330392,"The shell of a 19-centimeter-long vesicomyid clam, collected live at the Galápagos spreading center hydrothermal field, was sampled along growth lines and analyzed for members of the (238)U and (232)Th decay series. The growth rate, determined from the (210)Po/(210)Pb and (228)Th/(228)Ra couples, is about 4 centimeters per year along the axis of maximum growth, which is 12 centimeters long. This yields an age of 3 to 4 years for this clam."
https://openalex.org/W2051849338,Two recent instrumental improvements in high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy make possible the recording of complete surface vibrational spectra on the millisecond time scale. This is the first spectroscopic probe capable of directly measuring fundamental surface rate processes in real time with a resolution less than or equal to 1 millisecond. Such measurements are the key to understanding surface kinetics at the molecular level. This article summarizes experiments on the adsorption and decomposition of formic acid on Cu(100) to investigate the temperature and coverage dependence of the formate intermediate. Other results are cited that provide a detailed description of the decomposition of methanol on Ni(110). Also reported are direct measurements of the residence time of carbon monoxide on Cu(100) and the associated desorption kinetics.
https://openalex.org/W2065010197,"Mass spectrometry data on plutonium isolated from Columbia River sediments exhibit mean ratios of plutonium-240 to plutonium-242 consistent with those observed for integrated global fallout. Ratios of plutonium-240 to plutonium-239 show marked deviations from accepted fallout values, suggesting a second source of plutonium-239. This additional plutonium-239 arises from the decay of neptunium-239 produced in reactor effluent water from the old plutonium production reactors located on the Hanford Reservation. An estimated 20 to 25 percent of the total plutonium inventory in sediments behind McNary Reservoir, the first downriver site of fine sediment accumulation below the Hanford Reservation, is ascribed to reactor operations."
https://openalex.org/W2002712202,"Acoustic backscatter observations at 200 kilohertz were made of the buoyant plume from a submarine spring at a depth of 47 meters in Cambridge Fiord, Baffin Island. Vertical velocities of up to 37 centimeters per second are inferred from the ascent rates of discrete scattering structures in the plume."
https://openalex.org/W2080708789,"Prolonged heat treatment (> 1 hour) of nontronite (an iron-rich smectite clay) at 900° to 1000°C produces a phase with some unusual magnetic properties. This new phase has a Curie temperature of 200° to 220°C, extremely high remanent coercivities in excess of 800 milliteslas, and a room-temperature coercivity dependent on the magnitude of the applied field during previous thermomagnetic cycling from above 220°C. X-ray and magnetic analyses suggest that an iron-substituted cristobalite could be responsible, in part, for these observations. Formation of this magnetic cristobalite, however, may require topotactic growth from a smectite precursor."
https://openalex.org/W2035523701,"Photoelectric solar radius measurements since 1974 at Mount Wilson show no change in the solar radius, with a limit of abouit 0.1 arc second (1 standard deviation), over the interval. The limit is set by residual systematic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2139537994,"Gas measurements made in the stratospheric plume from the eruption of Mount St. Helens on 18 May 1980 were not consistent with a reported large injection of radon-222 into the atmosphere. No enrichment in the volatile element polonium was found in filter samples, and the ratio of polonium-210 to lead-210 was not different from background values. Data obtained with an experimental impactor, flown shortly after the eruption, showed an increase of 10(3) in the stratospheric number concentration of submicrometer sulfate particles compared to concentrations before the eruption."
https://openalex.org/W1979329534,"Precise information about the molecular structure, stereochemistry, and environment of paramagnetic species can be obtained by electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy. This technique has been applied in a wide range of disciplines to liquid-phase, single-crystal, and powder samples. In some cases-the study of defects in ionic single crystals, for instance-the volume and complexity of data obtained by ENDOR can hinder interpretation. Such difficulties have been overcome by the use of supplemental ENDOR techniques that simplify the assignment of ENDOR lines. The increased use of computers for the automation of instrumentation, the design of experiments, and the analysis of data has made possible the study of a wider range of problems. With these improvements, as well as with the increased sensitivity provided by optically detected ENDOR, it is now feasible to study polycrystalline and amorphous materials, such as thin-film semiconductors and biological samples in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2168199415,"Neutron scattering is a versatile technique that has been successfully applied to condensed-matter physics, biology, polymer science, chemistry, and materials science. The United States lost its leadership role in this field to Western Europe about 10 years ago. Recently, a modest investment in the United States in new facilities and a positive attitude on the part of the national laboratories toward outside users have resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of U.S. scientists involved in neutron scattering research. Plans are being made for investments in new and improved facilities that could return the leadership role to the United States."

They are also easily recovered from cores and small samples. With proper documentation, the study of fossil larvae can considerably enhance the biostratigraphic potential of macrofossils."
