https://openalex.org/W2126464081,"We have generated mice that carry a germline mutation in which a large portion of the RAG-2 coding region is deleted. Homozygous mutants are viable but fail to produce mature B or T lymphocytes. Very immature lymphoid cells were present in primary lymphoid organs of mutant animals as defined by surface marker analyses and Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) transformation assays. However, these cells did not rearrange their immunoglobulin or T cell receptor loci. Lack of V(D)J recombination activity in mutant pre-B cell lines could be restored by introduction of a functional RAG-2 expression vector. Therefore, loss of RAG-2 function in vivo results in total inability to initiate V(D)J rearrangement, leading to a novel severe combined immune deficient (SCID) phenotype. Because the SCID phenotype was the only obvious abnormality detected in RAG-2 mutant mice, RAG-2 function and V(D)J recombinase activity, per se, are not required for development of cells other than lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2048359227,"Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common inherited neuromuscular disease in adults, with a global incidence of 1 in 8000 individuals. DM is an autosomal dominant, multisystemic disorder characterized primarily by myotonia and progressive muscle weakness. Genomic and complementary DNA probes that map to a 10-kilobase Eco RI genomic fragment from human chromosome 19q13.3 have been used to detect a variable length polymorphism in individuals with DM. Increases in the size of the allele in patients with DM are now shown to be due to an increased number of trinucleotide CTG repeats in the 3' untranslated region of a DM candidate gene. An increase in the severity of the disease in successive generations (genetic anticipation) is accompanied by an increase in the number of trinucleotide repeats. Nearly all cases of DM (98 percent or 253 of 258 individuals) displayed expansion of the CTG repeat region. These results suggest that DM is primarily caused by mutations that generate an amplification of a specific CTG repeat."
https://openalex.org/W1971507786,"Synthetic oligonucleotides containing GC-rich triplet sequences were used in a scanning strategy to identify unstable genetic sequences at the myotonic dystrophy (DM) locus. A highly polymorphic GCT repeat was identified and found to be unstable, with an increased number of repeats occurring in DM patients. In the case of severe congenital DM, the paternal triplet allele was inherited unaltered while the maternal, DM-associated allele was unstable. These studies suggest that the mutational mechanism leading to DM is triplet amplification, similar to that occurring in the fragile X syndrome. The triplet repeat sequence is within a gene (to be referred to as myotonin-protein kinase), which has a sequence similar to protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1998871484,"Diploid S. cerevisiae strains undergo a dimorphic transition that involves changes in cell shape and the pattern of cell division and results in invasive filamentous growth in response to starvation for nitrogen. Cells become long and thin and form pseudohyphae that grow away from the colony and invade the agar medium. Pseudohyphal growth allows yeast cells to forage for nutrients. Pseudohyphal growth requires the polar budding pattern of a/alpha diploid cells; haploid axially budding cells of identical genotype cannot undergo this dimorphic transition. Constitutive activation of RAS2 or mutation of SHR3, a gene required for amino acid uptake, enhance the pseudohyphal phenotype; a dominant mutation in RSR1/BUD1 that causes random budding suppresses pseudohyphal growth."

https://openalex.org/W2077861376,"Peptides extracted from HLA-A2.1 class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on the antigen processing mutant CEMx721.174.T2 were characterized by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Only seven dominant peptides were found, in contrast to over 200 associated with HLA-A2.1 on normal cells. These peptides were derived from the signal peptide domains of normal cellular proteins, were usually larger than nine residues, and were also associated with HLA-A2.1 in normal cells. These results suggest that proteolysis of signal peptide domains in the endoplasmic reticulum is a second mechanism for processing and presentation of peptides for association with class I molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2005573768,"We have previously shown that the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs) are required for regulated transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II. Here we report the biochemical properties of the RNA polymerase I promoter selectivity factor, SL1, and its relationship to TBP. Column chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation indicate that a subpopulation of TBP copurifies with SL1 activity. Antibodies directed against TBP efficiently deplete SL1 transcriptional activity, which can be restored with the SL1 fraction but not purified TBP. Thus, TBP is necessary but not sufficient to complement SL1 activity. Analysis of purified SL1 reveals a complex containing TBP and three distinct TAFs. Purified TAFs reconstituted with recombinant TBP complement SL1 activity, and this demonstrates that TBP plus novel associated factors are integral components of SL1. These findings suggest that TBP may be a universal transcription factor and that the TBP-TAF arrangement provides a unifying mechanism for promoter recognition in animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2029128612,"Sodium salicylate, an anti-inflammatory agent, was examined for its effects on the heat shock response in cultured human cells. Salicylate activation of DNA binding by the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) was comparable to activation attained during heat shock. However, sodium salicylate did not induce heat shock gene transcription even though the HSF was bound in vivo to the heat shock elements upstream of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) gene. These results reveal that activation of the heat shock transcriptional response is a multistep process. Modulation of extracellular pH augments sensitivity to salicylate-induced activation of HSF."
https://openalex.org/W2037928479,"We show that the non-DNA-binding precursor for the p50 subunit (p110), like NF-kappa B, is subject to control of nuclear uptake. In contrast to p50, p110 was excluded from nuclei and unable to associate detectably with p50 or p65 NF-kappa B subunits. The nuclear location signal in the N-terminal half of p110 was not accessible for monospecific antibodies. Removal of only 191 amino acids from the C-terminus of p110 restored antibody accessibility as well as nuclear uptake. The C-terminal half of p110, which is linked to the p50 portion via a glycine-rich hinge, could also noncovalently bind to p50. This helps to explain why p50, after cleavage of the precursor in intact cells, was still retained in an inactive form in the cytoplasm. Our study describes a novel mechanism of nuclear uptake control by masking of a nuclear location signal through a remote domain within a precursor molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2050072642,"By the 4-cell stage of C. elegans embryogenesis, a ventral blastomere, called EMS, is already committed to producing pharyngeal and intestinal cell types. Recessive, maternal-effect mutations in the gene skn-1 prevent EMS from producing both pharyngeal and intestinal cells. In skn-1 mutant embryos, EMS instead produces hypodermal cells and body wall muscle cells, much like its sister blastomere. Genetic analysis suggests that the skn-1 gene product is also required post-embryonically for development of the intestine. We have cloned and sequenced the skn-1 gene and describe sequence similarities to the basic regions of bZIP transcription factors. We propose that the maternally expressed skn-1 gene product acts to specify the fate of the EMS blastomere."
https://openalex.org/W2042582068,The ζ chain of the T cell antigen receptor is a dimeric transmembrane protein with a very short extracellular domain and an extended cytoplasmic tail that triggers T cell effector function when aggregated by extracellular stimuli. We have reduced the active site of ζ to an 18 residue motif that can be appended to the intracellular domain of other transmembrane proteins to endow them with receptor-like activity. The compact size of the motif appears to eliminate ζ mechanisms based on enzymatic activity and suggests that one or at most a few cellular proteins interact with the ζ intracellular domain to initiate signal transduction. Analysis of individual amino acids within the 18 residue element reveals two phylogenetically conserved tyrosines that are absolutely required for activity and other residues that are less essential but contribute to the efficacy of receptor-directed cytolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2084996914,"A Drosophila gene with similarity to the mammalian Ras GTPase activating protein has been isolated in screens for mutations that affect eye development. Inactivation of the locus, Gap1, mimics constitutive activation of the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase and eliminates the need for a functional Sevenless protein in the R7 cell. Our results suggest that Gap1 acts as a negative regulator of signaling by Sevenless by down-regulating the activity of the Ras1 protein, which has been shown to be a key element in signaling by Sevenless."
https://openalex.org/W1977478904,"A secreted fragment of the extracellular portion of human CD8 alpha has been expressed in CHO cells, and a deglycosylated and proteolyzed form of this fragment has been crystallized. We report here the crystal structure of this fragment as refined at 2.6 A resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using a superposition of ten variable domains from immunoglobulin light chains as the search model. Only the N-terminal 114 amino acids of CD8 alpha are visible in the electron density maps. The domain formed by these residues possesses a fold typical of immunoglobulin variable domains and associates to form Fv-like homodimers."
https://openalex.org/W1990068727,"For Drosophila, the choice between male and female development is made by the switch gene, Sxl, in response to the X:A ratio. Once Sxl is turned on in females, it actively maintains the determined state, independent of the X:A signal, by a positive autoregulatory feedback loop in which Sxl proteins direct the female-specific splicing of Sxl transcripts. In this paper we have investigated the mechanism controlling pathway initiation. Our results suggest a two-step model for the initial activation of Sxl in females. In the first step, a special class of Sxl mRNAs is expressed in female embryos from an early promoter that responds to the genes signaling the X:A ratio. The proteins produced from these early mRNAs then initiate the autoregulatory loop by directing the female-specific processing of transcripts from the late Sxl promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2035074438,"Most species of photosynthetic bacteria synthesize their photosynthetic apparatus only under conditions of reduced oxygen tension. To a large extent, this phenomenon is dependent upon anaerobic induction of photosynthesis gene expression. Here we report an example of a regulatory gene, regA, that is involved in transactivating anaerobic expression of the photosynthetic apparatus. We show that RegA is itself responsible for differential induction of light-harvesting and reaction center gene expression relative to operons for photopigment biosynthesis. Surprisingly, strains disrupted for regA were found to retain normal photosynthetic growth capabilities under high light intensities. We further show that photosynthetic growth in the absence of transactivating structural gene expression is a consequence of the superoperonal organization of the photosynthetic gene cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2027234006,"The heterotrimeric G proteins transduce extracellular signals by interacting with specific intracellular effectors. We have used a scanning mutagenesis approach to identify amino acids of αs, the α subunit of Gs, that determine the specificity of its interaction with its effector, adenylyl cyclase. In α subunit chimeras, residues 236–356 of αs comprise the shortest linear stretch that is required for activation of adenylyl cyclase. Within these 121 residues, we identified four clusters of residues in which substitutions prevented effector activation. Mutations in three of these regions did not affect α subunit expression or the GTP-induced conformational change. The identified αs residues in the NH2-terminal half of the 121-residue region endowed the cognate αi2 segment with the ability to activate effector, while those in the COOH-terminal half did not. In a three-dimensional Gα model, based on the structure of p21ras, the effector-activating residues of αs form a surface on the membrane-facing side of the molecule; this surface includes a region that changes conformation upon binding GTP."

https://openalex.org/W2085730270,"In Drosophila embryos, boundaries of lineage restriction separate groups of cells, or compartments. engrailed is essential for specification of the posterior compartment of each segment, and its expression is thought to mark this compartment. Using a new photo-activatable lineage tracer, we followed the progeny of single embryonic cells marked at the blastoderm stage. No clones straddled the anterior edges of engrailed stripes (the parasegment border). However, posterior cells of each stripe lose engrailed expression, producing mixed clones. We suggest that stable expression of engrailed by cells at the anterior edge of the stripe reflects, not cell-intrinsic mechanisms, but proximity to cells that produce Wingless, an extracellular signal needed for maintenance of engrailed expression. If control of posterior cell fate parallels control of engrailed expression, cell fate is initially responsive to cell environment and cell fate determination is a later event."
https://openalex.org/W1999478240,Cognitive and motor deficits are now recognized as significant clinical features of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Juvenile rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were found to exhibit cognitive and motor deficits characteristic of HIV infection. Impairment on a motor skill task was the most reliable indicator of infection. Various cognitive impairments were also evident. These deficits were related to SIV infection of the brain but not to inflammatory lesions at a particular locus. The results suggest that the SIV-infected rhesus macaque is a valuable model for understanding the cause of HIV-associated central nervous system dysfunction and for developing a treatment.
https://openalex.org/W2007883157,"The 21 kd NusG protein is essential for E. coli viability. Cells depleted for NusG were defective for factor-dependent transcription termination. Rho-induced polarity in the gal operon and the Rho-dependent lambda tR1 and lambda tL1 terminators were suppressed in NusG-deficient cells. NusG depletion inactivated the phage HK022 Nun termination factor. In contrast, the factor-independent lambda tl terminator was fully active in NusG-depleted cells and could be suppressed by phage lambda N function."
https://openalex.org/W1996107769,"The triskelion shape of the clathrin molecule enables it to form the polyhedral protein network that covers clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. Domains within the clathrin heavy chain that are responsible for maintaining triskelion shape and function were identified and localized. Sequences that mediate trimerization are distal to the carboxyl terminus and are adjacent to a domain that mediates both light chain binding and clathrin assembly. Structural modeling predicts that within this domain, the region of heavy chain-light chain interaction is a bundle of three or four alpha helices. These studies establish a low resolution model of clathrin subunit folding in the central portion (hub) of the triskelion, thus providing a basis for future mutagenesis experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2047588687,"Regulation of expression of protein-encoding genes in eukaryotes is frequently mediated by sequence-specific transcription factors that control the activities of the basal factors and RNA polymerase II. Basal factors have been considered to be essential for all polymerase II promoters. Studies of the basal factor requirements for transcription from the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) core promoter and the adenovirus major late gene core promoter (MLP) suggest that this paradigm is too simple. Basal transcription from the IgH promoter was reconstituted by TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF, and polymerase, whereas basal transcription from the MLP is highly dependent upon TFIIE in addition to the above factors. Two novel protein activities, referred to as 700 kd and 90 kd, further stimulated the basal reaction from the MLP. Thus, these data indicate that not all basal factors are in fact general."
https://openalex.org/W1995167755,"In the neurological mutant mouse weaver, CNS precursor cells in the external germinal layer (EGL) of the cerebellar cortex proliferate normally, but fail to differentiate and die in the proliferative zone. To examine the autonomy of expression of the weaver gene, we carried out cell-mixing experiments in vitro. In homotypic, reaggregate cultures, weaver EGL precursor cells expressed the general neuronal markers N-CAM, L1, and MAP2, but failed to express the late neuronal antigens TAG-1 and astrotactin, to extend neurites or to migrate on glial fibers. After reaggregation with wild-type EGL precursor cells, weaver precursor cells extended neurites equivalent in length to wild-type cells, migrated along astroglial fibers, and expressed TAG-1 and astrotactin. Rescue of neurite production was also achieved by the addition of membranes from, but not by medium conditioned by wild-type cells. These findings suggest that the weaver gene acts non-autonomously, encoding a membrane-associated ligand that induces EGL neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1976811877,"The restricted ability of embryonic tissue to respond to inductive signals is controlled by a poorly understood phenomenon, termed competence. In Xenopus, dorsal ectoderm is more competent than ventral ectoderm to become induced to neural tissue. We tested whether the Xenopus protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes alpha and beta have a role in neural induction and competence. We found that PKC alpha is predominantly localized in dorsal ectoderm, whereas PKC beta is uniformly distributed. Overexpression of PKC beta conveys a higher propensity for neural differentiation to both dorsal and ventral ectoderm, but their difference in competence remains. However, ectopic expression of PKC alpha elevates the level of neural competence of ventral ectoderm to that of dorsal ectoderm. These data indicate that different PKC isozymes have distinct roles in mediating both neural induction and competence."
https://openalex.org/W2090239155,"In humans the two cerebral hemispheres of the brain are functionally specialized with the left hemisphere predominantly mediating language skills. The basis of this lateralization has been proposed to be differential localization of the linguistic, the motoric, or the symbolic properties of language. To distinguish among these possibilities, lateralization of spoken language, signed language, and nonlinguistic gesture have been compared in deaf and hearing individuals. This analysis, plus additional clinical findings, support a linguistic basis of left hemisphere specialization."

https://openalex.org/W1993742413,"RNA editing in the kinetoplastid Trypanosoma brucei results in the addition and deletion of uridine residues within several mitochondrial mRNAs. The site and number of uridines added appears to be directed by small (∼70 nt) guide RNAs (gRNAs), which can base pair to the edited sequences. We examined reactions involving synthetic cytochrome b (CYb) gRNA and pre-edited mRNA in vitro. A major product of the in vitro reaction is a chimeric RNA molecule containing both gRNA and mRNA sequences. Formation of the CYb gRNA-mRNA chimera was specific, since such molecules did not accumulate when either the gRNA or mRNA was substituted with control RNAs. The reaction required a free 3′ hydroxyl on the gRNA and was unaffected by capping of the gRNA's 5′ end. Direct RNA sequencing indicated that the CYb gRNA is covalently linked via its 3′ poly(U) tail to one of the editing sites on the CYb mRNA. These results suggest that the U's added during editing are donated by the poly(U) tail of a gRNA via a chimeric gRNA-mRNA intermediate."
