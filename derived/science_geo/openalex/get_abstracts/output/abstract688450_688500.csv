https://openalex.org/W4207047906,"We address whether T cell responses induced by different vaccine platforms (mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S, and NVX-CoV2373) cross-recognize early SARS-CoV-2 variants. T cell responses to early variants were preserved across vaccine platforms. By contrast, significant overall decreases were observed for memory B cells and neutralizing antibodies. In subjects ∼6 months post-vaccination, 90% (CD4+) and 87% (CD8+) of memory T cell responses were preserved against variants on average by AIM assay, and 84% (CD4+) and 85% (CD8+) preserved against Omicron. Omicron RBD memory B cell recognition was substantially reduced to 42% compared with other variants. T cell epitope repertoire analysis revealed a median of 11 and 10 spike epitopes recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with average preservation > 80% for Omicron. Functional preservation of the majority of T cell responses may play an important role as a second-level defense against diverse variants."
https://openalex.org/W4210917384,"The kagome lattice1, which is the most prominent structural motif in quantum physics, benefits from inherent non-trivial geometry so that it can host diverse quantum phases, ranging from spin-liquid phases, to topological matter, to intertwined orders2-8 and, most rarely, to unconventional superconductivity6,9. Recently, charge sensitive probes have indicated that the kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs)9-11 exhibit unconventional chiral charge order12-19, which is analogous to the long-sought-after quantum order in the Haldane model20 or Varma model21. However, direct evidence for the time-reversal symmetry breaking of the charge order remains elusive. Here we use muon spin relaxation to probe the kagome charge order and superconductivity in KV3Sb5. We observe a noticeable enhancement of the internal field width sensed by the muon ensemble, which takes place just below the charge ordering temperature and persists into the superconducting state. Notably, the muon spin relaxation rate below the charge ordering temperature is substantially enhanced by applying an external magnetic field. We further show the multigap nature of superconductivity in KV3Sb5 and that the [Formula: see text] ratio (where Tc is the superconducting transition temperature and λab is the magnetic penetration depth in the kagome plane) is comparable to those of unconventional high-temperature superconductors. Our results point to time-reversal symmetry-breaking charge order intertwining with unconventional superconductivity in the correlated kagome lattice."

https://openalex.org/W4211096034,"The extension of life span driven by 40% caloric restriction (CR) in rodents causes trade-offs in growth, reproduction, and immune defense that make it difficult to identify therapeutically relevant CR-mimetic targets. We report that about 14% CR for 2 years in healthy humans improved thymopoiesis and was correlated with mobilization of intrathymic ectopic lipid. CR-induced transcriptional reprogramming in adipose tissue implicated pathways regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics, anti-inflammatory responses, and longevity. Expression of the gene Pla2g7 encoding platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PLA2G7) is inhibited in humans undergoing CR. Deletion of Pla2g7 in mice showed decreased thymic lipoatrophy, protection against age-related inflammation, lowered NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and improved metabolic health. Therefore, the reduction of PLA2G7 may mediate the immunometabolic effects of CR and could potentially be harnessed to lower inflammation and extend the health span."
https://openalex.org/W4210844692,"Abstract There is considerable interest in the waning of effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and vaccine effectiveness (VE) of booster doses. Using linked national Brazilian databases, we undertook a test-negative design study involving almost 14 million people (~16 million tests) to estimate VE of CoronaVac over time and VE of BNT162b2 booster vaccination against RT–PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalization or death). Compared with unvaccinated individuals, CoronaVac VE at 14–30 d after the second dose was 55.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.3–55.7) against confirmed infection and 82.1% (95% CI: 81.4–82.8) against severe outcomes. VE decreased to 34.7% (95% CI: 33.1–36.2) against infection and 72.5% (95% CI: 70.9–74.0) against severe outcomes over 180 d after the second dose. A BNT162b2 booster, 6 months after the second dose of CoronaVac, improved VE against infection to 92.7% (95% CI: 91.0−94.0) and VE against severe outcomes to 97.3% (95% CI: 96.1−98.1) 14–30 d after the booster. Compared with younger age groups, individuals 80 years of age or older had lower protection after the second dose but similar protection after the booster. Our findings support a BNT162b2 booster vaccine dose after two doses of CoronaVac, particularly for the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W4210870706,"Many potential applications of artificial intelligence involve making real-time decisions in physical systems while interacting with humans. Automobile racing represents an extreme example of these conditions; drivers must execute complex tactical manoeuvres to pass or block opponents while operating their vehicles at their traction limits1. Racing simulations, such as the PlayStation game Gran Turismo, faithfully reproduce the non-linear control challenges of real race cars while also encapsulating the complex multi-agent interactions. Here we describe how we trained agents for Gran Turismo that can compete with the world's best e-sports drivers. We combine state-of-the-art, model-free, deep reinforcement learning algorithms with mixed-scenario training to learn an integrated control policy that combines exceptional speed with impressive tactics. In addition, we construct a reward function that enables the agent to be competitive while adhering to racing's important, but under-specified, sportsmanship rules. We demonstrate the capabilities of our agent, Gran Turismo Sophy, by winning a head-to-head competition against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers. By describing how we trained championship-level racers, we demonstrate the possibilities and challenges of using these techniques to control complex dynamical systems in domains where agents must respect imprecisely defined human norms."
https://openalex.org/W4211164694,"Biohybrid systems have been developed to better understand the design principles and coordination mechanisms of biological systems. We consider whether two functional regulatory features of the heart-mechanoelectrical signaling and automaticity-could be transferred to a synthetic analog of another fluid transport system: a swimming fish. By leveraging cardiac mechanoelectrical signaling, we recreated reciprocal contraction and relaxation in a muscular bilayer construct where each contraction occurs automatically as a response to the stretching of an antagonistic muscle pair. Further, to entrain this closed-loop actuation cycle, we engineered an electrically autonomous pacing node, which enhanced spontaneous contraction. The biohybrid fish equipped with intrinsic control strategies demonstrated self-sustained body-caudal fin swimming, highlighting the role of feedback mechanisms in muscular pumps such as the heart and muscles."
https://openalex.org/W4210865385,"Liquid biopsies that measure circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA) offer an opportunity to study the development of pregnancy-related complications in a non-invasive manner and to bridge gaps in clinical care1-4. Here we used 404 blood samples from 199 pregnant mothers to identify and validate cfRNA transcriptomic changes that are associated with preeclampsia, a multi-organ syndrome that is the second largest cause of maternal death globally5. We find that changes in cfRNA gene expression between normotensive and preeclamptic mothers are marked and stable early in gestation, well before the onset of symptoms. These changes are enriched for genes specific to neuromuscular, endothelial and immune cell types and tissues that reflect key aspects of preeclampsia physiology6-9, suggest new hypotheses for disease progression and correlate with maternal organ health. This enabled the identification and independent validation of a panel of 18 genes that when measured between 5 and 16 weeks of gestation can form the basis of a liquid biopsy test that would identify mothers at risk of preeclampsia long before clinical symptoms manifest themselves. Tests based on these observations could help predict and manage who is at risk for preeclampsia-an important objective for obstetric care10,11."
https://openalex.org/W4210951405,"The Hayabusa2 spacecraft investigated the C-type (carbonaceous) asteroid (162173) Ryugu. The mission performed two landing operations to collect samples of surface and subsurface material, the latter exposed by an artificial impact. We present images of the second touchdown site, finding that ejecta from the impact crater was present at the sample location. Surface pebbles at both landing sites show morphological variations ranging from rugged to smooth, similar to Ryugu's boulders, and shapes from quasi-spherical to flattened. The samples were returned to Earth on 6 December 2020. We describe the morphology of >5 grams of returned pebbles and sand. Their diverse color, shape, and structure are consistent with the observed materials of Ryugu; we conclude that they are a representative sample of the asteroid."

https://openalex.org/W4225922139,"Current theory proposes that degenerated sex chromosomes-such as the mammalian Y-evolve through three steps: (i) recombination arrest, linking male-beneficial alleles to the Y chromosome; (ii) Y degeneration, resulting from the inefficacy of selection in the absence of recombination; and (iii) dosage compensation, correcting the resulting low expression of X-linked genes in males. We investigate a model of sex chromosome evolution that incorporates the coevolution of cis and trans regulators of gene expression. We show that the early emergence of dosage compensation favors the maintenance of Y-linked inversions by creating sex-antagonistic regulatory effects. This is followed by degeneration of these nonrecombining inversions caused by regulatory divergence between the X and Y chromosomes. In contrast to current theory, the whole process occurs without any selective pressure related to sexual dimorphism."
https://openalex.org/W4210984741,"Heterologous prime-boost immunization strategies have the potential to augment COVID-19 vaccine efficacy. We longitudinally profiled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S)-specific serological and memory B cell (MBC) responses in individuals who received either homologous (ChAdOx1:ChAdOx1) or heterologous (ChAdOx1:mRNA-1273) prime-boost vaccination. Heterologous messenger RNA (mRNA) booster immunization induced higher serum neutralizing antibody and MBC responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) compared with that of homologous ChAdOx1 boosting. Specificity mapping of circulating B cells revealed that mRNA-1273 boost immunofocused ChAdOx1-primed responses onto epitopes expressed on prefusion-stabilized S. Monoclonal antibodies isolated from mRNA-1273-boosted participants displayed overall higher binding affinities and increased breadth of reactivity against VOCs relative to those isolated from ChAdOx1-boosted individuals. Overall, the results provide molecular insight into the enhanced quality of the B cell response induced after heterologous mRNA booster vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4210899268,"Clustered somatic mutations are common in cancer genomes and previous analyses reveal several types of clustered single-base substitutions, which include doublet- and multi-base substitutions1-5, diffuse hypermutation termed omikli6, and longer strand-coordinated events termed kataegis3,7-9. Here we provide a comprehensive characterization of clustered substitutions and clustered small insertions and deletions (indels) across 2,583 whole-genome-sequenced cancers from 30 types of cancer10. Clustered mutations were highly enriched in driver genes and associated with differential gene expression and changes in overall survival. Several distinct mutational processes gave rise to clustered indels, including signatures that were enriched in tobacco smokers and homologous-recombination-deficient cancers. Doublet-base substitutions were caused by at least 12 mutational processes, whereas most multi-base substitutions were generated by either tobacco smoking or exposure to ultraviolet light. Omikli events, which have previously been attributed to APOBEC3 activity6, accounted for a large proportion of clustered substitutions; however, only 16.2% of omikli matched APOBEC3 patterns. Kataegis was generated by multiple mutational processes, and 76.1% of all kataegic events exhibited mutational patterns that are associated with the activation-induced deaminase (AID) and APOBEC3 family of deaminases. Co-occurrence of APOBEC3 kataegis and extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), termed kyklonas (Greek for cyclone), was found in 31% of samples with ecDNA. Multiple distinct kyklonic events were observed on most mutated ecDNA. ecDNA containing known cancer genes exhibited both positive selection and kyklonic hypermutation. Our results reveal the diversity of clustered mutational processes in human cancer and the role of APOBEC3 in recurrently mutating and fuelling the evolution of ecDNA."
https://openalex.org/W4210830393,"Animals must set behavioural priority in a context-dependent manner and switch from one behaviour to another at the appropriate moment1-3. Here we probe the molecular and neuronal mechanisms that orchestrate the transition from feeding to courtship in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that feeding is prioritized over courtship in starved males, and the consumption of protein-rich food rapidly reverses this order within a few minutes. At the molecular level, a gut-derived, nutrient-specific neuropeptide hormone-Diuretic hormone 31 (Dh31)-propels a switch from feeding to courtship. We further address the underlying kinetics with calcium imaging experiments. Amino acids from food acutely activate Dh31+ enteroendocrine cells in the gut, increasing Dh31 levels in the circulation. In addition, three-photon functional imaging of intact flies shows that optogenetic stimulation of Dh31+ enteroendocrine cells rapidly excites a subset of brain neurons that express Dh31 receptor (Dh31R). Gut-derived Dh31 excites the brain neurons through the circulatory system within a few minutes, in line with the speed of the feeding-courtship behavioural switch. At the circuit level, there are two distinct populations of Dh31R+ neurons in the brain, with one population inhibiting feeding through allatostatin-C and the other promoting courtship through corazonin. Together, our findings illustrate a mechanism by which the consumption of protein-rich food triggers the release of a gut hormone, which in turn prioritizes courtship over feeding through two parallel pathways."

https://openalex.org/W4210843030,"The empathic ability to vicariously experience the other’s fearful situation, a process called observational fear (OF), is critical to survive in nature and function in society. OF can be facilitated by both prior similar fear experience in the observer and social familiarity with the demonstrator. However, the neural circuit mechanisms of experience-dependent OF (Exp OF) remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that hippocampal-basolateral amygdala (HPC-BLA) circuits in mice without involving the anterior cingulate cortex, considered a center of OF, mediate Exp OF. Dorsal HPC neurons generate fear memory engram cells in BLA encoding prior similar fear experiences, which are essential for Exp OF. On the other hand, ventral HPC neurons respond to the familiar demonstrator’s aversive situation during Exp OF, which reactivates the fear memory engram cells in BLA to elicit Exp OF. Our study provides new insights into the memory engram-dependent perception-action coupling that underlies empathic behaviors like Exp OF."
https://openalex.org/W4210998775,"Bivalent genes are ready for activation upon the arrival of developmental cues. Here, we report that BEND3 is a CpG island (CGI)-binding protein that is enriched at regulatory elements. The cocrystal structure of BEND3 in complex with its target DNA reveals the structural basis for its DNA methylation-sensitive binding property. Mouse embryos ablated of Bend3 died at the pregastrulation stage. Bend3 null embryonic stem cells (ESCs) exhibited severe defects in differentiation, during which hundreds of CGI-containing bivalent genes were prematurely activated. BEND3 is required for the stable association of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) at bivalent genes that are highly occupied by BEND3, which suggests a reining function of BEND3 in maintaining high levels of H3K27me3 at these bivalent genes in ESCs to prevent their premature activation in the forthcoming developmental stage."
https://openalex.org/W4210913100,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently mutated in human cancer1,2, and is an important therapeutic target. EGFR inhibitors have been successful in lung cancer, where mutations in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain activate the receptor1, but not in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)3, where mutations occur exclusively in the extracellular region. Here we show that common extracellular GBM mutations prevent EGFR from discriminating between its activating ligands4. Different growth factor ligands stabilize distinct EGFR dimer structures5 that signal with different kinetics to specify or bias outcome5,6. EGF itself induces strong symmetric dimers that signal transiently to promote proliferation. Epiregulin (EREG) induces much weaker asymmetric dimers that drive sustained signalling and differentiation5. GBM mutations reduce the ability of EGFR to distinguish EREG from EGF in cellular assays, and allow EGFR to form strong (EGF-like) dimers in response to EREG and other low-affinity ligands. Using X-ray crystallography, we further show that the R84K GBM mutation symmetrizes EREG-driven extracellular dimers so that they resemble dimers normally seen with EGF. By contrast, a second GBM mutation, A265V, remodels key dimerization contacts to strengthen asymmetric EREG-driven dimers. Our results argue for an important role of altered ligand discrimination by EGFR in GBM, with potential implications for therapeutic targeting."

https://openalex.org/W4210886337,"Fast synaptic communication requires receptors that respond to the presence of neurotransmitter by opening an ion channel across the post-synaptic membrane. The muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from the electric fish, Torpedo, is the prototypic ligand-gated ion channel, yet the structural changes underlying channel activation remain undefined. Here we use cryo-EM to solve apo and agonist-bound structures of the Torpedo nicotinic receptor embedded in a lipid nanodisc. Using both a direct biochemical assay to define the conformational landscape and molecular dynamics simulations to assay flux through the pore, we correlate structures with functional states and elucidate the motions that lead to pore activation of a heteromeric nicotinic receptor. We highlight an underappreciated role for the complementary subunit in channel gating, establish the structural basis for the differential agonist affinities of α/δ versus α /γ sites, and explain why nicotine is less potent at muscle nicotinic receptors compared to neuronal ones."
https://openalex.org/W4211262214,"Epithelial cells migrate across wounds to repair injured tissue. Leader cells at the front of migrating sheets often drive this process. However, it is unclear how leaders emerge from an apparently homogeneous epithelial cell population. We characterized leaders emerging from epithelial monolayers in cell culture and found that they activated the stress sensor p53, which was sufficient to initiate leader cell behavior. p53 activated the cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, which in turn induced leader behavior through inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity. p53 also induced crowding hypersensitivity in leader cells such that, upon epithelial closure, they were eliminated by cell competition. Thus, mechanically induced p53 directs emergence of a transient population of leader cells that drive migration and ensures their clearance upon epithelial repair."
https://openalex.org/W4210886966,"Abstract The mutational landscape is shaped by many processes. Genic regions are vulnerable to mutation but are preferentially protected by transcription-coupled repair 1 . In microorganisms, transcription has been demonstrated to be mutagenic 2,3 ; however, the impact of transcription-associated mutagenesis remains to be established in higher eukaryotes 4 . Here we show that ID4—a cancer insertion–deletion (indel) mutation signature of unknown aetiology 5 characterized by short (2 to 5 base pair) deletions —is due to a transcription-associated mutagenesis process. We demonstrate that defective ribonucleotide excision repair in mammals is associated with the ID4 signature, with mutations occurring at a TNT sequence motif, implicating topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) activity at sites of genome-embedded ribonucleotides as a mechanistic basis. Such TOP1-mediated deletions occur somatically in cancer, and the ID-TOP1 signature is also found in physiological settings, contributing to genic de novo indel mutations in the germline. Thus, although topoisomerases protect against genome instability by relieving topological stress 6 , their activity may also be an important source of mutations in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W4210930321,"Ferroics, especially ferromagnets, can form complex topological spin structures such as vortices1 and skyrmions2,3 when subjected to particular electrical and mechanical boundary conditions. Simple vortex-like, electric-dipole-based topological structures have been observed in dedicated ferroelectric systems, especially ferroelectric-insulator superlattices such as PbTiO3/SrTiO3, which was later shown to be a model system owing to its high depolarizing field4-8. To date, the electric dipole equivalent of ordered magnetic spin lattices driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMi)9,10 has not been experimentally observed. Here we examine a domain structure in a single PbTiO3 epitaxial layer sandwiched between SrRuO3 electrodes. We observe periodic clockwise and anticlockwise ferroelectric vortices that are modulated by a second ordering along their toroidal core. The resulting topology, supported by calculations, is a labyrinth-like pattern with two orthogonal periodic modulations that form an incommensurate polar crystal that provides a ferroelectric analogue to the recently discovered incommensurate spin crystals in ferromagnetic materials11-13. These findings further blur the border between emergent ferromagnetic and ferroelectric topologies, clearing the way for experimental realization of further electric counterparts of magnetic DMi-driven phases."
https://openalex.org/W4210865559,"Type A GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) receptors represent a diverse population in the mammalian brain, forming pentamers from combinations of α-, β-, γ-, δ-, ε-, ρ-, θ- and π-subunits1. αβ, α4βδ, α6βδ and α5βγ receptors favour extrasynaptic localization, and mediate an essential persistent (tonic) inhibitory conductance in many regions of the mammalian brain1,2. Mutations of these receptors in humans are linked to epilepsy and insomnia3,4. Altered extrasynaptic receptor function is implicated in insomnia, stroke and Angelman and Fragile X syndromes1,5, and drugs targeting these receptors are used to treat postpartum depression6. Tonic GABAergic responses are moderated to avoid excessive suppression of neuronal communication, and can exhibit high sensitivity to Zn2+ blockade, in contrast to synapse-preferring α1βγ, α2βγ and α3βγ receptor responses5,7-12. Here, to resolve these distinctive features, we determined structures of the predominantly extrasynaptic αβ GABAA receptor class. An inhibited state bound by both the lethal paralysing agent α-cobratoxin13 and Zn2+ was used in comparisons with GABA-Zn2+ and GABA-bound structures. Zn2+ nullifies the GABA response by non-competitively plugging the extracellular end of the pore to block chloride conductance. In the absence of Zn2+, the GABA signalling response initially follows the canonical route until it reaches the pore. In contrast to synaptic GABAA receptors, expansion of the midway pore activation gate is limited and it remains closed, reflecting the intrinsic low efficacy that characterizes the extrasynaptic receptor. Overall, this study explains distinct traits adopted by αβ receptors that adapt them to a role in tonic signalling."
https://openalex.org/W4210877337,"Ultracold assembly of diatomic molecules has enabled great advances in controlled chemistry, ultracold chemical physics and quantum simulation with molecules1-3. Extending the ultracold association to triatomic molecules will offer many new research opportunities and challenges in these fields. A possible approach is to form triatomic molecules in a mixture of ultracold atoms and diatomic molecules by using a Feshbach resonance between them4,5. Although ultracold atom-diatomic-molecule Feshbach resonances have been observed recently6,7, using these resonances to form triatomic molecules remains challenging. Here we report on evidence of the association of triatomic molecules near the Feshbach resonance between 23Na40K molecules in the rovibrational ground state and 40K atoms. We apply a radio-frequency pulse to drive the free-bound transition in ultracold mixtures of 23Na40K and 40K and monitor the loss of 23Na40K molecules. The association of triatomic molecules manifests itself as an additional loss feature in the radio-frequency spectra, which can be distinguished from the atomic loss feature. The observation that the distance between the association feature and the atomic transition changes with the magnetic field provides strong evidence for the formation of triatomic molecules. The binding energy of the triatomic molecules is estimated from the measurements. Our work contributes to the understanding of the complex ultracold atom-molecule Feshbach resonances and may open up an avenue towards the preparation and control of ultracold triatomic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W4210925827,"The atmospheres of a large proportion of white dwarf stars are polluted by heavy elements that are expected to sink out of visible layers on short timescales. This has been interpreted as a signature of ongoing accretion of debris from asteroids, comets, and giant planets. This scenario is supported by the detection of debris discs and transits of planetary fragments around some white dwarfs. However, photospheric metals are only indirect evidence for ongoing accretion, and the inferred accretion rates and parent body compositions heavily depend on models of diffusion and mixing processes within the white dwarf atmosphere. Here we report a 4.4$\sigma$ detection of X-rays from a polluted white dwarf, G29$-$38, using a 106 ks exposure with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, demonstrating directly that the star is currently accreting. From the measured X-ray luminosity, we find an instantaneous accretion rate of $\dot{M_{\rm X}}=1.63^{+1.29}_{-0.40}\times 10^{9}\mathrm{\,g\,s^{-1}}$. This is the first direct measurement of the accretion rate onto the white dwarf, which is independent of stellar atmosphere models. This rate exceeds estimates based on past studies of the photospheric abundances by more than a factor two, and implies that convective overshoot has to be accounted for in modelling the spectra of debris-accreting white dwarfs. We measure a low plasma temperature of $kT=0.5\pm0.2\,\mathrm{keV}$, corroborating the predicted bombardment solution for white dwarfs accreting at low accretion rates. Offering a new method for studying evolved planetary systems, these observations provide the opportunity to independently measure the instantaneous accretion rate of planetary material, and therefore investigate the timescale of accretion onto white dwarfs, and the evolution and replenishment of debris disks."

Here, we showed that LPS can activate suprarenal and celiac ganglia (SrG-CG) neurons and upregulate NPY expression in rats. Single-cell sequencing analysis revealed that knockdown of the NPY gene in SrG-CG altered the proliferation and activation of splenic lymphocytes. In a neuron and splenocyte coculture system and in vivo experiments, neuronal NPY in SrG-CG attenuated the splenic immune response. Notably, we demonstrated that neuronal NPF in Drosophila exerted a conservative immunomodulatory effect. Moreover, numerous SNPs in NPY and its receptors were significantly associated with human autoimmune diseases, which was further supported by the autoimmune disease patients and mouse model experiments. Together, we demonstrated that NPY is an ancient language for nervous-immune system crosstalk and might be utilized to alleviate inflammatory storms during infection and to modulate immune balance in autoimmune diseases."

https://openalex.org/W4211066528,"Exosomes, key mediators of cell-cell communication, derived from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exhibit detrimental effects. Exercise improves endothelial function in part via the secretion of exosomes into circulation. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) is a major secretory copper (Cu) antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of O2•- to H2 O2 whose activity requires the Cu transporter ATP7A. However, the role of SOD3 in exercise-induced angiogenic effects of circulating plasma exosomes on endothelial cells (ECs) in T2DM remains unknown. Here, we show that both SOD3 and ATP7A proteins were present in plasma exosomes in mice, which was significantly increased after two weeks of volunteer wheel exercise. A single bout of exercise in humans also showed a significant increase in SOD3 and ATP7A protein expression in plasma exosomes. Plasma exosomes from T2DM mice significantly reduced angiogenic responses in human ECs or mouse skin wound healing models, which was associated with a decrease in ATP7A, but not SOD3 expression in exosomes. Exercise training in T2DM mice restored the angiogenic effects of T2DM exosomes in ECs by increasing ATP7A in exosomes, which was not observed in exercised T2DM/SOD3-/- mice. Furthermore, exosomes overexpressing SOD3 significantly enhanced angiogenesis in ECs by increasing local H2 O2 levels in a heparin-binding domain-dependent manner as well as restored defective wound healing and angiogenesis in T2DM or SOD3-/- mice. In conclusion, exercise improves the angiogenic potential of circulating exosomes in T2DM in a SOD3-dependent manner. Exosomal SOD3 may provide an exercise mimetic therapy that supports neovascularization and wound repair in cardiometabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W4225884035,"Governments around the world are seeking to slow the spread of Covid-19 by implementing measures that encourage, or mandate, changes in people's behaviour. These changes include the wearing of face masks, social distancing, and testing and self-isolating when unwell. The success of these measures depends on the commitment of individuals to change their behaviour accordingly. Understanding and predicting the motivation of individuals to change their behaviour is therefore critical in assessing the likely effectiveness of these measures in slowing the spread of the virus. In this paper we draw on a novel framework, the I3 Compliance Response Framework, to understand and predict the motivation of residents in Auckland, New Zealand, to comply with measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The Framework is based on two concepts. The first uses the involvement construct to predict the motivation of individuals to comply. The second separates the influence of the policy measure from the influence of the policy outcome on the motivation of individuals to comply. In short, the Framework differentiates between the strength of individuals' motivation and their beliefs about the advantages and disadvantages of policy outcomes and policy measures. We found this differentiation was useful in predicting an individual's possible behavioural responses to a measure and discuss how it could assist government agencies to develop strategies to enhance compliance."
https://openalex.org/W4210935716,"Data analysis in real life often relies mainly on statistical probability distributions. However, data arising from different fields such as environmental, financial, biomedical sciences and other areas may not fit the classical distributions. Therefore, the need arises for developing new distributions that would capture high degree of skewness and kurtosis and enhance the goodness-of-fit in empirical distribution. In this paper, we introduce a novel family of distributions which can extend some popular classes of distributions to include different new versions of the baseline distributions. The proposed family of distributions is referred as the Marshall-Olkin Weibull generated family. The proposed family of distributions is a combination of Marshall-Olkin transformation and the Weibull generated family. Two special members of the proposed family are investigated. A variety of shapes for the densities and hazard rate are presented of the considered sub-models. Some of the main mathematical properties of this family are derived. The estimation for the parameters is obtained via the maximum likelihood method. Moreover, the performance of the estimators for the considered members is examined through simulation studies in terms of bias and root mean square error. Besides, based on the new generated family, the log Marshall-Olkin Weibull-Weibull regression model for censored data is proposed. Finally, COVID-19 data and three lifetime data sets are used to demonstrate the importance of the newly proposed family. Through such an applications, it is shown that this family of distributions provides a better fit when compared with other competitive distributions."
https://openalex.org/W4210841404,"In vertebrates, stimulus-independent activity accompanies neural circuit maturation throughout the developing brain1,2. The recent discovery of similar activity in the developing Drosophila central nervous system suggests that developmental activity is fundamental to the assembly of complex brains3. How such activity is coordinated across disparate brain regions to influence synaptic development at the level of defined cell types is not well understood. Here we show that neurons expressing the cation channel transient receptor potential gamma (Trpγ) relay and pattern developmental activity throughout the Drosophila brain. In trpγ mutants, activity is attenuated globally, and both patterns of activity and synapse structure are altered in a cell-type-specific manner. Less than 2% of the neurons in the brain express Trpγ. These neurons arborize throughout the brain, and silencing or activating them leads to loss or gain of brain-wide activity. Together, these results indicate that this small population of neurons coordinates brain-wide developmental activity. We propose that stereotyped patterns of developmental activity are driven by a discrete, genetically specified network to instruct neural circuit assembly at the level of individual cells and synapses.

https://openalex.org/W4210856148,"Social media has surrounded every area of life, and social media platforms have become indispensable for today's communication. Many journals use social media actively to promote and disseminate new articles. Its use to share the articles contributes many benefits, such as reaching more people and spreading information faster. However, there is no consensus in the studies that to evaluate between tweeted and non-tweeted papers regarding their citation numbers. Therefore, it was aimed to show the effect of social media on the citations of articles in the top ten communication-based journals. For this purpose, this work evaluated original articles published in the top 10 communication journals in 2018. The top 10 communication-based journals were chosen based on SCImago Journal & Country Rank (cited in 2019). Afterward, it was recorded the traditional citation numbers (Google Scholar and Thompson-Reuters Web of Science) and social media exposure of the articles in January 2021 (nearly three years after the articles' publication date). It was assumed that this period would allow the impact of the published articles (the citations and Twitter mentions) to be fully observed. Based on this assessment, a positive correlation between exposure to social media and article citations was observed in this study."
https://openalex.org/W4210857703,"Molecular reprogramming of stromal microarchitecture by tumour-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) is proposed to favour pre-metastatic niche formation. We elucidated the role of extravesicular tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1EV) in pro-invasive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling of the liver microenvironment to aid tumour progression in colorectal cancer (CRC). Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed a high expression of stromal TIMP1 in the invasion front that was associated with poor progression-free survival in patients with colorectal liver metastases. Molecular analysis identified TIMP1EV enrichment in CRC-EVs as a major factor in the induction of TIMP1 upregulation in recipient fibroblasts. Mechanistically, we proved that EV-mediated TIMP1 upregulation in recipient fibroblasts induced ECM remodelling. This effect was recapitulated by human serum-derived EVs providing strong evidence that CRC release active EVs into the blood circulation of patients for the horizontal transfer of malignant traits to recipient cells. Moreover, EV-associated TIMP1 binds to HSP90AA, a heat-shock protein, and the inhibition of HSP90AA on human-derived serum EVs attenuates TIMP1EV-mediated ECM remodelling, rendering EV-associated TIMP1 a potential therapeutic target. Eventually, in accordance with REMARK guidelines, we demonstrated in three independent cohorts that EV-bound TIMP1 is a robust circulating biomarker for a non-invasive, preoperative risk stratification in patients with colorectal liver metastases."
https://openalex.org/W4210873423,"Tight regulation of mRNA isoform expression is essential for neuronal development, maintenance, and function; however, the repertoire of proteins that govern isoform composition and abundance remains incomplete. Here, we show that the RNA kinase CLP1 regulates mRNA isoform expression through suppression of proximal cleavage and polyadenylation. We found that human stem-cell-derived motor neurons without CLP1 or with the disease-associated CLP1 p.R140H variant had distinct patterns of RNA-polymerase-II-associated cleavage and polyadenylation complex proteins that correlated with polyadenylation site usage. These changes resulted in imbalanced mRNA isoform expression of long genes important for neuronal function that were recapitulated in vivo. Strikingly, we observed the same pattern of reduced mRNA isoform diversity in 3' end sequencing data from brain tissues of patients with neurodegenerative disease. Together, our results identify a previously uncharacterized role for CLP1 in mRNA 3' end formation and reveal an mRNA misprocessing signature in neurodegeneration that may suggest a common mechanism of disease."
https://openalex.org/W4211060063,"Sustained anti-angiogenesis therapy increases the level of tumor hypoxia, leading to increased expression of HIF-1a, thereby contributing to the resistance to anti-angiogenesis therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we report that phenazine biosynthesis-like domain-containing protein (PBLD) inhibits hypoxia-induced angiogenesis via ERK/HIF-1a/VEGF axis in HCC cells. Bioinformatic analysis of the TCGA database and clinical samples validation also identify a negative correlation between PBLD and angiogenesis-related genes expression including HIF-1a. Apart from the downregulation of HIF-1a/VEGF expression in HCC cells, PBLD also blocks VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) on endothelial cells via HCC-derived exosomal miR-940. PBLD also activates TCF4 transcriptional promotion effects on miR-940 by directly interacting with it. Together, PBLD exerts an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis not only via blocking the VEGFR2 expression in endothelial cells, but also through downregulating HIF-1a-induced VEGF expression and secretion in HCC cells. These explorations may provide a theoretical basis for exploring new targets and strategies to overcome resistance to anti-angiogenesis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4210922049,"Background The programme death ligand1 and its receptor (PD-1/PD-L1) interaction is a target for blockage by immunotherapy that uses the body’s own immune system. Some studies show that PD-L1 expressing tumours are also more aggressive with poor prognosis. This study evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 in uterine cervical carcinomas. Women with cervical cancer would benefit from its use as a marker in therapy and prognosis. Methods Hospital-based cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted. The study materials included 183 archived formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks with histological diagnosis of cervical carcinoma diagnosed in our facility within a five-year period (January 2012 and December 2016) that met the study criteria. Data were extracted from records in the Department and immunohistochemistry was done using polyclonal antibodies to PD-L1 (GTX104763, Genetex). Obtained data were analysed using SPSS version 23. P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Results A hundred and eighty-three cases of cervical cancer were studied. PD-L1 was positive in 57.4% of all cases. The diffuse pattern of staining was the major pattern accounting for 88.5% of positive cases. Poorly differentiated cervical carcinomas are less likely to express PD-L1. Within the histologic types, the squamous cell carcinomas expressed PD-L1 in 58.7%, and 50% of adenocarcinomas were positive. PD-L1 was not expressed in all cases of adenoid cystic carcinomas and basaloid squamous cell carcinomas. Conclusion A significant population of cervical carcinoma expresses PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry. PD-L1 prevalence is lower amongst the poorly differentiated cancers compared to other grades."

https://openalex.org/W4210886202,"Redroot pigweed ( Amaranthus retroflexus L.) and slender amaranth ( Amaranthus viridis L.) are becoming problematic weeds in summer crops, including cotton in Australia. A series of laboratory and field experiments were performed to examine the germination ecology, and seed persistence of two populations of A . retroflexus and A . viridis collected from the Goondiwindi and Gatton regions of Australia. Both populations of A . retroflexus and A . viridis behaved similarly to different environmental conditions. Initial dormancy was observed in fresh seeds of both species; however, germination reached maximum after an after-ripening period of two months at room temperature. Light was not a mandatory prerequisite for germination of both species as they could germinate under complete darkness. Although both species showed very low germination at the alternating day/night temperature of 15/5 C, these species germinated more than 40% between ranges of 25/15 C to 35/25 C. Maximum germination of A . retroflexus (93%) and A . viridis (86%) was observed at 35/25 C and 30/20, respectively. Germination of A . retroflexus and A . viridis was completely inhibited at osmotic potentials of -1.0 and -0.6 MPa, respectively. No germination was observed in both species at the sodium chloride concentration of 200 mM. A . retroflexus seedling emergence (87%) was maximum from the seeds buried at 1 cm while the maximum germination of A . viridis (72%) was observed at the soil surface. No seedling emergence was observed from a burial depth of 8 cm for both species. In both species, seed persistence increased with increasing burial depth. At 24 months after seed placement, seed depletion ranged from 75% (10 cm depth) to 94% (soil surface) for A . retroflexus , and ranged from 79% to 94% for A . viridis , respectively. Information gained from this study will contribute to an integrated control programs for A . retroflexu s and A . viridis ."
https://openalex.org/W4210899872,"Abstract Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, and its ligand is collagen. Previous studies demonstrated that DDR1 is highly expressed in many tumors. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains obscure. In this study, we found that DDR1 was upregulated in HCC tissues, and the expression of DDR1 in TNM stage II-IV was higher than that in TNM stage I in HCC tissues, and high DDR1 expression was associated with poor prognosis. Gene expression analysis showed that DDR1 target genes were functionally involved in HCC metastasis. DDR1 positively regulated the migration and invasion of HCC cells and promoted lung metastasis. Human Phospho-Kinase Array showed that DDR1 activated ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. Mechanically, DDR1 interacted with ARF6 and activated ARF6 through recruiting PSD4. The kinase activity of DDR1 was required for ARF6 activation and its role in metastasis. High expression of PSD4 was associated with poor prognosis in HCC. In summary, our findings indicate that DDR1 promotes HCC metastasis through collagen induced DDR1 signaling mediated PSD4/ARF6 signaling, suggesting that DDR1 and ARF6 may serve as novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for metastatic HCC."

https://openalex.org/W4210922117,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with ""Triple Whammy"" drug therapy consisting of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, diuretics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been reported. There have been no reports investigating ""Triple Whammy"" drug therapy and the time to AKI onset using adverse drug events report databases. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the time to AKI onset and treatment with ""Triple Whammy"" drug therapy. We analyzed AKI cases registered in the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. The data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier approach, generalized Wilcoxon tests, and Weibull distribution. AKI was reported in 18,415 cases, of which 7,466 cases used Triple Whammy drugs. All combinations of Triple Whammy drugs were associated with significantly higher odds ratios for reporting AKI. In Weibull analysis, AKI onset was early for most combination patterns of Triple Whammy drugs. The Kaplan-Meier approach showed that the treatment duration to AKI onset was much shorter in cases using NSAIDs; median onsets, 8 days for triple combination, 7 days for NSAIDs added to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, 9 days for NSAIDs added to diuretics, 6 days for diuretics added to NSAIDs, and 9 days for NSAIDs alone. AKI associated with Triple Whammy drugs is likely to occur in the early stages of treatment, especially with concomitant NSAIDs. Patients should be monitored for the occurrence of AKI within the first 2 weeks."
https://openalex.org/W4210855954,"Due to the limited storage space of spacecraft and downlink bandwidth in the data delivery during planetary exploration, an efficient way for image compression onboard is essential to reduce the volume of acquired data. Applicable for planetary images, this study proposes a perceptual adaptive quantization technique based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). This technique is used for bitrate reduction while maintaining the subjective visual quality. The proposed algorithm adaptively determines the Coding Tree Unit (CTU) level Quantization Parameter (QP) values in HEVC intra-coding using the high-level features extracted by CNN. A modified model based on the residual network is exploited to extract the saliency map for a given image automatically. Furthermore, based on the saliency map, a CTU level QP adjustment technique combining global saliency contrast and local saliency perception is exploited to realize a flexible and adaptive bit allocation. Several quantitative performance metrics that efficiently correlate with human perception are used for evaluating image quality. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm achieves better visual quality along with a maximum of 7.17% reduction in the bitrate as compared to the standard HEVC coding."
https://openalex.org/W4210918731,"So far, no comprehensive studies have been performed to assess burden and determinants of anemia in Iran. In the present study, we aimed to answer this query using the data obtained from the Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN (PERSIAN).In this cross-sectional study, we included 161,686 adult participants (aged 35 years and older) from 16 provinces of Iran. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration of <13 g/dL in males and <12 g/dL in females. To evaluate the association between anemia and different factors, we used the multivariable Poisson regression analysis with robust variance by applying adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).Of the total number of subjects, 72,387 (44.77%) were male and others were female. Mean age was 49.39±9.15 years old. The overall age- and sex-standardized prevalence of anemia was 8.83% (95% CI: 8.70-8.96%) in the included population. The highest and the lowest age- and sex-standardized prevalence of anemia pertained to Hormozgan (37.41%, 95% CI: 35.97-38.85%) and Kurdistan (4.57%, 95% CI: 3.87-5.27%) provinces, respectively. Being female (PR = 2.97), rural residence (PR = 1.24), being retired (PR = 1.53) and housewife (PR = 1.11), third and fourth wealth status quartiles (PR = 1.09 and PR = 1.11, respectively), being underweight (PR = 1.49), drug user (PR = 1.35), inadequate sleep (PR = 1.16), poor physical activity (PR = 1.15), diabetes (PR = 1.09), renal failure (PR = 2.24), and cancer (PR = 1.35) were associated with increased risk of anemia. On the other hand, illiteracy (PR = 0.79) and abdominal obesity (PR = 0.77) decreased the risk of anemia.According to the results, a variable prevalence of anemia was observed across the included provinces. We tried to provide an informative report on anemia prevalence for health professionals and authorities to take measures for identification and management of the cases of anemia in high-prevalence areas."
https://openalex.org/W4210823873,"Recent stereo matching methods, especially end-to-end deep stereo matching networks, have achieved remarkable performance in the fields of autonomous driving and depth sensing. However, state-of-the-art stereo algorithms, even with the deep neural network framework, still have difficulties at finding correct correspondences in near-range regions and object edge cues. To reinforce the precision of disparity prediction, in the present study, we propose a parallax attention stereo matching algorithm based on the improved group-wise correlation stereo network to learn the disparity content from a stereo correspondence, and it supports end-to-end predictions of both disparity map and edge map. Particular, we advocate for a parallax attention module in three-dimensional (disparity, height and width) level, which structure ensures high-precision estimation by improving feature expression in near-range regions. This is critical for computer vision tasks and can be utilized in several existing models to enhance their performance. Moreover, in order to making full use of the edge information learned by two-dimensional feature extraction network, we propose a novel edge detection branch and multi-featured integration cost volume. It is demonstrated that based on our model, edge detection project is conducive to improve the accuracy of disparity estimation. Our method achieves better results than previous works on both Scene Flow and KITTI datasets."
