We report that IP of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with two cycles of 30-min ischemia/reoxygenation (I/R) supported their survival under subsequent longer exposure to anoxia and following engraftment in the infarcted heart. IP significantly reduced apoptosis in MSCs through activation of Akt (Ser473) and ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and nuclear translocation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). We observed concomitant induction of miR-210 in the preconditioned MSCs (PCMSCs). Inhibition of HIF-1α or of miR-210 abrogated the cytoprotective effects of preconditioning. Extrapolation of these data to in vivo studies in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction predominantly improved stem cell survival after engraftment with a role for miR-210. Notably, multiple I/R cycles more effectively regulated the miR-210 and hence promoted MSC survival compared with single-cycle hypoxia of an equal duration. Real time PCR array for rat apoptotic genes, computational target gene analyses, and luciferase reporter assay identified FLICE-associated huge protein (FLASH)/caspase-8-associated protein-2 (Casp8ap2) in PCMSCs as the target gene of miR-210. Induction of FLASH/CASP8AP2 in miR-210 knocked-down PCMSCs resulted in increased cell apoptosis. Taken together, these data demonstrated that cytoprotection afforded by IP was regulated by miR-210 induction via FLASH/Casp8ap2 suppression. These results highlighted that IP by multiple short episodes of I/R is a novel strategy to promote stem cell survival.

Recent studies have successfully established a functional link between a discrete group of hypoxia-regulated miRs and cell survival signaling (i.e. miR-23, -24, -26, -27, -103, -107, -181, -210, and -213) (3.Foshay K.M.

Hypoxia-regulated miRs are induced under low oxygen tension with a critical participation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) (6.Cheng A.M. Byrom M.W. Shelton J. Ford L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, most studies have focused on cancer cells as a model to study the mechanistic participation of hypoxia-regulated miRs in their endeavor to escape death in the ischemic microenvironment of tumors. Fasanaro et al. (7.Fasanaro P. D'Alessandra Y. Di Stefano V. Melchionna R. Romani S. Pompilio G. Capogrossi M.C. Martelli F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15878-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) have shown recently that miR-210 was a crucial element of endothelial cell functioning in response to hypoxia and considerably influenced their migration, capillary network formation, and differentiation capability. Induction of miR-210 occurred as early as 4 h after exposure to hypoxia and persisted for 24 h above base-line levels. Notably, miR-210 inhibition in their experiments was associated with an increase in apoptosis of endothelial cells. Stem cells have a different biology than cancer cells and may differ in their response to hypoxia. Moreover, little is known about the role of hypoxia-regulated miRs during ischemic preconditioning (IP) of stem cells by multiple short episodes of ischemia/reoxygenation (I/R). microRNA caspase-8-associated protein-2 extracellular signal-regulated kinase hypoxia-inducible factor-1α ischemic preconditioning ischemia/reoxygenation lactate dehydrogenase mesenchymal stem cell preconditioned MSC nonpreconditioned MSC phosphate-buffered saline scramble small interfering RNA transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling untranslated region. IP is one of the most powerful cytoprotective stimuli (8.Gross E.R. Gross G.J. Drug Discov. Today Dis. Mech. 2007; 4: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9.Hausenloy D.J. Yellon D.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 70: 240-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The classical methodology of IP was modified for preconditioning of stem cells and involved their single and long term exposure to hypoxia to elevate their survival (10.Hu X. Yu S.P. Fraser J.L. Lu Z. Ogle M.E. Wang J.A. Wei L. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 2008; 135: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the effectiveness of intermittent hypoxia in cellular protection was shown to be a stimulus-dependent transcriptional activity of HIF-1α (11.Yuan G. Adhikary G. McCormick A.A. Holcroft J.J. Kumar G.K. Prabhakar N.R. J. Physiol. 2004; 557: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Despite differences in the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α, these studies elucidated a pivotal role for HIF-1α in cytoprotection (12.Nanduri J. Yuan G. Kumar G.K. Semenza G.L. Prabhakar N.R. Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2008; 164: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the cytoprotective effects of multiple cycles of brief I/R involved hypoxia-regulated miRs expression downstream of HIF-1α. In this study, we showed that IP-induced miR-210 plays a key role in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) survival, and we identify caspase-8-associated protein-2 (Casp8ap2) as a functional target of miR-210. In accordance with our in vitro data, we also demonstrated that preconditioned MSCs (PCMSCs) survived better compared with nonpreconditioned MSCs (non-PCMSCs), and two cycles of I/R were more effective in cytoprotection compared with one cycle of I/R. Bone marrow-derived MSCs were purified from young male Fischer-344 rats by flushing the cavity of femurs as described previously (13.Shujia J. Haider H.K. Idris N.M. Lu G. Ashraf M. Cardiovasc, Res. 2008; 77: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Native MSCs were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/60-mm cell culture dish. The cells were starved overnight for serum and glucose before preconditioning. For IP, the cells were subjected to repeated cycles of anoxia (10 or 30 min) with intermittent reoxygenation (10 min) for specific cycles (one to three cycles) in an anoxic chamber (Forma-1025 Anaerobic System). At the end of the required number of cycles, the cells were either harvested for molecular studies or were subjected to anoxia for 6 h for survival studies in vitro. Cell survival was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay using conditioned medium and transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) of the cells from each treatment group. Intracellular LDH leakage was measured using an LDH Assay Kit (Diagnostic Chemicals) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Extraction of miRs was carried out using a mirVanaTM miR isolation kit and detected by using a mirVanaTM quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR miRNA detection kit (Ambion). Specific miRNA primers from Ambion were used during qRT-PCR according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Predesigned HIF-1α siRNA and scramble siRNA (Sc) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and Casp8ap2 siRNA was from Ambion. Transient transfection of siRNA was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. All transfections were carried out in triplicate. MSCs were lysed in lysis buffer, pH 7.4 (50 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl), 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation of MSCs was performed using an NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protein samples (40 μg) were electrophoresed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroimmunoblotted as described (14.Haider H.K. Jiang S. Idris N.M. Ashraf M. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The specific antibodies used for the detection of antigens of interest are listed in supplemental Table I. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL according to instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). For quantification, the numbers of TUNEL+ cells were counted in at least five randomly selected high power fields (magnification, ×200) with three independent samples. To knock down miR-210, transfection was performed with anti-miR-210 (miR inhibitor; Ambion) and siPORTTM NeoFxTM transfection agent (NeoFx; Ambion) according to the instructions of the manufacturer (6.Cheng A.M. Byrom M.W. Shelton J. Ford L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of NeoFx was diluted with 100 μl of Opti-MEM for each sample and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Then, we diluted anti-miR inhibitor with 100 μl of Opti-MEM at the final concentration of 30 nm and added it to the diluted NeoFx mixture. After incubation for another 10 min, the transfection mixture was added to 2.3 ml of cell suspension (3 × 105 cells). Cell suspension containing transfection mixture was plated into a 6-well plate, and the assay was performed at 72 h after incubation. Precursor miR-210 expression clone was constructed in a feline immunodeficiency virus-based lentiviral vector system (pEZX-miR-210) and luciferase reporter construct containing the 3′-UTR of Casp8ap2 were designed to encompass the miR-210 binding sites (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD). For transfection, MSCs were plated in triplicate into 24-well plates and cotransfected with 0.8 μg of pEZX-miR-210 (or pEZX-miR-scramble) and reporter construct by using the Lipofectamine 2000TM (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was normalized on the basis of Renilla luciferase activity. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured by using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.05% Triton X-100, and rinsed sequentially in PBS, 50 mm NH4Cl, and PBS. The cells were then incubated with a blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) and subsequently with FLASH antibody (M-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by a rinse in PBS and bovine serum albumin before being incubated with the appropriate species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 546. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Cells were examined by fluorescence microscope (BX41; Olympus, Japan). In vivo experiments were performed in a rat heart model of acute myocardial infarction using young female Fischer-344 rats as described earlier (14.Haider H.K. Jiang S. Idris N.M. Ashraf M. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (24 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg body weight, respectively). After endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation using Harvard Apparatus Rodent Ventilator (model 683), the heart was exposed by left-sided minimal thoracotomy. The left anterior descending coronary artery was permanently ligated with Prolene 6.0 sutures. Immediately after ligation (n = 4 animals/group), 70 μl of basal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without cells (group 1) or containing 1 × 106 non-PCMSCs (group 2) or PCMSCs (group 3, IP one cycle, 30 min; and group 4, IP two cycles, 30 min) were injected intramyocardially at multiple sites in and around the infarct zone. The chest was closed, and the animals were allowed to recover. During postoperative care, Buprenex (0.1 mg/kg b.i.d) was administered for 24 h to alleviate pain. For postmortem studies, the animals were killed using an overdose of sodium pentobarbitol 4 days after cell engraftment. The heart tissue was collected, washed extensively with PBS to remove blood traces, and used for molecular studies. Our study conformed to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, University of Cincinnati. The cell and myocardial specimens from various treatment groups of animals on day 4 after cell transplantation were used for molecular studies by PCR (15.Niagara M.I. Haider H.K. Jiang S. Ashraf M. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For myocardial tissue, the specimens were snap-frozen and powdered. DNA purification was performed using Genomic DNA Isolation kit (Qiagen), and the concentration of the purified DNA was determined by spectrophotometry. The primer sequences for sry gene and actin used for PCR were: sry gene, forward 5′-GAGGCACAAGTTGGCTCAACA-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCCTGCAAAAAGGGCCTTT-3′; actin, forward 5′-AGCCATGTACGTAGCCATCC-3′ and reverse 5′- CTCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAA-3′. Real-time PCR-based 84-gene array RT ProfilerTM PCR Array (SA Biosciences) for rat apoptosis genes and qPCR for Casp8ap2 using primers purchased from SA Biosciences were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparison between two mean values was evaluated by an unpaired Student's two-tailed t test and between three or more groups was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc analysis. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. MSCs preconditioned by treatment with multiple I/R cycles of 10 or 30 min (one to three cycles) showed a significant level of protection upon subsequent exposure to 6 h of anoxia. LDH release (an indicator of cellular injury) was significantly reduced in PCMSCs both in 10-min and 30-min treatment compared with non-PCMSCs (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, two cycles of I/R were more cytoprotective compared with single hypoxic exposure. More so, two cycles of I/R were also more cytoprotective compared with three cycles of hypoxic exposure (Fig. 1A). Phase contrast microscopy revealed hypercontracted morphology of non-PCMSCs whereas IP for 30 min (one or two cycles) prevented these morphological changes (Fig. 1B). The number of TUNEL+ cells was markedly reduced in PCMSCs with two cycles of I/R under 6 h of anoxia (Fig. 1, C1 and C2), which was consistent with the LDH release data. We also observed increased nuclear translocation of HIF-1α in PCMSC (Fig. 1D). A higher phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) together with antiapoptotic protein Bcl.xL was observed in PCMSC (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. IA). Again, IP with three cycles of 30-min I/R was less effective for these molecular changes and therefore was found to be less efficient in terms of cytoprotection thereby suggesting that too many cycles of I/R were detrimental for cells (supplemental Fig. IB). Pretreatment of PCMSCs with phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt inhibitor (wortmannin) effectively blocked these molecular events with a concomitant reduction in cell survival upon exposure to 6 h of anoxia (supplemental Fig. I, C–E). We observed marked elevation of miR-210 in PCMSCs compared with non-PCMSCs (supplemental Fig. IF). To study the mechanistic participation of miR-210 in cytoprotection, miR-210 expression was successfully abrogated in the PCMSCs by using miR-210-specific inhibitor (Fig. 1F). Using miR-107 inhibitor as a control, we observed that inhibitors of miR-107 and miR-210 specifically abrogated their respective target without showing any nonspecific interference (Fig. 1F). We observed that abrogation of miR-210 resulted in significantly higher apoptosis of these cells under 6 h of anoxia compared with controls (Fig. 1G and supplemental Fig. IIA). Pretreatment of MSCs with 50 μm wortmannin reduced miR-210 expression in PCMSCs (supplemental Fig. IIB). Next, we investigated a link between up-regulated expression of HIF-1α and miR-210 in PCMSCs. We successfully abrogated HIF-1α in MSCs using specific siRNA. A subsequent IP failed to induce HIF-1α in these cells with a concomitant loss of miR-210 induction (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, phase contrast microscopy revealed an obvious loss of morphological integrity (Fig. 2C). These molecular events and morphological changes led to an associated decreased survival of PCMSCs upon exposure to 6 h of anoxia compared with the controls (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. III). Native MSCs without siRNA transfection and Sc siRNA transfected MSCs were used as controls. The observed in vitro relationship between preconditioning and improved survival of PCMSCs under anoxia was extrapolated in vivo using a female rat heart model of acute myocardial infarction. PCR for sry gene in the infarcted rat heart (n = 4 animals/group) on day 4 showed higher survival of the transplanted cells preconditioned by two 30-min cycles IP in group 4 (p < 0.05 with non-PCMSCs transplanted group 2 and one 30-min cycle PCMSCs in group 3) (Fig. 2E). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-injected female animals hearts (group 1) were negative for sry gene expression. Improved survival of donor cells was accompanied by higher miR-210 levels in groups 3 and 4 (Fig. 2F). Of greater interest was the markedly changed expression level of miR-210 with non-PCMSC engraftment (group-2) compared with group 1, which showed that transplantation of native MSCs altered miR-210 levels in the infarcted heart. Additionally, higher survival of PCMSCs in groups and group 4 (with elevated miR-210) compared with group 2 implies a major contribution of miR-210 in cytoprotection after engraftment in accordance with our in vitro results. Real time PCR-based array for rat apoptotic genes analysis showed that Casp8ap2, tumor necrosis factor receptor super family-1a, DNA fragmentation factor-β, and lymphotoxin-A had more than 2-fold up-regulated expression in miR-210 knock-down MSCs compared with the control cells (supplemental Table II). To investigate further the biological relevance of miR-210 up-regulation in prosurvival signaling in PCMSCs, we examined three databases (miRANDA, Sanger MirBase, and Targetscan algorithms) to search for the potential targets of miR-210. Our in silico search resulted in a consensus putative target site of miR-210 relevant to apoptosis in the 3′-UTR of Casp8ap2 mRNAs (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, tumor necrosis factor receptor super family-1a, DNA fragmentation factor-β, and lymphotoxin-A showed poor alignment as target genes for miR-210. The role of Casp8ap2 as a target gene of miR-210 was confirmed by luciferase activity assay. Cotransfection of a precursor miR-210 expression vector (pEZX-miR-210) with the vector containing 3′-UTR of the Casp8ap2 gene led to reduced luciferase activity compared with cotransfection with the miR-Sc vector (pEZX-miR-Sc), indicating that forced expression of miR-210 can down-regulate Casp8ap2 expression via targeting the 3′-UTR of this gene (Fig. 3B). CASP8AP2 in humans is FLASH homolog in mouse and has been identified for interaction with the death-effector domain of caspase-8 with a regulatory role in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Fluorescence immunocytochemistry using FLASH/ CASP8AP2-specific antibody revealed nuclear localization of FLASH/CASP8AP2 in native MSCs cultured under normoxia as was evident from colocalization of red fluorescence with blue DAPI staining (white arrows, Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, 6-h anoxic culture conditions triggered cytoplasmic translocation of FLASH/CASP8AP2 from the nucleus as indicated by the lack of red fluorescence in the nuclei. Moreover, the percentage of FLASH/CASP8AP2-positive cells with nuclear localization was higher (p < 0.01), and cytoplasmic localization was lower (p < 0.01) compared with the cells cultured under 6 h of anoxia. These results clearly indicated that FLASH/CASP8AP2 having nuclear localization in native cells was translocated into the cytoplasm under anoxia. Additionally, we also observed that FLASH/CASP8AP2 showed a concomitant up-regulated expression in non-PCMSCs exposed to anoxia that was abrogated by preconditioning of the cells (Fig. 3D). Because CASP8AP2 has a pivotal role in apoptosis, we validated this predicted gene target for its functional involvement in PCMSC survival under anoxia. IP of MSCs with two cycles of I/R was more effective in abrogation FLASH/CASP8AP2 under 6 h of anoxia (two cycles of I/R versus one cycle of I/R; p < 0.01). However, abrogation of miR-210 in PCMSCs significantly increased Casp8ap2 expression as determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 4A) and confirmed by real time PCR (supplemental Fig. IVA). LDH release assay showed that induction of Casp8ap2 was associated with increased death of PCMSCs with miR-210 knock down compared with the Sc siRNA-treated or mock-treated PCMSCs (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data showed that Casp8ap2 gene induction was regulated downstream of miR-210 in PCMSCs. Finally, we investigated the role of Casp8ap2 in survival of PCMSCs and non-PCMSCs under anoxia. Casp8ap2 was successfully abrogated in MSCs by specific RNA interference using Sc siRNA transfection as a control (Fig. 4C). Abrogation of Casp8ap2 significantly improved survival of both PCMSCs and non-PCMSCs under anoxia, although the cytoprotective effects of such molecular event were more pronounced in non-PCMSCs (Fig. 4D and supplemental Fig. IVB). These results clearly showed that FLASH/Casp8ap2 plays an important role in apoptosis as a downstream target of hypoxia-induced miR-210 during IP of MSCs. We have successfully extrapolated the classical concept of IP using multiple episodes of sublethal I/R to precondition MSCs and improve their survival upon longer exposure to anoxia. Moreover, we have also accounted for a mechanistic involvement of HIF-1α and miR-210 in IP-induced cytoprotection of MSCs. We observed that IP of MSCs with multiple cycles of brief I/R episodes was more effective in promoting stem cell survival compared with single exposure to anoxia of equivalent time duration. Moreover, we also observed that the cytoprotective effects of IP under anoxia were mediated by HIF-1α induction and its dependent expression of miR-210. Various strategies have been adopted to prevent massive death of the donor cells in the infarcted heart after engraftment (16.Haider H.K. Ashraf M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2008; 45: 554-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the effectiveness of our novel strategy of preconditioning of stem cells by treatment with preconditioning mimetics or growth factors that effectively improved stem cell survival (15.Niagara M.I. Haider H.K. Jiang S. Ashraf M. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 17.Lu G. Haider H.K. Jiang S. Ashraf M. Circulation. 2009; 119: 2587-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We report here that preconditioning of stem cells can be achieved by exposure of the cells to multiple short episodes of intermittent I/R. This involves induction of HIF-1α, which constitutes an integral part of the molecular response of a cell to hypoxia. Moreover, HIF-1α serves as a master regulator to orchestrate the expression of genes, which helps the cells to adapt to low oxygen tension (18.Dai Y. Xu M. Wang Y. Pasha Z. Li T. Ashraf M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2007; 42: 1036-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is translocated into the nucleus under hypoxia to form a functional complex (19.Semenza G.L. Sci. STKE. 2007; 2007: cm8Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). With better understanding of gene regulation by transcription factors with the participation of miRs (20.Hobert O. Science. 2008; 319: 1785-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), a novel relationship has been established between hypoxia and a select group of miRs of which miR-210 is considered a universal responder irrespective of the cell type (4.Kulshreshtha R. Davuluri R.V. Calin G.A. Ivan M. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 5.Kulshreshtha R. Ferracin M. Wojcik S.E. Garzon R. Alder H. Agosto-Perez F.J. Davuluri R. Liu C.G. Croce C.M. Negrini M. Calin G.A. Ivan M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Taking a cue from these studies, we elucidated miR-210 as a potent negative regulator of stem cell apoptosis during IP downstream of HIF-1α. As significantly higher levels of HIF-1α and miR-210 were observed in PCMSCs, which incidentally demonstrated better survival under lethal anoxia, abrogation of HIF-1α with specific RNAi abolished the IP-induced cytoprotection with a parallel reduction in miR-210. Likewise, transfection of MSCs with a miR-210-specific inhibitor abolished the IP-induced cytoprotection albeit without associated change in HIF-1α, thus suggesting the importance of miR-210 in antiapoptosis and HIF-1α as a regulator of miR-210 during IP. Engraftment of non-PCMSCs in group 2 insignificantly changed miR-210 compared with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-injected group 1 infarcted hearts. On the contrary, PCMSC-engrafted hearts in groups 3 and 4 had significantly higher levels of miR-210 compared with other groups (highest level in group 4). Interestingly, increased donor cell survival and lower TUNEL positivity were observed in association with miR-210 levels, which clearly demonstrated its critical role in cytoprotection of the transplanted cells. Our results are consistent with the findings that HIF-1α positively regulates miR-210, inhibition of which increased endothelial cell apoptosis (5.Kulshreshtha R. Ferracin M. Wojcik S.E. Garzon R. Alder H. Agosto-Perez F.J. Davuluri R. Liu C.G. Croce C.M. Negrini M. Calin G.A. Ivan M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Further studies are under way to elucidate whether the cytoprotective effects of IP can be accomplished by direct induction of miR-210. Additionally, it is highly likely the PCMSCs can serve as a source of miR-210 for delivery to the host cardiomyocytes for protection against ischemic injury. Based on our observations, we postulated that native MSCs engrafted in the infarcted heart, in response to the ischemic microenvironment, became a source of hypoxia-regulated miRs for the host myocytes. Previous studies have shown that miRs can translocate between adjacent cells (21.Skog J. Würdinger T. van Rijn S. Meijer D.H. Gainche L. Sena-Esteves M. Curry Jr., W.T. Carter B.S. Krichevsky A.M. Breakefield X.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1470-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). There is a strong possibility that hypoxia-regulated miRs from the transplanted MSCs can translocate into the myocytes to regulate cytoprotective gene expression and serve as one of the mechanisms underlying improved cardiac function after heart cell therapy. We also observed FLASH/Casp8ap2 as the effector gene that contributed in cytoprotection downstream of miR-210 activation. Our results showed that Casp8ap2 gene expression was elevated in non-PCMSCs upon exposure to anoxia, whereas IP effectively suppressed its gene expression. On the contrary, knock down of miR-210 in PCMSCs predominantly increased Casp8ap2 expression with an associated decline in their survival, thus suggesting Casp8ap2 as one of the major targets of miR-210 during IP of MSCs. CASP8AP2 is an integral member of the apoptosis signaling complex that activates caspase-8 and facilitates Fas-induced apoptosis (22.Imai Y. Kimura T. Murakami A. Yajima N. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Nature. 1999; 398: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). CASP8AP2 was originally identified as a component of death-inducing signaling complex involved in Fas- and tumor necrosis factor-α-mediated apoptosis and contained a death effector domain-recruiting domain, which interacted with death effector domain of caspase-8 or Fas-associated death domain. Once activated, caspase-8 is released from the complex and participates in the activation of effector caspases including caspases-3, -4, -6, -7, -9, and -10. Recent studies indicate that FLASH, a CASP8AP2 homolog in mice and rat, is a huge multifunctional protein that is involved in S phase progression and transcriptional regulation of cells besides its critical role in apoptosis (23.Barcaroli D. Bongiorno-Borbone L. Terrinoni A. Hofmann T.G. Rossi M. Knight R.A. Matera A.G. Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The subcellular distribution of FLASH/CASP8AP2 may therefore be crucial for its functional participation in nonapoptosis- and apoptosis-related signaling pathways (25.Krieghoff-Henning E. Hofmann T.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 2185-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In our results, nuclear-localized FLASH/CASP8AP2 was translocated into the cytoplasm subsequent to 6 h of lethal anoxia and was associated with significant loss of cell survival in non-PCMSCs. On the contrary, IP, which abolished Casp8ap2 expression in PCMSCs and also the cells with Casp8ap2 knock down, showed significantly higher survival upon exposure to lethal anoxia, thus suggesting the importance of Casp8ap2 during apoptosis. In conclusion, because of its safety, ease, and effectiveness in reprogramming of stem cells, the IP approach is innovative to overcome stem cell attrition in the infarcted heart. Moreover, hypoxia-induced miR-210, downstream of HIF-1α is a critical regulator of stem cell survival through FLASH/Casp8ap2 suppression. Download .pdf (.33 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W1979935206,"Metastatic spread of cancer to distant vital organs, including lung and bone, is the overwhelming cause of breast cancer mortality and morbidity. Effective treatment of systemic metastasis relies on the identification and functional characterization of metastasis mediators to multiple organs. Overexpression of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) is frequently associated with advanced tumor stage and metastatic relapse in breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of CCL2 in promoting organ-specific metastasis of breast cancer has not been rigorously investigated. Here, we used organ-specific metastatic sublines of the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line to demonstrate that overexpression of CCL2 promotes breast cancer metastasis to both lung and bone. Conversely, blocking CCL2 function with a neutralizing antibody reduced lung and bone metastases. The enhancement of lung and bone metastases by CCL2 was associated with increased macrophage infiltration and osteoclast differentiation, respectively. By performing functional assays with primary cells isolated from the wild type, CCL2 and CCR2 knock-out mice, we showed that tumor cell-derived CCL2 depends on its receptor CCR2 (chemokine, CC motif, receptor 2) expressed on stromal cells to exert its function in promoting macrophage recruitment and osteoclast differentiation. Overall, these data demonstrated that CCL2-expressing breast tumor cells engage CCR2(+) stromal cells of monocytic origin, including macrophages and preosteoclasts, to facilitate colonization in lung and bone. Therefore, CCL2 and CCR2 are promising therapeutic targets for simultaneously inhibiting lung and bone metastasis of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1977103789,"Between 2005 and 2007 Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused its largest outbreak/epidemic in documented history. An unusual feature of this epidemic is the involvement of Ae. albopictus as a principal vector. Previously we have demonstrated that a single mutation E1-A226V significantly changed the ability of the virus to infect and be transmitted by this vector when expressed in the background of well characterized CHIKV strains LR2006 OPY1 and 37997. However, in the current study we demonstrate that introduction of the E1-A226V mutation into the background of an infectious clone derived from the Ag41855 strain (isolated in Uganda in 1982) does not significantly increase infectivity for Ae. albopictus. In order to elucidate the genetic determinants that affect CHIKV sensitivity to the E1-A226V mutation in Ae. albopictus, the genomes of the LR2006 OPY1 and Ag41855 strains were used for construction of chimeric viruses and viruses with a specific combination of point mutations at selected positions. Based upon the midgut infection rates of the derived viruses in Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, a critical role of the mutations at positions E2-60 and E2-211 on vector infection was revealed. The E2-G60D mutation was an important determinant of CHIKV infectivity for both Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, but only moderately modulated the effect of the E1-A226V mutation in Ae. albopictus. However, the effect of the E2-I211T mutation with respect to mosquito infections was much more specific, strongly modifying the effect of the E1-A226V mutation in Ae. albopictus. In contrast, CHIKV infectivity for Ae. aegypti was not influenced by the E2-1211T mutation. The occurrence of the E2-60G and E2-211I residues among CHIKV isolates was analyzed, revealing a high prevalence of E2-211I among strains belonging to the Eastern/Central/South African (ECSA) clade. This suggests that the E2-211I might be important for adaptation of CHIKV to some particular conditions prevalent in areas occupied by ECSA stains. These newly described determinants of CHIKV mosquito infectivity for Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti are of particular importance for studies aimed at the investigation of the detailed mechanisms of CHIKV adaptations to its vector species."
https://openalex.org/W2056937874,"The Wnts include a large family of secreted proteins that serve as important signals during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. In the most well understood Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt binding to Frizzled and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein induces beta-catenin protein stabilization and entry into the nucleus, resulting in changes in target gene transcription. Emerging evidence suggests that Wnt5a can inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin signaling through interaction with the receptor Ror2. The Ror2 protein belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily and contains several recognizable structural motifs. However, limited information is available regarding which specific domains are required for the inhibitory signaling activity of Wnt5a. Through mutation and deletion analysis, we have analyzed which specific domains and residues, including those necessary for tyrosine kinase activity, mediate the Wnt5a signal. To determine whether Ror2 can inhibit canonical Wnt signaling in vivo, we examined the effect of Ror2 loss on the expression of the Wnt reporter Axin2(LacZ), finding increased reporter activity in Ror2 null mice, demonstrating that Ror2 can also inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the context of intact tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2067498565,"Recent epidemiologic, genetic, and molecular studies suggest infection and inflammation initiate certain cancers, including those of the prostate. The American Cancer Society, estimates that approximately 20% of all worldwide cancers are caused by infection. Mycoplasma, a genus of bacteria that lack a cell wall, are among the few prokaryotes that can grow in close relationship with mammalian cells, often without any apparent pathology, for extended periods of time. In this study, the capacity of Mycoplasma genitalium, a prevalent sexually transmitted infection, and Mycoplasma hyorhinis, a mycoplasma found at unusually high frequency among patients with AIDS, to induce a malignant phenotype in benign human prostate cells (BPH-1) was evaluated using a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. After 19 weeks of culture, infected BPH-1 cells achieved anchorage-independent growth and increased migration and invasion. Malignant transformation of infected BPH-1 cells was confirmed by the formation of xenograft tumors in athymic mice. Associated with these changes was an increase in karyotypic entropy, evident by the accumulation of chromosomal aberrations and polysomy. This is the first report describing the capacity of M. genitalium or M. hyorhinis infection to lead to the malignant transformation of benign human epithelial cells and may serve as a model to further study the relationship between prostatitis and prostatic carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1995292541,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in the mouse requires the microtubule-based organelle, the primary cilium. The primary cilium is assembled and maintained through the process of intraflagellar transport (IFT) and the response to Shh is blocked in mouse mutants that lack proteins required for IFT. Although the phenotypes of mouse IFT mutants do not overlap with phenotypes of known Wnt pathway mutants, recent studies report data suggesting that the primary cilium modulates responses to Wnt signals.We therefore carried out a systematic analysis of canonical Wnt signaling in mutant embryos and cells that lack primary cilia because of loss of the anterograde IFT kinesin-II motor (Kif3a) or IFT complex B proteins (Ift172 or Ift88). We also analyzed mutant embryos with abnormal primary cilia due to defects in retrograde IFT (Dync2h1). The mouse IFT mutants express the canonical Wnt target Axin2 and activate a transgenic canonical Wnt reporter, BAT-gal, in the normal spatial pattern and to the same quantitative level as wild type littermates. Similarly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from IFT mutants respond normally to added Wnt3a. The switch from canonical to non-canonical Wnt also appears normal in IFT mutant MEFs, as both wild-type and mutant cells do not activate the canonical Wnt reporter in the presence of both Wnt3a and Wnt5a.We conclude that loss of primary cilia or defects in retrograde IFT do not affect the response of the midgestation embryo or embryo-derived fibroblasts to Wnt ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2068957859,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to allow cells to adapt to stress targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Induction of ER chaperone GRP78/BiP increases protein folding capacity; as such it represents a major survival arm of UPR. Considering the central importance of the UPR in regulating cell survival and death, evidence is emerging that cells evolve feedback regulatory pathways to modulate the key UPR executors, however, the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the fortuitous discovery of GRP78va, a novel isoform of GRP78 generated by alternative splicing (retention of intron 1) and alternative translation initiation. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses revealed that expression of GRP78va is enhanced by ER stress and is notably elevated in human leukemic cells and leukemia patients. In contrast to the canonical GRP78 which is primarily an ER lumenal protein, GRP78va is devoid of the ER signaling peptide and is cytosolic. Through specific knockdown of endogenous GRP78va by siRNA without affecting canonical GRP78, we showed that GRP78va promotes cell survival under ER stress. We further demonstrated that GRP78va has the ability to regulate PERK signaling and that GRP78va is able to interact with and antagonize PERK inhibitor P58IPK. Our study describes the discovery of GRP78va, a novel cytosolic isoform of GRP78/BiP, and the first characterization of the modulation of UPR signaling via alternative splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA. Our study further reveals a novel survival mechanism in leukemic cells and other cell types where GRP78va is expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1990990266,"Background The case fatality ratio (CFR), the ratio of deaths from an infectious disease to the number of cases, provides an assessment of virulence. Calculation of the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to cases during the course of an epidemic tends to result in a biased CFR. The present study develops a simple method to obtain an unbiased estimate of confirmed CFR (cCFR), using only the confirmed cases as the denominator, at an early stage of epidemic, even when there have been only a few deaths. Methodology/Principal Findings Our method adjusts the biased cCFR by a factor of underestimation which is informed by the time from symptom onset to death. We first examine the approach by analyzing an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong (2003) with known unbiased cCFR estimate, and then investigate published epidemiological datasets of novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in the USA and Canada (2009). Because observation of a few deaths alone does not permit estimating the distribution of the time from onset to death, the uncertainty is addressed by means of sensitivity analysis. The maximum likelihood estimate of the unbiased cCFR for influenza may lie in the range of 0.16–4.48% within the assumed parameter space for a factor of underestimation. The estimates for influenza suggest that the virulence is comparable to the early estimate in Mexico. Even when there have been no deaths, our model permits estimating a conservative upper bound of the cCFR. Conclusions Although one has to keep in mind that the cCFR for an entire population is vulnerable to its variations among sub-populations and underdiagnosis, our method is useful for assessing virulence at the early stage of an epidemic and for informing policy makers and the public."

However, the JNK/FOXO target genes are unknown. Here, we identified Jafrac1, a Drosophila homolog of human Peroxiredoxin II (hPrxII), as a downstream effecter of JNK/FOXO signaling in neurons that enhances stress resistance and extends life span. We found that Jafrac1 was expressed in the adult brain and induced by paraquat, a reactive oxygen species-generating chemical. RNA interference-mediated neuronal knockdown of Jafrac1 enhanced, while neuronal overexpression of Jafrac1 and hPrxII suppressed, paraquat-induced lethality in flies. Neuronal expression of Jafrac1 also significantly reduced ROS levels, restored mitochondrial function, and attenuated JNK activation caused by paraquat. Activation of JNK/FOXO signaling in neurons increased the Jafrac1 expression level under both normal and oxidative stressed conditions.

However, little is known regarding the JNK/FOXO target genes in neurons.Thiol-reducing systems are important reducers of many oxidative stressors, such as peroxide (9Matsumoto A. Okado A. Fujii T.

In Drosophila, JNK confers tolerance to oxidative stress and extends life span by inducing a protective gene expression program.

However, whether this effect is due to the specific protection of neurons against oxidative damage, or whether JNK activation in neurons may induce a humoral response that regulates longevity systemically, is unclear (1Accili D.

There are two putative FOXO consensus binding sites (RWWAACA) in the promoter region of Jafrac1 (data not shown), suggesting that the transcription factor FOXO may bind to the Jafrac1 promoter and directly activate Jafrac1 transcription. We also demonstrated that neuronal knockdown of Jafrac1 enhances, and neuronal overexpression of Jafrac1 reduces, ROS-induced lethality. Furthermore, the neuronal knockdown of Jafrac1 shortened, while overexpression of Jafrac1 extended, the life span of the flies. These results support the hypothesis that, in Drosophila, the JNK/FOXO pathway protects neurons from oxidative stress and extends life span by induction of antioxidant genes, including Jafrac1 in neurons (Fig. 5D).Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are identified by their ability to neutralize cellular hydroperoxides in mammals (24Seaver L.C.

Moreover, mitochondrial peroxiredoxin (Dpx-5037, mTPx) has been reported to restore wild-type life span in a Drosophila model for Friedreich's ataxia (27Anderson P.R. Kirby K. Orr W.C. Hilliker A.J.

Several studies in Drosophila show that expression of specific mitochondrial proteins can increase resistance to oxidative stress as well as extend life span (28Fridell Y.W. Sánchez-Blanco A.

Collectively, Jafrac1 or hPrxII may extend life span by acting as a guardian for neuronal mitochondria under age-associated oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, because mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases (8Lin M.T. Beal M.F. Nature. 2006; 443: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar), induction of Jafrac1/PrxII in neurons may also be protective against age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

Among six distinct mammalian Prxs (I–VI), Prx II is exclusively expressed in the brain (11Jin M.H. Lee Y.H. Kim J.M. Sun H.N. Moon E.Y. Shong M.H. Kim S.U. Lee S.H. Lee T.H. Yu D.Y. Lee D.S.

However, the regulation of PrxII expression in neurons has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that neuronal expression of Jafrac1, a Drosophila homologue of human Prx II (hPrxII), was regulated by JNK/FOXO signaling, promoted resistance to oxidative stress, and extended the life span of the flies.

In Drosophila, JNK confers tolerance to oxidative stress and extends life span by inducing a protective gene expression program. Increased JNK activity in neurons is sufficient to promote stress tolerance and extend life span in flies (4Wang M.C. Bohmann D. Jasper H.

However, whether this effect is due to the specific protection of neurons against oxidative damage, or whether JNK activation in neurons may induce a humoral response that regulates longevity systemically, is unclear (1Accili D.

There are two putative FOXO consensus binding sites (RWWAACA) in the promoter region of Jafrac1 (data not shown), suggesting that the transcription factor FOXO may bind to the Jafrac1 promoter and directly activate Jafrac1 transcription. We also demonstrated that neuronal knockdown of Jafrac1 enhances, and neuronal overexpression of Jafrac1 reduces, ROS-induced lethality. Furthermore, the neuronal knockdown of Jafrac1 shortened, while overexpression of Jafrac1 extended, the life span of the flies. These results support the hypothesis that, in Drosophila, the JNK/FOXO pathway protects neurons from oxidative stress and extends life span by induction of antioxidant genes, including Jafrac1 in neurons (Fig. 5D).Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are identified by their ability to neutralize cellular hydroperoxides in mammals (24Seaver L.C.

All Drosophila Prxs have peroxidase activities, and their expressions are induced by oxidative stress. Prx overexpression enhances resistance to oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide and paraquat in cultured Drosophila cells (25Radyuk S.N. Klichko V.I. Spinola B. Sohal R.S. Orr W.C. Free Radic Biol.

Moreover, mitochondrial peroxiredoxin (Dpx-5037, mTPx) has been reported to restore wild-type life span in a Drosophila model for Friedreich's ataxia (27Anderson P.R. Kirby K. Orr W.C. Hilliker A.J.

Several studies in Drosophila show that expression of specific mitochondrial proteins can increase resistance to oxidative stress as well as extend life span (28Fridell Y.W. Sánchez-Blanco A.

Collectively, Jafrac1 or hPrxII may extend life span by acting as a guardian for neuronal mitochondria under age-associated oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, because mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases (8Lin M.T. Beal M.F. Nature. 2006; 443: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar), induction of Jafrac1/PrxII in neurons may also be protective against age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1982042514,"Bile acids are potentially toxic compounds and their levels of hepatic production, uptake and export are tightly regulated by many inputs, including circadian rhythm. We tested the impact of disrupting the peripheral circadian clock on integral steps of bile acid homeostasis.Both restricted feeding, which phase shifts peripheral clocks, and genetic ablation in Per1(-/-)/Per2(-/-) (PERDKO) mice disrupted normal bile acid control and resulted in hepatic cholestasis. Restricted feeding caused a dramatic, transient elevation in hepatic bile acid levels that was associated with activation of the xenobiotic receptors CAR and PXR and elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), indicative of liver damage. In the PERDKO mice, serum bile acid levels were elevated and the circadian expression of key bile acid synthesis and transport genes, including Cyp7A1 and NTCP, was lost. This was associated with blunted expression of a primary clock output, the transcription factor DBP, which transactivates the promoters of both genes.We conclude that disruption of the circadian clock results in dysregulation of bile acid homeostasis that mimics cholestatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1978678623,"The mechanism of chemotaxis is one of the most interesting issues in modern cell biology. Recent work shows that shallow chemoattractant gradients do not induce the generation of pseudopods, as has been predicted in many models. This poses the question of how else cells can steer towards chemoattractants. Here we use a new computational algorithm to analyze the extension of pseudopods by Dictyostelium cells. We show that a shallow gradient of cAMP induces a small bias in the direction of pseudopod extension, without significantly affecting parameters such as pseudopod frequency or size. Persistent movement, caused by alternating left/right splitting of existing pseudopodia, amplifies the effects of this bias by up to 5-fold. Known players in chemotactic pathways play contrasting parts in this mechanism; PLA2 and cGMP signal to the cytoskeleton to regulate the splitting process, while PI 3-kinase and soluble guanylyl cyclase mediate the directional bias. The coordinated regulation of pseudopod generation, orientation and persistence by multiple signaling pathways allows eukaryotic cells to detect extremely shallow gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2044499093,"Calcium (Ca(2+)) is a key second messenger in eukaryotes where it regulates a diverse array of cellular processes in response to external stimuli. An important Ca(2+) sensor in both animals and plants is calmodulin (CaM). In addition to evolutionarily conserved CaM, plants possess a unique family of CaM-like (CML) proteins. The majority of these CMLs have not yet been studied, and investigation into their physical properties and cellular functions will provide insight into Ca(2+) signal transduction in plants. Here we describe the characterization of CML42, a 191-amino acid Ca(2+)-binding protein from Arabidopsis. Ca(2+) binding to recombinant CML42 was assessed by fluorescence spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, microcalorimetry, and CD spectroscopy. CML42 displays significant alpha-helical secondary structure, binds three molecules of Ca(2+) with affinities ranging from 30 to 430 nm, and undergoes a Ca(2+)-induced conformational change that results in the exposure of one or more hydrophobic regions. Gene expression analysis revealed CML42 transcripts at various stages of development and in many cell types, including the support cells, which surround trichomes (leaf hairs) on the leaf surface. Using yeast two-hybrid screening we identified a putative CML42 interactor; kinesin-interacting Ca(2+)-binding protein (KIC). Because KIC is a protein known to function in trichome development, we examined transgenic CML42 knockout plants and found that they possess aberrant trichomes with increased branching. Collectively, our data support a role for CML42 as a Ca(2+) sensor that functions during cell branching in trichomes."
https://openalex.org/W1997515738,"The four sperm-specific CatSper ion channel proteins are required for hyperactivated motility and male fertility, and for Ca(2+) entry evoked by alkaline depolarization. In the absence of external Ca(2+), Na(+) carries current through CatSper channels in voltage-clamped sperm. Here we show that CatSper channel activity can be monitored optically with the [Na(+)](i)-reporting probe SBFI in populations of intact sperm. Removal of external Ca(2+) increases SBFI signals in wild-type but not CatSper2-null sperm. The rate of the indicated rise of [Na(+)](i) is greater for sperm alkalinized with NH(4)Cl than for sperm acidified with propionic acid, reflecting the alkaline-promoted signature property of CatSper currents. In contrast, the [Na(+)](i) rise is slowed by candidate CatSper blocker HC-056456 (IC(50) approximately 3 microM). HC-056456 similarly slows the rise of [Ca(2+)](i) that is evoked by alkaline depolarization and reported by fura-2. HC-056456 also selectively and reversibly decreased CatSper currents recorded from patch-clamped sperm. HC-056456 does not prevent activation of motility by HCO(3) (-) but does prevent the development of hyperactivated motility by capacitating incubations, thus producing a phenocopy of the CatSper-null sperm. When applied to hyperactivated sperm, HC-056456 causes a rapid, reversible loss of flagellar waveform asymmetry, similar to the loss that occurs when Ca(2+) entry through the CatSper channel is terminated by removal of external Ca(2+). Thus, open CatSper channels and entry of external Ca(2+) through them sustains hyperactivated motility. These results indicate that pharmacological targeting of the CatSper channel may impose a selective late-stage block to fertility, and that high-throughput screening with an optical reporter of CatSper channel activity may identify additional selective blockers with potential for male-directed contraception."
https://openalex.org/W2017392747,"In eukaryotes, each subcellular compartment harbors a specific group of proteins that must accomplish specific tasks. Nfs1 is a highly conserved mitochondrial cysteine desulfurase that participates in iron-sulfur cluster assembly as a sulfur donor. Previous genetic studies, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have suggested that this protein distributes between the mitochondria and the nucleus with biochemically undetectable amounts in the nucleus (termed “eclipsed distribution”). Here, we provide direct evidence for Nfs1 nuclear localization (in addition to mitochondria) using both α-complementation and subcellular fractionation. We also demonstrate that mitochondrial and nuclear Nfs1 are derived from a single translation product. Our data suggest that the Nfs1 distribution mechanism involves at least partial entry of the Nfs1 precursor into mitochondria, and then retrieval of a minor subpopulation (probably by reverse translocation) into the cytosol and then the nucleus. To further elucidate the mechanism of Nfs1 distribution we determined the N-terminal mitochondrial sequence of Nfs1 by Edman degradation. This led to the discovery of a novel mitochondrial processing enzyme, Icp55. This enzyme removes three amino acids from the N terminus of Nfs1 after cleavage by mitochondrial processing peptidase. Intriguingly, Icp55 protease (like its substrate Nfs1) appears to be dual distributed between the nucleus and mitochondria.

Eclipsed distribution is a specific case of the dual protein subcellular localization in which one compartment contains the vast majority of a specific protein while a second compartment contains only a minute (eclipsed) amount (1Regev-Rudzki N.

Therefore, eclipsed distributed proteins are hard to detect, and it is hard to discriminate between the specific functions of each isoprotein. For example, aconitase, a well characterized mitochondrial protein that participates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, has been recently shown to be present in minute amounts in the cytosol, where it is crucial for the function of the glyoxylate shunt (2Regev-Rudzki N. Pines O. BioEssays. 2007; 29: 772-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 3Shlevin L. Regev-Rudzki N. Karniely S. Pines O. Traffic. 2007; 8: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).

In eukaryotes, an NifS-like protein termed Nfs1 has been identified, which shows a highly conserved sequence homology.

When this NLS-like sequence was mutated to RRGSR, the mutant gene could not complement cell growth of a chromosomal NFS1-depleted strain. Nevertheless, this mutation did not affect the function of Nfs1 in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins (5Mühlenhoff U. Balk J. Richhardt N. Kaiser J.T. Sipos K. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol.

However, recent evidence suggests that nuclear Nfs1 does not serve as the sulfur donor for cytosolic tRNAs (8Nakai Y. Nakai M. Lill R. Suzuki T. Hayashi H. Mol.

In S. cerevisiae and in human cells, Nfs1 cysteine desulfurases are encoded by single genes. The sorting mechanism that governs the simultaneous distribution of this protein into several subcellular compartments is unknown. In yeast, attempts to detect the endogenous Nfs1 in the nucleus by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence failed (6Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol.

In human cells, the subcellular distribution of transiently expressed Nfs1 in mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus was claimed to be achieved by alternative translation initiation from a single transcript (11Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).

In this study, we characterized the processing pathway of yeast Nfs1 during its translocation into the mitochondrial matrix. To our surprise, we discovered that yeast Nfs1 undergoes two steps of proteolytic processing; first it is cleaved by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), which removes its mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and then it is cleaved by a newly discovered peptidase, designated Icp55, which removes three amino acids from its N terminus. In addition, we used an α-complementation assay to detect the nuclear localization of Nfs1, and we provide evidence that the mitochondrial and nuclear Nfs1 isoforms are derived from a single translation product.

For agar plates, 2% agar was added and when indicated 0.08% X-gal was added, dissolved in 100% N,N-dimethylformamide and phosphate buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate buffer titrated to pH 7.0). Plates containing 2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% glucose (w/v) (YPD) supplemented with 120 μg/ml tetracycline where used for conditional knockout of Nfs1 for the Tet-NFS1 strain. Cultures or induced cultures (in galactose) were harvested and labeled with 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. When required, 20 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was added before labeling. Labeling was stopped by addition of 10 mm sodium azide. Labeled cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, broken with glass beads for 5 min, and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant fraction. Supernatants were denatured by boiling in 1% SDS, immunoprecipitated with anti-Nfs1 or anti-α rabbit antiserum and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Induced yeast cultures were grown to an absorbance (A) of 1.5 at 600 nm. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (18Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were prepared in the presence of Zymolyase-20T (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Each of our subcellular fractionation experiments was assayed for cross-contaminations by using anti-Aco1 antibody as a mitochondrial marker and anti-hexokinase 1 (anti-HxK1) antibody as a cytosolic marker. For isolation of nucleus, 200 ml of induced yeast culture was grown to 1.5 A at 600 nm. Cells were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 6 min and washed with phosphate-citrate buffer (pH = 6.5). Cells were digested to spheroplasts by Zymolyase-20T (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Spheroplasts were then precipitated at 1200 × g for 5min and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100). Cells debris were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, twice. Total sample was taken before nucleus precipitation. Nuclei were precipitated at 1500 × g for 20 min and then washed in the lysis buffer without Triton X-100. Nuclei were lysed with a high salts concentration buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min to remove nucleus debris and DNA. Total and nuclear fractions were assayed with anti-histone H4 antibody, which was kindly provided by Amikam Cohen (Hebrew University of Jerusalem). Yeast cells were transformed with plasmids encoding various α fusion proteins and with pωc, pωm, or pωNLS. Colonies were streaked on X-gal plates and incubated at 30 °C for 72 h. Induced yeast cultures were grown to 1.5 A at 600 nm. Cells were lysed with glass beads in Buffer A (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, pH adjust to 8 with NaOH). Purification proceeded according to Qiagen protocol of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen). Purification quality was assessed with Coomassie Blue SDS-PAGE staining. The purified protein was subjected to an Edman degradation analysis. Nfs1 is a highly conserved mitochondrial cysteine desulfurase in all organisms. In S. cerevisiae and in other eukaryotes the protein harbors a typical N-terminal MTS and is localized to the mitochondria. As outlined in the introduction, a low abundant form of Nfs1 in the nucleus may be targeted by a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (6Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8314-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). To characterize the Nfs1 distribution mechanism, one of our first efforts was to identify its exact MTS and determine the MPP-cleavage site at the N terminus of Nfs1. Nfs1 fused to a six-histidine tag was purified from a wild-type (WT) yeast strain and was subjected to Edman degradation analysis. The N-terminal sequence detected was PAAGVKLDD, indicating that Nfs1 is cleaved between two proline residues at positions 36 and 37 (Fig. 1A). The detected cleavage site according to this Edman degradation analysis was unexpected, because typical MPP cleavage sites usually include arginine residues at one or more of the positions −2, −3, and/or −10 relative to the cleavage site (19Ito A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Niidome T. Kitada S. Shimokata K. Ogishima T. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24719-24722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, cleavage between phenylalanine 33 and tyrosine 34 would place arginines at positions −2 and −3 relative to this site according to the MPP preferences, referred to above (see highlighted arginines at positions −2 and −3 relative to this cleavage site in Fig. 1A). Another prediction based on the bioinformatic MitoProtII program (21Andreoli C. Prokisch H. Hortnagel K. Mueller J.C. Munsterkotter M. Scharfe C. Meitinger T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (database issue): D459-D462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Prokisch H. Andreoli C. Ahting U. Heiss K. Ruepp A. Scharfe C. Meitinger T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 (database issue): D705-D711Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), places the cleavage site for yeast Nfs1 between tyrosine 34 and serine 35 (arginines would be at positions −2 and −10 relative to this cleavage site). Thus, we hypothesized the existence of an additional proteolytic step (besides that performed by MPP), which cleaves Nfs1 immediately downstream of the predicted MPP cleavage site. This could result in the N-terminal sequence detected by Edman degradation of Nfs1 (between proline 36 and proline 37). We screened yeast databases (Saccharomyces Genome Database and Yeast Proteome Database) for known and putative mitochondrial proteases. We were particularly interested in enzymes with aminopeptidase activity, that could theoretically remove between two and three amino acids. Among the candidate enzymes we found a group of putative Xaa-Pro aminopeptidases that presumably remove Xaa-Pro from the N terminus of substrate proteins. Only one putative Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase, Icp55 (YER078c), was predicted to be localized in the mitochondria according to the databases. To directly examine if Nfs1 is a substrate of Icp55, Western blot analysis was performed on extracts of yeast cells harboring a deletion of the ICP55 gene (Δicp55) in comparison with WT strains. Nfs1, from the Δicp55 strain exhibited a slightly slower migrating band, indicating a higher molecular weight than the corresponding protein band from WT strains (Fig. 1B). Edman degradation analysis performed on Nfs1 purified from the knockout strain, Δicp55, detected three additional amino acids, YSP, at the N terminus of Nfs1 (Fig. 1A). Thus, Nfs1 is subjected to two steps of processing: first by MPP, which cleaves the precursor between phenylalanine 33 (Phe-33) and tyrosine 34 (Tyr-34), and second by a newly discovered processing enzyme, Icp55, which cleaves between proline 36 (Pro-36) and proline 37 (Pro-37) removing three amino acids residues (YSP). To investigate the properties of the novel peptidase, we first examined whether Icp55 can cleave the full-length Nfs1 precursor (i.e. the unprocessed form). A mutant MPP recognition sequence was constructed by replacing the two arginine codons at positions −2 and −3, which are expected to prevent cleavage by MPP (Fig. 1C, UP, unprocessed). As anticipated, the mutant protein migrated on SDS-PAGE according to a molecular weight of the Nfs1 precursor (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 2 and 3). This indicates that, in the absence of Nfs1 processing by MPP, the Nfs1 precursor is not cleaved by Icp55, because we can only detect the full-length Nfs1 precursor. Thus, Icp55 is in fact a mitochondrial processing enzyme whose recognition sequence is exposed only after removal of the MTS by MPP. To gain insight into the requirements for Icp55 processing we changed the amino acid sequence in the vicinity of the Icp55 cleavage site. Each mutant protein was subjected to Edman degradation following expression in both the WT strain (expressing endogenous Icp55) and in the chromosomal knockout strain, Δicp55 (Fig. 1C). Only in one case, replacement of two prolines (Pro-36 and Pro-37) by two aspartates, was the cleavage prevented by Icp55. These two prolines seem to be of importance for the Icp55 cleavage reaction, because the replacement of a single proline changed the specificity to a new cleavage site without eliminating the cleavage reaction per se (Fig. 1C). Replacement of the first proline (Pro-36) by alanine moved the cleavage site between Tyr-34 and Ser-35, whereas exchange of the second (Pro-37) by alanine moved the cleavage between residue Ser-35 and Pro-36 (Fig. 1C). Another residue that we thought may be of importance is the N-terminal tyrosine exposed by MPP cleavage. Replacement of Tyr-34 by a phenylalanine had no effect on Icp55 cleavage between the prolines (Pro-36 and Pro-37) while its exchange by leucine brought about incomplete cleavage at the same site. Possibly an aromatic residue at this position may be of significance. Replacement of Ser-35 by alanine did not prevent cleavage but also moved the cleavage site between Tyr-34 and Ala-35 (Fig. 1C). These data clearly show that changing amino acids in the vicinity of the cleavage site affect cleavage efficiency and/or the specific site cleaved. The specificity of Icp55 cleavage remains to be identified. There are a number of studies that suggest a nuclear function for yeast Nfs1 (5Mühlenhoff U. Balk J. Richhardt N. Kaiser J.T. Sipos K.

The difficulty in detection prompted us to employ our α-complementation assay, which has been previously shown to be a sensitive in vivo approach for detecting eclipsed distributed proteins (1Regev-Rudzki N. Karniely S. Ben-Haim N.N. Pines O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4163-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Karniely S. Rayzner A. Sass E. Pines O. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3835-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The α-complementation is based on the ability of two artificially expressed peptide fragments of Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (designated α 77 amino acids and ω 993 amino acids) to assemble in vivo into an enzymatically active complex only when present in the same compartment (16Karniely S. Rayzner A. Sass E. Pines O. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3835-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). We fused the α fragment of β-galactosidase to the C terminus of Nfs1 (Nfs1-α) and expressed this fusion protein in yeast, whereas the ω polypeptide was expressed either in the cytosol (ωc), mitochondria (ωm), or nucleus (ωNLS). Although ωc and ωm have been described previously (16Karniely S. Rayzner A. Sass E. Pines O. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3835-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), ωNLS is described for the first time here as a way to get an indication of nuclear localization. To create ωNLS, we attached the NLS of SV-40 T-Antigen (PKKKRKV) (17Lanford R.E. Kanda P. Kennedy R.C. Cell. 1986; 46: 575-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) to the C terminus of the ω fragment. We have performed subcellular fractionation and can show that the ωNLS fusion protein exhibits a significant presence in the nucleus (data not shown). The first step in using the Nfs1-α fusion protein for analysis of Nfs1 distribution was to show that the apparent characteristics of the fusion protein are identical to those of the wild-type protein. Described below are the fusion protein's enzymatic activity in vivo (Fig. 2B), subcellular distribution (Fig. 2C), and processing in mitochondria (Fig. 3A). The Nfs1-α fusion protein can complement the Nfs1 activity in the Tet-NFS1 strain (Fig. 2B). This yeast strain contains a Tet-off promoter upstream of the endogenous NFS1 gene and can be repressed by adding tetracycline to the medium (14Mnaimneh S. Davierwala A.P. Haynes J. Moffat J. Peng W.T. Zhang W. Yang X. Pootoolal J. Chua G. Lopez A. Trochesset M. Morse D. Krogan N.J. Hiley S.L. Li Z. Morris Q. Grigull J. Mitsakakis N. Roberts C.J. Greenblatt J.F. Boone C. Kaiser C.A. Andrews B.J. Hughes T.R. Cell. 2004; 118: 31-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The Tet-NFS1 strain expressing an empty vector does not grow on YPD plates containing tetracycline, whereas the same strain expressing the fusion protein (Nfs1-α) readily grows on the same media (Fig. 2B). Subcellular fractionation experiments reveal that the majority of the Nfs1-α molecules are found in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 2C), a pattern that is reminiscent of the Nfs1 wild-type protein (Fig. 2C, top). The quality of each fractionation was monitored with antibodies against mitochondrial (Aco1) and cytosolic (hexokinase 1 (HxK1)) markers (Fig. 2C). In addition, Nfs1-α is processed in the mitochondria efficiently, as will be described in the next section (Fig. 3A). Hence, we conclude that Nfs1-α exhibits the same subcellular distribution as wild-type Nfs1. To examine the subcellular localization of the Nfs1-α fusion protein using the α-complementation assay, plasmids encoding Nfs1-α together with a cytosolic, mitochondrial, or nuclear localized ω fragments (ωm, ωc, and ωNLS, respectively) were simultaneously coexpressed in yeast WT cells. When these cells were grown on agar plates containing the X-gal indicator and galactose as the carbon source, blue colonies were obtained for cells coexpressing Nfs1-α either with ωm or with ωNLS, but not with the ωc fragment (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that a subpopulation of the Nfs1-α molecules is located in the nucleus and in fact no Nfs1-α is present in the cytosol (Fig. 2D), providing direct evidence for the dual distribution of this protein. As a negative control, we show that an exclusive mitochondrial protein fused to the α fragment of Kgd2-α (dihydrolipoyl transsuccinylase, a component of the mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex), produces non-colored colonies when coexpressed with ωNLS or with ωc (Fig. 2D). The α-fragment itself, however, when attached to NLS as a positive control, produces blue colonies exclusively when coexpressed with the nuclear ω fragment (Fig. 2D). The cytosolic control HxK1-α fusion protein (HxK1 fused to α) produces blue colonies when coexpressed not only with ωc but also with ωNLS. This result is due to incomplete localization of ωNLS to the nucleus, and a subfraction of it remains in the cytosol. As a consequence, blue colonies appear for cells coexpressing ωNLS and any cytosolic protein fused to the α fragment. In this regard, because Nfs1-α is not a cytosolic protein (white colonies with ωc), blue colonies with ωNLS obviously detect the nuclear localization of the protein. In support of this analysis a Nfs1-α mutant, lacking the MTS (ΔMTS-Nfs1-α), as expected, appears to be located in the nucleus but not in mitochondria. Surprisingly, ΔMTS-Nfs1-α appeared to also be in the cytosol, suggesting that the nuclear import of ΔMTS-Nfs1-α is somehow saturated, which in turn may suggest the participation of currently unknown factors in this process. In addition, we mutated the NLS sequence of Nfs1-α similarly (not identically) to that described by Nakai and coworkers (6Nakai Y. Nakai M. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol.

Its more limited ability to replicate in murine macrophages has been attributed to redundant innate sensor systems that detect and effectively respond to this infection. The current studies evaluate the role of one of these innate response systems, the type I interferon (IFN-I) autocrine loop. The ability of L. pneumophila to induce IFN-I expression was found to be dependent on IRF-3, but not NF-κB. Secreted IFN-Is then in turn suppress the intracellular replication of L. pneumophila. Surprisingly, this suppression is mediated by a pathway that is independent of Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, but correlates with the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 or classically activated phenotype.

Genetic studies have mapped L. pneumophila virulence and immune evasion to the Dot-Icm type IV secretion system (reviewed in Refs. 2Fortier A. Diez E. Gros P.

Both type I (e.g. IFN-α/β) and type II (IFN-γ) IFNs play an important role in the innate response to intracellular microbes (18Schindler C. Plumlee C. Semin Cell Dev.

Characterization of IFN's antiviral activity led to the identification of the IFN-α receptor (IFNAR), the IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR), and the JAK-STAT signaling paradigm, where STATs (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) are transcription factors and JAKs (Janus Kinases) the receptor-associated kinases that activate them (23Schindler C. Levy D.E. Decker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20059-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Specifically, IFN-γ directs the formation of a single transcription factor, the Stat1 homodimer, whereas IFN-I directs the activation of both Stat1 homodimers and ISGF-3 (IFN-stimulated gene factor 3; Stat1 + Stat2 + IRF9). Recent studies have underscored an important role for IRF-3 and IRF-7 in promoting activation of an IFN-I autocrine loop. This entails a sequential expression of IFN-β and IFN-α, and is dependent on IFNAR. This autocrine loop plays an important role in innate immunity (23Schindler C. Levy D.E. Decker T. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 1266-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our studies highlight a role for the IFN-I autocrine loop in the innate response to this bacterium. The ability of L. pneumophila to induce IFN-I expression was found to depend on IRF-3, yet be independent of the flagellin-Naip5 axis, as well as p50/cRel. Additionally, in contrast to the critical role Stat1 plays in the antibacterial response of IFN-γ, the ability of IFN-α to suppress L. pneumophila growth was found to be independent of both Stat1 and Stat2. Finally, the Stat1-independent protection afforded by IFN-α correlated with the induction of classically activated M1 macrophage markers. 129, C57Bl/6J and A/J strains of mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and bred in a specific pathogen free facility. Homozygous Stat1(−/−), Stat2(−/−), IFNAR1(−/−), IFNGR1(−/−), and Stat3-fl/fl × Rosa26-ER(T2)-Cre (Stat3-cko) mice were either in a 129 or C57Bl/6J background, as noted (19Meraz M.A. White J.M.

Primary murine macrophages were prepared by culturing bone marrow (BM) cells in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), P/S (GIBCO), and 20% L929-conditioned medium for 5–7 days, as previously reported (32Zhao W.

Blood. 2006; 108: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). L-cell-conditioned medium was collected from L929 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (GIBCO) plus 10% fetal calf serum for 7 days. Cells were stimulated with IFN-αA/D (1000 units/ml; PBL, Piscataway, NJ), active on both human and murine cells, or murine IFN-γ (50 units/ml; PBL). Some cells were pretreated with LY294002 (50 μm; 30 min; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) or SB203580 (50 μm; 30 min; Calbiochem). Stat3 conditional knock-out (cko) BM cells were treated with 250 nm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) on culture days 1 and 5 to delete Stat3. The L. pneumophila strain JR32 (restriction-defective Philadelphia-1, streptomycin-resistant) and dotA strains in the JR32 background were grown in AYE broth or on CYE plates, previously described (38Chen J. de Felipe K.S.

Ex vivo bacterial growth was evaluated by infecting (MOI = 0.25) day 6 bone marrow-derived murine macrophages (BMMs) with post-exponential phase L. pneumophila in 24-well plates (2.5 × 105 BMMs per well; (41Hilbi H. Segal G. Shuman H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 603-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)). Specifically, BMMs were infected with bacteria resuspended in RPMI. The zero hour, collected after 2 h of absorption, as well as all other time points were collected after washing infected BMMs with sterile water (10 s) and then lysing them in 1 ml of sterile water (5 min). Recovered bacteria were serially diluted in water and plated on CYE agar. Three days later, colony counts were enumerated. All infections were carried out in triplicate, and verified in at least three independent studies. Total RNA was prepared from day 6 BMMs before or after L. pneumophila infection (MOI = 10) through lysis in Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 3–5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed (M-MLV; Invitrogen), as previously reported (32Zhao W. Cha E.N. Lee C. Park C.Y. Schindler C. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37Song L. Bhattacharya S. Yunus A.A. Lima C.D. Schindler C. Blood. 2006; 108: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For semi-quantitative analysis, cDNA was amplified for 28 cycles, fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. For quantitative (Q) analysis, cDNA was amplified in an ABI Prism 7500 with SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and specific primers (see supplemental Table S1). Gene expression was normalized to a β-actin control. For each primer set, Ct values and standard curves were generated by plotting log DNA concentration versus Ct values from 1:5 serial dilutions with SDS1.9.1 software (Applied Biosystems). Cells were stained with different combinations of fluorochrome-coupled antibodies (32Zhao W. Cha E.N. Lee C. Park C.Y. Schindler C. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Anti-CD86 (GL1-PE), anti-I-Ab (AF6–120), and anti-Strepavidin-APC were from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). BM macrophage cultures were infected with fluorescent bacteria. After 1–2 days of growth, cells were stained, and data collected on an LSRII (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Flow data were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR), as previously reported (32Zhao W. Cha E.N. Lee C. Park C.Y. Schindler C. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from IFN-αA/D (1000 u/ml; PBL)-treated cells and evaluated by immunoblotting, as reported (20Park C. Li S. Cha E. Schindler C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 795-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with antibodies specific for Phospho-Stat3 (Cell Signaling Tech., Beverly, MA), Stat3 (Cell Signaling Tech), and Stat1 (20Park C. Li S. Cha E. Schindler C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 795-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). 48 h supernatants were collected from BMMs and evaluated for NO production by a modified Griess Assay (37Song L. Bhattacharya S. Yunus A.A. Lima C.D. Schindler C. Blood. 2006; 108: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Macrophages were pretreated with IFN-αA/D (1000 units/ml, 2 h; PBL), murine IFN-γ (50 units/ml, 2h; PBL) and/or infected with L. pneumophila (MOI = 1). In some cases, cells were treated with L-NIL (100 μm, Sigma) or L-NMMA (1 mm, Sigma) at 30 min after infection. To more carefully explore the ability of IFNs to suppress L. pneumophila replication in mice, BMMs were prepared from three distinct murine backgrounds, A/J, 129 and C57Bl/6J, as well as IFNGR and IFNAR knock-out mice (28Müller U. Steinhoff U. Reis L.F. Hemmi S. Pavlovic J. Zinkernagel R.M. Aguet M. Science. 1994; 264: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). As anticipated, L. pneumophila replicated more effectively in A/J than C57Bl/6J BMMs. 129 macrophages exhibited an intermediate phenotype (see Fig. 1, A and B and Refs. 13Coers J. Vance R.E. Fontana M.F. Dietrich W.F. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 2344-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Akamine M. Higa F. Haranaga S. Tateyama M. Mori N. Heuner K. Fujita J. Microbiol.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 1266-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, IFN-γ pretreatment rendered all three genotypes, but not IFNGR(−/−) BMMs, resistant to infection (Fig. 1, A and D and Refs. 26Akamine M. Higa F. Haranaga S. Tateyama M. Mori N. Heuner K. Fujita J. Microbiol. Immunol. 2007; 51: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 42Deng J.C. Tateda K. Zeng X. Standiford T.J. Infect.

IFN-α also significantly suppressed L. pneumophila growth in all three genotypes, but not in IFNAR(−/−) macrophages (Fig. 1, B and D). Although IFN-α tended to be a bit less potent, (Fig. 1, A versus B, see also Figs. 4 and 7), it effectively suppressed the growth of both wild type and flagellin null (Fla−, panel E) L. pneumophila, in all genotypes (panels B and D; data not shown). This provided evidence that the response to IFN-Is is independent of Naip5 and the inflammasome (13Coers J. Vance R.E. Fontana M.F. Dietrich W.F. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 2344-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, L. pneumophila replicated significantly more efficiently in IFNAR(−/−) than the parental 129 macrophages (Fig. 1C), suggesting that L. pneumophila may stimulate IFN-I autocrine activity (see below and Refs. 13Coers J. Vance R.E. Fontana M.F. Dietrich W.F. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 2344-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 27Schiavoni G. Mauri C. Carlei D. Belardelli F. Pastoris M.C. Proietti E. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1266-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The lack of an analogous response in IFNGR(−/−) BMMs, likely reflects the inability of macrophages to secrete autocrine IFN-γ (data not shown).FIGURE 4Characterization of IFN-α-dependent response to L. pneumophila infection. A, L. pneumophila (JR-32) growth was evaluated in d6 A/J BMMs, after 2 h of pretreatment with 100 units/ml or 1000 units/ml of IFN-αA/D, as in Fig. 1. B, L. pneumophila growth was evaluated in A/J BMMs treated with IFN-αA/D (1000 units/ml) either at 2, 24, or 48 h after infection, as indicated. C, GFP-Fla− L. pneumophila growth in d6 C57Bl/6J BMMs was evaluated by FACS, 24 and 48 h after infection (MOI = 1). Macrophages were pretreated (2 h before infection) with one dose of IFN-αA/D (500 units/ml), or IFN-γ (50 units/ml). Cells were harvested, stained for MHC-II (I-Ab + anti-Strepavidin-APC; BD Pharmingen) and analyzed with LSRII and FlowJo software. Each study is representative of more than three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7NO production in IFN-stimulated and L. pneumophila-infected macrophages. A, culture supernatants were evaluated for NO production 48 h after infection of day 6 C57Bl/6J BMMs with L. pneumophila (GFP Fla−, MOI = 1). In some cases, native, IFN-αA/D- or IFN-γ-pretreated BMMs (as in Fig. 4C) were also treated with l-NIL (100 μm) or l-NMMA (1 mm) at 30 min after infection. B, C57Bl/6J BMMs, treated as in panel A, were evaluated 48 h after infection by FACS, as detailed in Fig. 4. The percentage of GFP-positive cells is indicated. These studies are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether L. pneumophila stimulated autocrine IFN-I production, IFN-β expression was evaluated by a sensitive Q-PCR assay (22Decker T. Müller M. Stockinger S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 44Hiscott J. Lin R. Nakhaei P. Paz S. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 53-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Both WT (denoted Lp) and Fla− L. pneumophila stimulated a robust 50–100-fold induction of IFN-β in C57Bl/6J macrophages (Fig. 2A). This response was maximal at 6 h after infection. However, dotA mutants, defective in type IV secretion and intracellular replication, did not stimulate IFN-β expression (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in A/J macrophages, indicating that the flagellin-Naip5 axis does not contribute to this response (Fig. 2B and Ref. 13Coers J. Vance R.E. Fontana M.F. Dietrich W.F. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 2344-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Control studies revealed that WT (Lp) and Fla− L. pneumophila stimulated strong TNF induction at both 3 and 6 h, whereas the response to dotA was considerably more transient (Fig. 2C). Moreover, this was associated with considerably lower quantities of secreted TNF (supplemental Fig. S1A and Ref. 13Coers J. Vance R.E. Fontana M.F. Dietrich W.F. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 2344-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 45Abu-Zant A. Jones S. Asare R. Suttles J. Price C. Graham J. Kwaik Y.A. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 246-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)). Likewise, only WT L. pneumophila stimulated robust IL-1β secretion (supplemental Fig. S1B). These results underscore the need for sustained intracellular growth to stimulate a strong inflammatory response (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, differences in the pattern and kinetics of cytokine expression suggested that IFN-β and TNF expression are directed by distinct L. pneumophila sensor systems, which are also independent of the Naip5-Ipaf axis. Two transcription factors, NF-κB and IRF-3, play an acute role in stimulating the expression of IFN-β (35Wang X. Hussain S. Wang E.J. Wang X. Li M.O. García-Sastre A. Beg A.A. J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 15325-15329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed that p50 and cRel are the major NF-κB transcription factors activated by LPS and L. pneumophila in murine macrophages (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C). Moreover, dotA-dependent NF-κB activation was considerably more transient than with either WT or Fla− L. pneumophila (supplemental Fig. S2C). To explore the potential role NF-κB subunits may play in IFN-I expression, p50 and cRel double knock-out BMMs were exploited (35Wang X. Hussain S. Wang E.J. Wang X. Li M.O. García-Sastre A. Beg A.A. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 6770-6776Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Upon infection with L. pneumophila, p50/cRel double knock-out macrophages exhibited a pattern of IFN-β expression that was analogous to control C57Bl/6J cells (Fig. 3A). Curiously, the p50/cRel double knock-out macrophages displayed increased IFN-β induction when they were infected with dotA or stimulated with LPS, underscoring a potentially complex counter regulatory role recently highlighted for NF-κB (13Coers J. Vance R.E. Fontana M.F. Dietrich W.F. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 2344-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 45Abu-Zant A. Jones S. Asare R. Suttles J. Price C. Graham J. Kwaik Y.A.

Hussain S. Zheng Y. Sanjabi S. Ouaaz F. Beg A.A. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 6777-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, L. pneumophila replicated normally in p50/cRel double knock-out BMMs (supplemental Fig. S2D). These observations indicate that NF-κB does not significantly contribute to L. pneumophila-dependent IFN-I response. Next, the potential role IRF-3 plays in directing the L. pneumophila dependent expression of IFN-β was evaluated. This analysis exploited IRF3(−/−) BMMs, thereby avoiding the more limited sensitivity of biochemical assays for IRF-3 activity (34Stockinger S. Reutterer B. Schaljo B. Schellack C. Brunner S. Materna T. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Taniguchi T. Murray P.J. Müller M. Decker T. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7416-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As above, WT and Fla− L. pneumophila both stimulated a robust induction of IFN-β expression in control C57Bl/6J BMMs (Fig. 3B). However, IFN-β expression was absent in IRF3(−/−) BMMs, underscoring the important role this transcription factor plays in regulating the IFN-I autocrine loop (14Stetson D.B. Medzhitov R.

https://openalex.org/W2085975068,"Long-wavelength ultraviolet (UVA-1) radiation causes oxidative stress that modifies cellular molecules. To defend themselves against noxious oxidation products, skin cells produce detoxifying enzymes and antioxidants. We have recently shown that UVA-1 oxidized the abundant membrane phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PAPC), which then induced the stress-response protein heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in dermal fibroblasts. Here we examined the effects of UVA-1- and UV-oxidized phospholipids on global gene expression in human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. We identified a cluster of genes that were coinduced by UVA-1-oxidized PAPC and UVA-1 radiation. The cluster included HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit, aldo-keto reductases-1-C1 and -C2, and IL-8. These genes are members of the cellular stress response system termed ""antioxidant response."" Accordingly, the regulatory regions of all of these genes contain binding sites for NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a major regulator of the antioxidant response. Both UVA-1 irradiation and treatment with oxidized lipids led to increased nuclear accumulation and DNA binding of NRF2. Silencing and deficiency of NRF2 suppressed the antioxidant response. Taken together, our data show that UVA-1-mediated lipid oxidation induces expression of antioxidant response genes, which is dependent on the redox-regulated transcription factor NRF2. Our findings suggest a different view on UV-generated lipid mediators that were commonly regarded as detrimental"
https://openalex.org/W1970464019,"Hyperosmotic stress triggers a great variety of adaptive responses in eukaryotic cells that affect many different physiological functions. Here we investigate the role of the mitochondria during osmostress adaptation in budding yeast. Mitochondrial function is generally required for proper salt and osmotic stress adaptation because mutants with defects in many different mitochondrial components show hypersensitivity to increased NaCl and KCl concentrations. Mitochondrial protein abundance rapidly increases upon osmoshock in a selective manner, because it affects Calvin cycle enzymes (Sdh2 and Cit1) and components of the electron transport chain (Cox6) but not the ATP synthase complex (Atp5). Transcription of the SDH2, CIT1, and COX6 genes is severalfold induced within the first minutes of osmotic shock, dependent to various degree on the Hog1 and Snf1 protein kinases. Mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase enzyme activity is stimulated upon osmostress in a Snf1-dependent manner. The osmosensitivity of mitochondrial mutants is not caused by impaired stress-activated transcription or by a general depletion of the cellular ATP pool during osmostress. We finally show that the growth defect of mitochondrial mutants in high salt medium can be partially rescued by supplementation of glutathione. Additionally, mitochondrial defects cause the hyperaccumulation of reactive oxygen species during salt stress. Our results indicate that the antioxidant function of the mitochondria might play an important role in adaptation to hyperosmotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1985916344,"Background Bacterial and fungal infections induce a potent immune response in Drosophila melanogaster, but it is unclear whether viral infections induce an antiviral immune response. Using microarrays, we examined the changes in gene expression in Drosophila that occur in response to infection with the sigma virus, a negative-stranded RNA virus (Rhabdoviridae) that occurs in wild populations of D. melanogaster. Principal Findings We detected many changes in gene expression in infected flies, but found no evidence for the activation of the Toll, IMD or Jak-STAT pathways, which control immune responses against bacteria and fungi. We identified a number of functional categories of genes, including serine proteases, ribosomal proteins and chorion proteins that were overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes. We also found that the sigma virus alters the expression of many more genes in males than in females. Conclusions These data suggest that either Drosophila do not mount an immune response against the sigma virus, or that the immune response is not controlled by known immune pathways. If the latter is true, the genes that we identified as differentially expressed after infection are promising candidates for controlling the host's response to the sigma virus."
https://openalex.org/W2033470525,"Background Frequent somatic mutations have recently been identified in the ras-like domain of the heterotrimeric G protein α-subunit (GNAQ) in blue naevi 83%, malignant blue naevi (50%) and ocular melanoma of the uvea (46%). The mutations exclusively affect codon 209 and result in GNAQ constitutive activation which, in turn, acts as a dominant oncogene. Methodology To assess if the mutations are present in other tumor types we performed a systematic mutational profile of the GNAQ exon 5 in a panel of 922 neoplasms, including glioblastoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), blue naevi, skin melanoma, bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreas, and thyroid carcinomas. Principal Findings We detected the previously reported mutations in 6/13 (46%) blue naevi. Changes affecting Q209 were not found in any of the other tumors. Our data indicate that the occurrence of GNAQ mutations display a unique pattern being present in a subset of melanocytic tumors but not in malignancies of glial, epithelial and stromal origin analyzed in this study."

However, we report here that recruitment of SWI/SNF to target genes of estrogen receptor α (ERα) requires the previously described nuclear receptor coactivator protein Flightless-I (Fli-I). Fli-I can bind directly to both ER and BAF53, an actin-related component of the SWI/SNF complex, suggesting that Fli-I may recruit SWI/SNF to ER target genes via interaction with BAF53. Point mutations in Fli-I that disrupt binding to ER or BAF53 compromised the ability of Fli-I to enhance ER-mediated activation of a transiently transfected reporter gene. Depletion of endogenous Fli-I or BAF53 inhibited estrogen-responsive expression of endogenous target genes of ER, indicating a critical role for Fli-I and BAF53. Moreover, depletion of endogenous Fli-I or BAF53 specifically eliminated part of the complex cyclical pattern of recruitment of SWI/SNF to estrogen-responsive promoters in a way that indicates multiple roles and multiple mechanisms of recruitment for SWI/SNF in estrogen-dependent target gene expression.

Chromatin remodeling for transcriptional regulation involves protein complexes with two distinct types of enzymatic activities, i.e. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and posttranslational histone modification. The four major classes of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, SWI/SNF, ISWI, Mi-2/NuRD, and INO80, are characterized by the identity of their ATPase subunit (1Peterson C.L. Workman J.L.

Recent studies identified Flightless-I (Fli-I) as a transcriptional coactivator for NRs, including estrogen receptor α (ERα) and thyroid hormone receptor, in transient reporter gene assays (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Fli-I has a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region at its N terminus and a C-terminal gelsolin-like domain (Fig. 1A) which places it in the gelsolin protein family (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Like other members of the gelsolin family, Fli-I binds to actin and actin-related proteins (15Davy D.A. Ball E.E. Matthaei K.I. Campbell H.D. Crouch M.F. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Davy D.A. Campbell H.D. Fountain S. de Jong D. Crouch M.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 549-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also like gelsolin, the C-terminal gelsolin-like domain of Fli-I consists of two large tandem repeats, each of which contains three smaller repeats (Fig. 1A); in gelsolin, each small repeat folds as an independent structural module (17Urosev D. Ma Q. Tan A.L. Robinson R.C. Burtnick L.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although we previously showed that Fli-I is required for activation of a transient reporter gene by steroid hormones (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which Fli-I contributes to transcriptional activation of NR target genes is unknown. Our finding that Fli-I interacts directly with NRs and BAF53 (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which is an actin-related protein component of SWI/SNF complexes (4Trotter K.W. Archer T.K. Nucl. Recept.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2619-2622PubMed Google Scholar), suggests a possible functional relationship between Fli-I and SWI/SNF. This led us to propose that Fli-I might be responsible for recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex to steroid hormone-responsive promoters (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the current study we, therefore, tested whether depletion of Fli-I by siRNA affected the estrogen-dependent expression of endogenous ER target genes and recruitment of SWI/SNF to the corresponding promoters of ER target genes. Our findings indicate an important role for Fli-I in the transcription initiation process and the function of SWI/SNF and support a model for multiple roles of SWI/SNF complexes in estrogen-dependent transcription of ER target genes.

GST protein expression vectors encoding the following proteins were constructed by inserting the appropriate cDNA coding region into EcoRI and XhoI sites of the vector: pGEX4T1-LRR (amino acids 1–494), pGEX4T1-GelA (amino acids 495–822), pGEX4T1-GelB (amino acids 825–1269), pGEX4T1-G1 (amino acids 495–597), pGEX4T1-G3 (amino acids 710–822). His-tagged full-length Fli-I (pTriEX4-Fli-I) was created by PCR amplification of pCDNA-Fli-I and subcloning into NcoI and XhoI sites of pTriEX4 vector (Novagen). pTriEX4-Fli-I-ΔG1 lacking amino acids 495–597 was generated by two-step PCR amplification and insertion. The first PCR product comprised of the first 1410 bp of Fli-I cDNA was inserted into NcoI and BamHI sites of pTriEX4, and the second PCR fragment comprised of bp 1719–3801 was inserted into the XmaI site within the previous insert and the XhoI site in pTriEX4 vector. Point mutations in Fli-I, GelA, and G1 were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). BRG1 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Anthony N. Imbalzano (University of Massachusetts Medical School). The procedure for GST pulldown assays was described previously (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain and purified by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads and washing with NETN buffer (300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.01% Nonidet P-40). His-tagged BAF53 and Fli-I were also expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). FLAG-tagged Fli-I fragments were synthesized by transcription and translation in vitro using the TNT-Quick-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For coimmunoprecipitation assay, 293T cells were plated at 1.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish and transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and the indicated amount of plasmids. At 48 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared in 1.0 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2 mm EDTA). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) using the following antibodies: anti-His, anti-ERα, anti-Fli-I, anti-BRG1, anti-BAF53, anti-β-actin, anti-GAL4DBD, and normal mouse or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-HA (Roche Applied Science); anti-FLAG (Sigma Aldrich). ChIP assays were performed according to previously described protocols (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF7 cells were transfected with siRNA and then cultured for 3 days in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum. At ∼90% confluency cells were treated with 100 nm estradiol (E2) or vehicle for the indicated time. After cross-linking with formaldehyde, cell extracts were prepared from control and E2-treated MCF7 cells. Immunoprecipitation of sonicated chromatin solutions was conducted by overnight incubation at 4 °C with normal mouse or rabbit IgG, anti-ERα, anti-Fli-I, anti-BRG1, anti-TRAP220 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-RNA polymerase II (Millipore). Cross-linking was reversed by heating, and immunoprecipitated DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA was dissolved in 100 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA) and analyzed by quantitative PCR using the Stratagene Mx3000P system with SYBR Green dye.

We previously showed that Fli-I enhances and is required for efficient NR mediated transcription of transiently transfected reporter genes (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here we examined endogenous ER target genes in MCF7 cells. Compared with siNS, siRNA specific for Fli-I (siFli-I) effectively reduced Fli-I mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1B). Fli-I siRNA also significantly inhibited E2-dependent expression of the endogenous pS2, GREB1, and cathepsin D genes (Fig. 1C, showing the mean and S.D. from the results of seven independent experiments). For the seven independent experiments, the reduction of Fli-I mRNA levels was 57 ± 13%, and the -fold induction of ER target gene expression by E2 was reduced by 48 ± 14% for pS2 mRNA (p < 0.01 by paired, two-tailed t test), 47 ± 8% for GREB1 mRNA (p < 0.01), and 49 ± 21% for cathepsin D mRNA (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C and supplemental Table S1). The percentages given above for the effect of siRNA on ER target gene expression represent the % reduction in the E2-induced mRNA level after subtracting out the basal mRNA level (as basal expression was not significantly affected by the Fli-I-specific siRNA); see supplemental Table S1 for the formula used in the calculation. Although knockdown efficiency of Fli-I varied from experiment to experiment, there was a strong linear correlation between reduction of Fli-I mRNA and reduction of E2-induced levels of pS2 mRNA with an R2 correlation coefficient of 0.83 (Fig. 1C). The reduction of Fli-I mRNA level by another siRNA targeting a different part of the coding region of Fli-I caused a similar inhibition of ER target gene expression (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, Fli-I is required for hormonal induction of ER target genes in MCF7 cells. We previously showed that Fli-I binds to full-length ER (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell.

ER-ligand binding domain (LBD) fused to GST bound in vitro in an E2-dependent manner to the GelA domain (amino acids 495–822) of Fli-I but not to the LRR domain (amino acids 1–494) or the GelB domain (amino acids 825–1269) (Fig. 2A). In similar GST pulldown assays with each of the three repetitive subregions of GelA (Fig. 1A), only the third repeat (G3, amino acids 710–822) bound ER-LBD, and binding was E2-dependent, indicating that G3 is the major binding site for ER-LBD (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Conversely, GST-tagged G3 bound an in vitro translated ER fragment consisting of the DNA binding domain (DBD) and LBD in a hormone-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Interestingly, the G3 fragment contains an LXXLL motif (where L represents leucine, and X denotes any amino acid) which is observed in many coactivators that interact with hormone-activated NR. To determine whether the LXXLL motif in G3 is required for the hormone-dependent interaction with ERα, a GST pulldown assay was performed using a mutant GelA fragment with Leu-769 and Leu-770 changed to Ala (i.e. LXXLL to LXXAA). This mutation eliminated binding of GelA to hormone-activated ERα (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the same mutation in His-tagged full-length Fli-I almost completely eliminated binding to ERα LBD compared with wild type Fli-I (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the ER-Fli-I interaction is direct, that the G3 gelsolin repeat is the primary site in Fli-I for binding to ER LBD, and that the LXXLL motif is critical for this interaction. We previously demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation that the GelA fragment of Fli-I binds BAF53, an actin-like component of the SWI/SNF complex (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In further mapping studies, deletion of the G1 module (amino acids 495–597) from His-tagged full-length Fli-I substantially decreased co-immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged BAF53 by anti-His-tag antibodies from total cell extracts of transiently transfected 293T cells (Fig. 3A). Thus, the G1 fragment is required for binding of BAF53 to full-length Fli-I. Furthermore, purified recombinant His-tagged BAF53 was bound by GST-tagged GelA, but not by GST-LRR or GST-GelB, indicating that the GelA-BAF53 interaction is direct (Fig. 3B). The G1 fragment of GelA was sufficient to bind BAF53 (Fig. 3C). A Glu-to-Lys mutation in the first actin binding motif of the protein gelsolin reduces binding of gelsolin to actin (25Way M. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the analogous E585K mutation in the G1 motif of Fli-I reduced binding of the GelA fragment of Fli-I to BAF53 (14Lee Y.H. Campbell H.D. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2103-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The same mutation in full-length Fli-I substantially reduced binding to BAF53 (Fig. 3D). This result confirmed that G1 is the primary BAF53 binding site in Fli-I and that Glu585 in full-length Fli-I is critically involved in the interaction with BAF53. In contrast, purified recombinant BAF53 did not bind to GST-ER-LBD (Fig. 3E); thus, any association between BAF53 and ER would have to be indirect and could potentially be mediated by Fli-I. Components of the SWI/SNF complex form a very strong protein complex which is stable even in 3 m urea, and most SWI/SNF subunits (e.g. BRG1, human Brahma, and BAFs) exist in complexes in vivo (26Zhao K. Wang W. Rando O.J. Xue Y. Swiderek K. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). We failed to observe direct interaction of BRG1 with Fli-I (data not shown), but we found that the GelA fragment of Fli-I binds to BAF53 directly (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we speculated that Fli-I recruits the SWI/SNF complex via interaction with BAF53. Among the three actin binding motifs in the GelA region, the G1 fragment showed strong autonomous transcriptional activation when fused to Gal4 DBD (Fig. 4A), and we also found that the G1 fragment is sufficient to interact with BAF53 (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex by G1 may account for the transcriptional activation. The observation that the G1(E585K) mutant protein, which does not bind to BAF53, showed much weaker transcriptional activation (Fig. 4B) supports our hypothesis that Fli-I recruits the SWI/SNF complex via the interaction with BAF53 to activate ER-mediated transcription. To assess whether Fli-I requires interaction with ER or the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex for its coactivator function, we performed ER-mediated reporter gene assays in SW13 cells. The SW13 cell line contains no detectable BRG1 or human Brahma proteins (the ATPase core subunits of SWI/SNF) but nonetheless contains all the BAF subunits of the SWI/SNF complex (6Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 27Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). ER-mediated activation of estrogen-responsive genes was diminished in these cells, but reintroduction of the BRG1 protein induces formation of a functional SWI/SNF complex and restores estrogen stimulated gene expression, indicating that SWI/SNF activity is essential for estrogen receptor-mediated transcription. In our study wild type GelA, GelA(E/K) or GelA(LL/AA) were transiently expressed with ERα in the absence or presence of co-expressed BRG1. In the absence of BRG1, ERα failed to activate transcription efficiently in the presence of E2 (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–2). However, expression of BRG1 in SW13 cells by transient transfection restored hormone-dependent activation of the reporter gene (lanes 3–4). Interestingly, the level of transcription was synergistically enhanced by co-expression of BRG1 with GelA (lanes 6–7), which can bind to ER through the G3 motif and to BAF53 in the SWI/SNF complex through the G1 motif. However, GelA alone did not activate reporter gene expression in the absence of BRG1 (lane 5). In contrast, the GelA(E585K) mutant, which does not bind to BAF53, and the GelA(LL/AA) mutant, which does not bind to ERα, failed to cooperate functionally with BRG1 and ERα (Fig. 4C, lanes 8–13). These results further support the ability of Fli-I to recruit the SWI/SNF complex to ER target promoters by the interaction of GelA with ERα through the leucine-rich motif (LXXLL) in G3 and by the interaction of GelA with BAF53 through the G1 motif. Results from our protein interaction and transient reporter gene assays (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4) indicated that the interaction of Fli-I with ER and with the SWI/SNF subunit BAF53 are critical for the coactivator function of Fli-I. Therefore, we tested whether Fli-I is involved in recruitment of SWI/SNF to the promoter region of an endogenous ER target gene. E2 treatment results in cyclical recruitment of ER and various coregulators to the pS2 promoter in MCF7 cells (28Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M.

ERα and Fli-I were associated with the pS2 promoter at 30 and 60 min after E2 treatment of MCF7 cells (Fig. 5A), but Fli-I was not recruited to the pS2 coding region (Fig. 5B), demonstrating regional specificity of Fli-I recruitment. A more detailed time course of Fli-I occupancy on the pS2 promoter during E2 treatment found that there were two peaks of Fli-I occupancy around 20 and 80 min of E2 treatment (supplemental Fig. S2). E2 also induced occupancy of BRG1 on the pS2 promoter at 30 min; BRG1 occupancy was reduced to the uninduced level at 60 min (Fig. 5A), consistent with the different timing previously observed for recruitment of BRG1 versus ER (30Métivier R. Penot G. Hübner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Next, transfection with siRNA was used to test whether Fli-I is required for recruitment of BRG1 to the pS2 promoter in response to E2. The siRNA against Fli-I reduced the endogenous cellular level of Fli-I protein and mRNA but had no effect on the level of ERα, BRG1, BAF53, or actin protein (Fig. 6C, two right panels). Using MCF7 cells transfected with nonspecific or Fli-I-specific siRNA, we analyzed the occupancy of ER and selected coregulators and RNA polymerase II on the pS2 promoter at time points between 0 and 120 min after adding E2. Although the peaks are small, we consistently observed three distinct cycles of ERα recruitment to the pS2 promoter during 120 min of E2 treatment, consistent with previous reports (30Métivier R.

https://openalex.org/W2017261329,"Prominin1 (Prom1, also known as CD133 in human) has been widely used as a marker for cancer stem cells (CSCs), which self-renew and are tumorigenic, in malignant tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, there is other evidence showing that Prom1-negative cancer cells also form tumors in vivo. Thus it remains controversial whether Prom1 is a bona fide marker for CSCs. To verify if Prom1-expressing cells are essential for tumorigenesis, we established a mouse line, whose Prom1-expressing cells can be eliminated conditionally by a Cre-inducible DTA gene on the Prom1 locus together with a tamoxifen-inducible CreERTM, and generated glioma-initiating cells (GICs-LD) by overexpressing both the SV40 Large T antigen and an oncogenic H-RasL61 in neural stem cells of the mouse line. We show here that the tamoxifen-treated GICs-LD (GICs-DTA) form tumor-spheres in culture and transplantable GBM in vivo. Thus, our studies demonstrate that Prom1-expressing cells are dispensable for gliomagenesis in this mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W2012638054,"Background Motor proficiency is positively associated with physical activity levels. The aim of this study is to investigate associations between the timing of infant motor development and subsequent sports participation during adolescence. Methods Prospective observational study. The study population consisted of 9,009 individuals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. Motor development was assessed by parental report at age 1 year, using age at walking with support and age at standing unaided. At follow up aged 14 years, data were collected on the school grade awarded for physical education (PE). Self report was used to collect information on the frequency of sports participation and number of different sports reported. Principal Findings Earlier infant motor development was associated with improved school PE grade, for age at walking supported (p<0.001) and standing unaided (p = <0.001). Earlier infant motor development, in terms of age at walking supported, was positively associated with the number of different sports reported (p = 0.003) and with a greater frequency of sports participation (p = 0.043). These associations were independent of gestational age and birth weight, as well as father's social class and body mass index at age 14 years. Conclusions Earlier infant motor development may predict higher levels of physical activity as indicated by higher school PE grade, participation in a greater number of different types of sports and increased frequency of sports participation. Identification of young children with slower motor development may allow early targeted interventions to improve motor skills and thereby increase physical activity in later life."
https://openalex.org/W2022546100,"Gastric distention (GD), as it occurs during meal ingestion, signals a full stomach and it is one of the key mechanisms controlling food intake. Previous studies on GD showed lower activation of the amygdala for subjects with higher body mass index (BMI). Since obese subjects have dopaminergic deficits that correlate negatively with BMI and the amygdala is innervated by dopamine neurons, we hypothesized that BMI would correlate negatively with activation not just in the amygdala but also in other dopaminergic brain regions (midbrain and hypothalamus).We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate brain activation during GD in 24 healthy subjects with BMI range of 20-39 kg/m(2). Using multiple regression and cross-correlation analyses based on a family-wise error corrected threshold P = 0.05, we show that during slow GD to maximum volumes of 500 ml and 700 ml subjects with increased BMI had increased activation in cerebellum and left posterior insula, and decreased activation of dopaminergic (amygdala, midbrain, hypothalamus, thalamus) and serotonergic (pons) brain regions and anterior insula, regions that were functionally interconnected with one another.The negative correlation between BMI and BOLD responses to gastric distention in dopaminergic (midbrain, hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus) and serotonergic (pons) brain regions is consistent with disruption of dopaminergic and serotonergic signaling in obesity. In contrast the positive correlation between BMI and BOLD responses in posterior insula and cerebellum suggests an opposing mechanism that promotes food intake in obese subjects that may underlie their ability to consume at once large food volumes despite increasing gastric distention."
https://openalex.org/W2140019582,"Background There is a need for biomarkers insuring identification of septic patients at high-risk for death. We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study to investigate the time-course of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) serum levels in patients with severe sepsis and examined whether serial serum levels of LBP could be used as a marker of outcome. Methodology/Principal Findings LBP serum levels at study entry, at 48 hours and at day-7 were measured in 180 patients with severe sepsis. Data regarding the nature of infections, disease severity, development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and intensive care unit (ICU) outcome were recorded. LBP serum levels were similar in survivors and non-survivors at study entry (117.4±75.7 µg/mL vs. 129.8±71.3 µg/mL, P = 0.249) but there were significant differences at 48 hours (77.2±57.0 vs. 121.2±73.4 µg/mL, P<0.0001) and at day-7 (64.7±45.8 vs. 89.7±61.1 µg/ml, p = 0.017). At 48 hours, LBP levels were significantly higher in ARDS patients than in ALI patients (112.5±71.8 µg/ml vs. 76.6±55.9 µg/ml, P = 0.0001). An increase of LBP levels at 48 hours was associated with higher mortality (odds ratio 3.97; 95%CI: 1.84–8.56; P<0.001). Conclusions/Significance Serial LBP serum measurements may offer a clinically useful biomarker for identification of patients with severe sepsis having the worst outcomes and the highest probability of developing sepsis-induced ARDS."
https://openalex.org/W2077648407,"Hepatic gluconeogenesis is tightly balanced by opposing stimulatory (glucagon) and inhibitory (insulin) signaling pathways. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic growth factor that mediates diverse biological processes. In this study, we investigated the effect of HGF and its family member, macrophage-stimulating factor (MSP), on hepatic gluconeogenesis in primary hepatocytes. HGF and MSP significantly repressed expression of the key hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) and reduced glucose production. HGF and MSP activated small heterodimer partner (SHP) gene promoter and induced SHP mRNA and protein levels, and the effect of HGF and MSP on SHP gene expression was demonstrated to be mediated via activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. We demonstrated that upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1) specifically mediated HGF effect on SHP gene expression, and inhibition of USF-1 by dominant negative USF-1 significantly abrogated HGF-mediated activation of the SHP promoter. Elucidation of the mechanism showed that USF-1 bound to E-box-1 in the SHP promoter, and HGF increased USF-1 DNA binding on the SHP promoter via AMPK and DNA-dependent protein kinase-mediated pathways. Adenoviral overexpression of USF-1 significantly repressed PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase gene expression and reduced glucose production. Knockdown of endogenous SHP expression significantly reversed this effect. Finally, knockdown of SHP or inhibition of AMPK signaling reversed the ability of HGF to suppress hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha-mediated up-regulation of PEPCK and Glc-6-Pase gene expression along with the HGF- and MSP-mediated suppression of gluconeogenesis. Overall, our results suggest a novel signaling pathway through HGF/AMPK/USF-1/SHP to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2061294693,"S-nitrosylation is an important mediator of multiple nitric oxide-dependent biological processes, including eukaryotic cellular events such as macrophage apoptosis and proinflammatory signaling. Many pathogenic bacteria possess NO detoxification mechanisms, such as the nitric oxide reductase (NorB) of Neisseria meningitidis and the flavohemoglobins (Hmp) of Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli, which serve to protect the microorganism from nitrosative stress within the intracellular environment. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of meningococcal NorB increases the rate at which low-molecular-weight S-nitrosothiol (SNO) decomposes in vitro. To determine whether this effect occurs in cells during infection by bacteria, we induced SNO formation in murine macrophages by activation with lipopolysaccharide and gamma-interferon and observed a reduced abundance of SNO during coincubation with N. meningitidis, S. enterica, or E. coli. In each case, this effect was shown to be dependent on bacterial NO detoxification genes, which act to prevent SNO formation through the removal of NO. This may represent a novel mechanism of host cell injury by bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2069399078,"Since the spring of 1977, two subtypes of influenza A virus (H3N2 and H1N1) have been seasonally infecting the human population. In this work we study the distribution of patient ages within the populations that exhibit the symptomatic disease caused by each of the different subtypes of seasonal influenza viruses. When the publicly available extensive information is pooled across multiple geographical locations and seasons, striking differences emerge between these subtypes. We report that the symptomatic flu due to H1N1 is distributed mainly in a younger population relative to H3N2. (The median age of the H3N2 patients is 23 years while H1N1 patients are 9 years old.) These distinct characteristic spectra of age groups, possibly carried over from previous pandemics, are consistent with previous reports from various regional population studies and also findings on the evolutionary dynamics of each subtype. Moreover, they are relevant to age-related risk assessments, modeling of epidemiological networks for specific age groups, and age-specific vaccine design. Recently, a novel H1N1 virus has spread around the world. Preliminary reports suggest that this new strain causes symptomatic disease in the younger population in a similar fashion to the seasonal H1N1 strains."

The identification of unique biomarker patterns associated with airway dominant versus parenchymal dominant patterns would support the existence of unique phenotypes representing independent biologic processes. A cross-sectional study was performed to examine the association of serum biomarkers with radiographic airway and parenchymal phenotypes of COPD.Serum from 234 subjects enrolled in a CT screening cohort was analyzed for 33 cytokines and growth factors using a multiplex protein array. The association of serum markers with forced expiratory volume in one second percent predicted (FEV1%) and quantitative CT measurements of airway thickening and emphysema was assessed with and without stratification for current smoking status. Significant associations were found with several serum inflammatory proteins and measurements of FEV1%, airway thickening, and parenchymal emphysema independent of smoking status. The association of select analytes with airway thickening and emphysema was independent of FEV1%. Furthermore, the relationship between other inflammatory markers and measurements of physiologic obstruction or airway thickening was dependent on current smoking status.Airway and parenchymal phenotypes of COPD are associated with unique systemic serum biomarker profiles. Serum biomarker patterns may provide a more precise classification of the COPD syndrome, provide insights into disease pathogenesis and identify targets for novel patient-specific biological therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2016495202,"MicroRNAs play a critical role in many essential cellular functions in the mammalian species. However, limited information is available regarding the regulation of miRNAs gene transcription. Microarray profiling and real-time PCR analysis revealed a marked down-regulation of miR-206 in nuclear receptor SHP−/− mice. To understand the regulatory function of SHP with regard to miR-206 gene expression, we determined the putative transcriptional initiation site of miR-206 and also its full length primary transcript using a database mining approach and RACE. We identified the transcription factor AP1 binding sites on the miR-206 promoter and further showed that AP1 (c-Jun and c-Fos) induced miR-206 promoter transactivity and expression which was repressed by YY1. ChIP analysis confirmed the physical association of AP1 (c-Jun) and YY1 with the endogenous miR-206 promoter. In addition, we also identified nuclear receptor ERRγ (NR3B3) binding site on the YY1 promoter and showed that YY1 promoter was transactivated by ERRγ, which was inhibited by SHP (NROB2). ChIP analysis confirmed the ERRγ binding to the YY1 promoter. Forced expression of SHP and AP1 induced miR-206 expression while overexpression of ERRγ and YY1 reduced its expression. The effects of AP1, ERRγ, and YY1 on miR-206 expression were reversed by siRNA knockdown of each gene, respectively. Thus, we propose a novel cascade “dual inhibitory” mechanism governing miR-206 gene transcription by SHP: SHP inhibition of ERRγ led to decreased YY1 expression and the de-repression of YY1 on AP1 activity, ultimately leading to the activation of miR-206. This is the first report to elucidate a cascade regulatory mechanism governing miRNAs gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2003960951,"Upon IgE-mediated activation, mast cells (MC) exocytose their cytoplasmic secretory granules and release a variety of bioactive substances that trigger inflammatory responses. Polyamines mediate numerous cellular and physiological functions. We report here that MCs express antizyme inhibitor 2 (AZIN2), an activator of polyamine biosynthesis, previously reported to be exclusively expressed in the brain and testis. We have investigated the intracellular localization of AZIN2 both in resting and activated MCs. In addition, we have examined the functional role of polyamines, downstream effectors of AZIN2, as potential regulators of MC activity.Immunostainings show that AZIN2 is expressed in primary and neoplastic human and rodent MCs. We demonstrate that AZIN2 localizes in the Vamp-8 positive, serotonin-containing subset of MC granules, but not in tryptase-containing granules, as revealed by double immunofluorescence stainings. Furthermore, activation of MCs induces rapid upregulation of AZIN2 expression and its redistribution, suggesting a role for AZIN2 in secretory granule exocytosis. We also demonstrate that release of serotonin from activated MCs is polyamine-dependent whereas release of histamine and beta-hexosaminidase is not, indicating a granule subtype-specific function for polyamines.The study reports for the first time the expression of AZIN2 outside the brain and testis, and demonstrates the intracellular localization of endogenous AZIN2 in MCs. The granule subtype-specific expression and its induction after MC activation suggest a role for AZIN2 as a local, in situ regulator of polyamine biosynthesis in association with serotonin-containing granules of MCs. Furthermore, our data indicates a novel function for polyamines as selective regulators of serotonin release from MCs."

Although the effects of metal ion binding on eukaryotic mRNAs have not been extensively studied, Mg2+ is known to cause changes in conformation, shown by changes in radical cleavage sites of IRE-RNA with 1,10-phenanthrolene-iron and proton shifts in the one-dimensional NMR spectrum (12Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Wang Y.H. Sczekan S.R. Theil E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Mg2+ effects are observed at low magnesium concentrations (0.1–0.5 mm) and low molar stoichiometries (1:1 and 2:1 = Mg:RNA). We hypothesized that Fe2+ could directly change the binding of the IRE-mRNA to the iron regulatory protein for several reasons. First, other metal ions influence the IRE-RNA structure (12Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Wang Y.H. Sczekan S.R. Theil E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Second, in IRE-RNA/IRP cocrystals there are exposed RNA sites in the IRE-RNA/IRP complex that are accessible for interactions (13Walden W.E. Selezneva A.I. Dupuy J. Volbeda A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Theil E.C. Volz K. Science. 2006; 314: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Third, regions in the IRE-RNA are hypersensitive to Fe2+-EDTA/ascorbate/H2O2, suggesting selective interactions with metals and/or solvent (28Harrell C.M. McKenzie A.R. Patino M.M. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 4166-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We now report that Fe2+ weakens IRE-RNA/IRP binding, whereas Mg2+ requires 100 times the concentration and Mn2+ is comparable with Fe2+; the Fe2+ effect was diminished in mutant IRE-RNA and IRE-RNA selective in wild type sequences: ferritin IRE-RNA > mt-aconitase IRE-RNA. Isolation of recombinant rabbit IRP1 from yeast used previously described methods (29Erlitzki R. Long J.C. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42579-42587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). RNA oligonucleotides for frog ferritin H, frog ferritin H ΔU6, and mt-aconitase (30, 29, and 29 nucleotides, respectively) were purchased from Genelink (Hawthorne, NY). The frog H (FerH) IRE-RNA was used as a model because of extensive structural information, e.g. “footprinting,” solution NMR, x-ray diffraction of cocrystals with IRP, and direct comparisons between natural, poly(A), 5′-UTR-IRE mRNA, with full-length transcripts and RNA aptamers (28Harrell C.M.

J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After dissolving in 40 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, RNA was melted and annealed as described (31Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), by heating to 85 °C for 15 min with slow cooling to 25 °C. Melting and annealing decreased the Kd by ∼5-fold for the ferritin-IRE-RNA but had little effect on the mt-aconitase IRE-RNA. Protein fluorescence intensities (332 nm (280 nm excitation)) were corrected for dilution, as needed, and for inner filter effects; maximum dilutions were <7%. Nonlinear least squares fitting of the data used KaleidaGraph software (version 2.1.3; Abelbeck Software). Ethidium bromide fluorescence was measured at 595 nm, with excitation at 510 nm. Scatchard analysis of EtBr binding used KaleidaGraph software. Solutions of Fe2+-O2, Mg2+, or Mn2+ were added to both RNA and protein solutions at the same concentrations, and the solutions were incubated separately for 15 min before adding to binding buffer that contained the same metal ion concentration as the RNA and protein solutions. RNA and protein mixtures were incubated in binding buffer (29Erlitzki R. Long J.C. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42579-42587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), 40 mm HEPES/K+, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, for 15 min at 25 °C, before making fluorescence measurements. When Fe2+ was used, all incubations were anaerobic. The protein concentration was 0.1 μm and the RNA concentration varied from 0 to 1.0 μm; because of tight binding, 0.05 μm protein was also analyzed for ferritin RNA titrations to determine Kd. The order of addition to the binding buffer had no effect on the results. In the case of Fe2+, nitrogen-purged solutions of 0.1 m HCl used to dissolve FeSO4 and inhibit oxidation were diluted to 0.001 m H+ and further diluted 1:100 into the RNA or protein solutions. Solutions of RNA and protein ± Fe2+-O2 were prepared as in the solution studies. Free and bound RNA was resolved by electrophoresis (EMSA) in 1% agarose gels followed by staining with ethidium bromide. The RNA concentrations were 0.1 μm and protein concentrations varied from 0 to 2.0 μm. We selected two IRE-mRNAs to study, ferritin and mt-aconitase, because iron induces the synthesis of both proteins in whole animals and cells and because the iron responses are different: iron induces ferritin synthesis in the liver more than ∼150-fold and in mt-aconitase ∼4-fold (32Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The two IRE-RNA structures are different (Fig. 2) as is the binding of IRP2 and IRP1 in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (31Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When the Kd for IRP1 binding to the two IRE-RNAs was determined by protein fluorescence quenching, the values differed 10-fold (Figs. 2 and 3).FIGURE 3Fe2+ selectively weakens IRE-RNA/IRP1 interactions. A, IRE-RNA binding to IRP was measured, ±Fe2+-O2, as IRP1 fluorescence quenching in solution (constant protein concentration) as described in the legend to Fig. 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The IRE-RNAs used were FerH IRE-RNA, FerH ΔU6 IRE-RNA, and mt-aconitase IRE-RNA. Data were analyzed as previously described (45Khan M.A. Miyoshi H. Gallie D.R. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1340-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 46Firpo M.A. Connelly M.B. Goss D.J. Dahlberg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4693-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Kd values are the averages of three titrations. Relative stabilities (1/Kd) of the IRE-RNA·IRP1 complexes are used in the graph, right. B, IRE-RNA binding to IRP ± Fe2+-O2, was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (constant RNA concentration). Anaerobic solutions of RNA and protein were prepared as in A; Fe2+ was 50 μm when present (see “Experimental Procedures”). A constant 0.1 μm RNA concentration was used with varying concentrations of protein; RNA was stained with ethidium bromide. Note the larger amount of IRP1 repressor required to bind (shift) an equivalent amount of mt-aconitase IRE-RNA compared with ferritin IRE-RNA ± Fe2+-O2. The data are representative of two independent experiments and the significance of the effect of metal ions on the Kd values is p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fe2+, 5 μm, increased the Kd for ferritin IRE-RNA 6-fold and mt-aconitase RNA 2-fold (Fig. 3A), showing that Fe2+ weakens IRE-RNA/IRP1 binding and suggesting that excess cellular Fe2+ can derepress, i.e. facilitate formation of repressor-free, IRE-mRNA. Stabilities of IRE-RNA·IRP1 complexes were decreased 17- and 6-fold for ferritin and mt-aconitase IRE-RNA·IRP complexes, respectively, at 50 μm Fe2+. Thus, Fe2+, as well as the IRP1 repressor itself, recognize differences in IRE-RNA structure. The result is that Fe2+ weakens the RNA/protein repressor interaction differentially for the IRE-mRNAs that regulate ferritin and mt-aconitase synthesis. When we analyzed IRE-RNA/IRP1 interactions by fluorescence quenching, the titration used a constant protein concentration (0.1 μm) for the ferritin IRE-RNA, additional data were collected with 0.05 μm protein; RNA varied from 0 to 1.0 μm. To evaluate the possible effect of using a constant RNA concentration and titrating with variable protein concentrations, and to obtain data from electrophoretic mobility shift gel electrophoresis as in earlier studies of the IRE-RNA·protein complexes (31Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Butt J. Kim H.Y. Basilion J.P. Cohen S. Iwai K.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of Fe2+ on RNA/protein interactions, in the absence of oxygen, by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. A constant 0.1 μm RNA was used with variable protein concentrations (0 to 2.0 μm) ± 50 μm Fe2+-O2. Gels were prepared and analyzed in the absence of air to stabilize Fe2+. The fraction of RNA complexed to the protein was diminished by the presence of Fe2+ (Fig. 3B). Differences between ferritin and mt-aconitase RNAs in the gels are observed most readily by comparing the unshifted RNA bands (see Fig. 3). Changing the order of addition of RNA and protein to the reaction mixture had no effect. The direct effects of Fe2+ observed by the stability of the RNA·protein complex (Fig. 3) complement the indirect effects of cellular iron, as previously observed, on the RNA/protein binding that is mediated by protein degradation and, for IRP1, changes in [4Fe-4S] assembly (1Wallander M.L. Leibold E.A. Eisenstein R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 668-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 2Rouault T.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 15Clarke S.L. Vasanthakumar A. Anderson S.A. Pondarré C. Koh C.M. Deck K.M. Pitula J.S. Epstein C.J. Fleming M.D. Eisenstein R.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mn2+ is chemically similar to Fe2+ but can be studied in air (22Vogt M. Lahiri S. Hoogstraten C.G. Britt R.D. DeRose V.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 16764-16770Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mn2+ also weakens IRE-RNA/IRP1 interactions, with differential effects for the two IRE-RNAs as well. For example, for 50 μm ferritin IRE-RNA, IRP1 binding was weakened 8-fold by Mn2+ and 17-fold by Fe2+. For the mt-aconitase IRE-RNA·IRP1 complex, the effects of Fe2+ and Mn2+ were identical (Fig. 3A), and smaller than for the ferritin IRE-RNA·IRP complex. Mg2+ was studied because of the direct metal interactions observed with ferritin IRE-RNA by NMR spectroscopy (11Gdaniec Z. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and because Mg2+ influences the structure/function of many classes of RNA (e.g. Refs. 17Shenvi C.L. Dong K.C. Friedman E.M. Hanson J.A. Cate J.H. RNA. 2005; 11: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and 26Martick M. Horan L.H. Noller H.F. Scott W.G. Nature. 2008; 454: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Only when Mg2+ concentrations are 100 times higher than Mn2+ or Fe2+ was comparable weakening of the IRE-RNA·IRP complexes observed (Fig. 3A). The metal selectivity and RNA selectivity for altering IRE-RNA·IRP stability raises the possibility that metal ions played a selective role in the evolution of IRE-RNA·IRP complexes or the possibility that metal ions besides iron contribute to regulation of in vivo 5′-UTR IRE-RNA/IRP interactions. There is no evidence that metal ions bind to IRP1, except for the FeS cluster added to the apoIRP1 that yields c-aconitase. Furthermore, there are no obvious, additional, predicted metal binding sequences in the primary sequence of IRP1 (14Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand there is evidence that metals bind to IRE-RNA from solution NMR and metal nuclease cleavage (27Wang Y.H. Sczekan S.R. Theil E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Harrell C.M. McKenzie A.R. Patino M.M. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 4166-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Thorp H.H. McKenzie R.A. Lin P.N. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 2773-2779Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To obtain more direct evidence that the effect of metal ions on the stability of the IRE-RNA·protein complexes reflects metal ions bound to IRE-RNA and not to the IRP repressor, we examined the effect of metal ions on the intrinsic fluorescence of IRP and the fluorescence of ethidium bromide bound to IRE-RNA. We used Mn2+ as a surrogate for Fe2+ to facilitate experiments in air, because the effects on stability of the RNA·protein complex are similar to Fe2+ (Fig. 3). Mn2+ does not bind to IRP1, based on the absence of changes in intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 4) when manganese is added; Mg2+ does not bind either, using the same analytical approach (Fig. 4). By contrast, addition of IRE-RNA to IRP1 decreases the intrinsic fluorescence of IRP1 (Fig. 2). Mn2+ binds to ferritin IRE-RNA, in experiments using EtBr fluorescence as a reporter (Fig. 4A). For example, EtBr fluorescence decreases when Mn2+ was added to EtBr and RNA; the Ka between EtBr and RNA was 41.6 ± 2.3 × 106 liter/mol in the absence of Mn2+ and 18.0 ± 0.6 × 106 liter/mol in the presence of Mn2+; the decrease in Ka is significant (p < 0.01), and indicates metal binding to RNA. The stoichiometry of EtBr binding to IRE-RNA was 4.8 ± 0.3, and decreases to 2.6 ± 0.1 (Fig. 4) in the presence of Mn2+. Given the general similarities between Fe2+ and Mn2+ in destabilizing the IRE-RNA·IRP complex, undetectable Mn2+ binding to IRP1, and detectable Mn2+ binding to IRE-RNA and general similarities of Fe2+ and Mn2+ chemistry, the results indicate that Fe2+ destabilizes the IRE-RNA·IRP complex by binding to the RNA. In vivo when Fe2+ accumulates to concentrations that saturate normal Fe2+ chaperones and transporters, and fill ferritin, Fe2+ becomes available to destabilize IRE-RNA·IRP complexes and increase the synthesis of the encoded proteins. Because ferritin IRE-RNA differs from mt-aconitase IRE-RNA by a U6 bulge in the helix, we analyzed the ferritin ΔU6 mutant IRE-RNA. Ferritin ΔU6 IRE-RNA should behave more like mt-aconitase than ferritin IRE-RNA, based on the predicted RNA secondary structure (Fig. 2) and the regions of contact in the IRE-RNA/IRP1 crystal structure (Fig. 1B). In fact, stability of the ferritin ΔU6 IRE-RNA·IRP1 complex is between that of the mt-aconitase IRE-RNA·IRP complex (3-fold higher) and the ferritin IRE-RNA·IRP complex (3-fold lower). Thus, the U6 bulge in ferritin RNA explains only part of the difference in IRP binding by ferritin and mt-aconitase IRE-RNAs. Mn2+ or Mg2+ had only small effects on the mutant IRE-RNA·IRP complex, in contrast to the complexes of wild type IRE·RNA with IRP (Fig. 3A), indicating that in the ferritin ΔU6 IRE-RNA·IRP1 complex the metal binding sites that influence stability or the RNA conformational change responsible for decreased IRP binding are blocked by deletion of U6. Because both ferritin and ferritin ΔU6 IRE-RNAs have identical base pairs but differences in IRP1 binding, because ferritin ΔU6 and mt-aconitase IRE-RNAs have similar secondary structures around the two IRP1 binding sites of the C8 bulge and CAGUG loop (Fig. 2), and because metal effects on the protein·RNA complex differ among ferritin, ferritin ΔU6, and mt-aconitase IRE-RNAs, the phylogenetically conserved differences among each IRE-mRNA clearly contribute to the inherent stability and metal responses of the IRE-RNA·IRP complexes. The translation of 5′-UTR IRE-mRNAs increases when concentrations of environmental iron, such as ferrous salts, ferric chelates, and heme increase as the result of iron-induced changes in the IRE/IRP interactions and by degrading IRP (1Wallander M.L.

However, the chemical identity of the cellular iron signal targeted to IRE-RNA/IRP interactions is unknown, although insertion of a [4Fe-4S] cluster, after cluster synthesis/transport by ISC protein catalysts and chaperones (36Lill R. Mühlenhoff U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 669-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), influences IRE-RNA/IRP1 interactions. When cellular iron concentrations are high, a larger fraction of each 5′-UTR IRE-mRNA is in the polyribosomes (5Zähringer J. Baliga B.S. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 6Melefors O. Goossen B. Johansson H.E. Stripecke R. Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. J. Biol.

Iron deficiency, by contrast stabilizes IRP concentrations and destabilizes the FeS cluster in IRP1, possibly mediated by IRP phosphorylation, and a smaller fraction of the 5′-UTR IRE-mRNAs are in polyribosomes (16Deck K.M. Vasanthakumar A. Anderson S.A. Goforth J.B. Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12701-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). (A subset of the IRE-mRNA family, mainly involved in iron absorption and transport, regulates mRNA turnover with the mRNA stabilized by IRP binding. The 3′-UTR IRE-RNAs have specific structural features that place them outside the scope of this study.) IRE-RNA·IRP complexes occur in the cytoplasm, but whether the RNA·protein complex forms during IRE-mRNA processing in the nucleus, or during transport to the cytoplasm for mRNA storage or use remains unknown. The effect of Fe2+ on the stability of the 5′-UTR IRE-RNA·IRP complexes reported here indicates that the complex can sense increases in concentrations of aquated Fe2+ that result in weaker RNA/protein interactions. Destabilization of the IRE-RNA·IRP complex by Fe2+ competes with the stabilization conferred by the very large number of bonds between the protein and the RNA complex in crystals (13Walden W.E.

In the IRE-RNA·IRP complex, protein-RNA bonds are clustered at the RNA C8 bulge and the CAGUG terminal loop of the IRE-RNA structure (13Walden W.E. Selezneva A.I. Dupuy J. Volbeda A.

A number of RNA-protein bonds involve RNA sites that are hypersensitive to cleavage by Fe2+-EDTA/ascorbate/H2O2 (28Harrell C.M. McKenzie A.R. Patino M.M. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 4166-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting specific interactions with Fe2+-EDTA or solvent or both. The observed destabilization of the IRE-RNA·IRP complex is most likely explained by metal binding to exposed sites on the IRE-RNA (Fig. 1B), for several reasons. First, metal ions did not bind to the IRP1 in the current study. Second, there are no predicted metal binding sites in the IRP protein (14Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) beyond cysteine/[Fe-S] interactions. Third, in this study, metal ions decrease conformation-sensitive EtBr binding to RNA. Finally metal binding to IRE-RNA has been detected by NMR spectroscopy and metallonuclease cleavage (12Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C.

Chem. 1996; 35: 2773-2779Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Structural differences between ferritin and mt-aconitase IRE-RNAs are reflected in the stability differences of the RNA·protein complexes observed here, because the same IRP is present in both complexes and only the RNA is different. IRE-RNA structural differences then, explain, at least in part, the 30-fold difference in iron-induced synthesis in vivo for the two proteins and differences in IRP1 and IRP2 binding in vitro (31Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because ferritin is an ancient IRE-RNA and mt-aconitase evolved more recently (39Piccinelli P. Samuelsson T. RNA. 2007; 13: 952-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the lower stability of the mt-aconitase IRE-RNA·protein complex and the smaller iron response may reflect the shorter time for evolutionary fine-tuning of the IRE-mRNA. However, the different iron responses of the two IRE-RNAs could also reflect the physiological function of each encoded protein. For example, large fluctuations in mt-aconitase synthesis could be deleterious to cell oxidative metabolism, which would explain the relatively small changes in synthesis induced by iron. By contrast large changes in ferritin synthesis allow cells to respond to large changes in iron and oxygen stress through ferritin mRNA translation (more sensitive to iron signals) as well as ferritin DNA transcription (more sensitive to oxidant signals) (40Hintze K.J. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15048-15052Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 41Hintze K.J. Katoh Y. Igarashi K. Theil E.C. J. Biol.

Fe2+, Mn2+, and 100× Mg2+ destabilize wild type IRE-RNA·IRP complexes, but the IRE-RNA mutation greatly reduced the metal ion effects; a single nucleotide deletion that eliminated the ferritin-selective IRE-RNA U6 bulge also greatly reduced the metal ion effects and weakened IRP binding. Thus, the genetic selective forces acting upon each IRE-mRNA appear to be extremely high. Moreover, the phylogenetic conservation of each IRE-RNA structure is extremely high (>90%) and includes variations among wild type IRE-RNA structures such as the initiator AUG in the mt-aconitase IRE-RNA, and base pairing flanking sequences around the ferritin-IRE RNAs of vertebrates (27Wang Y.H.

https://openalex.org/W2133746624,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health concern. Adenosine, a signaling molecule generated in response to cell stress, contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD. An established model of adenosine-mediated lung injury is the adenosine deaminase-deficient (Ada(-/-)) mouse. Osteopontin (OPN) is a chemokine that is produced following injury and is implicated in a variety of human pathologies, but its expression and role in the pathogenesis of COPD have not been examined. To investigate the role of OPN in a model of COPD, Ada(-/-) double-knockout mice were generated, and inflammation and air-space enlargement endpoints were examined. Results demonstrate that Ada(-/-) mice exhibit OPN-dependent neutrophilia, alveolar air-space enlargement, and increases in mediators of air-space enlargement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that patients with COPD have increased OPN expression within distal airways in association with clinical airway obstruction. These results suggest that OPN represents a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2015270219,"Background ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 mediates apolipoprotein AI-dependent efflux of cholesterol and thereby removes cholesterol from peripheral tissues. ABCA1 expression is tightly regulated and deficiency of this cholesterol transporter results in cholesterol accumulation within cells. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) participates in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis by endocytosis of apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins and modulation of cellular proliferation signals. Methods and Principal Findings In the present study, we demonstrate a new role for LRP1 in reverse cholesterol transport. Absence of LRP1 expression results in increased PDGFRβ signaling and sequential activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, which increases phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Phosphorylated and activated cPLA2 releases arachidonic acid from the phospholipid pool. Overproduction of arachidonic acid suppresses the activation of LXR/RXR heterodimers bound to the promoter of LXR regulated genes such as ABCA1, resulting in greatly reduced ABCA1 expression. Conclusions and Significance LRP1 regulates LXR-mediated gene transcription and participates in reverse cholesterol transport by controlling cPLA2 activation and ABCA1 expression. LRP1 thus functions as a physiological integrator of cellular lipid homeostasis with signals that regulate cellular proliferation and vascular wall integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2016382389,"Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1) is a ubiquitously expressed dynamin-like GTPase in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It plays important roles in mitochondrial fusion, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP production. Mutations of OPA1 result in autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA). The molecular mechanisms by which link OPA1 mutations and DOA are not fully understood. Recently, we created a Drosophila model to study the pathogenesis of optic atrophy. Heterozygous mutation of Drosophila OPA1 (dOpa1) by P-element insertion results in no obvious morphological abnormalities, whereas homozygous mutation is embryonic lethal. In eye-specific somatic clones, homozygous mutation of dOpa1 causes rough (mispatterning) and glossy (decreased lens deposition) eye phenotypes in adult Drosophila. In humans, heterozygous mutations in OPA1 have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which is predicted to affect multiple organs. In this study, we demonstrated that heterozygous dOpa1 mutation perturbs the visual function and an ERG profile of the Drosophila compound eye. We independently showed that antioxidants delayed the onset of mutant phenotypes in ERG and improved larval vision function in phototaxis assay. Furthermore, heterozygous dOpa1 mutation also caused decreased heart rate, increased heart arrhythmia, and poor tolerance to stress induced by electrical pacing. However, antioxidants had no effects on the dysfunctional heart of heterozygous dOpa1 mutants. Under stress, heterozygous dOpa1 mutations caused reduced escape response, suggesting abnormal function of the skeletal muscles. Our results suggest that heterozygous mutation of dOpa1 shows organ-specific pathogenesis and is associated with multiple organ abnormalities in an age-dependent and organ-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2017866996,"Cigarette smoking is the major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Respiratory bacterial infections have been shown to be involved in the development of COPD along with impaired airway innate immunity.To address the in vivo impact of cigarette smoke (CS) exclusively on host innate defense mechanisms, we took advantage of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), which has an innate immune system but lacks adaptive immune function. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) clearance from intestines of C. elegans was dampened by CS. Microarray analysis identified 6 candidate genes with a 2-fold or greater reduction after CS exposure, that have a human orthologue, and that may participate in innate immunity. To confirm a role of CS-down-regulated genes in the innate immune response to PA, RNA interference (RNAi) by feeding was carried out in C. elegans to inhibit the gene of interest, followed by PA infection to determine if the gene affected innate immunity. Inhibition of lbp-7, which encodes a lipid binding protein, resulted in increased levels of intestinal PA. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells were shown to express mRNA of human Fatty Acid Binding Protein 5 (FABP-5), the human orthologue of lpb-7. Interestingly, FABP-5 mRNA levels from human smokers with COPD were significantly lower (p = 0.036) than those from smokers without COPD. Furthermore, FABP-5 mRNA levels were up-regulated (7-fold) after bacterial (i.e., Mycoplasma pneumoniae) infection in primary human bronchial epithelial cell culture (air-liquid interface culture).Our results suggest that the C. elegans model offers a novel in vivo approach to specifically study innate immune deficiencies resulting from exposure to cigarette smoke, and that results from the nematode may provide insight into human airway epithelial cell biology and cigarette smoke exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2133231714,"Neisseria meningitidis is a strictly human pathogen that has two facets since asymptomatic carriage can unpredictably turn into fulminant forms of infection. Meningococcal pathogenesis relies on the ability of the bacteria to break host epithelial or endothelial cellular barriers. Highly restrictive, yet poorly understood, mechanisms allow meningococcal adhesion to cells of only human origin. Adhesion of encapsulated and virulent meningococci to human cells relies on the expression of bacterial type four pili (T4P) that trigger intense host cell signalling. Among the components of the meningococcal T4P, the concomitantly expressed PilC1 and PilC2 proteins regulate pili exposure at the bacterial surface, and until now, PilC1 was believed to be specifically responsible for T4P-mediated meningococcal adhesion to human cells. Contrary to previous reports, we show that, like PilC1, the meningococcal PilC2 component is capable of mediating adhesion to human ME180 epithelial cells, with cortical plaque formation and F-actin condensation. However, PilC1 and PilC2 promote different effects on infected cells. Cellular tracking analysis revealed that PilC1-expressing meningococci caused a severe reduction in the motility of infected cells, which was not the case when cells were infected with PilC2-expressing strains. The amount of both total and phosphorylated forms of EGFR was dramatically reduced in cells upon PilC1-mediated infection. In contrast, PilC2-mediated infection did not notably affect the EGFR pathway, and these specificities were shared among unrelated meningococcal strains. These results suggest that meningococci have evolved a highly discriminative tool for differential adhesion in specific microenvironments where different cell types are present. Moreover, the fine-tuning of cellular control through the combined action of two concomitantly expressed, but distinctly regulated, T4P-associated variants of the same molecule (i.e. PilC1 and PilC2) brings a new model to light for the analysis of the interplay between pathogenic bacteria and human host cells."

In this study, we characterized dominant-negative inhibitors of the ϵ-toxin. Site-specific mutations were introduced into the gene encoding ϵ-toxin, and recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. Paired cysteine substitutions were introduced at locations predicted to form a disulfide bond. One cysteine in each mutant was introduced into the membrane insertion domain of the toxin; the second cysteine was introduced into the protein backbone. Mutant proteins with cysteine substitutions at amino acid positions I51/A114 and at V56/F118 lacked detectable cytotoxic activity in a MDCK cell assay. Cytotoxic activity could be reconstituted in both mutant proteins by incubation with dithiothreitol, indicating that the lack of cytotoxic activity was attributable to the formation of a disulfide bond. Fluorescent labeling of the cysteines also indicated that the introduced cysteines participated in a disulfide bond. When equimolar mixtures of wild-type ϵ-toxin and mutant proteins were added to MDCK cells, the I51C/A114C and V56C/F118C mutant proteins each inhibited the activity of wild-type ϵ-toxin. Further analysis of the inhibitory activity of the I51C/A114C and V56C/F118C mutant proteins indicated that these proteins inhibit the ability of the active toxin to form stable oligomeric complexes in the context of MDCK cells.

Because of its extreme potency and the possibility of intoxicating humans, the C. perfringens ϵ-toxin is considered a select agent by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. A vaccine currently is approved for veterinary use, though multiple immunizations are required to provide long-term immunity (10Cameron C.M. Onderstepoort J. Vet.

There also is an antitoxin approved for veterinary use. However, in the event that an animal exhibits symptoms of intoxication by ϵ-toxin, it is typically too late for the current antitoxin to be effective, and use of the antitoxin is typically limited to prophylactic treatment of unvaccinated animals within a herd (14Beers M. Berkow R. The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy. 17th Edition. Merck and Co., Inc., 2005Google Scholar). There is no treatment currently approved for use in humans. Thus, alternative countermeasures are needed that inhibit the activity of the toxin. One alternative method of countering the cytotoxic activity of bacterial toxins is through dominant-negative inhibitors. Dominant-negative inhibitors are non-cytotoxic mutant forms of active toxins that are able to inhibit the activity of wild-type toxin when the two proteins are mixed together.

In this study, we sought to generate dominant-negative mutants of the ϵ-toxin. We hypothesized that mutations within the membrane insertion domain of ϵ-toxin, particularly mutations that are expected to restrict movement of this domain, would lead to dominant-negative inhibitors. We expressed wild-type and site-specific mutants of the ϵ-toxin as recombinant proteins in E. coli. The recombinant proteins were purified, and cytotoxicity was assessed using an established cell culture assay. Using this approach, we identified mutant proteins that inhibited the activity of wild-type ϵ-toxin in vitro and determined the mechanism of inhibition. The gene encoding ϵ-prototoxin, etxB, from C. perfringens type B strain ATCC3626 was PCR-amplified and cloned into plasmid pET22b (Novagen). This placed the etxB gene under the regulation of the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and fused the N-terminal end of the prototoxin to the pelB leader peptide and the C-terminal end of the prototoxin to a His6 affinity tag (to aid in purification of the protein). A derivative plasmid that expressed a GFP-ϵ-toxin fusion protein was also constructed (5Soler-Jover A. Dorca J. Popoff M.R. Gibert M. Saura J. Tusell J.M. Serratosa J. Blasi J. Martin-Satué M.

Glucose induces expression of HXT genes encoding hexose transporters through a signal generated by the Snf3 and Rgt2 glucose sensors that leads to depletion of the transcriptional regulators Mth1 and Std1. These paralogous proteins bind to Rgt1 and enable it to repress expression of HXT genes. Here we show that Mth1 and Std1 can substitute for one another and provide nearly normal regulation of their targets. However, their roles in the glucose signal transduction cascade have diverged significantly. Mth1 is the prominent effector of Rgt1 function because it is the more abundant of the two paralogs under conditions in which both are active (in the absence of glucose). Moreover, the cellular level of Mth1 is quite sensitive to the amount of available glucose. The abundance of Std1 protein, on the other hand, remains essentially constant over a similar range of glucose concentrations. The signal generated by low levels of glucose is amplified by rapid depletion of Mth1; the velocity of this depletion is dependent on both its rate of degradation and swift repression of MTH1 transcription by the Snf1-Mig1 glucose repression pathway.

Nutrient sensors provide cells with vital information about their environment, enabling rapid and efficient assimilation of specific nutrients (1Lindsley J.E. Rutter J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 139: 543-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Efficient utilization of glucose is especially important to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae because of its propensity to ferment this primary carbon source. The central components of the signaling pathway that controls expression of HXT (hexose transporter) genes encoding the hexose transporters are Mth1 and Std1. These two proteins are paralogs that arose from the whole genome duplication event that occurred about 100 million years ago, before the divergence of the sensu stricto clade of Saccharomyces species (2Kellis M. Birren B.W. Lander E.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, 3Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Information about the presence of glucose in the environment is transduced from the cell surface to the nucleus through Mth1 and Std1. Because they are functionally redundant under most experimental conditions, one of these paralogs should suffice, and indeed, yeasts that diverged before the whole genome duplication make do with a single Mth1/Std1 ortholog (4Gordon J.L. Byrne K.P. Wolfe K.H. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000485Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The advantage conferred by having both Mth1 and Std1 (or indeed, any paralogs) cannot be fully appreciated without an understanding of how each contributes to the behavior of the signaling machinery. To that end, we enumerated the properties of Mth1 and Std1 that inform a larger question: Why retain paralogs?Yeast cells sense extracellular glucose through the Snf3 and Rgt2 glucose sensors (reviewed in Refs. 5Gancedo J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 673-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Santangelo G.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 253-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), which are thought to be glucose receptors with high (Snf3) and low (Rgt2) affinity for glucose (7Ozcan S. Dover J. Johnston M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2566-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The signal they generate upon binding of glucose is transduced to the Mth1 and Std1 proteins through the Yck1 protein kinase, which phosphorylates them, thereby targeting them for ubiquitylation by the SCFGrr1 ubiquitin-protein ligase, dooming them to destruction (8Flick J.S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5101-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Flick K.M. Spielewoy N. Kalashnikova T.I. Guaderrama M. Zhu Q. Chang H.C. Wittenberg C. Mol. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 24: 8994-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because Mth1 and Std1 are required for the function of Rgt1, a transcriptional repressor of HXT genes (11Kim J.H. Johnston M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26144-26149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Lakshmanan J. Mosley A.L. Ozcan S. Curr.

Genetics. 2005; 169: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), their destruction results in derepression of HXT gene transcription, leading to a rapid influx of glucose into cells (14Kaniak A. Xue Z. Macool D. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Rgt1 repressor function is controlled by the abundance of Mth1 and Std1. These two proteins have maintained 58% amino acid identity since their divergence 100 million years ago, but their own transcriptional regulation differs significantly; STD1 expression is induced by glucose because it is controlled by Rgt1, and MTH1 expression is repressed by glucose through the Snf1-Mig1 glucose repression pathway (14Kaniak A. Xue Z. Macool D. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Repression of MTH1 transcription by glucose augments the glucose-stimulated degradation of Mth1, leading to a rapid and significant decline in the abundance of Mth1 protein (15Kim J.H. Brachet V. Moriya H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the levels of Std1 protein change little after cells are exposed to glucose, because glucose induction of its transcription offsets degradation of the protein (15Kim J.H. Brachet V. Moriya H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The different roles played by these central components of this glucose signal transduction pathway in integrating the glucose signal are not well understood. Different consequences of loss of Mth1 or Std1 or their over expression have been observed (16Kuchin S. Vyas V.K. Kanter E. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Genetics. 2003; 163: 507-514PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lafuente M.J. Gancedo C. Jauniaux J.C. Gancedo J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Schmidt M.C.

We discovered that these differences do not arise from functional independence of Mth1 and Std1 but rather result from differences in their transcriptional regulation.We demonstrate that Mth1 and Std1 are largely dedicated to regulating Rgt1 function and that they are functionally interchangeable in the glucose-sensing pathway. Because of the significant glucose-induced changes in Mth1 protein levels, we believe that Mth1 serves as a primary regulator of Rgt1 function and thus of HXT expression. In addition, Mth1 protein levels provide information about the availability of glucose to the transcriptional program regulating glucose uptake and utilization. Std1, on the other hand, with its low and static abundance, may provide a buffer that modulates the speed and extent of repression and induction of HXT gene expression.DISCUSSIONNutrient detection through transporter-like sensors is an ancient, unique mechanism by which yeast cells monitor their environment (21Brown V. Sexton J.A. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1726-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 44Betina S. Goffrini P. Ferrero I. Wésolowski-Louvel M. Genetics. 2001; 158: 541-548PubMed Google Scholar, 45Stasyk O.G. Maidan M.M. Stasyk O.V. Van Dijck P. Thevelein J.M. Sibirny A.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The glucose sensor-dependent regulation of Mth1 level enables yeast cells to respond quickly to glucose over a wide range of concentrations. The behavior of Mth1 resembles the dose-dependent regulatory response of the level of Stp1 in the related amino acid sensing system that employs Ssy1, a transporter-like amino acid sensor (46Poulsen P. Wu B. Gaber R.F. Ottow K. Andersen H.A. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).A large number of the genes whose expression is altered by deletion of MTH1 and/or STD1 are known or likely targets of Rgt1, suggesting that Mth1 and Std1 are dedicated to this signal transduction pathway. Mth1 is clearly the prime player because it accounts for the majority of the effects on gene expression observed in the Δmth1/Δstd1 mutant. This may be explained by a greater abundance of Mth1 protein relative to Std1 in the absence of glucose.The functional overlap is not complete, however; a strain containing only the Std1 protein expressed from both the MTH1 and STD1 promoters is not as sensitive to glucose as its wild type equivalent, being unable to achieve the same magnitude of induction of HXT expression (Fig. 2B). The relative insensitivity of Std1 protein to depletion after glucose addition, even when it is expressed from the glucose-repressed MTH1 promoter, may reflect inherent differences in the ability of Mth1 or Std1 to interact productively with the signaling apparatus (18Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. Zhang X. Tillman T.S. Solimeo H. Wölfl S. Almonte C. Watkins S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4561-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, although the individual contributions of Mth1 and Std1 to the logic of the glucose-sensing circuit are primarily a consequence of dissimilar transcriptional regulation, differences in the proteins also contribute to the characteristics of the glucose response. This is not surprising, because these two genes diverged from their common ancestor at least 100 million years ago.Although the role played by Mth1 seems clear, the contributions made by Std1 to the signaling pathway remain enigmatic. It is possible that the primary function of Std1 lies outside of the glucose-sensing pathway or that it is active under conditions other than simple addition or depletion of glucose. Such a role may require it to work with proteins other than Rgt1, because Rgt1 seems to be primarily (perhaps exclusively) dedicated to regulating the transcription of HXT genes and their regulators (14Kaniak A. Xue Z. Macool D. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Under the conditions tested here, Std1 does not appear necessary for the major characteristics of the glucose-signaling network. Because of its low, constant level of expression, we imagine it serves as a buffer to ensure that a minimum level of active Rgt1 is always present, even at high glucose concentrations. It is likely that any role found for Std1 in the glucose-sensing network will be subtle in nature, perhaps endowing the signaling machinery with properties more discernable at the population level.The whole genome duplication that occurred in the lineage that led to S. cerevisiae provided this and related yeasts with two co-repressors for their glucose-sensing network that came to be expressed at different levels and regulated in different ways. Yeasts such as Kluyveromyces lactis and C. albicans diverged from S. cerevisiae before the whole genome duplication and are thus more constrained because they possess only a single MTH1/STD1 ortholog. In the yeasts in which that ortholog has been studied, its expression is under Rgt1 control and is therefore induced by glucose (47Hnatova M. Wésolowski-Louvel M. Dieppois G. Deffaud J. Lemaire M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 48Sexton J.A. Brown V. Johnston M. Yeast. 2007; 24: 847-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), like STD1 in S. cerevisiae. This suggests that glucose induction of STD1 expression is the ancestral state of the system. This is supported by recent work to reconstruct the gene order of the pre-whole genome duplication ancestor, which suggests that duplication of the ancestral locus resulted in a maintenance of synteny on both sides of present day STD1, whereas a chromosomal translocation occurred in the region upstream of MTH1 (4Gordon J.L. Byrne K.P. Wolfe K.H. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000485Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).The specialization of the Mth1 and Std1 signal transducers was complemented by specialization of the duplicated glucose sensors, resulting in paralogs with high (Snf3) and low affinity (Rgt2) for glucose. The release of functional constraint ushered in by the arrival of paralogs allowed S. cerevisiae to exploit alternative wiring schemes of the glucose-sensing network that were not accessible to species lacking this duplication. It appears that S. cerevisiae has tuned the expression and regulation of Mth1 and Std1 to optimize sensitivity to a wide range of glucose concentrations (0.01–2%). The combined effects of glucose-induced Mth1 degradation and glucose-stimulated shutdown of Mth1 production serve to amplify a weak signal generated by the low amounts of glucose detected through Snf3. S. cerevisiae undergoes an “all-or-none” switch from oxidative to fermentative growth when an amount of glucose sufficient for that lifestyle is detected. The amplification of a signal at low levels of glucose (via Snf3), sensitivity to high levels of glucose (via Rgt1), and coupling both production and degradation of a central regulator (Mth1) to glucose availability are elegant examples of how gene duplication enabled new regulatory wirings, providing a competitive advantage in this niche. Nutrient sensors provide cells with vital information about their environment, enabling rapid and efficient assimilation of specific nutrients (1Lindsley J.E. Rutter J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 139: 543-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).

However, the levels of Std1 protein change little after cells are exposed to glucose, because glucose induction of its transcription offsets degradation of the protein (15Kim J.H. Brachet V. Moriya H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The different roles played by these central components of this glucose signal transduction pathway in integrating the glucose signal are not well understood. Different consequences of loss of Mth1 or Std1 or their over expression have been observed (16Kuchin S. Vyas V.K. Kanter E. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Genetics. 2003; 163: 507-514PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lafuente M.J. Gancedo C. Jauniaux J.C. Gancedo J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. Zhang X. Tillman T.S. Solimeo H. Wölfl S. Almonte C. Watkins S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4561-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We discovered that these differences do not arise from functional independence of Mth1 and Std1 but rather result from differences in their transcriptional regulation. We demonstrate that Mth1 and Std1 are largely dedicated to regulating Rgt1 function and that they are functionally interchangeable in the glucose-sensing pathway. Because of the significant glucose-induced changes in Mth1 protein levels, we believe that Mth1 serves as a primary regulator of Rgt1 function and thus of HXT expression. In addition, Mth1 protein levels provide information about the availability of glucose to the transcriptional program regulating glucose uptake and utilization. Std1, on the other hand, with its low and static abundance, may provide a buffer that modulates the speed and extent of repression and induction of HXT gene expression. DISCUSSIONNutrient detection through transporter-like sensors is an ancient, unique mechanism by which yeast cells monitor their environment (21Brown V. Sexton J.A. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 1726-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 44Betina S. Goffrini P. Ferrero I. Wésolowski-Louvel M. Genetics. 2001; 158: 541-548PubMed Google Scholar, 45Stasyk O.G. Maidan M.M. Stasyk O.V. Van Dijck P. Thevelein J.M. Sibirny A.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The glucose sensor-dependent regulation of Mth1 level enables yeast cells to respond quickly to glucose over a wide range of concentrations. The behavior of Mth1 resembles the dose-dependent regulatory response of the level of Stp1 in the related amino acid sensing system that employs Ssy1, a transporter-like amino acid sensor (46Poulsen P. Wu B. Gaber R.F. Ottow K. Andersen H.A. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).A large number of the genes whose expression is altered by deletion of MTH1 and/or STD1 are known or likely targets of Rgt1, suggesting that Mth1 and Std1 are dedicated to this signal transduction pathway. Mth1 is clearly the prime player because it accounts for the majority of the effects on gene expression observed in the Δmth1/Δstd1 mutant. This may be explained by a greater abundance of Mth1 protein relative to Std1 in the absence of glucose.The functional overlap is not complete, however; a strain containing only the Std1 protein expressed from both the MTH1 and STD1 promoters is not as sensitive to glucose as its wild type equivalent, being unable to achieve the same magnitude of induction of HXT expression (Fig. 2B). The relative insensitivity of Std1 protein to depletion after glucose addition, even when it is expressed from the glucose-repressed MTH1 promoter, may reflect inherent differences in the ability of Mth1 or Std1 to interact productively with the signaling apparatus (18Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. Zhang X. Tillman T.S. Solimeo H. Wölfl S. Almonte C. Watkins S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4561-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, although the individual contributions of Mth1 and Std1 to the logic of the glucose-sensing circuit are primarily a consequence of dissimilar transcriptional regulation, differences in the proteins also contribute to the characteristics of the glucose response. This is not surprising, because these two genes diverged from their common ancestor at least 100 million years ago.Although the role played by Mth1 seems clear, the contributions made by Std1 to the signaling pathway remain enigmatic. It is possible that the primary function of Std1 lies outside of the glucose-sensing pathway or that it is active under conditions other than simple addition or depletion of glucose. Such a role may require it to work with proteins other than Rgt1, because Rgt1 seems to be primarily (perhaps exclusively) dedicated to regulating the transcription of HXT genes and their regulators (14Kaniak A. Xue Z. Macool D. Kim J.H. Johnston M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Under the conditions tested here, Std1 does not appear necessary for the major characteristics of the glucose-signaling network. Because of its low, constant level of expression, we imagine it serves as a buffer to ensure that a minimum level of active Rgt1 is always present, even at high glucose concentrations. It is likely that any role found for Std1 in the glucose-sensing network will be subtle in nature, perhaps endowing the signaling machinery with properties more discernable at the population level.The whole genome duplication that occurred in the lineage that led to S. cerevisiae provided this and related yeasts with two co-repressors for their glucose-sensing network that came to be expressed at different levels and regulated in different ways. Yeasts such as Kluyveromyces lactis and C. albicans diverged from S. cerevisiae before the whole genome duplication and are thus more constrained because they possess only a single MTH1/STD1 ortholog. In the yeasts in which that ortholog has been studied, its expression is under Rgt1 control and is therefore induced by glucose (47Hnatova M. Wésolowski-Louvel M. Dieppois G. Deffaud J. Lemaire M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 48Sexton J.A. Brown V. Johnston M. Yeast. 2007; 24: 847-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), like STD1 in S. cerevisiae. This suggests that glucose induction of STD1 expression is the ancestral state of the system. This is supported by recent work to reconstruct the gene order of the pre-whole genome duplication ancestor, which suggests that duplication of the ancestral locus resulted in a maintenance of synteny on both sides of present day STD1, whereas a chromosomal translocation occurred in the region upstream of MTH1 (4Gordon J.L. Byrne K.P. Wolfe K.H. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000485Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).The specialization of the Mth1 and Std1 signal transducers was complemented by specialization of the duplicated glucose sensors, resulting in paralogs with high (Snf3) and low affinity (Rgt2) for glucose. The release of functional constraint ushered in by the arrival of paralogs allowed S. cerevisiae to exploit alternative wiring schemes of the glucose-sensing network that were not accessible to species lacking this duplication. It appears that S. cerevisiae has tuned the expression and regulation of Mth1 and Std1 to optimize sensitivity to a wide range of glucose concentrations (0.01–2%). The combined effects of glucose-induced Mth1 degradation and glucose-stimulated shutdown of Mth1 production serve to amplify a weak signal generated by the low amounts of glucose detected through Snf3. S. cerevisiae undergoes an “all-or-none” switch from oxidative to fermentative growth when an amount of glucose sufficient for that lifestyle is detected. The amplification of a signal at low levels of glucose (via Snf3), sensitivity to high levels of glucose (via Rgt1), and coupling both production and degradation of a central regulator (Mth1) to glucose availability are elegant examples of how gene duplication enabled new regulatory wirings, providing a competitive advantage in this niche.

Here, we sought to investigate the mechanism underlying fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) induction of Gdnf expression in astrocytes. We found that FGF2 stimulation of rat astrocytes induced expression of Egr-1 at a high level. Sequence analysis of the rat Gdnf gene identified three overlapping Egr-1-binding sites between positions −185 and −163 of the rat Gdnf promoter. Transfection studies using a series of deleted Gdnf promoters revealed that these Egr-1-binding sites are required for maximal activation of the Gdnf promoter by FGF2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that Egr-1 binds to the Gdnf promoter. Furthermore, the induction of Gdnf expression by FGF2 is strongly attenuated both in C6 glioma cells stably expressing Egr-1-specific small interfering RNA and in primary cultured astrocytes from the Egr-1 knock-out mouse. Additionally, we found that stimulation of the ERK and JNK pathways by FGF2 is functionally linked to Gdnf expression through the induction of Egr-1. These data demonstrate that FGF2-induced Gdnf expression is mediated by the induction of Egr-1 through activation of the ERK and JNK/Elk-1 signaling pathways.

Johansson M. Tomac A. Collins F. Olson L. Hoffer B. Humpel C. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 124: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Gdnf is rapidly up-regulated in response to brain injury (10Kitagawa H. Hayashi T. Mitsumoto Y. Koga N. Itoyama Y. Abe K. Stroke. 1998; 29: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and specific pharmacological treatments. However, the details of the mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of Gdnf expression are not clearly understood. Egr-1 (also known as nerve growth factor-induced-A (NGFI-A), zinc-finger clone 28 (zif268), Krüppel box 24 (krox24), and TPA-induced sequence 8 (Tis8)) is a transcription factor encoded by an immediate-early response gene. Egr-1 is present at high concentrations in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdaloid nuclei, and striatum (11Mack K. Day M. Milbrandt J. Gottlieb D.I. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Schlingensiepen K.H. Lüno K. Brysch W. Neurosci.

Int. 1997; 31: 477-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), suggesting that Egr-1 may play a role in the nervous system. The regulatory regions of the murine and human Gdnf genes contain putative consensus sequences for Egr-1 binding. Because Egr-1 (14Gentilella A. Passiatore G. Deshmane S. Turco M.C. Khalili K. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5011-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and Gdnf (15Suter-Crazzolara C. Unsicker K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 41: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) can be induced by FGF2, we investigated whether Egr-1 is involved in Gdnf expression. Here, we show that Egr-1 directly binds to the Gdnf promoter and promotes transcriptional activation of the Gdnf gene. FGF2 induces Egr-1 expression through the ERK or JNK pathways. Inhibition of either of these pathways abrogates FGF2-induced expression of Egr-1 and Gdnf. An important role for Egr-1 in Gdnf expression is supported by the demonstration that FGF2-induced GDNF expression is attenuated both in C6 glioma cells stably expressing Egr-1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and in primary cultured astrocytes derived from the Egr-1 knock-out mouse. These findings suggest a novel role for Egr-1 in the regulation of Gdnf transcription by FGF2 in astrocytes. Egr-1 knock-out mice developed on a C57BL6 background were from Dr. Jeffrey Milbrandt (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and have been described elsewhere (16Lee S.L. Wang Y. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4566-4572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse recombinant FGF2 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The firefly and Renilla Dual-GloTM Luciferase Assay System was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The plasmid pRL-null, which encodes Renilla luciferase, was purchased from Promega. Plasmid pFA2-Elk1, which encodes a fusion protein consisting of the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) and the activation domain of Elk-1 (amino acids 307–427), and plasmid pFR-Luc, which contains five Gal4-binding element repeats upstream of the luciferase gene, were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Plasmids expressing dominant negative (DN)-MEK1 (pCGN1/MEK DN), DN-ERK2 (pHA-ERK2 K52R), DN-JNK1 (pSRα/HA-JNK T183A/Y185F), and kinase-dead p38 kinase (pCDNA3/FLAG-p38 T180A/Y182F) were kindly provided by Dr. D. S. Min (Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Science, Pusan National University, Korea). The pCDNA3.1/Egr-1(I293F) plasmid, which expresses dominant-active (DA)-Egr-1, was generated as previously described (17Russo M.W. Matheny C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 6858-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The rat glioma cell line C6 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). C6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Primary rat astrocytes and astrocytes from Egr-1 knock-out (Egr-1−/−) and heterozygous (Egr-1+/−) mice were prepared from cerebral cortices of newborn pup littermates as previously described (18Lee J.M. Calkins M.J. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12029-12038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) and cultured in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). The Egr-1 genotype was determined by PCR amplification from genomic DNA using the forward primer 5′-aaccggcccagcaagacacc-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ctcgtgctttacggtatcgc-3′. Astrocyte purity was determined by immunostaining with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (1:500, Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). Total RNA was extracted using a TRIzol RNA extraction kit (Invitrogen) from cells stimulated with FGF2 (10 ng/ml) for various lengths of time. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA by using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative real time PCR was performed an icycler iQTM system (Bio-Rad), using the TaqMan-iQTM supermix kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The TaqManTM fluogenic probes and PCR primers for rat Gdnf and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) were designed by Metabion Int. (Martinsreid, Deutschland). The sequences of primers were 5′-CTGCCCGCCGGTAAGAGG-3′ (forward for Gdnf) and 5′-CGTCATCAAACTGGTCAGGATAATC-3′ (reverse for Gdnf), 5′-GTGATGCTGGTGCTGAGTATGTC-3′ (forward for gapdh), and 5′-GCGGAAGGGGCGGAGATG-3′ (reverse for gapdh). The TaqMan fluorogenic probes used were 5′-FAM-CGCCCGCCGAAGACCACTCCCTC-BHQ-3′ (for Gdnf) and 5′-Yakima Yellow TM-ACCCTTCAGGTGAGCCCCAGCCTT-BHQ-1-3′ (for gapdh). Threshold cycle, Ct, which correlates inversely with the target mRNA levels, was measured as the cycle number at which the reporter fluorescent emission increases above a threshold level. The relative changes in Gdnf mRNA levels were normalized for gapdh mRNA in the same samples. For RT-PCR analysis, gene-specific primers for murine Gdnf (forward, 5′-GGTCTACGGAGAGACCGATCCGAGGTGC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCTCTGGAGCCAGGGTCAGATACATC-3′) and actin (forward, 5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC-3′; reverse, 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′) were used. The PCR conditions for all primers were as follows: hold for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94 °C (30 s), annealing at 55 °C (30 s), and elongation at 72 °C (1 min). The amplified products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. A Gdnf promoter fragment spanning nucleotides −983 to +3 was synthesized from rat genomic DNA (Promega) by PCR using primers 5′-ccggtaccTCCATCAAAGTCCAACTTGGCAAATA-3′ (forward) and 5′-gaagatctTCTCAGCTCTTAGGTCTCCTCTGCC-3′ (reverse). (KpnI and BglII restriction sites are indicated by lowercase letters.) The amplified PCR product was ligated into the KpnI-BglII site of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) to yield pGDNF-Luc(−983/+3). A series of deletion constructs of rat Gdnf promoter fragments were synthesized by PCR using the pGDNF-Luc(−983/+3) plasmid as a template. The forward and reverse primers used in the PCR to generate deletion mutant promoters contained KpnI and BglII restriction enzyme sites, respectively, to facilitate subsequent ligation into the KpnI-BglII site of pGL3-basic. The forward primer sequences were 5′-ccggtaccCGCCCTCATGTCTTCAAGGG-3′ (−493 to +3) ccggtaccGAGGAGGTGCAGAGTGAGGC (−374 to +3) and 5′-ccggtaccCCGGTACCTGGATTGCGTGCTCTTGCTC-3′ (−114 to +3). One reverse primer (5′-gaagatctTCTCAGCTCTTAGGTCTCCTCTGCC-3′) was used to generate all deletion mutant promoters (lowercase letters in the forward and reverse primers indicate KpnI and BglII restriction sites, respectively). The PCR products were digested with KpnI and BglII and then ligated into the pGL3-basic vector. An internal deletion construct lacking Egr-1-binding motifs (−185 to −163) in pGDNF-Luc(−493/+3) was generated using two-step PCR yielding pGDNF-Luc(−493/+3ΔEgr1). The primers used for the first step were 5′-ccggtaccCGCCCTCATGTCTTCAAGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-tctcgagAGGAGGGCGAAGGC-3′ (−493 to −185; reverse); 5′-actcgagACACGGTGGCCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-gaagatctTCTCAGCTCTTAGGTCTCCTCTGCC-3′ (−163 to +3; reverse). (Lowercase letters indicate XhoI restriction sites.) The PCR products were digested with XhoI and ligated. In the second step, the primers were 5′-ccggtaccCGCCCTCATGTCTTCAAGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-gaagatctTCTCAGCTCTTAGGTCTCCTCTGCC-3′ (reverse). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and restriction analysis. C6 cells or primary cultured astrocytes were seeded into 12-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of promoter-reporter construct using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Elk-1 trans-acting activity, cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of trans-activator plasmid (pFA2-Elk1) and 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid (pFR-Luc). To monitor transfection efficiency, 50 ng of the pRL-null plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase was included in all samples. Where indicated, 0.2 μg of mammalian expression vector was also included. At 24-h post-transfection, the levels of firefly and Renilla luciferase activity were measured sequentially from a single sample using the Dual-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega) with a luminometer (Centro LB960; Berthold Tech, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity, and the relative amount of luciferase activity in the untreated cells was designated as 1. Cells were lysed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein samples (20 μg/lane) were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Western blotting was performed according to standard procedures using antibodies specific for Egr-1 (1:1000 dilution), ERK2 (1:5000), or GAPDH (1:2000) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or for phospho-Raf1 (1:1000), phospho-(Thr202/Tyr204)-ERK1/2 (1:1000), phospho-(Thr180/Tyr182)-p38 (1:1000), or phospho-(Thr183/Tyr185)-JNK (1:1000) (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The signals were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). The small hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmid targeting mouse Egr-1 mRNA (pSilencer/siEgr1) and the generation of C6 cells expressing Egr-1 siRNA (C6/SiEgr-1) or control siRNA (C6/Scramble) have been described previously (19Choi B.H. Kim C.G. Bae Y.S. Lim Y. Lee Y.H. Shin S.Y. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). C6 cells or primary cultured astrocytes plated on coverslips were treated with 0 or 10 ng/ml of FGF2 for 24 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin as described previously (20Shin S.Y. Bahk Y.Y. Ko J. Chung I.Y. Lee Y.S. Downward J. Eibel H. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. Kim Y.H. Lee B. Lee Y.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The coverslips were co-stained with rabbit anti-Gdnf (1:100) and mouse anti-S100 (1:200) antibodies for the mouse astrocyte marker, for 90 min at room temperature and then incubated for 30 min with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, yielding green and red signals, respectively. The labeled cells were examined under an Olympus FV-1000 Spectral confocal laser-scanning microscope with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 550 nm. Primary cultured astrocytes treated with FGF2 (10 ng/ml) were treated with 1% formaldehyde to cross-link the DNA, lysed, and chromatin immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-Egr-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal rabbit IgG as described previously (21Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The precipitated DNA was analyzed by standard RT-PCR methods. All procedures were carried out with the approval of the Konkuk University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For preparation of samples, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of Zoletil (22.5 mg/kg; Virbac, Carros, France) and Xylazine (7.5 mg/kg; Bayer, KS) and perfused transcardially with a fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Brains were post-fixed for 24 h in the same fixative solution and bisected sagitally at the midline. The samples were embedded in paraffin, cut into serial sections 4-μm thick, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out using a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). The paraffin sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, heated in 0.01 m sodium citrate for 10 min in a microwave to retrieve the antigen, and treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. They were then incubated with blocking solution containing 1.5% anti-horse serum and 5% bovine serum albumin. The sections were incubated with anti-Gdnf antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 60 min and then with a avidin-biotin peroxidase complex for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were treated with peroxidase substrate kits (Vector Labs) to visualize immunoreactivity, counterstained with hematoxylin, and dehydrated in ethanol. After clearing in xylene, sections were coverslipped and examined under a Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoreactive cells were quantitatively analyzed by a computerized image analyzer MetaMorph 7.5 (Molecular Devices, Downington, PA). The immunopositive cells in three nonconsecutive sections per mouse were counted by two blinded independent investigators using the image analyzer at a magnification of ×200. Results are expressed as the mean number of cells per mm2 ± S.D. Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance using SPSS for Windows (version 14.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). For the assay of Gdnf release, Egr-1+/− or Egr-1−/− astrocytes were cultured with or without 10 ng/ml of FGF2 at a density of 13 × 104/cm2 on a 12-well plate. After 48 h treatment, conditioned medium was collected and stored at −80 °C until assayed. GDNF protein levels in cell-conditioned media were determined using a Gdnf enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). To investigate the molecular mechanism of FGF2 regulation of Gdnf expression, we first determined the ability of FGF2 to induce the expression of Gdnf by quantitative real time-PCR using the TaqMan fluogenic probes in rat astrocytes. After 12 and 24 h of exposure to FGF2, Gdnf mRNA was increased 9.7- and 9.2-fold, respectively, as compared with control cells in a dissociated culture of rat astrocytes (Fig. 1A), and increased 4.4- and 5.6-fold, respectively, as compared with control cells in C6 glioma cells (Fig. 1B). All of the dissociated cultures of rat astrocytes were shown to express S-100, an astrocyte marker, by confocal microscopy. Notably, FGF2 treatment enhanced Gdnf immunoreactivity in the dissociated rat astrocyte culture (Fig. 1C). These data clearly demonstrate that FGF2 induces up-regulation of Gdnf expression in rat astrocytes. To identify the cis-acting region that mediates the responsiveness of the rat Gdnf gene to FGF2, progressively deleted Gdnf promoter-reporter constructs were made and transfected into rat primary astrocytes. The basal promoter activity of the −493/+3 and −114/+3 constructs was 10 and 5 times higher, respectively, than that of the −983/+3 construct (Fig. 1D), suggesting negative regulatory elements between nucleotides −983 and −492 control basal transcription. In contrast, FGF2-induced promoter activity approximately doubled in the −983/+3, −493/+3, and −374/+3 constructs but remained the same in the −114/+3 construct. Similar results were obtained in C6 glioma cells, although the observed increases in basal activity were much smaller than those seen in primary cultured astrocytes (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that a proximal region between −374 and −114 of the Gdnf promoter contains a cis-acting regulatory element responsive to FGF2. An analysis of the Gdnf promoter sequences spanning −374 to −114 performed using the program MatInspector revealed the presence of three putative binding motifs for Egr-1 proximal to the transcription start site at positions −185 to −163 (Fig. 2A). Egr-1 is a Cys2/His2-type zinc finger transcription factor that regulates cell growth, differentiation, and development (22Thiel G. Cibelli G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). To assess whether Egr-1 activates the Gdnf promoter, we co-transfected the −493/+3 Gdnf promoter construct and the expression plasmid for DA-Egr-1, pcDNA3.1/Egr1(I293F), into rat primary cultured astrocytes. In the absence of FGF2 treatment, the forced expression of DA-Egr-1 caused basal reporter activity to increase as the amount of transfected DNA increased (Fig. 2B). To characterize whether the Egr-1-binding motifs were responsible for stimulation of the GDNF gene promoter by Egr-1, we generated an internal deletion construct lacking all three Egr-1-binding motifs (−493/+3ΔEgr1). As shown in Fig. 2C, transfection of DA-Egr-1 into rat primary astrocytes had no appreciable effect on the reporter activity of the −493/+3ΔEgr1 or −114/+3 constructs, which lack apparent Egr-1-binding sequences. To assess the contribution of the Egr-1-binding sequences to the activation of the GDNF promoter by FGF2, the transcriptional activity of these deletion constructs in response to FGF2 was evaluated in rat primary astrocytes. As shown in Fig. 2D, FGF2 approximately doubled the reporter activity in the −493/+3 construct, but not in the −493/+3ΔEgr1 or −114/+3 constructs. Similar results were obtained in C6 glioma cells (data not shown). These observations indicate that the Egr-1-binding motifs are cis-acting elements necessary for maximal activation of the GDNF promoter by FGF2. Egr-1 expression is induced by FGF2 in several cell lines (23Jin Y. Sheikh F. Detillieux K.A. Cattini P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 984-990PubMed Google Scholar, 24Santiago F.S. Lowe H.C. Day F.L.

Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1026-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings, Egr-1 expression was clearly up-regulated by FGF2 as a function of time in primary rat astrocytes (Fig. 3A) or in C6 glioma cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, FGF2 increased Egr-1 promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner in primary rat astrocytes (Fig. 3C) and C6 cells (Fig. 3D). To determine whether Egr-1 protein binds to the Egr-1-binding sequences in vivo, we performed a ChIP assay. Cross-linked rat primary astrocytes were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Egr-1 antibody or normal rabbit IgG. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by PCR assays using primers flanking the Egr-1-binding sequences (−324 to −88) of the Gdnf promoter. As shown in Fig. 3E, a noticeable increase in the intensity of the DNA band was observed for rabbit anti-Egr-1 antibody but not for the normal rabbit IgG. The off-target region (from −443 to −243) was not amplified, although positive results were obtained from input DNA. This result indicates that a physical interaction between Egr-1 and the Gdnf promoter occurs in vivo upon FGF2 treatment. In many cell systems, activation of MAPKs, including the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs, induces Egr-1 promoter activity (26Kim C.G. Choi B.H. Son S.W. Yi S.J. Shin S.Y. Lee Y.H.

To identify the signal transduction pathway that mediates FGF2-induced expression of Egr-1 in primary rat astrocytes, we examined the ability of FGF2 to stimulate MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). After serum-starved rat astrocytes were treated with FGF2 for various lengths of time, the activation status of MAPKs was assessed using phospho-specific antibodies. The levels of phosphorylated Raf, p38 kinase, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2 increased in a time-dependent manner upon FGF2 treatment. These increases in the phosphorylated levels were evident within 15 min after FGF2 treatment. Similar results were observed in C6 cells (Fig. 4B). To determine whether activation of these MAPKs was associated with FGF2-induced Egr-1 expression, the effects of chemical inhibitors were assessed. Pretreatment of primary rat astrocytes with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 completely inhibited FGF2-stimulated Egr-1 expression, whereas neither the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 nor the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 had any effect (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained in C6 cells (Fig. 4D). As a ternary complex factor, Elk-1 forms a complex with serum response factor on the serum response element (32Ling Y. Lakey J.H. Roberts C.E. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Elk-1 is activated by ERK, and JNK (33Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2006; 73: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and its transactivation plays a crucial role in extracellular signaling-induced transcription of Egr-1 (34Schratt G. Weinhold B.

Kola I. Papas T.S. Seth A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To determine whether the ERK and JNK pathways induce Egr-1 expression via Elk-1 transactivation upon FGF2 stimulation in primary astrocytes, Elk-1 trans-acting activity was examined using a reporter assay system. Primary rat astrocytes were co-transfected with the trans-acting plasmid Gal4-Elk-1 and the pFR-Luc reporter plasmid containing Gal4-binding sequences. Treatment with FGF2 tripled the trans-acting activity of Gal4-Elk-1 (Fig. 5A). However, this activity was strongly inhibited in the presence of DN-MEK1, DN-ERK2, or DN-JNK1. Similarly, FGF2-induced Egr-1 promoter activity (Fig. 5B) and Gdnf promoter activity (Fig. 5C) were strongly attenuated by the expression of DN-MEK, DN-ERK2, or DN-JNK1. These data demonstrate that both ERK and JNK pathways are involved in FGF2-induced expression of Egr-1 and Gdnf. To determine whether Egr-1 plays a functional role in FGF2 regulation of Gdnf transcription, we used RNA interference. First, the knockdown of Egr-1 expression in primary rat astrocytes by transient transfection of shRNA plasmids generating Egr-1-specific siRNA (pSilencer/siEgr1) was verified (Fig. 6A). Then, FGF2-induced Gdnf expression was measured under these conditions using Western blotting. The transient expression of Egr-1 siRNA clearly attenuated activation of the Gdnf promoter (Fig. 6B) and accumulation of Gdnf mRNAs (Fig. 6C) by FGF2. To further evaluate the importance of Egr-1 expression in FGF2-mediated transcriptional activation of the Gdnf gene, we used C6 cell lines stably expressing Egr-1 siRNA (19Choi B.H. Kim C.G. Bae Y.S.

https://openalex.org/W2106136271,"The goal of this study was to determine the effect of X11α on ApoE receptor 2 (ApoEr2) trafficking and the functional significance of this interaction on cell movement in MCF 10A epithelial cells. We found that X11α increased surface levels of ApoEr2 by 64% compared to vector control, as determined by surface protein biotinylation. To examine the functional significance of this effect, we tested whether ApoEr2 played a novel role in cell movement in a wound-healing assay. We found that overexpression of ApoEr2 in MCF 10A cells increased cell migration velocity by 87% (P<0.01, n=4) compared to GFP control. Cotransfection of X11α had an additive effect on average velocity compared to ApoEr2 alone (13%; P<0.05, n=4). In addition, we tested whether ApoEr2 ligands altered the effect of ApoEr2 on cell movement. We found that treatment with concentrated medium containing the extracellular matrix protein Reelin, but not control medium, further increased the velocity of ApoEr2- but not APP-transfected cells (20%;P<0.001, n=4). Similarly, Reelin treatment increased cell velocity in the presence of ApoEr2 and X11α (10%;P<0.05, n=4).

At present, it is unclear whether the beneficial effects of music are limited to lessening the bradykinesia of whole body movement or whether beneficial effects also extend to skilled movements of PD subjects. This question was addressed in the present study in which control and PD subjects were given a skilled reaching task that was performed with and without accompanying preferred musical pieces. Eye movements and limb use were monitored with biomechanical measures and limb movements were additionally assessed using a previously described movement element scoring system. Preferred musical pieces did not lessen limb and hand movement impairments as assessed with either the biomechanical measures or movement element scoring. Nevertheless, the PD patients with more severe motor symptoms as assessed by Hoehn and Yahr (HY) scores displayed enhanced visual engagement of the target and this impairment was reduced during trials performed in association with accompanying preferred musical pieces. The results are discussed in relation to the idea that preferred musical pieces, although not generally beneficial in lessening skilled reaching impairments, may normalize the balance between visual and proprioceptive guidance of skilled reaching."
https://openalex.org/W2160135082,"Background Caspase-12 functions as an antiinflammatory enzyme inhibiting caspase-1 and the NOD2/RIP2 pathways. Due to increased susceptibility to sepsis in individuals with functional caspase-12, an early-stop mutation leading to the loss of caspase-12 has replaced the ancient genotype in Eurasia and a significant proportion of individuals from African populations. In African-Americans, it has been shown that caspase-12 inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Methodology/Principal Findings We assessed whether similar mechanisms are present in African individuals, and whether evolutionary pressures due to plague may have led to the present caspase-12 genotype population frequencies. No difference in cytokine induction through the caspase-1 and/or NOD2/RIP2 pathways was observed in two independent African populations, among individuals with either an intact or absent caspase-12. In addition, stimulations with Yersinia pestis and two other species of Yersinia were preformed to investigate whether caspase-12 modulates the inflammatory reaction induced by Yersinia. We found that caspase-12 did not modulate cytokine production induced by Yersinia spp. Conclusions Our experiments demonstrate for the first time the involvement of the NOD2/RIP2 pathway for recognition of Yersinia. However, caspase-12 does not modulate innate host defense against Y. pestis and alternative explanations for the geographical distribution of caspase-12 should be sought."
https://openalex.org/W2106594424,"Potentially chloroquine resistant P. falciparum, identified by the 76T haplotype in the chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt 76T), are highly prevalent throughout Africa. In Guinea-Bissau, normal and double dose chloroquine have respective efficacies of 34% and 78% against P.falciparum with pfcrt 76T and approximately three times the normal dose of chloroquine is routinely taken. Proportions of pfcrt 76T generally increase during high transmission seasons, as P.falciparum with pfcrt 76T commonly survive treatment with normal dose chloroquine. In Guinea-Bissau, there should be no seasonal increase of pfcrt 76T if the high doses of CQ commonly used are effective.P. falciparum parasite density, age, sex, the proportion of chloroquine resistance associated haplotypes pfcrt 76T and P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 86Y were assessed in 988 samples collected from children between 2002 and 2007. There was no seasonal accumulation of any allele. During the high and low transmission periods the pfcrt 76T proportions were 24% (95% CI, 21-27%) and 26% (95% CI, 20-33%). There was no significant change of pfcrt 76T (OR 1.05, 95% CI; 0.94-1.16 p = 0.39) or pfmdr1 86Y (OR 0.92, 95%CI; 0.83-1.01 p = 0.08) proportions between 2003 and 2007. Lower median parasite density (P.falciparum/microl) was associated with pfcrt 76T (15254 [95% CI, 12737-17772]; n = 164) compared to pfcrt 76K (18664 [95% CI, 16676-20653]; p = 0.003; n = 591). Similarly, pfmdr1 86Y was associated with a lower median parasite density (16320 [95% CI, 13696-18944]; n = 224) compared to pfmdr1 86N, (18880 [95% CI, 16701-21059]; P = 0.018; n = 445).In contrast to the rest of Africa, P. falciparum parasites resistant to normal dose chloroquine do not have a selective advantage great enough to become the dominant P.falciparum type in Guinea-Bissau. This is most likely due to the efficacy of high-dose chloroquine as used in Guinea-Bissau, combined with a loss of fitness associated with pfcrt 76T."
https://openalex.org/W2046409264,"Background Activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) within antigen presenting cells (APCs) is linked to abnormal APCs differentiation and function. We have previously shown that STAT3 is activated within APC by a novel contact-dependent mechanism, which plays a key role in mediating the immunomodulatory effects of hMSC. In order to better understand the underlying mechanisms that control APC maturation in a contact dependent manner, we extended our observation to tumor cells. Tumors were shown to secrete a variety of tumor-derived factors that activate STAT3 within infiltrating APCs. We now tested whether tumor cells can activate STAT3 within APC using the contact-dependent mechanism, in addition to soluble factors, and compared these two STAT3 activating pathways. Principal Findings We demonstrate that in addition to tumor-derived secreted factors tumor cells activate STAT3 by a mechanism that is based on cell-cell interaction. We further demonstrate that these two STAT3 activating mechanisms differ in their JAK usage and their susceptibility to JSI-124 inhibition thereby representing two distinct pathways. Significantly, although both pathways activate STAT3, they modulate DCs maturation in a different manner that results in disparate phenotypic outcomes. Whereas the soluble-dependent pathway results in an immature phenotype, the contact-dependent pathway results in an apparently mature phenotype. Albeit their mature-like phenotype these latter cells express the tolerogenic markers ILT3 and ILT4 and possess T cell inhibitory activity. Significance This data suggests that, in at least certain cellular microenvironments, cell:cell interactions represent a novel way to activate STAT3 signaling, uncouple APC activation events and consequently regulate immunity and tolerance. Significantly, we have now demonstrated that this contact-dependent signaling pathway differs from that mediated by soluble factors and cytokines, inducing disparate phenotypic outcome, suggesting these two mechanisms have different and possibly complementary biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2067979030,"Weight-bearing stepping, without supraspinal re-connectivity, can be attained by treadmill training in an animal whose spinal cord has been completely transected at the lower thoracic level. Repair of damaged tissue and of supraspinal connectivity/circuitry following spinal cord injury in rat can be achieved by specific cell elimination with radiation therapy of the lesion site delivered within a critical time window, 2-3 weeks postinjury. Here we examined the effects of training in the repaired spinal cord following clinical radiation therapy. Studies were performed in a severe rat spinal cord contusion injury model, one similar to fracture/crush injuries in humans; the injury was at the lower thoracic level and the training was a combined hindlimb standing and stepping protocol. Radiotherapy, in a similar manner to that reported previously, resulted in a significant level of tissue repair/preservation at the lesion site. Training in the irradiated group, as determined by limb kinematics tests, resulted in functional improvements that were significant for standing and stepping capacity, and yielded a significant direct correlation between standing and stepping performance. In contrast, the training in the unirradiated group resulted in no apparent beneficial effects, and yielded an inverse correlation between standing and stepping performance, e.g., subject with good standing showed poor stepping capacity. Further, without any training, a differential functional change was observed in the irradiated group; standing capacity was significantly inhibited while stepping showed a slight trend of improvement compared with the unirradiated group. These data suggest that following repair by radiation therapy the spinal circuitries which control posture and locomotor were modified, and that the beneficial functional modulation of these circuitries is use dependent. Further, for restoring beneficial motor function following radiotherapy, training seems to be crucial."
https://openalex.org/W2093515618,"Background During development, neurons modify their axon growth mode switching from an elongating phase, in which the main axon stem reaches the target territory through growth cone-driven extension, to an arborising phase, when the terminal arbour is formed to establish synaptic connections. To investigate the relative contribution of cell-autonomous factors and environmental signals in the control of these distinct axon growth patterns, we examined the neuritogenesis of Purkinje neurons in cerebellar cultures prepared at elongating (embryonic day 17) or arborising (postnatal day zero) stages of Purkinje axon maturation. Methodology/Principal Findings When placed in vitro, Purkinje cells of both ages undergo an initial phase of neurite elongation followed by the development of terminal ramifications. Nevertheless, elongation of the main axon stem prevails in embryonic Purkinje axons, and many of these neurons are totally unable to form terminal branches. On the contrary, all postnatal neurites switch to arbour growth within a few days in culture and spread extensive terminal trees. Regardless of their elongating or arborising pattern, defined growth features (e.g. growth rate and tree extension) of embryonic Purkinje axons remain distinct from those of postnatal neurites. Thus, Purkinje neurons of different ages are endowed with intrinsic stage-specific competence for neuritic growth. Such competence, however, can be modified by environmental cues. Indeed, while exposure to the postnatal environment stimulates the growth of embryonic axons without modifying their phenotype, contact-mediated signals derived from granule cells specifically induce arborising growth and modulate the dynamics of neuritic elongation. Conclusions/Significance Cultured Purkinje cells recapitulate an intrinsically coded neuritogenic program, involving initial navigation of the axon towards the target field and subsequent expansion of the terminal arborisation. The execution of this program is regulated by environmental signals that modify the growth competence of Purkinje cells, so to adapt their endogenous properties to the different phases of neuritic morphogenesis."

During endoplasmic reticulum stress, binding of Pur alpha to the INE decreased; the element acted as a positive regulator in early stress by binding of the transcription factor ATF4 and as a negative regulator in prolonged stress by binding the stress-induced C/EBP family member, CHOP. We conclude that transcriptional control of the Cat-1 gene is tightly controlled by multiple cis-DNA elements, contributing to regulation of cationic amino acid transport for cell growth and proliferation. In addition, we propose that genes may use stress-response elements such as the INE to support basal expression in the absence of stress."
https://openalex.org/W2018284255,"Recent studies suggest that high-affinity neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) containing alpha4 and beta2 subunits (alpha4beta2*) functionally interact with G-protein-coupled dopamine (DA) D(2) receptors in basal ganglia. We hypothesized that if a functional interaction between these receptors exists, then mice expressing an M2 point mutation (Leu9'Ala) rendering alpha4 nAChRs hypersensitive to ACh may exhibit altered sensitivity to a D(2)-receptor agonist. When challenged with the D(2)R agonist, quinpirole (0.5-10 mg/kg), Leu9'Ala mice, but not wild-type (WT) littermates, developed severe, reversible motor impairment characterized by rigidity, catalepsy, akinesia, and tremor. While striatal DA tissue content, baseline release, and quinpirole-induced DA depletion did not differ between Leu9'Ala and WT mice, quinpirole dramatically increased activity of cholinergic striatal interneurons only in mutant animals, as measured by increased c-Fos expression in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive interneurons. Highlighting the importance of the cholinergic system in this mouse model, inhibiting the effects of ACh by blocking muscarinic receptors, or by selectively activating hypersensitive nAChRs with nicotine, rescued motor symptoms. This novel mouse model mimics the imbalance between striatal DA/ACh function associated with severe motor impairment in disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and the data suggest that a D(2)R-alpha4*-nAChR functional interaction regulates cholinergic interneuron activity."
https://openalex.org/W2121182661,"Background In genetic studies of rare complex diseases it is common to ascertain familial data from population based registries through all incident cases diagnosed during a pre-defined enrollment period. Such an ascertainment procedure is typically taken into account in the statistical analysis of the familial data by constructing either a retrospective or prospective likelihood expression, which conditions on the ascertainment event. Both of these approaches lead to a substantial loss of valuable data. Methodology and Findings Here we consider instead the possibilities provided by a Bayesian approach to risk analysis, which also incorporates the ascertainment procedure and reference information concerning the genetic composition of the target population to the considered statistical model. Furthermore, the proposed Bayesian hierarchical survival model does not require the considered genotype or haplotype effects be expressed as functions of corresponding allelic effects. Our modeling strategy is illustrated by a risk analysis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) in the Finnish population-based on the HLA-A, HLA-B and DRB1 human leucocyte antigen (HLA) information available for both ascertained sibships and a large number of unrelated individuals from the Finnish bone marrow donor registry. The heterozygous genotype DR3/DR4 at the DRB1 locus was associated with the lowest predictive probability of T1D free survival to the age of 15, the estimate being 0.936 (0.926; 0.945 95% credible interval) compared to the average population T1D free survival probability of 0.995. Significance The proposed statistical method can be modified to other population-based family data ascertained from a disease registry provided that the ascertainment process is well documented, and that external information concerning the sizes of birth cohorts and a suitable reference sample are available. We confirm the earlier findings from the same data concerning the HLA-DR3/4 related risks for T1D, and also provide here estimated predictive probabilities of disease free survival as a function of age."
https://openalex.org/W2144940576,"Background Colorectal cancer is mainly attributed to diet, but the role exerted by foods remains unclear because involved factors are extremely complex. Geography substantially impacts on foods. Correlations between international variation in colorectal cancer-associated mutation patterns and food availabilities could highlight the influence of foods on colorectal mutagenesis. Methodology To test such hypothesis, we applied techniques based on hierarchical clustering, feature extraction and selection, and statistical pattern recognition to the analysis of 2,572 colorectal cancer-associated TP53 mutations from 12 countries/geographic areas. For food availabilities, we relied on data extracted from the Food Balance Sheets of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Dendrograms for mutation sites, mutation types and food patterns were constructed through Ward's hierarchical clustering algorithm and their stability was assessed evaluating silhouette values. Feature selection used entropy-based measures for similarity between clusterings, combined with principal component analysis by exhaustive and heuristic approaches. Conclusion/Significance Mutations clustered in two major geographic groups, one including only Western countries, the other Asia and parts of Europe. This was determined by variation in the frequency of transitions at CpGs, the most common mutation type. Higher frequencies of transitions at CpGs in the cluster that included only Western countries mainly reflected higher frequencies of mutations at CpG codons 175, 248 and 273, the three major TP53 hotspots. Pearson's correlation scores, computed between the principal components of the datamatrices for mutation types, food availability and mutation sites, demonstrated statistically significant correlations between transitions at CpGs and both mutation sites and availabilities of meat, milk, sweeteners and animal fats, the energy-dense foods at the basis of “Western” diets. This is best explainable by differential exposure to nitrosative DNA damage due to foods that promote metabolic stress and chronic inflammation."
