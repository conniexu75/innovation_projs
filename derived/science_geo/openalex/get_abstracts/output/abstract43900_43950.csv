https://openalex.org/W2026891958,"The mechanism of self-tolerance is studied in T-cell-receptor transgenic mice expressing a receptor in many of their T cells for the male (H–Y) antigen in the context of class I H–2Db MHC antigens. Autospecific T cells are deleted in male mice. The deletion affects only transgene-expressing cells with a relatively high surface-density of CDS molecules, including nonmature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, and is not caused by anti-idiotype cells."
https://openalex.org/W1993303421,"Brain glucose uptake, oxygen metabolism, and blood flow in humans were measured with positron emission tomography, and a resting-state molar ratio of oxygen to glucose consumption of 4.1:1 was obtained. Physiological neural activity, however, increased glucose uptake and blood flow much more (51 and 50 percent, respectively) than oxygen consumption (5 percent) and produced a molar ratio for the increases of 0.4:1. Transient increases in neural activity cause a tissue uptake of glucose in excess of that consumed by oxidative metabolism, acutely consume much less energy than previously believed, and regulate local blood flow for purposes other than oxidative metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1963569988,The CD4 and CD8 T cell antigens are thought to transduce an independent signal during the process of T cell activation. We report our evaluation of the possible involvement of the lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase p56lck in these transduction pathways. Our data demonstrate that p56lck is specifically modulated with either CD4 or CD8 following antibody-mediated cross-linking of these molecules and that a large fraction of the total cellular lck protein can be coimmunoprecipitated with these surface glycoproteins. These results suggest that p56lck is functionally and physically associated with CD4/CD8 in normal murine T lymphocytes and support the concept that an independent signal is transduced by the interaction of these surface molecules with major histocompatibility complex determinants.
https://openalex.org/W2074061180,"In order to investigate how peptides associate with class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins intracellularly, we generated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for a readily available soluble protein in association with class I. C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice immunized against a syngeneic tumor cell transfected with chicken ovalbumin (OVA) cDNA gave rise to H-2Kb-restricted CTL specific for the OVA258-276 peptide. This synthetic peptide and CNBr fragments of OVA (242-285 and 242-273) were able to target H-2b cells for lysis by the CTL in a 3 hr assay. Cells incubated with native OVA for up to 24 hr did not become sensitized for recognition and lysis. However, when OVA was introduced directly into the cytoplasm of cells by the osmotic lysis of pinosomes, the Kb restricted determinant formed readily."
https://openalex.org/W2048085771,"Molecules involved in the antigen receptor-dependent regulation of early T cell activation genes were investigated with the use of functional sequences of the T cell activation-specific enhancer of interleukin-2 (IL-2). One of these sequences forms a protein complex, NFAT-1, specifically with nuclear extracts of activated T cells. This complex appeared 10 to 25 minutes before the activation of the IL-2 gene. Studies with inhibitors of protein synthesis indicated that the time of synthesis of the activator of the IL-2 gene in Jurkat T cells corresponds to the time of appearance of NFAT-1. NFAT-1, or a very similar protein, bound functional sequences of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1; the LTR of this virus is known to be stimulated during early T cell activation. The binding site for this complex activated a linked promoter after transfection into antigen receptor-activated T cells but not other cell types. These characteristics suggest that NFAT-1 transmits signals initiated at the T cell antigen receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2073173912,"Proteins undergo a series of nonenzymatic reactions with glucose over time to form advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs). Macrophages have a receptor that recognizes the AGE moiety and mediates the uptake and degradation of AGE proteins. This removal process is associated with the production and secretion of cachectin (tumor necrosis factor) and interleukin-1, two cytokines with diverse and seemingly paradoxical biological activities. The localized release and action of these cytokines could account for the coordinated removal and replacement of senescent extracellular matrix components in normal tissue homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W1984125372,"A 16-kilodalton protein expressed in cells producing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) was identified as the gene product of the vpu open reading frame. When expressed in vitro, the 81-amino acid vpu protein reacted with about one-third of the serum samples from AIDS patients that were tested, indicating that the vpu open reading frame is expressed in vivo as well. Introduction of a frame-shift mutation into the vpu open reading frame did not significantly interfere with expression of the major viral proteins in a transient expression system. However, a five- to tenfold reduction in progeny virions was observed after the infection of T lymphocytes with the mutant virus. These data suggest that the vpu gene product is required for efficient virus replication and may have a role in assembly or maturation of progeny virions."

https://openalex.org/W1965131361,"In studies of the genetics of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the product of the nef gene, formerly known as F, 3'-orf, or B-ORF, was a negative regulator of HIV-1 replication. Proviruses with mutations in the nef gene replicated better than their standard counterparts during transient expression, and the mutant virus maintained its enhanced replication even after serial passages in T lymphocytes. The nef protein trans-suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, the replication of wild-type and nef mutant proviruses and the expression of reporter genes linked to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). The repression induced by the nef protein was mediated by inhibition of transcription from the HIV-1 LTR, which contains a far upstream cis element (previously recognized to be a negative regulatory element) between 340 and 156 nucleotides upstream of the RNA initiation site."
https://openalex.org/W2051349356,"Cyclosporine A (CsA) is an important immunosuppressive drug that is widely used in transplantation medicine. Many of its suppressive effects on T cells appear to be related to the inhibition of T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation events. Paradoxically, in certain situations CsA is responsible for the induction of a T cell-mediated autoimmunity. The effects of CsA on T cell development in the thymus were investigated to elucidate the physiologic events underlying this phenomenon. Two major effects were revealed: (i) CsA inhibits the development of mature single positive (CD4+8- or CD4-8+) TCR-alpha beta+ thymocytes without discernibly affecting CD4-8- TCR-gamma delta+ thymocytes and (ii) CsA interferes with the deletion of cells bearing self-reactive TCRs in the population of single positive thymocytes that do develop. This suggests a direct mechanism for CsA-induced autoimmunity and may have implications for the relative contribution of TCR-mediated signaling events in the development of the various T cell lineages."

https://openalex.org/W1515192237,"The expression of the gene encoding the facilitated glucose transporter (GT) protein was studied in fibroblast cell lines. Addition of 15% calf serum to confluent BALB/c3T3, NIH3T3, or Rat-2 cells rapidly induced a 5-10-fold increase in GT mRNA, as determined by hybridization of size-fractionated total RNA to a rat brain GT cDNA. The rise in GT mRNA was maximal at 3-4 h after stimulation, and then returned to basal values by 16 h. The serum-stimulated increase in GT mRNA was not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) or anisomycin (100 microM). In BALB/c3T3 cells, fibroblast growth factor (100 ng/ml), platelet-derived growth factor (5 units/ml), and epidermal growth factor (40 ng/ml) stimulated GT mRNA accumulation, although, when added individually, none of these growth factors increased DNA synthesis. The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which activates the enzyme protein kinase C, also caused GT mRNA accumulation in BALB/c3T3 and NIH3T3 cells. Prolonged pretreatment of cells with TPA abolished the response to TPA but not fibroblast growth factor. The involvement of GT gene transcription was assessed by the nuclear run-on technique. Treatment of NIH3T3 cells with serum increased transcription at least 10-20-fold by 30 min and returned to near basal levels by 2 h. This rapid activation paralleled that of the c-fos gene, but preceded the increase in c-myc gene transcription. These data indicate the following: 1) serum growth factors increase glucose transporter mRNA levels by a process not requiring intermediary new protein synthesis and clearly dissociable from mitogenesis, 2) the changes in GT mRNA are preceded by a rapid and transient activation of GT gene transcription, and 3) there exist protein kinase C-dependent and independent pathways for regulation of GT gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2033955212,"The T cell surface molecule CD4 interacts with class II MHC molecules on the surface of target cells as well as with the envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Internalization of CD4 molecules is observed after exposure of CD4+ T cells to either phorbol esters or appropriate antigen-bearing target cells. To determine whether HIV entry proceeds via receptor-mediated endocytosis or direct viral fusion with the cell membrane, we have constructed two mutants in the cytoplasmic domain of the CD4 protein that severely impair the ability of CD4 molecules to undergo endocytosis. Quantitative infectivity studies reveal that HeLa cell lines expressing wild-type or mutant CD4 molecules are equally susceptible to HIV infection. In addition, HIV binding does not lead to CD4 endocytosis. These studies indicate that although the CD4 molecule can be internalized, HIV entry proceeds via direct fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1513774612,"Human endothelial cells synthesize large amounts of platelet-activating factor (PAF) after 30-min treatment with recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Synthesis of PAF peaks at 4-6 h, whereas in endothelial cells treated with interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1) it peaks at 8-12 h. More than twice as much PAF is synthesized in response to optimal concentrations of TNF than in response to IL-1. However, PAF synthesis is stimulated by lower molar concentrations of IL-1 than TNF. About 30% of PAF produced in response to either TNF or IL-1 is released into the medium, whereas approximately 70% remains cell-associated. Experiments with labeled precursors show that PAF is synthesized de novo in response to TNF. This activity of TNF is inhibited by treating endothelial cells with the inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis cycloheximide or actinomycin D. This finding may be explained by the observation that TNF induces in endothelial cells an acetyltransferase required for PAF synthesis. The induction of this enzymatic activity precedes the peak of PAF synthesis in TNF-treated cells. After prolonged incubation with either TNF or IL-1, endothelial cells no longer respond to the same monokine, but are still capable of producing PAF when treated with the other monokine. The finding that these monokines do not show reciprocal tachyphylaxis in endothelial cells may be explained by their binding to different receptors. In cells treated simultaneously with different concentrations of TNF and IL-1, PAF synthesis is stimulated in an additive rather than synergistic way. This suggests that PAF is synthesized by the same pathway in response to TNF or IL-1."

https://openalex.org/W2023200899,"All of the T cell receptor alpha- and beta-chain rearrangements present in a dual reactive T cell clone were characterized. This clone exhibits allelic exclusion of its beta-chain genes in that only one of the two alleles is productively rearranged. Unexpectedly, it displays two productive V alpha-gene rearrangements, which are both transcribed into 1.5 kb mRNA. The contribution of each of the two productive alpha genes to the dual recognition was analyzed by gene transfer. To this end, each of the two alpha genes was separately transfected with the single productively rearranged beta gene. Transfer of only one of the two alpha beta combinations restored both allogeneic MHC recognition and self MHC-restricted antigen recognition. Thus, T cell dual recognition results from the cross-reactive recognition of an allo-MHC product by a single antigen-specific and MHC-restricted alpha beta T cell receptor. Furthermore, the presence of two productively rearranged alpha-chain genes in a T cell clone raises questions concerning the level at which allelic exclusion operates in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1991157588,"We have tested the role of protein kinase C in mRNA expression and T cell proliferation mediated through the T cell receptor and through the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor. Chronic treatment of a mouse T cell clone with phorbol esters caused a complete loss of protein kinase C activity and a concomitant loss of proliferation to T cell receptor ligands (antigen, lectins, antireceptor antibodies). In contrast, kinase C-depleted T cells retained the ability to proliferate to IL-2. Loss of the T cell receptor response was not due to decreased cell surface expression of receptor or impairment of early receptor function (phosphatidylinositol turnover, calcium mobilization). Kinase C-depleted T cells showed no induction of mRNAs for activation-associated genes on exposure to the T cell receptor ligand Concanavalin A; expression of a subset of the same mRNAs in response to IL-2 was unaffected. We conclude that kinase C is required for mRNA expression and subsequent proliferation mediated through the T cell receptor pathway but is not involved in mRNA expression and proliferation in response to IL-2."

https://openalex.org/W2028277782,"Single amino acid substitutions at nine different positions on the H-2Kb molecules from in vitro-mutagenized, immunologically altered, somatic cell variants were correlated with their patterns of recognition by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and allogeneic cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones. While MAbs were found to detect spatially discrete, domain-specific sites, CTLs interacted simultaneously with multiple residues on the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of the Kb molecule. The computer graphic three-dimensional Kb model structure showed that, of the seven CTL-specific residues analyzed, six residues were located on the alpha-helical regions of the two domains. Every CTL clone was found to interact with a distinct pattern of residues composed of a specific subset of the CTL-specific residues."

https://openalex.org/W1576382588,"The pathways of 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (ddAdo) metabolism, a selective inhibitor of the replication of human immunodeficiency virus, were investigated with use of the human T-lymphoid cell line CCRF-CEM which is deficient in either deoxycytidine kinase or adenosine kinase activity, or both. At an extracellular concentration of 10 microM, which blocks the cytopathic effect of human immunodeficiency virus in vitro, ddAdo was found to be metabolized to its mono-, di-, and triphosphates and to dideoxyinosine monophosphate (ddIMP). The metabolism of ddAdo in the kinase-deficient mutants was found to be unchanged by comparison with that in parental cells; however, the inhibition of ddAdo deamination to 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddIno) by the adenosine deaminase inhibitor, 2'-deoxycoformycin, reduced ddAdo nucleotide formation in deoxycytidine kinase-deficient, adenosine kinase-deficient, and doubly kinase-deficient mutants by 42, 54, and 80%, respectively. Incubation of the CCRF-CEM cells with 20 microM L-alanosine, an amino acid antagonist that inhibits purine biosynthesis at the level of adenylosuccinate/lyase synthetase, resulted in 80% inhibition in the accumulation of ddAdo nucleotides in both wild-type and kinase-deficient mutants and also increased ddIMP accumulation 2- to 3-fold. These findings indicate that ddAdo activation in human T-lymphoblasts can occur by three metabolic pathways: directly, by phosphorylation to ddAMP by the action of either deoxycytidine kinase or adenosine kinase and, indirectly, through deamination to ddIno with consequent phosphorylation of ddIno to ddIMP, and reamination to ddAMP in a reaction catalyzed by adenylosuccinate synthetase/lyase. However, in the absence of 2'-deoxycoformycin, the activation of ddAdo to ddATP in T-lymphoid cells is primarily a function of the indirect route."
https://openalex.org/W184609806,"The plasma antithrombotic enzyme activated protein C (APC) has two major plasma inhibitors. One is heparin-dependent, has been characterized, and is known as protein C inhibitor. The second inhibitor was isolated based on its heparin-independent ability to inhibit and complex with APC. The purified inhibitor had the amino acid composition and NH2 terminus of alpha 1-antitrypsin and reacted with monoclonal antibodies to alpha 1-antitrypsin. The inhibitor was greater than 95% pure alpha 1-antitrypsin as judged by electroimmunoassay, inactivation of trypsin, and electrophoresis in two gel systems. To identify the second major plasma inhibitor of APC, immunoblot studies of enzyme-inhibitor complexes were made to compare APC addition to normal plasma and to plasma deficient in protein C inhibitor or alpha 1-antitrypsin. The results showed that alpha 1-antitrypsin is the second major plasma APC inhibitor. Given the association rate constant of alpha 1-antitrypsin for APC of 10 M-1 s-1 and its plasma concentration of approximately 40 microM, it accounts for approximately half of the heparin-independent APC inhibitory activity of plasma. Based on immunoblot analysis plasmas of 15 patients with intravascular coagulation contained APC-alpha 1-antitrypsin complexes suggesting that this inhibition reaction occurs in vivo. Thus, alpha 1-antitrypsin is a major physiologic inhibitor of APC."

https://openalex.org/W2007803211,"The human T cell receptor delta (TCR delta) gene encodes one component of the TCR gamma delta-CD3 complex found on subsets of peripheral blood and thymic T cells. Human TCR delta diversity was estimated by characterizing rearrangements in TCR gamma delta cell lines and determining the structures of complementary DNA clones representing functional and nonfunctional transcripts in these cell lines. One V delta segment and one J delta segment were identified in all functional transcripts, although a distinct J delta segment was identified in a truncated transcript. Further, one D delta element was identified, and evidence for the use of an additional D delta element was obtained. Thus human TCR delta genes appear to use a limited number of germline elements. However, the apparent use of two D delta elements in tandem coupled with imprecise joining and extensive incorporation of N nucleotides generates unprecedented variability in the junctional region."
https://openalex.org/W1515381124,"Regulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein and mRNA were examined in the human leukemic T-cell line CEM-C7. Unlike other cells in which GR regulation has been examined, the growth of these cells is inhibited by glucocorticoids, leading to cell death. Treatment of glucocorticoid-sensitive CEM-C7 cells with 1 microM dexamethasone for 18 h resulted in an increase in both cytoplasmic and nuclear GR protein, as determined by immunoblotting with anti-human GR antisera. Analysis of GR mRNA levels by Northern blotting revealed a corresponding increase in mRNA in steroid-treated cells. An increase in GR mRNA was detectable after as little as 3 h of treatment with dexamethasone, and GR mRNA concentration continued to increase for at least 18 h, well before the onset of growth arrest or cell death. GR mRNA concentration was not altered after dexamethasone treatment of the glucocorticoid-resistant mutant cell line ICR27TK.3, which lacks functional GR. Thus, the increase in GR seen in glucocorticoid-sensitive cells is a GR-mediated response. These results are in sharp contrast to the down-regulation of GR reported in other cells and tissues, and suggest that regulation of the GR by its cognate ligand may be tissue-specific."
https://openalex.org/W2027527107,"To determine whether T cell receptor genes follow the same principle of allelic exclusion as B lymphocytes, we have analyzed the rearrangements and expression of TCRα and β genes in the progeny of the CD3+, M14T line. Here, we show that this line can undergo secondary rearrangements that replace the pre-existing Vα-Jα rearrangements by joining an upstream Vα gene to a downstream Jα segment. Both the productively and nonproductively rearranged alleles in the M14T line can undergo secondary rearrangements while its TCRβ genes are stable. These secondary recombinations are usually productive, and new forms of TCRα polypeptides are expressed in these cells in association with the original Cβ chain. Developmental control of this Vα-Jα replacement phenomenon could play a pivotal role in the thymic selection of the T cell repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W1504658660,"Monolayer cultures of human mesothelial cells made quiescent by serum deprivation are induced to undergo one round of DNA synthesis by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or transforming growth factor type β1 (TGF-β1). This onetime stimulation is independent of other serum components. The kinetics for induction of DNA synthesis observed for PDGF, EGF, and TGF-β1 are all similar to one another, with a peak of DNA synthesis occurring 24-36 h after the addition of the growth factors. Repetitive rounds of DNA synthesis and cell division do not ensue after addition of PDGF, EGF, or TGF-β1 alone or in combination; however, in media supplemented with chemically denatured serum, each of these factors is capable of sustaining continuous replication of mesothelial cells. Stimulation of growth by PDGF and TGF-β1 is unusual for an epithelial cell type, and indicates that mesothelial cells have growth regulatory properties similar to connective tissue cells.— Gabrielson, E.

https://openalex.org/W2079402517,"The murine T cell receptor V alpha 3 gene segment is associated with reactivity to p-azobenzenearsonate, as indicated by several independent lines of evidence. First, three out of four arsonate-reactive T cell clones tested (two I-Ad-and one I-Ak-restricted) utilized V alpha 3. Second, bulk splenic cultures enriched for arsonate/H-2d and arsonate/H-2k responsive T cells showed increased expression of V alpha 3 mRNA. Third, a V alpha 3-containing alpha chain (Ar-5: arsonate/I-Ad) transferred arsonate responsiveness to an appropriate recipient T cell (O3: ovalbumin/I-Ad). Fourth, an independently derived V alpha 3-expressing T cell clone (2C: alloreactive to Ld) showed a response to arsonate/Ld. Thus, a V alpha 3 gene segment, in conjunction with at least two different J alpha segments (J alpha 20'(Ar-5) and J alpha pHDS58(2C)) and at least three different beta chains (V beta 2(Ar-5), V beta 6(O3), and V beta 8(2C], confers reactivity to arsonate in association with at least three different MHC proteins (I-Ad, I-Ak, and Ld). We suggest that V alpha 3 encodes a protein sequence with a binding site for the arsonate hapten."
https://openalex.org/W1566041190,"It was previously demonstrated that freshly isolated rat hepatocytes can internalize severalfold more epidermal growth factor (EGF) molecules than the number of surface EGF receptors, suggesting extensive reutilization of receptors during endocytosis (Gladhaug, I. P. & Christoffersen, T. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 164, 267-275). The present report attempts to explore the pathways involved in the externalization of EGF receptors. Incubation of hepatocytes at 37 degrees C in the absence of ligand increased the surface receptor pool by 50-100% within 45 min. Pretreatment with monensin inhibited the turnover of the surface EGF receptor pool by 50-60% within 10 min and blocked the temperature-dependent externalization of receptors. Cycloheximide caused a slower attenuation of the surface receptor pool, whereas tunicamycin and chloroquine did not significantly affect the exchange of receptor pools. Monensin reduced the surface receptor pool and the endocytic uptake in corresponding proportions, without affecting the internalization of prebound EGF. Endocytic uptake was unaffected by chloroquine and slightly reduced by cycloheximide. The internalization of unoccupied receptors and the endocytosis of prebound EGF followed similar kinetics (t1/2 approximately 5 min), suggesting that unoccupied receptors are internalized at a rate comparable to that of occupied receptors. The results suggest that there is a rapid turnover of the surface pool of EGF receptors with constitutive internalization of unoccupied surface receptors and externalization of internal receptors. This is consistent with, but does not prove, a true recycling of the EGF receptors in the hepatocytes. The monensin-sensitive externalization pathway determines the capacity for continued endocytosis of EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1544678046,"Insulin, pancreatic polypeptide, glucagon, oxyntomodulin, and two distinct glucagon-like peptides were isolated from acidic ethanol extracts of bullfrog pancreas by gel filtration followed by high pressure liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequences of pancreatic polypeptide, oxyntomodulin, and both glucagon-like peptides were determined. Frog pancreatic polypeptide contains 36 amino acid residues and has a COOH-terminal phenylalaninamide. It is more homologous with human pancreatic polypeptide (61%) than other characterized members of this family of peptides. Frog glucagon has an amino acid composition identical to the NH2-terminal 29 residues of the larger, more abundant oxyntomodulin and was not sequenced. The finding of a single form of glucagon and oxyntomodulin, but two glucagon-like peptides in frog pancreas extract is similar to that found or deduced for mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1501653583,"The functional and conformational activation of cell surface glycoproteins IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa) was probed in platelets stimulated to secrete by complement proteins C5b-9. Gel-filtered human platelets exposed to the purified human C5b-9 proteins exhibited non-lytic secretory release of both alpha- and dense granule storage pools with only a small increase in total binding of 125I-fibrinogen (less than 3000 molecules/cell) to the cell surface. By contrast to ADP- or thrombin-activated platelets, increased 125I-fibrinogen bound to C5b-9 platelets was not inhibited by Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides, suggesting that the high affinity membrane receptor for fibrinogen is not expressed under these conditions. C5b-9-stimulated platelets also failed to bind 125I-von Willebrand factor (less than 1 ng/10(8) platelets), confirming that the adhesive protein receptor function of cell surface GPIIb-IIIa is not expressed in these cells. Although specific binding of 125I-fibrinogen or 125I-von Willebrand factor did not significantly increase after C5b-9 assembly, these proteins elicited de novo expression of the GPIIb-IIIa activation-associated epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody PAC-1, and binding of this antibody to C5b-9 platelets was fully competed by Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides. These data suggest that the metabolic events which trigger granule secretion after C5b-9 insertion into the plasma membrane cause cell surface GPIIb-IIIa to be expressed in an activation-associated but functionally incompetent conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1554659897,"The deficiency group of alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) alleles is characterized by alpha 1AT genes that code for alpha 1AT present in serum but in amounts insufficient to protect the lower respiratory tract from progressive destruction by its burden of neutrophil elastase. Mprocida, a rare alpha 1AT allele associated with alpha 1AT serum levels less than 10 mg/dl (normal 150-350 mg/dl), codes for an alpha 1AT molecule that focuses on immobilized pH gradient isoelectric gels slightly cathodal to the common normal M1 (Val213) protein. On a per molecule basis, Mprocida has a mildly reduced function as an inhibitor, with an association rate constant for human neutrophil elastase of 7.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 (normal M1 (Val213) 9.3 +/- 0.8 x 10(6), p less than 0.01). The Mprocida molecule behaves normally in vivo with a half-life similar to normal M1 alpha 1AT molecules. Restriction endonuclease mapping demonstrates that the cloned Mprocida gene was grossly intact. Sequencing of all the exons, exon-intron junctions, and the major promoter region demonstrated Mprocida to be identical to the M1 (Val213) gene except for a single base substitution in exon II coding for amino acid 41 of the mature protein (M1 (Val213) Leu41 CTG----Mprocida Pro41 CCG). Usefully, the coding sequence of the alpha 1AT residues 40-41 is recognized by the restriction endonuclease PvuII so that using a probe corresponding to this region of exon II, the Mprocida mutation can be rapidly identified by Southern analysis. Evaluation of the crystallographic structure of alpha 1AT suggests the Leu41 to Pro41 mutation may disrupt alpha-helix A in the region of Pro21-Ser45, suggesting the possibility that the alpha 1AT Mprocida molecule is unstable and degraded intracellularly prior to secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1556162974,"Abstract The efficiency of translation of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) RNA 4, barley alpha-amylase (B alpha A) mRNA, and two chimeric mRNAs, AMV 4-B alpha A and B alpha A-AMV 4 (in which the 5' leader sequences of the two mRNAs were interchanged), was measured in an S30 extract from wheat germ and a fractionated system from wheat germ in which translation could be made dependent upon initiation factor (eIF) 3, 4A, 4F, or 4G. In the S30 system, AMV RNA 4 and the chimeric mRNA AMV 4-B alpha A are translated much more efficiently than B alpha A mRNA and the chimeric mRNA B alpha A-AMV 4. When the S30 system was supplemented with high amounts of purified eIF-3, eIF-4A, eIF-4F, and eIF-4G, B alpha A and B alpha A-AMV 4 mRNAs were translated as efficiently as AMV RNA 4 and AMV 4-B alpha A mRNA. These findings indicated that the mRNAs containing the B alpha A leader sequence required higher amounts of one or more of the initiation factors (eIF-3, eIF-4A, eIF-4F, and eIF-4G) for efficient translation. Determination of the amounts of the initiation factors required for translation in the fractionated system showed that AMV RNA 4 required 2-4-fold lower amounts of eIF-3, eIF-4A, eIF-4F, and eIF-4G than did B alpha A mRNA. Replacement of the B alpha A leader sequence with that of AMV RNA 4 decreased the amounts of eIF-4A, eIF-4G, and eIF-3 required, but did not affect the amount of eIF-4F required. Replacement of the AMV RNA 4 leader sequence with that of B alpha A mRNA increased the amounts of eIF-4F, eIF-4G, and eIF-3 required, but did not affect the amount of eIF-4A required. These data strongly suggest that the amounts of the factors required are affected not only by the 5' leader itself but also by interactions between the 5' leader and a region(s) of the mRNA 3' to the initiation codon."

All forms of huIL-4 eluted on gel filtration chromatography with an apparent Mr of 22,000. Gas-phase microsequencing identified 26 and 8 amino acid residues at the N and C termini, respectively, all of which were consistent with the cDNA sequence. The site of processing of the signal sequence was found to occur between Gly-24 and His-25. Incubation with N-glycanase converted the 18- and 19-kDa variants to a 15-kDa form. Treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H reduced the molecular mass of the 18-kDa variant to 15 kDa, but did not have any apparent effects on the mass of the 19-kDa species. The removal of oligosaccharide by any of these treatments did not affect bioactivity in the T-cell proliferation assay. Neither O-glycanase nor endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase D affected the molecular weight of any of these species. These data suggest that differences in carbohydrate structure account, at least in part, for the observed microheterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W1489486554,"The T cell antigen receptor on most mature T cells consists of at least seven chains (the variable, clone-specific alpha and beta chains, and five constant chains, CD3-gamma, -delta, -epsilon, and -zeta 2). These chains assemble rapidly after synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this paper we describe an additional protein termed TRAP (T cell receptor associated protein) that is transiently associated with at least some of the newly synthesized murine receptor chains. TRAP remains bound to receptor subunits as they assemble for about 10-20 min after synthesis. Rapid dissociation of TRAP ensues. This can be blocked by manipulations that inhibit endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport or with agents that inhibit organelle acidification. In mutant T cells that fail to synthesize the beta chains, the partial complex fails to reach the Golgi system. Despite this, TRAP dissociates with kinetics similar to those observed in the parental T cells. Thus, our studies indicate that the dissociation of TRAP occurs in a pre-Golgi compartment by a process that requires an acidic intraorganellar pH."
https://openalex.org/W1549085313,"By use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we have found that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) causes an approximately 10-fold increase in the level of type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) accumulated in conditioned medium of the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. Half-maximal stimulation occurred at approximately equal to 15 nM PMA. The effect was only observed with phorbol esters that are tumor promoting. Maximal levels of secreted PAI-1 were observed 24 h after PMA addition. The increase in secreted PAI-1 was preceded by a transient approximately 10-fold increase in intracellular PAI-1 content, maximal at 8 h after PMA addition. There was a 20-fold increase in the cellular level of two 2.3- and 3.4-kilobase PAI-1 mRNAs and a more than 5-fold increase in the PAI-1 gene transcription rate. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) also increased the level of PAI-1 mRNA, and when both cycloheximide and PMA were used, an additive effect was observed. Cycloheximide changed the ratio between the two PAI-1 mRNAs in favor of the 3.4-kilobase species. Overall, the data show that transcriptional activation of the PAI-1 gene forms part of the pleiotropic responses to tumor-promoting phorbol esters."
https://openalex.org/W1546046077,"Abstract Previous studies with antigen-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells indicated the formation of multiple isomers of each of the various categories of inositol phosphates. The identities of the different isomers have been elucidated by selective labeling of [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with [32P]phosphate in the 3'-or 4',5'-positions and by following the metabolism of different radiolabeled inositol phosphates in extracts of RBL-2H3 cells. We report here that inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, when incubated with the membrane fraction of extracts of RBL-2H3 cells, was converted to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. Further dephosphorylation of the inositol polyphosphates proceeded rapidly in whole extracts of cells, although the process was significantly retarded when ATP (2 mM) levels were maintained by an ATP-regenerating system. The degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate proceeded with the sequential formation of inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, the inositol 4-monophosphate (with smaller amounts of the 1-monophosphate), and finally inositol. Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, on the other hand, was converted to inositol 1,3-bisphosphate and inositol 3,4-bisphosphate and subsequently to inositol 4-monophosphate and inositol 1-monophosphate (stereoisomeric forms were undetermined). The possible implications of the apparent interconversion between inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate in regulating histamine secretion in the RBL-2H3 cells are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1521664084,"The T-cell surface glycoprotein CD4 plays an important role in mediating cellular immunity and serves as the receptor for human immunodeficiency virus. We have examined the glycosylation of CD4 and asked whether carbohydrate addition is essential for proper expression of the glycoprotein on the cell membrane. Under conditions where treatment of CD4+ human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (CEM-CM3 cells) with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin decreased surface expression of CD4 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, the surface expression of several other glycoproteins was unaffected. Incubation with tunicamycin for 48 h inhibited mannose incorporation by 98%, caused a 76% decrease in CD4 surface expression as judged by flow cytometry, and had little effect on methionine incorporation. Scatchard analysis showed a decrease in the total number of CD4 molecules on the cell surface from 17,000 to 8,900 after 24 h of tunicamycin treatment. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled CD4 revealed the presence of an unglycosylated precursor in tunicamycin-treated cells. The observed difference between the Mr of the glycoprotein and its precursor is consistent with glycosylation at two potential N-linked sites. However, this precursor could not be detected by measuring steady state levels by immunoblotting. Also, no intracellular accumulation of CD4 in tunicamycin-treated cells was detectable using immunofluorescence microscopy. We conclude that surface expression of CD4 depends on glycosylation of the protein and that the unglycosylated precursor is preferentially degraded."
https://openalex.org/W2092054998,"The study of resistance marker rearrangement in Spiroplasma citri mutants provides evidence of transfer of chromosomal information followed by recombination. This is the first report of such a transfer in vivo in the mollicutes--that is, in the smallest self-replicating organisms. The double-resistant phenotypes obtained are stable even without selection pressure. The mechanism of gene transfer is insensitive to deoxyribonuclease, requires contact, and possibly, areas of fusion of the cell membranes; it shares properties with the transfer by protoplast fusion in Gram-positive bacteria. The extensive degenerative evolution of mollicutes has retained, in S. citri, bacterial functions of chromosomal transfer and recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1489515092,"Intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations were monitored in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) using the Ca2+-sensitive dye fura II. Superfusion of VSMC with platelet-activating factor (S-PAF; 1-100 nM) increased cytosolic Ca2+ in a dose-dependent manner. The response was transient and returned to base line even though the agonist was still present. A second, higher dose of PAF did not elicit a response. The inactive optical isomer, R-PAF, was ineffective suggesting that the S-PAF response is specific and receptor-mediated. Pretreatment of VSMC with PAF attenuated angiotensin II-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization but not vasopressin-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization. Treatment of VSMC with PAF (10 nM) stimulated inositol trisphosphate and inositol tetrakisphosphate formation above control by 260 +/- 15% and 195 +/- 11%, respectively. Diacylglycerol levels also rose during PAF stimulation and remained increased over 15 min. Pretreatment of VSMCs with phorbol-12,13-myristate acetate (10 nM) for 30 min abolished both the PAF- and angiotensin II-induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+, but not the vasopressin-induced increase. Pretreatment of VSMC with dioctanoylglycerol (10 microM) abolished the S-PAF-, angiotensin II-, and vasopressin-induced elevation in cytosolic Ca2+. We propose that this desensitization is possibly mediated by diacylglycerol formed in response to PAF."
https://openalex.org/W1653001760,"We investigated the kinetics of the inhibitory action of antithrombin III and antithrombin III plus heparin during the activation of factor X by factor IXa. Generation and inactivation curves were fitted to a three-parameter two-exponentional model to determine the pseudo first-order rate constants of inhibition of factor IXa and factor Xa by antithrombin III/heparin. In the absence of heparin, the second-order rate constant of inhibition of factor Xa generated by factor IXa was 2.5-fold lower than the rate constant of inhibition of exogenous factor Xa. It appeared that phospholipid-bound factor X protected factor Xa from inactivation by antithrombin III. It is, as yet, unclear whether an active site or a nonactive site interaction between factor Xa and factor X at the phospholipid surface is involved. The inactivation of factor IXa by antithrombin III was found to be very slow and was not affected by phospholipid, calcium, and/or factor X. With unfractionated heparin above 40 ng/ml and antithrombin III at 200 nM, the apparent second-order rate constant of inhibition of exogenous and generated factor Xa were the same. Thus, in this case phospholipid-bound factor X did not protect factor Xa from inhibition. In the presence of synthetic pentasaccharide heparin, however, phospholipid-bound factor X reduced the rate constant about 5-fold. Pentasaccharide had no effect on the factor IXa/antithrombin III reaction. Unfractionated heparin (1 micrograms/ml) stimulated the antithrombin III-dependent inhibition of factor IXa during factor X activation 400-fold. In the absence of reaction components this stimulated was 65-fold. We established that calcium stimulated the heparin-dependent inhibition of factor IXa."
https://openalex.org/W1579733453,"The membrane glycoproteins CD4 (L3T4) and CD8 (Lyt2) are expressed on distinct populations of mature murine T lymphocytes, and are thought to be receptors for monomorphic determinants expressed on MHC class II and class I molecules, respectively. Although they differ in their ligand specificity, it has been presumed that CD4 and CD8 perform equivalent functions in the T cells that bear them. Since activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is known to cause rapid down-regulation of various receptors, including the T cell receptor complex (TcR complex), we treated cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, to determine whether cell-surface expression of CD4 and CD8 would be similarly affected by this intracellular mediator. Brief or relatively prolonged treatment with PMA induced mature murine T cells to reduce their surface expression of the TcR complex and of CD4, but not of CD8. Similarly, PMA rapidly induced transfected L cells to down-regulate surface CD4 expression, but had no effect on surface CD8 expression. Most significantly, PMA treatment induced CD4+CD8+ immature thymocytes to rapidly reduce their surface CD4 expression, but, again, it had no immediate effect on the surface expression of CD8. These results indicate that CD4 and TcR complex cell-surface expression are both sensitive to PKC activation by brief treatment with PMA, whereas CD8 expression is not, and suggest that CD4 and CD8 surface expression levels are regulated by distinct intracellular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1507503536,"Interleukin 3 (IL-3) derived from mouse T cells was biosynthetically labeled with either [35S]methionine or [3H]mannose, affinity-purified using various anti-IL-3 antibodies, and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Autoradiography revealed the same three major bands with Mr values of 21,500-22,500, 27,000-31,000, and 32,000-36,000, irrespective of whether the anti-IL-3 antibody had been directed to the N or C termini of the IL-3 polypeptide. Bioassay of eluates from the gels confirmed that all three bands exhibited IL-3 bioactivity. IL-3 produced from two nonphysiological sources, the myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3B or Cos 7 cells that had been transfected with an IL-3 cDNA clone, had in each case a different pattern of microheterogeneity. Treatment with either tunicamycin or N-glycanase resulted in IL-3 running as one band with Mr 16,000, corresponding to its 140-amino acid polypeptide chain. No evidence for proteolytic processing was detected. These results show that the Mr heterogeneity of IL-3 was highly dependent on the cellular source and is due to N-linked glycosylation."
