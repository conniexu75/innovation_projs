https://openalex.org/W1570939625,"Membranes from bovine brain bind relatively large quantities of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) with high affinity. The two proteins responsible for most of this activity were purified; they account for 1.5% of the membrane protein. The two proteins contain alpha subunits of either 39,000 or 41,000 Da, beta subunits of 36,000 or 35,000 Da, and a potential gamma subunit (11,000 Da). These structures are the same as a family of proteins that includes transducin and the regulatory proteins, GS and GI, of adenylate cyclase. The 41,000- and 39,000-Da polypeptides can be ADP-ribosylated with islet-activating protein from Bordetella pertussis, bind guanine nucleotides specifically, and migrate through polyacrylamide gels with rates similar to the alpha subunits of GI and transducin, respectively. The 36,000- and 35,000-Da polypeptides are similar to the beta subunits of GI and GS. The gamma subunit is found whenever beta subunits are present. The 41,000- and 39,000-Da polypeptides (with beta and gamma) are designated, respectively, GI and GO from brain. The alpha subunit of GO was isolated without the use of ligands known to dissociate other G proteins. GO alpha binds GTP gamma S reversibly in the absence of Mg2+ and is relatively stable in cholate. This isolated alpha subunit should be of great utility in elucidating the mechanism of action of this family of GTP-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2077102469,The guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins (G proteins) found in a variety of tissues transduce signals generated by ligand binding to cell surface receptors into changes in intracellular metabolism. Amino acid sequences of peptides prepared by partial proteolysis of the alpha subunit of a bovine brain G protein and the alpha subunit of rod outer-segment transducin were determined. The two proteins show regions of sequence identity as well as regions of diversity. A portion of the amino-terminal peptide sequence of each protein is highly homologous with the corresponding region in the ras protein (a protooncogene product). These similarities suggest that G proteins and ras proteins may have analogous functions.
https://openalex.org/W1992138479,"We have isolated and analyzed DNA sequences encompassing the period (per) locus of Drosophila melanogaster. The location of this clock gene was delimited by the molecular mapping of chromosome aberrations at or very near the per locus. At least five RNAs are transcribed from this region. One of these transcripts, a 0.9 kb species, is strongly implicated in per's control of biological rhythms. Two independently isolated arrhythmic mutations at the per locus dramatically reduce the level of this transcript. Furthermore, the level of the 0.9 kb transcript is strongly modulated during a light/dark cycle. We discuss evidence, from previously reported genetic and phenotypic analysis of per's function, suggesting that this region may be complex and that several gene products from the per region, including this 0.9 kb transcript, may be involved in the different aspects of normal rhythmicity influenced by this clock gene."
https://openalex.org/W2003928141,"Chondroitin-sulfate containing proteoglycan (CSPG) of the extracellular matrix (ECM) was visualized in chick tissues and cell cultures with a monoclonal antibody, CS-56. Cultured cells of various origins contained dense punctate layers of CSPG on both the substrate and the cell surface, as determined by immunofluorescent and immunogold staining. Under culture conditions the CSPG-containing matrix was usually excluded from stable cell-to-substrate focal contacts. The substrate-attached CSPG exhibited remarkable chemical stability but could be successfully removed by pronase or chondroitinases ABC and AC. Incubation of living cells with CS-56 antibodies resulted in the clustering of surface CSPG into patches, indicating that the surface-bound CSPG is free to move laterally along the plasma membrane. The unique properties of the CSPG-containing ECM revealed by CS-56 antibodies and their relationships to specific types of cell contacts are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1501888177,"We report here the discovery of a new class of phospholipases A2 in which Asp-49, a residue considered to be an obligate component of the catalytic apparatus, is replaced by a lysine. Asp-49 is invariant among the more than 30 venom and pancreatic phospholipases A2 sequenced to date, and its beta-carboxylate group has been shown to be a ligand for calcium in a binding site which also involves contributions from the peptide carbonyl oxygens of Tyr-28, Gly-30, and Gly-32, the so-called calcium-binding loop. The change of Asp-49 to a lysine, and other substitutions in regions heretofore thought to be invariant, including the calcium-binding loop, suggested that the new phospholipases might differ functionally with respect to calcium and/or substrate binding. Indeed, although the Lys-49 phospholipases A2 show a dependence on calcium similar to that of the Asp-49 enzymes, they may be distinguished by the fact that, in the absence of phospholipid, they do not bind calcium to any measurable extent under conditions where Asp-49 enzymes bind a stoichiometric amount of calcium. Furthermore, in the absence of calcium, they show binding to single bilayer phospholipid vesicles under conditions where Asp-49 phospholipases do not bind at all. These results suggest a reversed order of addition of calcium and substrate in the formation of the ternary catalytic complex in the Lys-49 phospholipases A2. Although the mechanistic implications of these structural and functional alterations are not defined at present, it is clear that Asp-49 is not essential for phospholipase A2 catalysis and that it does not participate in the enzyme-calcium-phospholipid catalytic complex."
https://openalex.org/W1591397942,"Biosynthesis and secretion of proteodermatan sulfate produced by cultured human skin fibroblasts were investigated employing immunological procedures. During an incubation period of 10 min in the presence of [3H]leucine, two core protein forms of Mr = 46,000 and 44,000, respectively, were synthesized. They were converted to mature proteodermatan sulfate with a half-time of approximately 12 min. Fifty per cent of total mature proteodermatan sulfate were found in the culture medium after a 35-min chase. Six to eight per cent remained associated with the cell layer after a chase of 6 h. In the presence of tunicamycin, fibroblasts synthesized a single core protein of Mr = 38,000 that was converted to mature proteodermatan sulfate and secreted with similar kinetics as the N-glycosylated species. Subtle differences in the molecular size of core proteins were noted when cell-associated and secreted proteodermatan sulfate were degraded with chondroitin ABC lyase, but core proteins free of N-linked oligosaccharides were identical. Labeling with [3H]mannose revealed that secreted proteodermatan sulfate contains two or three complex-type or two complex-type and one high-mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharide chains. The N-glycans are bound to a 21-kDa fragment of the core protein. After incubation in the presence of [3H]glucosamine, the [3H]galactosamine/[3H]glucosamine ratio was 3.76 and 3.30 for secreted and cell-associated proteodermatan sulfate, respectively. Evidence for the presence of O-linked oligosaccharides could not be obtained. Small amounts of core protein free of dermatan sulfate chains were secreted when the cultures were treated with p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside."
https://openalex.org/W1565561451,"Covalent modification of sulfhydryl groups which become sensitive toward sulfhydryl agents during germination of Bacillus cereus spores exerts a profound bacteriostatic effect, resulting in outgrowth inhibition. The modified spore components are membrane species of 13,000, 28,000, and 29,000 daltons. Detergent disruption of the membrane inactivated the sulfhydryl groups. A highly sigmoid inhibition curve (n = 11.8) with diamide suggested the participation of closely neighboring sulfhydryl groups. Substate and substrate analogs of the lactose and dicarboxylic acid permeases protected the sulfhydryl groups against modification. Nisin, a 34-residue peptide antibiotic, inhibited spore outgrowth and sulfhydryl modification at a concentration of about 0.1 microM. Since these sulfhydryl groups have been implicated as involved with the bacteriostatic action of nitrite, substances directed toward them may be a useful new class of bacteriostatic agents and antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W1539732094,"The NH2-terminal blocking group of the membrane-binding domain of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase has been deduced as myristic (n-tetradecanoyl) acid. This fatty acid was identified by gas chromatography of the digest of the NH2-terminal tetrapeptide of cytochrome b5 reductase. Fast atom bombardment and direct chemical ionization mass spectroscopy of the underivatized NH2-terminal tetrapeptide confirmed the presence of myristic acid, identified its linkage to the NH2 terminus and established CH3(CH2)12-CO-Gly-Ala-Gln-Leu as the NH2-terminal sequence. In addition, the complete amino acid sequence of the membrane-binding domain of cytochrome b5 reductase is also reported. The finding of a myristic acyl chain on the NH2-terminal segment, comprised of hydrophobic amino acid residues, implies that the function of the myristate group may be other than simply to anchor the reductase to the microsomal membrane. This post-translational modification, presumably in the endoplasmic reticulum, may selectively stabilize a particular membrane structure and orientation that optimally facilitates electron transport on the cytosolic surface of this membrane organelle."
https://openalex.org/W1591379573,"The present study demonstrates that inactivation of exogenous 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkylacetyl-GPC; platelet-activating factor) by human platelets is mediated by the sequential action of two enzymes, 1) a Ca2+-independent acetylhydrolase recovered in the cytosolic fraction of platelets that deacylates alkylacetyl-GPC forming alkyllyso-GPC and 2) a CoA-independent, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive transacylase associated with platelet membranes that incorporates a long-chain fatty acid into alkyllyso-GPC to produce alkylacyl-GPC. Separation of platelet phospholipids and subsequent resolution into individual molecular species by high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that the newly formed alkylacyl-GPC was exclusively alkylarachidonoyl-GPC and that the arachidonoyl group for acylation of alkyllyso-GPC was provided by phosphatidylcholine. We conclude that the previously described platelet arachidonoyl transacylase (Kramer, R.M., and Deykin, D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13806-13811) may play an important role in the metabolism of platelet-activating factor."
https://openalex.org/W1603783662,"Activated factor V (factor Va) is composed of two nonidentical subunits which can be dissociated on chelation of the bound Ca2+ with EDTA. The isolated subunits can be recombined in the presence of Ca2+ to form factor Va. The factor Va heavy chain (Mr = 94,000) binds to prothrombin in a specific and Ca2+-independent fashion. Following inactivation of either factor Va or the factor Va heavy chain by limited proteolysis with activated protein C, factor Va no longer binds to the immobilized prothrombin. Factor Va also binds specifically to (p-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl-factor Xa-Affi-Gel 15. However, neither isolated subunit binds to this column. Factor Va inactivated by activated protein C is no longer retained by the factor Xa column. This data suggests that both subunits are required for optimal factor Va-factor Xa interaction and that inactivation of factor Va with activated protein C reduces the affinity of factor Va for both prothrombin and factor Xa."
https://openalex.org/W1487727195,"Human plasma high-density lipoprotein-3 (HDL3) has been shown to bind to a variety of cells and tissues. In order to investigate the nature of HDL3-cell association, we studied the interaction of 125I-HDL3 with porcine aortic endothelial cells, rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells, and normal human skin fibroblasts. At 37 degrees C, 125I-HDL3 association with endothelial cells was nonsaturable. Furthermore, 60% protein digestion of HDL3 by trypsin (T-HDL3) actually increased its ability, on a protein weight basis, to associate with endothelial cells and to displace 125I-HDL3 from all three cell types. Synthetic phospholipid-cholesterol discs containing either apo-A-I or apo-A-II were equally effective in displacing 125I-HDL3 from endothelial cells, and phospholipid-cholesterol vesicles containing no protein also displaced 125I-HDL3 from endothelial cells. Neither lipid-free apo-HDL3 nor apo-T-HDL3 was able to competitively displace 125I-HDL3. The above competitive displacement data, when expressed on a protein weight basis, showed differences in the ability of the competitors to displace 125I-HDL3 from cells in the following order of effectiveness: discs greater than T-HDL3 greater than native HDL3. When these data were expressed on a surface lipid weight basis, all three competitors, as well as the lipid vesicles, were approximately normalized to a single competitive displacement curve. Studies on the nature of the cellular mediators of HDL3-cell association revealed that the cell surface sites were resistant to proteolytic treatment. Furthermore, both 125I-HDL3 and 125I-T-HDL3 association with fibroblasts preincubated with varying concentrations of cholesterol increased in parallel with the free cholesterol content of the cells; although cycloheximide blocked this increase in HDL3-cell association, cycloheximide also prevented the increase in cholesterol content of cholesterol-treated cells. We conclude that the association of HDL3 with the cell types studied is not mediated by specific ligand and receptor proteins but rather involves the interaction of cellular surface lipids, possibly cholesterol, with the surface lipids of HDL3."
https://openalex.org/W1627085285,"Incubation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells with [1-14C]arachidonic acid, followed by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis, results in the appearance of two principal radioactive products besides 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. The first peak is 12-L-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid, a hydrolysis product of the prostaglandin endoperoxide. The second peak was esterified, converted to the trimethylsilyl ether derivative, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and shown to be the lipoxygenase product 15(S)-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). Incubation of the 15-HETE precursor 15(S)-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE) with endothelial cells results in the formation of four distinct UV absorbing peaks. UV and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed these peaks to be 8,15(S)-dihydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acids (8,15-diHETE) differing only in their hydroxyl configuration and cis trans double-bond geometry. Formation of 8,15-diHETE molecules suggests the prior formation of the unstable epoxide molecule 14(S),15(S)-trans-oxido-5,8-Z-14,15-leukotriene A4 or an attack at C-10 of 15-HPETE by an enzyme with mechanistic features in common with a 12-lipoxygenase. The observation that endothelial cells can synthesize both 15-HETE and 8,15-diHETE molecules suggests that this cell type contains both a 15-lipoxygenase and a system that can synthesize 14,15-leukotriene A4."
https://openalex.org/W1509847058,"The purpose of this study was to characterize the physical, kinetic, and immunological properties of carnitine acyltransferases purified from mouse liver peroxisomes. Peroxisomal carnitine octanoyltransferase and carnitine acetyltransferase were purified to apparent homogeneity from livers of mice fed a diet containing the hypolipidemic drug Wy-14,643 [( 4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio]-acetic acid). Both enzymes have a molecular weight of 60,000 and a similar pH optimum. Carnitine octanoyltransferase had a maximum activity for C6 moieties while the maximum for carnitine acetyltransferase was with C3 and C4 moieties. The apparent Km values were between 2 and 20 microM for the preferred acyl-CoA substrates, and the Km values for L-carnitine varied depending on the acyl-CoA cosubstrates used. The Hill coefficient, n, was approximately 1 for all acyl-CoAs tested, indicating Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Carnitine octanoyltransferase retained its maximum activity when preincubated with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) at pH 7.0 or 8.5. Neither carnitine octanoyltransferase nor carnitine acetyltransferase were inhibited by malonyl-CoA. The immunology of carnitine octanoyltransferase is discussed. These data indicate that peroxisomal carnitine octanoyltransferase and carnitine acetyltransferase function in vivo in the direction of acylcarnitine formation, and suggest that the concentration of L-carnitine could influence the specificity for different acyl-CoA substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1585526284,"Using brush-border membranes prepared from rabbit small intestine by Ca2+ precipitation and KSCN treatment, we have studied the kinetics and conformational changes of the glucose carrier. Na+ behaves as a competitive activator of glucose transport under zero-trans conditions. Phenyl isothiocyanate and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) inhibit Na+-dependent transport in an irreversible but substrate-protectable manner. Vesicles pretreated with phenyl isothiocyanate in the presence of substrates were then selectively labeled at the glucose carrier with FITC. Competition experiments with Na+ and phlorizin or glucose indicated that FITC binds to the glucose site on the carrier. Carrier-bound FITC displays a saturable quenching of fluorescence in the presence of Na+. The K0.5 of the Na+-specific quench is 25 mM, which is similar to the apparent Km for Na+ activation of glucose transport. Two tyrosine group-specific reagents, N-acetylimidazole and tetranitromethane, inhibit glucose uptake and fluorescent quenching in a Na+-protectable fashion. FITC labeled a 75-kilodalton peptide on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a substrate-sensitive manner. We conclude that Na+ binds to the glucose symporter of intestinal brush borders, a 75-kilodalton peptide, and this induces a rapid conformation change in the transporter which increases its affinity for D-glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1967173645,"The tumor promoters 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate and teleocidin markedly enhanced the transformation of C3H 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts when these cells were transfected with the cloned human bladder cancer c-rasH oncogene. Transfection studies with the drug resistance marker gpt and time course studies indicate that this enhancement is not simply an effect on the process of DNA transfection. These findings, together with parallel studies with NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, also indicate that the competence of animal cells for DNA transfection is a function of the recipient cell line, the transfected marker, and the growth conditions. Our findings suggest that during multistage carcinogenesis tumor promoters may complement the function of activated cellular oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1518716981,"When mouse pancreatic minilobules prelabeled with either [14C]arachidonic acid (AA), [14C]stearic acid (SA), or [3H]glycerol were stimulated with the secretogogue, caerulein, there was a 60-70% loss in radioactivity in phosphatidylinositol (PI) at 30 min. This loss was accompanied by the formation of [14C] phosphatidic acid (PA), [14C]diacylglycerol (DG), [14C] triacylglycerol (TG), and free [14C]AA, [14C]SA, and [3H]glycerol. The loss in radioactive PI was the same as the loss in chemically measured PI-phosphorus. Thirty to fifty per cent of the caerulein-induced loss of prelabeled PI could be accounted for as free [14C]AA, [14C]SA, or [3H]glycerol. Increased incorporation of fatty acid or glycerol residues into DG, PA, and TG accounted for the balance of the loss in PI. The specific DG-lipase inhibitor, RHC 80267, markedly inhibited the caerulein-stimulated release of [14C]AA, [14C]SA, and [3H]glycerol and roughly doubled the caerulein-induced increment in [14C]AA-, [14C]SA-, or [3H]glycerol-labeled DG, showing that the source of the caerulein-induced increment in fatty acids and glycerol was DG. When the PI was prelabeled with either [32P] orthophosphate, [3H]myoinositol, or [3H]glycerol, only 1% or less of the radioactivity in PI was in lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), and there was no increase in radioactivity in LPI on stimulation with caerulein. These observations, taken together, argue strongly for a phospholipase C-catalyzed breakdown of PI followed by DG-lipase and argue against any significant involvement of phospholipase A2 in PI degradation in mouse pancreas. The formation of substantial amounts of free [14C]AA on stimulation supports the view that, among other things, the phosphoinositide effect in the exocrine pancreas serves to generate arachidonate (and its metabolites). The release of appreciable amounts of free fatty acids and glycerol shows that a significant portion of the DG formed as a result of caerulein-stimulated PI breakdown is not conserved in the phosphoinositide cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1572445209,"The biochemical events that lead to thrombin-stimulated release of von Willebrand factor and prostacyclin synthesis in cultured endothelial cells are examined. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with thrombin results in an instantaneous increase in phospholipid methylation which can be blocked by 3-deazaadenosine, a methyltransferase inhibitor. 3-Deazaadenosine also blocks the thrombin-induced Ca2+ influx into endothelial cells and the release of von Willebrand factor, indicating that these processes are coupled. The phorbol ester 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 both bypass the phospholipid methylation and directly stimulate Ca2+ influx and von Willebrand factor release. In contrast to the stimulus-induced von Willebrand factor release, the thrombin-induced prostacyclin synthesis cannot be blocked by 3-deazaadenosine. Similarly, incubation of endothelial cells with EDTA has no influence on the thrombin-induced prostacyclin synthesis, and PMA has no stimulatory effect on prostacyclin synthesis. These observations indicate that thrombin induces different metabolic responses in endothelial cells: phospholipid methylation followed by a Ca2+ influx, which subsequently leads to release of von Willebrand factor, and liberation of arachidonic acid from phospholipids for prostacyclin formation, which is independent of phospholipid methylation and Ca2+ influx."
https://openalex.org/W2095453241,"The Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone cPD1, which induces a mating response in cells harboring the conjugative plasmid pPD1, has been isolated and its structure determined. It was found to have a molecular weight of 912, and its amino acid sequence was H-Phe-Leu-Val-Met-Phe-Leu-Ser-Gly-OH. A synthetic octapeptide showed the same biological activity and chromatographic behavior as the isolated cPD1. Pheromone activity was detectable at a concentration of approximately 4 X 10(-11)M."
https://openalex.org/W1575711102,"Rat liver mitoplasts containing less than 1% microsomal contamination contain cytochrome P-450 at 25% of the microsomal level and retain the capacity for monooxygenase activation of structurally different carcinogens such as aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), and dimethylnitrosamine. Both phenobarbital (PB) and 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) induce the level of mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 by 2.0- to 2.5-fold above the level of control mitoplasts. The enzyme activities for AFB1 (3-fold) and BaP (16-fold) metabolism were selectively induced by PB and 3-MC, respectively. Furthermore, the metabolism of AFB1 and BaP by intact mitochondria was supported by Krebs cycle substrates but not by NADPH. Both PB and 3-MC administration cause a shift in the CO difference spectrum of mitoplasts (control, 448 nm; PB, 451 nm; and 3-MC, 446 nm) suggesting that they induce two different forms of mitochondrial cytochromes P-450. Mitoplasts solubilized with cholate and fractionated with polyethylene glycol exhibit only marginal monooxygenase activities. The activity, however, was restored to preparations from both PB-induced and 3-MC-induced mitochondrial enzymes (AFB1 activation, ethylmorphine, and benzphetamine deamination and BaP metabolism) by addition of purified rat liver cytochrome P-450 reductase, and beef adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase. The latter proteins failed to reconstitute activity to purified microsomal cytochromes P-450b and P-450c that were fully active with P-450 reductase. Monospecific rabbit antibodies against cytochrome P-450b and P-450c inhibited both P-450 reductase and adrenodoxin-supported activities to similar extents. Anti-P-450b and anti-P-450c provided Ouchterlony precipitin bands against PB- and 3-MC induced mitoplasts, respectively. We conclude that liver mitoplasts contain cytochrome P-450 that is closely similar to the corresponding microsomal cytochrome P-450 but can be distinguished by a capacity to interact with adrenodoxin. These inducible cytochromes P-450 are of mitochondrial origin since their levels in purified mitoplasts are over 10 times greater than can arise from the highest possible microsomal contamination."
https://openalex.org/W1514295482,"cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been purified to homogeneity from adult bodies of Drosophila melanogaster. It is tetrameric in structure with two regulatory and two catalytic subunits that dissociate when activated by cAMP. The regulatory subunit exists in phospho and dephospho forms, which have electrophoretic mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels corresponding to Mr = 58,000 and 52,000, respectively. The catalytic subunit has a molecular weight of 40,000. The holoenzyme has a Stokes radius of 4.7 nm. The Km for activation by cAMP is substrate-dependent with Km values of 20 nM with histone H2B and 100 nM with the peptide, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly. These physical and kinetic properties are very similar to those of the bovine heart Type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase. A Drosophila Type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase was also found in larval stages and during the first half of pupation but was absent in embryos and adults. The fly Type II enzyme was present in all developmental stages. Three regions of the Drosophila genome were found which, when present in three copies, significantly alter the specific activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These are located at 29F-33F (30% increase), 46A-50C (17% increase), and 66B-67D (16% decrease)."
https://openalex.org/W1507789199,"Cultured skin fibroblasts from a proband with an autosomal dominant variant of osteogenesis inperfecta were found to synthesize approximately equal amounts of normal pro-alpha 2(I) chains of type I procollagen and pro-alpha 2(I) chains which migrated more rapidly when examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The structural alteration was present in alpha 2(I)-CB4, a cyanogen bromide fragment containing amino acid residues 7-327 of the alpha 2 chain, and it appeared to be a deletion of about 30 amino acids. The pro-alpha 2(I) chains with the apparent deletion associated with normal pro-alpha 1(I) chains synthesized by the same fibroblasts and formed triple-helical type I procollagen. The presence of the altered pro-alpha 2 chains in trimers of procollagen had two consequences in terms of the physical properties of the molecule. One was to decrease the thermal stability of the protein as judged by resistance to proteolysis at 37 degrees C and by the helix to coil transition as assayed by circular dichroism. The second consequence was to make type I procollagen containing the shortened pro-alpha 2(I) chains resistant to digestion by procollagen N-proteinase. The simplest explanation for the data is that the apparent deletion in half the pro-alpha 2(I) chains produced a partial unfolding of the N-terminal region of type I procollagen which prevented processing of the protein by procollagen N-proteinase."
https://openalex.org/W1497058914,"Previous studies have shown that the primary arylamine carcinogen 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) is oxidized by the prostaglandin H synthase peroxidase to mutagenic and electrophilic products capable of covalent binding to macromolecules. The present study was designed to identify the potential reactive intermediate(s) responsible for binding, and to characterize further the metabolic intermediates in 2-AF peroxidation. Both prostaglandin H synthase and horseradish peroxidase, with H2O2, oxidize 2-AF to azofluorene, 2-aminodifluorenylamine (2-ADFA), 2-nitrofluorene, polymeric and nonorganic-extractable material. Both enzymes show greater activity at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.0. In the presence of either 2-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenol or 2,6-dimethylphenol, arylamine/phenol adducts were formed in high yield, with the nitrogen of either 2-AF or 2-ADFA coupled to the para position of the phenol (loss of -OCH3 with 2-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenol). These structures were confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Acid hydrolysis of N-hydroxy-2-AF to yield the nitrenium ion, in the presence of a phenol, also results in adduct formation, but only at times greater than 2 h and in very limited yield. The peroxidase-catalyzed adduct formation, however is rapid (less than 2 min) and extensive. These and other data support a one-electron pathway for 2-AF peroxidation, with a free radical or a free radical-derived product responsible for binding to protein and DNA. An N-hydroxy intermediate may therefore not be obligatory in the enzymatic activation of 2-AF to a mutagenic product."
https://openalex.org/W1541187938,"Membrane vesicles of Streptococcus lactis were used to characterize a novel anion exchange involving phosphate and sugar 6-phosphates. For vesicles loaded with 50 mM phosphate at pH 7, homologous phosphate:phosphate exchange had a maximal rate of 130 nmol/min/mg of protein and a Kt of 0.21 mM external phosphate; among phosphate analogues tested, only arsenate replaced phosphate. Heterologous exchange was studied by 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate entry into phosphate-loaded vesicles; this reaction had a maximal velocity of 31 nmol/min/mg of protein and a Kt of 26 microM external substrate. Sugar phosphate moved intact during this exchange, since its entry led to loss of internal 32Pi without transfer of 32P to sugar phosphate. Inhibitions of phosphate exchange suggested that the preferred sugar phosphate substrates were (Kiapp): glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, and mannose 6-phosphates (approximately 20 microM) greater than fructose 6-phosphate (150 microM) greater than glucosamine 6-phosphate (420 microM) greater than alpha-methylglucoside 6-phosphate (740 microM). Stoichiometry for phosphate:2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate antiport was 2:1 at pH 7, and since initial rates of exchange were unaffected by charge carrying ionophores (gramicidin, valinomycin, a protonophore), this unequal stoichiometry indicated the electroneutral exchange of two monovalent phosphates for a single divalent sugar phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1561401450,"Detergent-solubilized NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase was purified from porcine hepatic microsomes and compared to the rabbit enzyme isolated under identical conditions. The porcine enzyme had an equivalent specific activity toward cytochrome c compared to the rabbit enzyme. When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the porcine enzyme exhibited a major band at Mr = 80,000 and two additional bands at Mr = 20,000 and 60,000. The 20-kDa fragment was shown to be the COOH-terminal portion of the protein which contains a hydrophobic sequence of 28 residues homologous to the pyrophosphate-binding portion of the FAD-binding protein p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. The 60-kDa fragment corresponded to the NH2-terminal portion of the protein since this peptide and the intact protein have blocked NH2 terminal. The trypsin-solubilized porcine enzyme has an NH2-terminal sequence which is homologous to the equivalent trypsin-solubilized enzymes from rat and rabbit (80% sequence homology). Eight cysteine-containing peptides were isolated from a tryptic digest of the S-carboxymethylated pig enzyme. Significant sequence homology was not found between these peptides and other flavoproteins, except for one peptide (Glu-Val-Gly-Glu-Thr-Leu-Leu-Tyr-Tyr-Gly-Cys-Arg) which exhibited partial homology with the known NADPH-binding site of glutathione reductase. When the NADPH-protected enzyme was first S-alkylated with unlabeled iodoacetate, NADPH depleted, and further alkylated with 14C-labeled iodoacetate, the above radiolabeled peptide was isolated from a tryptic digest. The equivalent peptide was also isolated by a similar procedure from rabbit liver cytochrome P-450 reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1525045344,"Chlorotetracycline (CTC) fluorescence is shown to be a competent and quantitative measure of the free internal calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, obtained by ATP supported active uptake by bovine cardiac sarcolemmal (SL) vesicles. The fluorescence response of CTC to [Ca2+]i is calibrated by pre-equilibrating the vesicles with known Ca2+ concentrations and then diluting into a Ca2+-free medium containing CTC. The experiments show that CTC comes into equilibrium with the internal Ca2+ more rapidly than the latter can passively leak from the vesicles. The amplitude of the fluorescence increase is proportional to the Ca2+ concentration with which the vesicles are pre-equilibrated. This constitutes a calibration procedure for the use of CTC fluorescence as a quantitative measure of the free internal Ca2+ concentrations achieved in active transport. This method is applied to the determination of the average free Ca2+ concentrations achieved in ATP-energized uptake with sarcolemmal vesicles. Under optimal conditions an initial rate of 13 mM/min (37 nmol/mg/min) is observed. Uptake reaches a maximum corresponding to 70 mM (179 nmol/mg). Half-maximal values are obtained after 5 min of reaction. The mechanism of the CTC response to free internal Ca2+ concentration is discussed and is compared with measurements of vesicle-associated 45Ca2+."

This anionic fraction represented about 30% of the total activity in liver with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and was the preponderant form utilizing trans-4-phenyl-3-butene-2-one as a substrate. The anionic transferases are dimeric proteins composed of two subunits designated as Yb and were distinguished from the cationic transferases on the basis of structural, immunological, and binding properties. Amino acid compositions and immunological properties of the anionic protein were similar to those of glutathione S-transferases A and C. The anionic forms had substantially less ordered secondary structure than cationic forms composed of subunits Ya and Yc. Stoichiometric ratios of two high affinity binding sites per dimer, also differentiated between the anionic and all of the cationic transferases which bind only a single mole of ligand. Affinity matrices composed of corticosterone or cholate, and circular dichroism methods, were used to demonstrate selective binding of steroids and bile acids to the anionic glutathione S-transferases. Glucocorticoids and progestins were shown to bind with high affinity whereas estrogens were bound at distinct lower affinity sites. In contrast to the cationic transferases, glutathione had no effect on binding of the steroids to the anionic forms, which suggested that these proteins have the capacity to bind these substances even in a milieu with high concentrations of glutathione."
https://openalex.org/W1537421565,"Two different proteins, tau and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP 2), are able to stimulate tubulin polymerization into microtubules in vitro, but it is not certain if both proteins act by the same mechanism. We have examined the effects of tau and MAP 2 on the vinblastine-induced polymerization of tubulin into spiral filaments. In the presence of tau, vinblastine induced extensive aggregation of tubulin as shown by a large increase in turbidity. The increase in turbidity was accompanied by the formation of large numbers of spirals composed of a filament 40-60 A in diameter. The rate and extent of this aggregation into spirals were dependent on the concentrations of tubulin, tau, and vinblastine. Unlike normal microtubule assembly, this type of aggregation was not inhibited by colchicine or podophyllotoxin. In contrast, MAP 2, even at high concentrations, was less effective than tau at promoting the vinblastine-induced increase in turbidity of tubulin. In fact, MAP 2 strongly inhibited the effect of tau. These results indicate that tau and MAP 2 interact differently with the tubulin molecule in the presence of vinblastine and suggest that the two proteins may play different roles in regulating or promoting microtubule assembly. Vinblastine may thus be a useful probe in analyzing the modes of interactions of tau and MAP 2 with tubulin."

Time-dependent studies with 20 microM substrate show a lag in the synthesis of both the 11- and 14-isomers which was not observed for the synthesis of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), 5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid, and 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) from arachidonic acid. When platelets were incubated with increasing concentrations of 22:5(n-3), the 11- and 14-isomers were not produced until the substrate concentration exceeded 5 microM unless arachidonic acid was also added to the incubations. The stimulatory effect of arachidonic acid was not blocked by indomethacin thus suggesting that 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid or 12-HETE derived from arachidonic acid may activate the platelet lipoxygenase(s) which metabolize 22:5(n-3). Incubations containing 20 microM 22:5(n-3) and increasing levels of [1-14C]arachidonic acid show that the (n-3) acid inhibits the synthesis of both 5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid and TXB2 from arachidonic acid. At the same time, 12-HETE synthesis increased due to substrate shunting to the lipoxygenase pathway."

To this end, purified Ns protein was preactivated (Ns) in solution with guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) and Mg2+, and then added to cyc- membranes under conditions where Ni was either unactivated or activated (Ni) by GTP gamma S and Mg2+. Activation of Ni in cyc- membranes resulted in a lowered expression of Ns activity under all conditions tested. Upon dilution of the reactants (Ns and cyc- membranes) the reconstituted activity declined in proportion to the dilution with an approximate t 1/2 of 30-45 min, being unaffected by activation of Ni. Postactivation of Ni after reconstitution of cyc- membranes with Ns resulted in a time-dependent decline in Ns activity to a level that was the same as that obtained when Ns was added to cyc- membranes with preactivated Ni. These data indicated that the effects of Ns on C are of a reversible type. The following indicated that Ns and Ni affect C activity in a noncompetitive manner: (a) the per cent reduction in Ns activity due to activation of Ni was constant and independent of the concentration of Ns, (b) double reciprocal plots of activities reconstituted in control and Ni-containing cyc- membranes versus Ns concentration were linear with an unaltered apparent Km for Ns, and (c) the onset of inhibition of C prereconstituted with Ns was much faster (approximate t 1/2 = 2-5 min) than expected if it were due to occupancy of a common site on C left vacant by Ns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1560568701,"Abstract The reaction between the FAD-containing enzyme, mercuric reductase, and its reducing substrate, NADPH, has been studied at 5 degrees C, pH 7.3, by rapid-scan and fixed-wavelength stopped-flow techniques with the aim to characterize reaction intermediates. With an excess of NADPH the spectral changes observed in rapid-scan experiments can be described by a simple kinetic model, A----B----C----D, where A, B, C, and D represent distinct spectral species. The first step is virtually complete within the dead time of the apparatus. It is associated with a 16% bleaching of flavin absorbance and the appearance of a very broad charge-transfer band (epsilon max = 1.9 mM-1 cm-1) centered near 600 nm. The second step (k = 43 s-1) involves a further small bleaching of flavin absorbance and intensification of the charge-transfer band (epsilon max = 3.3 mM-1 cm-1) which becomes centered near 580 nm. The third step (k = 8 s-1) involves an intensification and a blue shift of the main FAD absorption band. Concurrently, the charge-transfer band increases in intensity and becomes centered near 530 nm (epsilon 530 = 5.0 mM-1 cm-1). While the first two steps involve 1 mol of NADPH per mol of FAD, the third step requires a second equivalent of NADPH. A 2-electron-reduced enzyme (EH2) can be obtained by treatment of the oxidized enzyme (E) with dithioerythritol. Addition of 1 eq of NADP+ to dithioerythritol-generated EH2 gives rise to a spectral species similar to the kinetic intermediate C, while the addition of 1 eq of NADPH gives rise to a spectral species similar to D. It is proposed that B largely corresponds to an E-NADPH complex, C to an EH2-NADP+ complex, and D to an EH2-NADPH complex."

The gelatinous extracts were solubilized by reduction and carboxymethylation and then purified by chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B and DEAE-Sepharose. The structure of some of the carbohydrate units in these glycoproteins were determined and compared. Alkaline borohydride treatment indicated that more than 85% of the carbohydrate chains in these glycoproteins were linked to serine or threonine residues in the polypeptide chain through O-glycosidic bonds with N-acetylgalactosamine. Reduced oligosaccharides released by treatment with alkaline borohydride were isolated by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-6 and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and paper. The structures of the oligosaccharides were established by methylation analysis, gas chromatography, and sequential hydrolysis with specific exoglycosidases. The major oligosaccharides in Cowper's gland mucin glycoproteins were sialylated short chains: NeuAc alpha 2,6GalNAcol and NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,3(NeuAc alpha 2,6)GalNAcol.

Reaction of the enzyme with 5'-FSBA results in the loss of inhibition by high concentrations of NADH with covalent attachment of 0.53 sulfonylbenozyladenosine/subunit, i.e. modification of three subunits of the hexameric enzyme. Equal amounts of N epsilon-(4-carboxybenzenesulfonyl)lysine (Lys-(CBS] and O-(4-carboxybenzenesulfonyl)tyrosine (Tyr-(CBS] are found throughout the course of the reaction (Saradambal, K.

Modified enzyme, prepared by incubating 2 mg/ml glutamate dehydrogenase with 0.3 mM 3H-labeled 5'-FSBA at pH 8 for 1 h, was carboxymethylated and digested with thermolysin. Two nucleosidyl peptides were isolated by a combination of chromatography on phenyl boronate-agarose, high-performance liquid chromatography in ammonium bicarbonate and high-performance liquid chromatography in trifluoroacetic acid. By comparison of the amino acid analysis and NH2-terminal residue of each isolated peptide with the known amino acid sequence of the enzyme, the peptides were identified as Leu-Gly-Arg-Lys(CBS) and Ile-Gly-His-Tyr(CBS)-Asp. These sequences correspond to residues 417-420 and 187-191, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1601623162,"Receptor-mediated uptake of mannose-terminated glycoproteins by macrophages is blocked by treating the cells with swainsonine, an inhibitor of alpha-mannosidase II, and by castanospermine, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum processing enzyme alpha-glucosidase. Both inhibitors are known to cause accumulation of unprocessed oligosaccharide chains terminating in mannose. Inhibition of ligand uptake by the drugs was time- and dose-dependent. Swainsonine produced a maximal effect after 2 h; castanospermine required 5-6 h. Following swainsonine treatment, complete recovery of mannose receptor activity required 24 h and was blocked by cycloheximide suggesting that new receptor synthesis was necessary. Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of oligosaccharide assembly, had no effect on uptake of mannosylated ligands, but tunicamycin pretreatment reduced the sensitivity to swainsonine. These effects of swainsonine and castanospermine appear to be specific, other macrophage pinocytosis receptors (e.g. mannose phosphate) or phagocytosis of yeast particles were unaffected. Moreover, swainsonine had no effect on the fibroblast mannose phosphate receptor. The ability of macrophages to process newly synthesized oligosaccharides was blocked following treatment with swainsonine. Normal processing was fully recovered 24 h after removal of the drug. Mannosidase II was partially inactivated by swainsonine treatment and only a portion was recovered after 24 h. Treatment of macrophages with swainsonine also resulted in an increase in net lysosomal enzyme secretion. Inhibition of mannose-specific receptor-mediated endocytosis in macrophages by swainsonine and castanospermine appears to be due to the formation of mannose-terminated membrane glycoproteins which engage the mannose receptor thereby preventing function. These results suggest a novel mechanism for regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1559553016,"We have reported the presence of N-acetylgalactosamine linked beta 1,4 to galactose on O-linked oligosaccharides of a cloned murine cytotoxic T cell line and the absence of these residues from the O-linked structures of a Vicia villosa lectin-resistant mutant line, VV6, derived from parental B6.1.SF.1 cells (Conzelmann, A., and Kornfeld, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12528-12535). This study shows that B6.1.SF.1 cells contain an enzyme which transfers N-acetylgalactosamine from UDP-GalNAc onto the O-linked tetrasaccharides of human glycophorin A, giving rise to pentasaccharides which contain beta-glycosidically linked N-acetylgalactosamine. Desialylated glycophorin was inactive as an acceptor. The enzyme also transfers N-acetylgalactosamine to the N-linked oligosaccharides of the Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein. This glycoprotein is known to contain N-linked oligosaccharides with beta-linked N-acetylgalactosamine residues which constitute the Sda blood group determinant. This N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase could not be detected in VV6 cells which can account for the lack of beta-linked N-acetylgalactosamine residues on its O-linked oligosaccharides. The two cell lines have comparable levels of UDP-GalNAc:apomucin N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, demonstrating that the enzyme deficiency in VV6 cells is selective. Both cell lines have a similar glycolipid content, with the major component being asialo-GM1. Since this glycolipid contains N-acetylgalactosamine linked beta 1,4 to galactose, it would appear that the N-acetylgalactosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of glycolipids is different from the UDP-GalNAc:glycoprotein N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. An independently derived murine CTL line also contains the UDP-GalNAc:glycoprotein N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, suggesting that the expression of this enzyme is a common characteristic of this type of cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1575545529,"alpha-Mannosidase from Dictyostelium discoideum is a heterogenous glycoprotein which is derived from a precursor as a result of proteolytic processing. Its oligosaccharides are phosphorylated and sulfated. We investigated the sulfation of the enzyme by means of pulse-chase labeling and specific immunoprecipitation followed by endoglycosidase H treatment and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The earliest detectable form of the precursor was shown to be glycosylated and sensitive to endoglycosidase H. With time some of its oligosaccharides were sulfated and became partially resistant to endoglycosidase H. In the same time period, the precursor was proteolytically cleaved, yielding four species with different molecular masses (46-58 X 10(3) daltons). When first generated each of these was sensitive to endoglycosidase H but with time the 54,000- and 58,000-dalton forms developed degrees of endoglycosidase H resistance. The fully mature cleaved forms all contained sulfate. Sulfate from pulse-labeled precursor could only be detected in two of the forms implying that sulfation of the others occurs either after precursor cleavage or before cleavage but subsequent to the pulse period. When secretion of precursor was triggered by starvation only the endoglycosidase H-resistant forms were secreted."
https://openalex.org/W2036815146,"Blood in mouth, nose, and eye tissues of birds cools by evaporation, then flows to a cephalic vascular heat exchanger, the ophthalmic rete. There, acting as a heat sink, blood from the evaporative surfaces cools arterial blood flowing counter-current to it toward the brain. The brain thus remains cooler than the body core. Data for unanesthetized domestic pigeons (Columba livia) suggest that in addition to losing heat, blood perfusing the evaporative surfaces also exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide with air. In the heat exchanger, this blood apparently gives up oxygen to, and gains carbon dioxide from, arterial blood. The consequent increase in oxygen and decrease in carbon dioxide in the brain's arterial blood enhance diffusion of these gases in, and oxygen supply to, the brain. Such events may help birds maintain the brain's oxygen supply during the high systemic demand of exercise and at the reduced oxygen availability of high altitude."
https://openalex.org/W1584947739,"Abstract In nongrowing mammalian cells, DNA repair synthesis following irradiation with high doses of UV is almost totally inhibited by aphidicolin, an agent specific for DNA polymerase alpha, and presumably is mediated by that polymerase. In this paper, several enzymologic characteristics of DNA repair synthesis induced in permeable confluent diploid human fibroblasts by high doses of UV have been examined and compared with corresponding features of semiconservative DNA replication, a process which is also mediated by polymerase alpha. Inhibition of UV-induced repair synthesis required doses of aphidicolin about 20-fold higher than those needed to inhibit replication, even when the two processes were studied at identical salt and nucleotide concentrations. As is the case for replication, inhibition of UV-induced repair synthesis by aphidicolin is competitive with dCTP. The apparent Ki values for aphidicolin of the two processes are similar, 0.2 microM for repair synthesis and 0.1 microM for semiconservative replication. In contrast, the apparent Km values for dCTP are very different, 0.17 microM for repair synthesis and about 2 microM for replication. The apparent Km values for all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates varied together are also very different, 0.07 microM for repair and 30 microM for replication. These results suggest that either UV-induced DNA repair synthesis and semiconservative replication are mediated by two different aphidicolin-sensitive DNA polymerases or the two functions are performed by a single polymerase (e.g. polymerase alpha) which, as a result of accessory proteins or other factors, acquires very different enzymologic characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1565262044,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is produced in cells as a breakdown product of the diphosphorylated form of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Stimulated breakdown of phosphoinositides has been correlated with a wide variety of hormonal stimuli which mobilize intracellular calcium, and IP3 has recently been found to cause calcium release from intracellular stores, thus implicating it as a second messenger in hormonal stimulation. In this paper we have examined the effect of IP3 on protein phosphorylation, and have found that IP3 stimulates phosphorylation of a 62-kDa protein in cell lysates made from cultured monkey fibroblasts and from bovine brain. Fifty per cent maximal stimulation of phosphorylation of this protein occurred at 2.5 X 10(-7) M IP3. Other inositol phosphates (inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, inositol 1-phosphate, inositol hexaphosphate, and myo-inositol) had no effect on protein phosphorylation at 10(-6)M, although inositol 1,4-bisphosphate at higher concentrations enhanced phosphorylation of the 62-kDa protein in brain lysates. The IP3-stimulated phosphorylation was calcium-independent and did not appear to result from inhibition of an endogenous protein phosphatase. We suggest that IP3, like other second messengers, acts as a protein kinase regulator."

After limited pepsin digestion of the medium, two discrete disulfide-bonded collagen fragments were detected with Mr = 210,000 and 153,000. These fragments contained 28 and 17.5%, respectively, of the radioactivity in the alpha 1(II)-chains. The smaller fragment (called M) produced three components upon reduction (Mr = 104,000, 51,000, and 31,000) and seemed to represent the previously reported collagens, HMW and M1. The larger fragment (called N) has not been previously described and gave rise to three components upon reduction (Mr = 140,000, 69,000, and 49,000). Prolonged pepsin treatment resulted in the gradual decrease of N with a corresponding increase of M, suggesting the conversion of N to M. CNBr peptide mapping demonstrated that all M-derived peptides were present in N and that N contained extra peptides that account for its larger size. These observations suggest that N represents a larger more intact form of cartilage-derived disulfide-bonded collagen."

After purification, apparently homogeneous Paju ornithine decarboxylase was inactivated with [3H]difluoromethylornithine and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under denaturing conditions it was found to have an altered molecular structure, i.e. two nonidentical subunits of Mr = 55,000 and 60,000. Another unusual feature of Paju ornithine decarboxylase was its long half-life in vivo (T 1/2 = 8 h compared with 36 min in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells). The disappearance of immunoreactive protein was only slightly slower than the loss of catalytic activity. The long half-life of Paju ornithine decarboxylase was not shared by adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.

When 125I-apo-A-II-labeled HDL3 was incubated with the PMN protease at 37 degrees C, a complete cleavage of apo-A-II was observed which paralleled the formation of bands of approximately 11,000 and 7,000 daltons by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 7,000-dalton component had the following N-terminal sequence: NH2-Thr-Asp-Tyr-Gly-Lys-Asp-Leu-Met-Glu-Lys. This corresponds to residues 19 through 28 of the intact apo-A-II monomer. Methoxysuccinyl (MeO-Suc)-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethylketone-(CH2Cl) caused a 90% inhibition of apo-A-II hydrolysis at the highest concentration tested (6 X 10(-4)M). Besides apo-A-II, the PMN enzyme also hydrolyzed a synthetic substrate, MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-4-nitroanilide and its 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide analogue. The protease appeared to have a mass of 28,000 daltons as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate-labeled PMN enzyme. That the PMN enzyme which cleaves apo-A-II is an elastase was derived from the following criteria: 1) cleavage at the Val-X bond in apo-A-II and in the two synthetic substrates studied; 2) prevention of the cleavage by MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CH2Cl, a known specific elastase inhibitor; and 3) a mass comparable to that reported for a pure PMN elastase.

The PDA-synthesizing system consists of two components, a heat-stable enzyme and a heat-labile enzyme. The heat-stable enzyme can be replaced by sepiapterin synthase A, a previously purified enzyme required for the Mg2+-dependent conversion of H2-NTP to an unstable compound that appears to be 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (pyruvoyl-H4-pterin). The heat-labile enzyme, purified to near-homogeneity and termed PDA synthase (Mr = 48,000), catalyzes the conversion of pyruvoyl-H4-pterin to PDA in a reaction requiring the presence of reduced glutathione. Because PDA is two electrons more reduced than pyruvoyl-H4-pterin, the reducing power required for this transformation is probably supplied by glutathione. The PDA-synthesizing system requires the presence of another thiol-containing compound such as 2-mercaptoethanol when incubation conditions 2-mercaptoethanol is no longer required. Evidence is presented to indicate that the Drosophila eye color mutant, sepia, is missing PDA synthase."

In this study, alpha subunit mRNA amounts have been examined in sheep pituitaries during defined times of the normal estrous cycle. These times were designed to include events prior to, and including the beginning of, the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge. Criteria such as serum and pituitary luteinizing hormone, serum progesterone, and ovarian morphology were used to classify the groups as: 1) Day 12 of the cycle; 2) 24 h before behavioral estrus (E-24); and 3) 5 h after estrus (E + 5). RNA was extracted from the pituitaries and amounts of alpha subunit mRNA quantitated using cell-free translations and cDNA hybridizations. Both Northern transfers and RNA dot blots were used. The amount of alpha subunit mRNA in the Day 12 group was the lowest of the three groups and was similar to that seen in the pituitary from an anestrous ewe. The amount observed in the E-24 animals was only slightly increased over the Day 12 (approximately 2-fold); however, a greater increase was observed when the E + 5 group was examined (approximately 4-8-fold). These results suggest that the amount of alpha subunit mRNA increases during the time of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge in the normal estrous cycle of the sheep and thus probably plays a role in the important physiological event."

The enzyme differed from the mitochondrial enzyme in the embryos, and mammalian alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferases 1 (with a molecular weight of about 80,000 with two identical subunits) and 2 (with a molecular weight of about 200,000 with four identical subunits) in molecular weights and immunological properties. Mitochondrial alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase in chick embryos had an identical molecular weight and immunologically cross-reacted with mammalian mitochondrial alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 2. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dissociated easily from the peroxisomal enzyme saturated with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Hepatic aspartate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and alanine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase in chick embryos, and hepatic alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferases in different animal species were all present as the holoenzyme."

Monooxygenation of 7,8-dihydrodiol was, surprisingly, 5 to 10 times more sensitive than monooxygenation of BP to inhibition by all primary metabolites, even though both reactions require the same enzyme, cytochrome P-450c. Two representative products, 1,6-quinone and 9-phenol, were both strong, competitive inhibitors of BP metabolism with Ki values of 0.12 and 0.74 microM, respectively. The total effect of product inhibition on the overall reactions was determined by fitting progress curves of BP, 7,8-dihydrodiol, and anti-7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-oxide (determined as 7,10/8,9-tetrol) over a range of BP concentrations to integrated steady-state equations using experimental Vmax and Km values. The effective product inhibition factors for BP and 7,8-dihydrodiol metabolism, determined from progress curve fits, were only 2-fold higher than the corresponding calculated theoretical values. The effective product inhibition factors, obtained from progress curve analysis, confirmed that 7,8-dihydrodiol metabolism was substantially more sensitive to inhibition by primary BP metabolites than BP metabolism itself. This difference probably reflects the much higher affinity of cytochrome P-450c for BP (Kd = 6 nM), as compared to 7,8-dihydrodiol (Kd = 175 nM) that was established spectrophotometrically both for the purified cytochrome and for MC microsomes. The Km for BP metabolism is 50 to 100 times higher than the Kd, while the Km is similar to the Kd for 7,8-dihydrodiol metabolism. The discrepancy for BP between Km and Kd suggests that standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics may be perturbed by either slow substrate or product dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1496885000,"The 8000 X g pellet of rabbit placenta transformed arachidonic acid into a number of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase products of known structure. A metabolite was also produced which was inhibited by indomethacin and required calcium for its formation. This compound had a UV absorption maximum at 227 nm under acidic or neutral conditions and gave a bathochromic shift to 281 nm under alkaline conditions. Reduction of this metabolite with sodium borohydride produced prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha (as determined by mass spectrometry), while catalytic hydrogenation increased the molecular weight by four mass units, indicating the presence of two double bonds. Based on the mass spectrum of the derivatized metabolite, the structure proved to be 9,15-dioxo-11-hydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoic acid. This compound is produced by the term placenta and does not appear to be formed from PGE2, PGF2 alpha, or PGD2. The compound is suppressed by GSH and NADPH, but its formation is not increased by NAD or NADP. PGH2 and PGG2 are not converted to 9,15-dioxo-11-hydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoic acid under similar in vitro incubation conditions. This therefore represents conversion of arachidonate to 9,15-dioxo-11-hydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoic acid through a Ca2+-dependent, non-PG dehydrogenase pathway."
