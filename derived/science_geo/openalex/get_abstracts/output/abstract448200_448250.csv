https://openalex.org/W2088580309,"Clonal evolution is a key feature of cancer progression and relapse. We studied intratumoral heterogeneity in 149 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases by integrating whole-exome sequence and copy number to measure the fraction of cancer cells harboring each somatic mutation. We identified driver mutations as predominantly clonal (e.g., MYD88, trisomy 12, and del(13q)) or subclonal (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53), corresponding to earlier and later events in CLL evolution. We sampled leukemia cells from 18 patients at two time points. Ten of twelve CLL cases treated with chemotherapy (but only one of six without treatment) underwent clonal evolution, predominantly involving subclones with driver mutations (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53) that expanded over time. Furthermore, presence of a subclonal driver mutation was an independent risk factor for rapid disease progression. Our study thus uncovers patterns of clonal evolution in CLL, providing insights into its stepwise transformation, and links the presence of subclones with adverse clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2017792066,"Spider silk is extraordinarily strong, mollusk shells and bone are tough, and porcupine quills and feathers resist buckling. How are these notable properties achieved? The building blocks of the materials listed above are primarily minerals and biopolymers, mostly in combination; the first weak in tension and the second weak in compression. The intricate and ingenious hierarchical structures are responsible for the outstanding performance of each material. Toughness is conferred by the presence of controlled interfacial features (friction, hydrogen bonds, chain straightening and stretching); buckling resistance can be achieved by filling a slender column with a lightweight foam. Here, we present and interpret selected examples of these and other biological materials. Structural bio-inspired materials design makes use of the biological structures by inserting synthetic materials and processes that augment the structures' capability while retaining their essential features. In this Review, we explain this idea through some unusual concepts."
https://openalex.org/W2025530120,"Environmental pollution by pharmaceuticals is increasingly recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide. A variety of pharmaceuticals enter waterways by way of treated wastewater effluents and remain biochemically active in aquatic systems. Several ecotoxicological studies have been done, but generally, little is known about the ecological effects of pharmaceuticals. Here we show that a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug (oxazepam) alters behavior and feeding rate of wild European perch (Perca fluviatilis) at concentrations encountered in effluent-influenced surface waters. Individuals exposed to water with dilute drug concentrations (1.8 micrograms liter(-1)) exhibited increased activity, reduced sociality, and higher feeding rate. As such, our results show that anxiolytic drugs in surface waters alter animal behaviors that are known to have ecological and evolutionary consequences."

Despite wide agreement that supernova remnants (SNRs) are the sources of galactic cosmic rays, unequivocal evidence for the acceleration of protons in these objects is still lacking. When accelerated protons encounter interstellar material, they produce neutral pions, which in turn decay into gamma rays. This offers a compelling way to detect the acceleration sites of protons. The identification of pion-decay gamma rays has been difficult because high-energy electrons also produce gamma rays via bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering. We detected the characteristic pion-decay feature in the gamma-ray spectra of two SNRs, IC 443 and W44, with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. This detection provides direct evidence that cosmic-ray protons are accelerated in SNRs."
https://openalex.org/W2151010498,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly appreciated as regulators of cell-specific gene expression. Here, an enhancer-like lncRNA termed NeST (nettoie Salmonella pas Theiler's [cleanup Salmonella not Theiler's]) is shown to be causal for all phenotypes conferred by murine viral susceptibility locus Tmevp3. This locus was defined by crosses between SJL/J and B10.S mice and contains several candidate genes, including NeST. The SJL/J-derived locus confers higher lncRNA expression, increased interferon-γ (IFN-γ) abundance in activated CD8(+) T cells, increased Theiler's virus persistence, and decreased Salmonella enterica pathogenesis. Transgenic expression of NeST lncRNA alone was sufficient to confer all phenotypes of the SJL/J locus. NeST RNA was found to bind WDR5, a component of the histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase complex, and to alter histone 3 methylation at the IFN-γ locus. Thus, this lncRNA regulates epigenetic marking of IFN-γ-encoding chromatin, expression of IFN-γ, and susceptibility to a viral and a bacterial pathogen."

The precise causes of insulin resistance are varied, and the relative importance of each is a matter of ongoing research. Here, we offer a Perspective on the heterogeneous etiology of insulin resistance, focusing in particular on the role of inflammation, lipid metabolism, and the gastrointestinal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2171577249,"X chromosome aneuploidies have long been associated with human cancers, but causality has not been established. In mammals, X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is triggered by Xist RNA to equalize gene expression between the sexes. Here we delete Xist in the blood compartment of mice and demonstrate that mutant females develop a highly aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm and myelodysplastic syndrome (mixed MPN/MDS) with 100% penetrance. Significant disease components include primary myelofibrosis, leukemia, histiocytic sarcoma, and vasculitis. Xist-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) show aberrant maturation and age-dependent loss. Reconstitution experiments indicate that MPN/MDS and myelofibrosis are of hematopoietic rather than stromal origin. We propose that Xist loss results in X reactivation and consequent genome-wide changes that lead to cancer, thereby causally linking the X chromosome to cancer in mice. Thus, Xist RNA not only is required to maintain XCI but also suppresses cancer in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1976171957,"One Protein, Two Probes A central challenge in the use of x-ray diffraction to characterize macromolecular structure is the propensity of the high-energy radiation to damage the sample during data collection. Recently, a powerful accelerator-based, ultrafast x-ray laser source has been used to determine the geometric structures of small protein crystals too fragile for conventional diffraction techniques. Kern et al. (p. 491 , published online 14 February) now pair this method with concurrent x-ray emission spectroscopy to probe electronic structure, as well as geometry, and were able to characterize the metal oxidation states in the oxygen-evolving complex within photosystem II crystals, while simultaneously verifying the surrounding protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W2111792017,"In the Arctic, under-ice primary production is limited to summer months and is restricted not only by ice thickness and snow cover but also by the stratification of the water column, which constrains nutrient supply for algal growth. Research Vessel Polarstern visited the ice-covered eastern-central basins between 82° to 89°N and 30° to 130°E in summer 2012, when Arctic sea ice declined to a record minimum. During this cruise, we observed a widespread deposition of ice algal biomass of on average 9 grams of carbon per square meter to the deep-sea floor of the central Arctic basins. Data from this cruise will contribute to assessing the effect of current climate change on Arctic productivity, biodiversity, and ecological function."
https://openalex.org/W2021379694,"The quantum mechanics of position measurement of a macroscopic object is typically inaccessible because of strong coupling to the environment and classical noise. Here we monitor a mechanical resonator subject to an increasingly strong continuous position measurement and observe a quantum mechanical backaction force that rises in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. For our optically-based position measurements, the backaction takes the form of a fluctuating radiation pressure from the Poisson-distributed photons in the coherent measurement field, termed radiation pressure shot noise. We demonstrate a backaction force that is comparable in magnitude to the thermal forces in our system. Additionally, we observe a temporal correlation between fluctuations in the radiation force and in the position of the resonator."
https://openalex.org/W2161027938,"A quantum walk is a time-homogeneous quantum-mechanical process on a graph defined by analogy to classical random walk. The quantum walker is a particle that moves from a given vertex to adjacent vertices in quantum superposition. We consider a generalization to interacting systems with more than one walker, such as the Bose-Hubbard model and systems of fermions or distinguishable particles with nearest-neighbor interactions, and show that multiparticle quantum walk is capable of universal quantum computation. Our construction could, in principle, be used as an architecture for building a scalable quantum computer with no need for time-dependent control."
https://openalex.org/W2041825325,"Although several hundred regions of the human genome harbor signals of positive natural selection, few of the relevant adaptive traits and variants have been elucidated. Using full-genome sequence variation from the 1000 Genomes (1000G) Project and the composite of multiple signals (CMS) test, we investigated 412 candidate signals and leveraged functional annotation, protein structure modeling, epigenetics, and association studies to identify and extensively annotate candidate causal variants. The resulting catalog provides a tractable list for experimental follow-up; it includes 35 high-scoring nonsynonymous variants, 59 variants associated with expression levels of a nearby coding gene or lincRNA, and numerous variants associated with susceptibility to infectious disease and other phenotypes. We experimentally characterized one candidate nonsynonymous variant in Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and show that it leads to altered NF-κB signaling in response to bacterial flagellin. PAPERFLICK:"
https://openalex.org/W2072776024,"Many exotic compounds, such as cuprate superconductors and heavy fermion materials, exhibit a linear in temperature (T) resistivity, the origin of which is not well understood. We found that the resistivity of the quantum critical metal Sr(3)Ru(2)O(7) is also T-linear at the critical magnetic field of 7.9 T. Using the precise existing data for the Fermi surface topography and quasiparticle velocities of Sr(3)Ru(2)O(7), we show that in the region of the T-linear resistivity, the scattering rate per kelvin is well approximated by the ratio of the Boltzmann constant to the Planck constant divided by 2π. Extending the analysis to a number of other materials reveals similar results in the T-linear region, in spite of large differences in the microscopic origins of the scattering."
https://openalex.org/W2160050228,"Accumulating evidence shows that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has a variety of physiological functions. H2S is produced from cysteine by 3 sulfurtransferases. H2S, in turn, generates polysulfides, the functions of which are not well understood. H2S induces Ca2+ influx in astrocytes, a type of glia. However, the receptor that mediates the response has not been identified. Here, we have shown that polysulfides induce Ca2+ influx by activating transient receptor potential (TRP)A1 channels in rat astrocytes (EC50 91 nM, Hill coefficient value 1.77±0.26) and that the maximum response was induced at 0.5 μM, which is 1/320 of the concentration of H2S required to achieve a response of similar magnitude (160 μM, EC50 116 μM). TRPA1-selective agonists, allyl isothiocyanate and cinnamaldehyde, induced Ca2+ influx, and responses to polysulfides were suppressed by TRPA1-selective inhibitors, HC-030031 and AP-18, as well as by siRNAs selective to TRPA1. The present study suggests that polysulfides are possible H2S-derived signaling molecules that stimulate TRP channels in the brain.—Kimura, Y., Mikami, Y., Osumi, K., Tsugane, M., Oka, J., Kimura, H.

https://openalex.org/W2063733088,"Instances in which natural selection maintains genetic variation in a population over millions of years are thought to be extremely rare. We conducted a genome-wide scan for long-lived balancing selection by looking for combinations of SNPs shared between humans and chimpanzees. In addition to the major histocompatibility complex, we identified 125 regions in which the same haplotypes are segregating in the two species, all but two of which are noncoding. In six cases, there is evidence for an ancestral polymorphism that persisted to the present in humans and chimpanzees. Regions with shared haplotypes are significantly enriched for membrane glycoproteins, and a similar trend is seen among shared coding polymorphisms. These findings indicate that ancient balancing selection has shaped human variation and point to genes involved in host-pathogen interactions as common targets."
https://openalex.org/W2041516961,"Although reconsolidation opens up new avenues to erase excessive fear memory, subtle boundary conditions put constraints on retrieval-induced plasticity. Reconsolidation may only take place when memory reactivation involves an experience that engages new learning (prediction error). Thus far, it has not been possible to determine the optimal degree of novelty required for destabilizing the memory. The occurrence of prediction error could only be inferred from the observation of a reconsolidation process itself. Here, we provide a noninvasive index of memory destabilization that is independent from the occurrence of reconsolidation. Using this index, we show in humans that prediction error is (i) a necessary condition for reconsolidation of associative fear memory and (ii) determined by the interaction between original learning and retrieval. Insight into the process of memory updating is crucial for understanding the optimal and boundary conditions on reconsolidation and provides a clear guide for the development of reconsolidation-based treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2128865541,"An adaptive variant of the human Ectodysplasin receptor, EDARV370A, is one of the strongest candidates of recent positive selection from genome-wide scans. We have modeled EDAR370A in mice and characterized its phenotype and evolutionary origins in humans. Our computational analysis suggests the allele arose in central China approximately 30,000 years ago. Although EDAR370A has been associated with increased scalp hair thickness and changed tooth morphology in humans, its direct biological significance and potential adaptive role remain unclear. We generated a knockin mouse model and find that, as in humans, hair thickness is increased in EDAR370A mice. We identify new biological targets affected by the mutation, including mammary and eccrine glands. Building on these results, we find that EDAR370A is associated with an increased number of active eccrine glands in the Han Chinese. This interdisciplinary approach yields unique insight into the generation of adaptive variation among modern humans."
https://openalex.org/W2147339635,"Allostery is well documented for proteins but less recognized for DNA-protein interactions. Here, we report that specific binding of a protein on DNA is substantially stabilized or destabilized by another protein bound nearby. The ternary complex's free energy oscillates as a function of the separation between the two proteins with a periodicity of ~10 base pairs, the helical pitch of B-form DNA, and a decay length of ~15 base pairs. The binding affinity of a protein near a DNA hairpin is similarly dependent on their separation, which-together with molecular dynamics simulations-suggests that deformation of the double-helical structure is the origin of DNA allostery. The physiological relevance of this phenomenon is illustrated by its effect on gene expression in live bacteria and on a transcription factor's affinity near nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2091190940,"Casein kinase 1 (CK1) members play key roles in numerous biological processes. They are considered ""rogue"" kinases, because their enzymatic activity appears unregulated. Contrary to this notion, we have identified the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3 as a regulator of the Wnt-β-catenin network, where it acts as a regulatory subunit of CK1ε: In a Wnt-dependent manner, DDX3 binds CK1ε and directly stimulates its kinase activity, and promotes phosphorylation of the scaffold protein dishevelled. DDX3 is required for Wnt-β-catenin signaling in mammalian cells and during Xenopus and Caenorhabditis elegans development. The results also suggest that the kinase-stimulatory function extends to other DDX and CK1 members, opening fresh perspectives for one of the longest-studied protein kinase families."
https://openalex.org/W1979909841,"Despite advances in surgical techniques for peripheral nerve repair, functional restitution remains incomplete. The timing of surgery is one factor influencing the extent of recovery but it is not yet clearly defined how long a delay may be tolerated before repair becomes futile. In this study, rats underwent sciatic nerve transection before immediate (0) or 1, 3, or 6 months delayed repair with a nerve graft. Regeneration of spinal motoneurons, 13 weeks after nerve repair, was assessed using retrograde labeling. Nerve tissue was also collected from the proximal and distal stumps and from the nerve graft, together with the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles. A dramatic decline in the number of regenerating motoneurons and myelinated axons in the distal nerve stump was observed in the 3- and 6-months delayed groups. After 3 months delay, the axonal number in the proximal stump increased 2–3 folds, accompanied by a smaller axonal area. RT-PCR of distal nerve segments revealed a decline in Schwann cells (SC) markers, most notably in the 3 and 6 month delayed repair samples. There was also a progressive increase in fibrosis and proteoglycan scar markers in the distal nerve with increased delayed repair time. The yield of SC isolated from the distal nerve segments progressively fell with increased delay in repair time but cultured SC from all groups proliferated at similar rates. MG muscle at 3- and 6-months delay repair showed a significant decline in weight (61% and 27% compared with contra-lateral side). Muscle fiber atrophy and changes to neuromuscular junctions were observed with increased delayed repair time suggestive of progressively impaired reinnervation. This study demonstrates that one of the main limiting factors for nerve regeneration after delayed repair is the distal stump. The critical time point after which the outcome of regeneration becomes too poor appears to be 3-months."
https://openalex.org/W2160997906,"AP-1 is a clathrin adaptor complex that sorts cargo between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. AP-1 recruitment to these compartments requires Arf1-GTP. The crystal structure of the tetrameric core of AP-1 in complex with Arf1-GTP, together with biochemical analyses, shows that Arf1 activates cargo binding by unlocking AP-1. Unlocking is driven by two molecules of Arf1 that bridge two copies of AP-1 at two interaction sites. The GTP-dependent switch I and II regions of Arf1 bind to the N terminus of the β1 subunit of one AP-1 complex, while the back side of Arf1 binds to the central part of the γ subunit trunk of a second AP-1 complex. A third Arf1 interaction site near the N terminus of the γ subunit is important for recruitment, but not activation.

CCV formation starts with the recruitment of adaptor proteins (APs) from the cytosol to the target membranes. The membrane-bound APs interact with sorting signals contained within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo proteins while also inducing the polymerization of clathrin into a polyhedral, lattice-like scaffold. Clathrin-coated membranes curve, eventually leading to the budding of CCVs that contain specific sets of cargo molecules. The main clathrin APs are two homologous, heterotetrameric complexes named AP-1 (γ-β1-μ1-σ1) and AP-2 (α-β2-μ2-σ2) (subunit composition in parentheses), which function at the TGN and endosomes (AP-1) and plasma membrane (AP-2) (Owen et al., 2004Owen D.J.

Both complexes are structured as a “core” domain, comprising the N-terminal “trunk” portions of γ/α and β1/β2 plus the whole μ1/μ2 and σ1/σ2 subunits and two “appendage” domains, corresponding to the C-terminal portions of γ/α and β1/β2, which are connected to the core by two long, largely unstructured “hinge” sequences. The core domain mediates recruitment to membranes and recognition of sorting signals while the hinge-ear domains interact with clathrin and various accessory proteins. Both AP-1 and AP-2 recognize at least two types of sorting signal: tyrosine-based YXXØ-type signals through binding to the μ1/μ2 subunits (Boll et al., 1996Boll W. Ohno H. Songyang Z. Rapoport I.

Second, binding of one type of signal enhances binding of the other type, probably due to stabilization of an open conformation (Lee et al., 2008aLee I. Doray B. Govero J. Kornfeld S. Binding of cargo sorting signals to AP-1 enhances its association with ADP ribosylation factor 1-GTP.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whereas the mechanisms of signal recognition by AP-1 and AP-2 appear quite similar, the determinants of recruitment to their corresponding membranes differ significantly. The AP-1 core has a phosphoinositide-binding site with preference for phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P] on its γ subunit, at a location similar to that of the PI(4,5)P2-binding site on AP-2 α (Heldwein et al., 2004Heldwein E.E. Macia E. Wang J. Yin H.L. Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. Crystal structure of the clathrin adaptor protein 1 core.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PI(4)P is enriched within domains of the TGN and endosomes (Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Phosphoinositides in cell regulation and membrane dynamics.Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar), consistent with the association of AP-1 to these compartments. In contrast to the case of AP-2, however, phosphoinositides alone are insufficient to recruit AP-1 to its sites of action. Instead, the key determinant of AP-1 targeting to the TGN and endosomes is its interaction with members of the ADP ribosylation factor (Arf) family of small GTPases, particularly Arf1 (Seaman et al., 1996Seaman M.N.J. Sowerby P.J. Robinson M.S. Cytosolic and membrane-associated proteins involved in the recruitment of AP-1 adaptors onto the trans-Golgi network.J. Biol.

Arf1 cooperates with cargo and phosphoinositides such that AP-1 binding to all of these components is thought to be necessary for targeting under normal conditions (Crottet et al., 2002Crottet P.

Biophys. 2008; 479: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Arfs cycle between a GDP-bound, inactive cytosolic form and a GTP-bound, active membrane-tethered form (Donaldson and Jackson, 2011Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. ARF family G proteins and their regulators: roles in membrane transport, development and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Conversion to the GTP-bound form requires a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), whereas conversion to the GDP-bound form is catalyzed by a GTPase activating protein (GAP). Loading with GTP causes Arfs to undergo a conformational change, exposing a myristoylated N-terminal amphipathic helix that inserts into the membrane while reconfiguring its switch I-II and interswitch regions to allow the binding of effector proteins (Donaldson and Jackson, 2011Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. ARF family G proteins and their regulators: roles in membrane transport, development and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Arf1 has many effectors, including AP-1 and the homologous heterotetrameric complexes AP-3 (Ooi et al., 1998Ooi C.E. Dell’Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S.

Arf1 is not enriched at the plasma membrane and is not thought to interact with AP-2 in cells. Some studies, however, have suggested that the plasma-membrane-associated Arf6 could be involved in recruiting AP-2 (Krauss et al., 2003Krauss M. Kinuta M. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Takei K. Haucke V.

Signal. 2007; 19: 2370-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the question of how Arf-family GTPases recognize, recruit, and activate AP complexes has broad implications for intracellular traffic. Recently, important insight into Arf1 recognition was obtained from the structure of a truncated γζ subcomplex from COPI (Yu et al., 2012Yu X.C. Breitman M. Goldberg J. A structure-based mechanism for Arf1-dependent recruitment of coatomer to membranes.Cell. 2012; 148: 530-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to take the next step in understanding whether Arf1 regulates not only the localization, but also the conformation of heterotetrameric sorting complexes. To address this question, we solved the crystal structure of the AP-1 core in complex with GTP-bound Arf1. The most important insight is that Arf1-GTP alone, in the absence of cargo or PI(4)P, can unlock AP-1 and drive it into the open conformation. AP-1 contains two binding sites for the canonical switch I and II surface on Arf1, one on each of the two trunk domains. Both of these Arf1-binding sites are required for high-affinity binding in vitro and for subcellular localization to the TGN and endosomes, but only the site on β1 is important for activation. Moreover, a surface on the C-terminal portion (“back side”) of Arf1, distal to switch I and II, was found to be required for full allosteric activation, although it does not contribute to recruitment. Taking together the mutational and biochemical analyses with the dimeric assemblage of AP-1 in the crystal lattice, we deduced a model for the allosteric activation mechanism. Reconstitution of the recruitment of AP-1 to liposomes by Arf1, cargo, and PI(4)P highlights the profound cooperativity between the binding of cargo to AP-1 and Arf1. The core of the AP-1 adaptor complex was reconstituted by coexpressing the trunk domains of the murine γ1 (residues 1–595) and human β1 (residues 1–584) subunits with full-length human σ1C and murine μ1A subunits in E. coli using a single polycistronic expression plasmid. Human Arf1 bearing the GTPase mutation Q71L and the N-terminal truncation Δ1-16 (Arf1Δ1-16) was loaded with GTP and mixed at a 4:1 excess of Arf1 relative to AP-1. Crystals were obtained that diffracted to 7.0 Å resolution. The crystal structure of the AP-1:Arf1-GTP complex (Figure 1A) was determined by the molecular replacement method. Because it was not known a priori whether the crystallized AP-1 core would be in one of the expected locked or open conformations, or in some novel conformation, test searches were run using all of the available crystal structures of AP-1 and AP-2 core complexes. A solution was obtained using as a search model the core of AP-2 in the open conformation (PDB: 2XA7) (Jackson et al., 2010Jackson L.P. Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Gaffry T. James L.C. Collins B.M. Höning S. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. A large-scale conformational change couples membrane recruitment to cargo binding in the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex.Cell. 2010; 141: 1220-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). At this stage, clear (Fo−Fc)αcalc difference electron density was visible for the entire Arf1Δ1-16 molecule (Figure 1B). The 1.6 Å structure of the GTP-bound form of murine Arf1Δ1-17 (Shiba et al., 2003Shiba T. Kawasaki M. Takatsu H. Nogi T. Matsugaki N. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Kato R. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Molecular mechanism of membrane recruitment of GGA by ARF in lysosomal protein transport.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (PDB: 1O3Y) was used as a search model to position the molecule in the unit cell. The clarity of this unbiased difference map, in spite of its low resolution, persuaded us to refine the structure and characterize its functional implications. It is not possible to visualize side chains at this resolution. However, given the availability of well-refined starting models for substructures, contemporary refinement methodology makes it possible to accurately analyze the overall conformation of large protein complexes and the nature of their interfaces from diffraction data at as low as 7 Å resolution (Brunger et al., 2012Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Fromme P. Fromme R. Levitt M. Schröder G.F. Improving the accuracy of macromolecular structure refinement at 7 Å resolution.Structure. 2012; 20: 957-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Refinement of this structure was facilitated by the finding that the Arf1-bound conformation of AP-1 is nearly identical to the open conformation of AP-2, which was refined at 3.1 Å resolution (Jackson et al., 2010Jackson L.P. Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Gaffry T. James L.C. Collins B.M. Höning S. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. A large-scale conformational change couples membrane recruitment to cargo binding in the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex.Cell. 2010; 141: 1220-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The main chain of the AP-1 structure was tethered to a model based on the open conformation of AP-2 using the deformable elastic network (DEN) methodology (Schröder et al., 2010Schröder G.F. Levitt M. Brunger A.T. Super-resolution biomolecular crystallography with low-resolution data.Nature. 2010; 464: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). A starting model of AP-1 in this conformation was generated by superimposing the 4.0 Å resolution coordinates of the AP-1 core complex (PDB: 1W63) (Heldwein et al., 2004Heldwein E.E. Macia E. Wang J. Yin H.L. Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. Crystal structure of the clathrin adaptor protein 1 core.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 14108-14113Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) onto the open conformation of AP-2 on a domain-by-domain basis. The trunk domains of β1 and γ were broken into three fragments for the superposition, and μ1 was broken into its N- and C-terminal domains. All of these domains had excellent fits with the sole exception of the μ1 C-terminal domain. Therefore, the μ1 C-terminal domain model was derived by replacing the side chains of μ2 in the TGN38-bound structure with their cognates from μ1. Even though the side chains were not visualized, they were included in the refinement in order to account for their contribution to X-ray scattering. Side-chain conformations were allowed to relax in order to accommodate sequence differences with respect to the parent models used for molecular replacement and to avoid steric collisions at Arf1 binding and lattice interfaces. The resulting structure (Figure 1A) had a free R-factor of 0.25 and excellent stereochemistry (Table S1, available online). Moreover, as described below, the structural interfaces underwent extensive validation on the Arf1 and AP-1 sides, both in solution and in cells. By analogy to AP-2, it was anticipated that AP-1 would be activated through a conformational change and exposure of the YXXØ- and [DE]XXXL[LI]-binding sites. Here, we have visualized the active conformation of AP-1 in the presence of Arf1-GTP but in the absence of cargo tails, phosphoinositides, or soluble phosphoinositide analogs. The overall structure is essentially superimposable on that of the YXXØ-bound AP-2 core (Figure 1C), which is the structural paradigm of the active conformation. This observation is consistent with the biochemical evidence that Arf1-GTP is a direct allosteric activator of AP-1. The crystals contain one copy each of the AP-1 core and Arf1 (Figure 1A). Arf1 bridges two copies of the AP-1 core in the crystal lattice, such that Arf1 binds to two sites on AP-1 (Figure 1D). The larger of the two interfaces (∼720 Å2) buries the switch I and II regions of Arf1 against helices α1, α3, and α5 of the β1 subunit (Figures 2A and 2B ). The β1 contact is centered on Gln59, Ile85, and Asn89. Arf1 contacts include Ile46, Ile49, Gly50, Phe51, Asn52, and Val53 of switch I; Trp66, Lys73, Ile74, Leu77, His80, Tyr81, and Gln83 of switch II; and Tyr35 of α1 (Figures 2A and 2B). Switch I and II are the regions of Arf1 that change conformation upon GTP binding (Goldberg, 1998Goldberg J. Structural basis for activation of ARF GTPase: mechanisms of guanine nucleotide exchange and GTP-myristoyl switching.Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The GDP-bound conformation of Arf1 (Amor et al., 1994Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Structure of the human ADP-ribosylation factor 1 complexed with GDP.Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) is not compatible with the β1 structure because of an extensive clash between switch I and β1-α5 (Figure S1). The involvement of the switch regions in AP-1 binding has been noted (Liang et al., 1997Liang J.O. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kornfeld S. Different domains of mammalian ADP-ribosylation factor 1 mediate interaction with selected target proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33001-33008Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the GTP requirement for membrane recruitment of AP-1 and its inhibition by the Arf1 GEF inhibitor brefeldin A (Stamnes and Rothman, 1993Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E.

By inactivating the retraction aspect of pilus function, genes essential for T4P assembly were discriminated. In contrast to previous studies in the T4P system of Neisseria spp., we found that components of the inner membrane subcomplex consisting of PilMNOP were not essential for surface pilus expression, whereas the highly conserved inner membrane protein PilC was essential. Here, we present data that PilC may coordinate the activity of cytoplasmic polymerization (PilB) and depolymerization (PilT) ATPases via their interactions with its two cytoplasmic domains. Using in vitro co-affinity purification, we show that PilB interacts with the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PilC. We hypothesized that PilT similarly interacts with the PilC C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Overexpression of that domain in the wild-type protein reduced twitching motility by ∼50% compared with the vector control. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved T4P-specific residues in the PilC C-terminal domain yielded mutant proteins that supported wild-type pilus assembly but had a reduced capacity to support twitching motility, suggesting impairment of putative PilC-PilT interactions. Taken together, our results show that PilC is an essential inner membrane component of the T4P system, controlling both pilus assembly and disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W2132041842,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by alveolar injury and uncontrolled inflammation. Since most cases of ALI resolve spontaneously, understanding the endogenous mechanisms that promote ALI resolution is important to developing effective therapies. Previous studies have implicated extracellular adenosine signaling in tissue adaptation and wound healing. Therefore, we hypothesized a functional contribution for the endogenous production of adenosine during ALI resolution. As a model, we administered intratracheal LPS and observed peak lung injury at 3 d, with resolution by d 14. Treatment with pegylated adenosine-deaminase to enhance extracellular adenosine breakdown revealed impaired ALI resolution. Similarly, genetic deletion of cd73, the pacemaker for extracellular adenosine generation, was associated with increased mortality (0% wild-type and 40% in cd73–/– mice; P<0.05) and failure to resolve ALI adequately. Studies of inflammatory cell trafficking into the lungs during ALI resolution revealed that regulatory T cells (Tregs) express the highest levels of CD73. While Treg numbers in cd73–/– mice were similar to controls, cd73-deficient Tregs had attenuated immunosuppressive functions. Moreover, adoptive transfer of cd73-deficient Tregs into Rag–/– mice emulated the observed phenotype in cd73–/– mice, while transfer of wild-type Tregs was associated with normal ALI resolution. Together, these studies implicate CD73-dependent adenosine generation in Tregs in promoting ALI resolution.—Ehrentraut, H., Clambey, E. T., McNamee, E. N., Brodsky, K. S., Ehrentraut, S. F., Poth, J.

https://openalex.org/W2040801294,"Mature mammalian sperm contain a complex population of RNAs some of which might regulate spermatogenesis while others probably play a role in fertilization and early development. Due to this limited knowledge, the biological functions of sperm RNAs remain enigmatic. Here we report the first characterization of the global transcriptome of the sperm of fertile stallions. The findings improved understanding of the biological significance of sperm RNAs which in turn will allow the discovery of sperm-based biomarkers for stallion fertility. The stallion sperm transcriptome was interrogated by analyzing sperm and testes RNA on a 21,000-element equine whole-genome oligoarray and by RNA-seq. Microarray analysis revealed 6,761 transcripts in the sperm, of which 165 were sperm-enriched, and 155 were differentially expressed between the sperm and testes. Next, 70 million raw reads were generated by RNA-seq of which 50% could be aligned with the horse reference genome. A total of 19,257 sequence tags were mapped to all horse chromosomes and the mitochondrial genome. The highest density of mapped transcripts was in gene-rich ECA11, 12 and 13, and the lowest in gene-poor ECA9 and X; 7 gene transcripts originated from ECAY. Structural annotation aligned sperm transcripts with 4,504 known horse and/or human genes, rRNAs and 82 miRNAs, whereas 13,354 sequence tags remained anonymous. The data were aligned with selected equine gene models to identify additional exons and splice variants. Gene Ontology annotations showed that sperm transcripts were associated with molecular processes (chemoattractant-activated signal transduction, ion transport) and cellular components (membranes and vesicles) related to known sperm functions at fertilization, while some messenger and micro RNAs might be critical for early development. The findings suggest that the rich repertoire of coding and non-coding RNAs in stallion sperm is not a random remnant from spermatogenesis in testes but a selectively retained and functionally coherent collection of RNAs."

Skeletal myocytes classified as type I (oxidative, slow) muscle fibers are enriched in mitochondria and exhibit a high oxidative capacity.

For full enzyme activity, ATGL requires a cofactor designated as CGI-58 (19Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G.

CGI-58 deficiency also causes NLSD, but the clinical presentations of ATGL deficiency and CGI-58 deficiency differ in some aspects as follows. (a) The development of cardiomyopathy is always present in humans (and mice) harboring mutated ATGL alleles, whereas cardiomyopathy has not been described for humans carrying mutated CGI-58 alleles (20Schweiger M.

Chem. 2010; 285: 7300-7311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and accordingly, the disease was designated as NLSD with ichthyosis, formerly named Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (23Chanarin I. Patel A. Slavin G. Wills E.J. Andrews T.M. Stewart G. Neutral-lipid storage disease. A new disorder of lipid metabolism.Br. Med. J. 1975; 1: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, muscle weakness is described in some NLSD with ichthyosis case reports. These clinical findings suggest a less prominent role for CGI-58 in muscle lipid catabolism than for ATGL. Considering the pivotal role of ATGL in adipose tissue TG mobilization and the supply of FA as oxidative fuel for CM and SM, it cannot be excluded that cardiac dysfunction in humans and mice globally lacking ATGL involve an inadequate FA delivery from the circulation. To address the role of CGI-58 in muscle energy metabolism and to exclude phenotypic changes caused by generalized metabolic derangements, we generated and characterized a mouse model lacking CGI-58 exclusively in CM and SM. The present study reveals a critical role for CGI-58 in muscle lipolysis. Besides, the lack of CGI-58 in CM caused profound cardiometabolic derangements. Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free animal facility on a regular light/dark cycle (12 h/12 h) and had ad libitum access to water and a standard chow diet (4.5% w/w fat; Ssniff, Soest, Germany). Animals were anesthetized with IsoFlo®/isoflurane (Abbott) and euthanized by cervical dislocation. The study was approved by the Austrian ethics committee and is in accordance with the council of Europe Convention. Targeted ES cells harboring a single loxP site within intron 4 of the mouse CGI-58 gene and a loxP flanked NEO cassette within intron 7 were generated as previously described (22Radner F.P. Streith I.E. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kumari M. Eichmann T.O. Rechberger G. Koefeler H.C. Eder S. Schauer S. Theussl H.C. Preiss-Landl K. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Haemmerle G.

ES cell clones showing recombination at the loxP sites of the NEO cassette were used to generate chimeric mice. Animals carrying the floxed CGI-58 allele transmitted this locus through the germ line and yielded mice heterozygous for the targeted allele. Mice heterozygous for the floxed CGI-58 allele were backcrossed six to eight times onto the C57BL/6 background before breeding the animals with transgenic mice expressing the Cre-recombinase under the control of the muscle-specific muscle creatine kinase promoter (24Brüning J.C.

Mice homozygous for the CGI-58 floxed allele (flox/flox) showed no significant differences in body weight, muscle TG levels, and plasma parameters compared with C57BL/6 wild type mice (data not shown) and were used as controls. Mice homozygous for the floxed CGI-58 allele and heterozygous for the muscle-specific muscle creatine kinase-Cre transgene were used for the generation of muscle-specific CGI-58-deficient (CGI-58KOM) mice. Determination of tissue neutral TG hydrolytic activity in the absence and presence of recombinant GST-tagged CGI-58 was performed as previously described (16Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R.

For musculus (m.) soleus, TG hydrolytic activities were measured in at least 2 pools per genotype, each containing tissue preparations of 2–3 mice. Determination of cardiac lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolytic activity was carried out as described before (17Haemmerle G. Moustafa T. Woelkart G. Büttner S. Schmidt A. van de Weijer T. Hesselink M.

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen). For first-strand cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed at 37 °C for 2 h using random hexamer primers and the MultiScribe High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit from Applied Biosystems. Primers used for RT-quantitative PCR were designed using ABI Primer Express® and/or Primer3. Primers were designed to span exon-intron boundaries with an amplicon size of less than 150 bp and BLASTed for specificity. RT-quantitative PCR reactions (20 μl) contained 8 ng of cDNA, 10 pmol of each primer, and 10 μl of SYBR Green Master mix (Fermentas, Thermo Scientific, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and were carried out using the StepOneTR Plus real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Relative mRNA levels were quantified using the comparative ΔΔCt method, normalized to β-actin. The following primer sequences were used for RT-PCR: CGI-58 forward (5′-GGT TAA GTC TAG TGC AGC-3′) and reverse (5′-AAG CTG TCT CAC CAC TTG-3′); ATGL forward (5′-GAG ACC AAG TGG AAC ATC-3′) and reverse (5′-GTA GAT GTG AGT GGC GTT-3′); LCAD (acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, long chain) forward (5′-TTT CCG GGA GAG TGT AAG GA-3′) and reverse (5′-ACT TCT CCA GCT TTC TCC CA-3′); AOX (acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1, palmitoyl) forward (5′-GGG AGT GCT ACG GGT TAC ATG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCG ATA TCC CCA ACA GTG ATG-3′); MCAD (acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, medium chain) forward (5′-GAT GCA TCA CCC TCG TGT AAC-3′) and reverse (5′-AAG CCC TTT TCC CCT GAA-3′); PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isoenzyme 4) forward (5′-ATC TAA CAT CGC CAG AAT TAA ACC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGA ACG TAC ACA ATG TGG ATT G-3′); PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, coactivator 1α) forward (5′-CCC TGC CAT TGT TAA GAC-3′) and reverse (5′-GC TGC TGT TCC TGT TTT C-3′); CPT1b (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1β) forward (5′-GGC ACC TCT TCT GCC TTT AC-3′) and reverse (5′-TTT GGG TCA AAC ATG CAG AT-3′; LPL forward (5′-TCC AGC CAG GAT GCA ACA-3′) and reverse (5′-CCA CGT CTC CGA GTC CTC TCT-3′); CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36) forward (5′-GAA CCT ATT GAA GGC TTA CAT CC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCC AGT CAC TTG TGT TTT GAA C-3′); β-actin forward (5′-AGC CAT GTA CGT AGC CAT CCA-3′) and reverse (5′-TCT CCG GAG TCC ATC ACA ATG-3′). Tissues of non-fasted or 14 h fasted mice were homogenized in buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain,1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.0) on ice using an Ultra Turrax® (Ika GmbH, Staufen, Germany). The homogenates were centrifuged (20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min). The infranatants were collected and used for Western blot analysis. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using PVDF membranes (Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and CAPS buffer (10 mm 3-cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulfonic acid, 10% methanol) for protein transfer. Blots were probed using either a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against murine CGI-58 (kindly provided by Dr. Dawn L. Brasaemle) or specific antibodies against ATGL (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA), CGI-58 (designated as ABHD5, Abnova, Heidelberg), or GAPDH (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA). Specifically bound immunoglobulins were detected in a second reaction using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (GE Healthcare). Tissue lipids were extracted according to the method of Folch et al. (25Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipids from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue lipids were dried in a stream of nitrogen and redissolved by brief sonication in 2% Triton X-100. TG concentrations were measured using the Infinity Triglycerides Reagent (Thermo Electron Corp., Scoresby, Victoria, Australia). For tissue protein determination, the remaining protein pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (0.3 n NaOH, 0.1 m SDS), and protein content was measured subsequently using the BCA reagent (Thermo Scientific, Pierce). Muscle tissue acetyl- and acyl-CoA levels were determined by online solid phase extraction-LC-MS according to the method of Magnes et al. (26Magnes C. Suppan M. Pieber T.R. Moustafa T. Trauner M.

For the analysis of plasma parameters, non-fasted or 14 h fasted animals were briefly anesthetized, and blood samples were collected by retro-orbital puncture. Plasma levels of TG, glycerol, free FAs, and total cholesterol were determined using commercial kits (Thermo Electron Corp., Sigma; Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany; Roche Diagnostics). Blood glucose was determined using an AccuCheck® glucometer (Roche Diagnostics). Plasma insulin levels were determined with a mouse/rat insulin ELISA kit (ChrystalChem) in re-fed mice. To visualize neutral lipids, SM and hearts were instantly frozen in liquid nitrogen. After perfusion with 0.9% NaCl for removal of blood lipids, cryosections (3 μm) were stained with Sudan III (Sigma), and nuclei were stained with hematoxylin following a standard protocol. Electron microscopy was performed as previously described (17Haemmerle G. Moustafa T. Woelkart G. Büttner S. Schmidt A. van de Weijer T. Hesselink M. Jaeger D. Kienesberger P.C. Zierler K.

In brief, tissues from fasted mice were homogenized in chilled STE buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) using an Ultra Turrax® (IKA, Staufen, Germany). Homogenates were centrifuged at 420 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min to obtain a mitochondria-enriched fraction. Pellets were washed and suspended in STE buffer. After protein determination, 20 μl of the suspension was incubated with 400 μl of reaction mix (100 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, 5 mm KH2PO4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.3% BSA, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCL2, 2 mm carnitine, 0.1 mm malate, 0.05 mm CoA, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm oleic acid complexed to BSA, 0.1 μCi/reaction [14C]oleic acid) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by transferring the reaction mix in fresh tubes containing 200 μl of 1 m HClO4. For CO2 trapping, the tube caps were equipped with a piece of filter paper soaked with 20 μl of 10 n NaOH. The closed tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Afterward the filter papers were subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Mouse echocardiography (28Song Q. Schmidt A.G. Hahn H.S. Carr A.N. Frank B. Pater L. Gerst M. Young K. Hoit B.D.

Two-dimensional guided M-mode echoes were obtained from short- and long-axis views at the level of the largest left ventricular (LV) diameter using a VS-VEVO 770 high resolution imaging system (Visualsonics, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a real-time microvisualization scanhead (30 MHz). LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions were measured from original tracings by using the leading edge convention of the American Society of Echocardiography. All measurements and calculations were done in triplicate. Percent fractional shortening, ejection fraction, and LV mass were calculated as previously described (28Song Q. Schmidt A.G. Hahn H.S.

https://openalex.org/W1985253362,"Sterols are crucial lipid components that regulate membrane permeability and fluidity and are the precursors of bioactive steroids. The plant sterols exist as three major forms, free sterols, steryl glycosides and steryl esters. The storage of steryl esters in lipid droplets has been shown to contribute to cellular sterol homeostasis. To further document cellular aspects of sterol biosynthesis in plants, we addressed the question of the subcellular localization of the enzymes implicated in the final steps of the post-squalene biosynthetic pathway. In order to create a clear localization map of steroidogenic enzymes in cells, the coding regions of Δ7-sterol-C5-desaturase (STE1/DWARF7), Δ24-sterol-Δ24-reductase (DIMINUTO/DWARF1) and Δ5,7-sterol-Δ7-reductase (DWARF5) were fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines deficient in the corresponding enzymes. All fusion proteins were found to localize in the endoplasmic reticulum in functionally complemented plants. The results show that both Δ5,7-sterol-Δ7-reductase and Δ24-sterol-Δ24-reductase are in addition localized to the plasma membrane, whereas Δ7-sterol-C5-desaturase was clearly detected in lipid particles.

These sensory quanta are first processed by the cuneate nucleus before the afferent information is transmitted to brain networks serving specific perceptual and sensorimotor functions. Here we report data on the integration of primary afferent synaptic inputs obtained with in vivo whole cell patch clamp recordings from the neurons of this nucleus. We find that the synaptic integration in individual cuneate neurons is dominated by 4-8 primary afferent inputs with large synaptic weights. In a simulation we show that the arrangement with a low number of primary afferent inputs can maximize transfer over the cuneate nucleus of information encoded in the spatiotemporal patterns of spikes generated when a human fingertip contact objects. Hence, the observed distributions of synaptic weights support high fidelity transfer of signals from ensembles of tactile afferents. Various anatomical estimates suggest that a cuneate neuron may receive hundreds of primary afferents rather than 4-8. Therefore, we discuss the possibility that adaptation of synaptic weight distribution, possibly involving silent synapses, may function to maximize information transfer in somatosensory pathways."

The understanding of the contributions from each individual MMP, both in healthy and pathological events, has been complicated by the lack of specific inhibitors and the fact that some of the potent MMPs are multifunctional enzymes. These factors have also hampered the setup of therapeutic strategies targeting MMP activity. A tempting target is the membrane-associated MT1-MMP, which has well-documented importance in matrix degradation but which takes part in more than one pathway in this regard. In this report, we describe the selective targeting of a single function of this enzyme by means of a specific monoclonal antibody against MT1-MMP, raised in an MT1-MMP knock-out mouse. The antibody blocks the enzyme ability to activate proMMP-2 without interfering with the collagenolytic function or the general proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP. Using this antibody, we have shown that the MT1-MMP-catalyzed activation of proMMP-2 is involved in the outgrowth of cultured lymphatic endothelial cells in a collagen matrix in vitro, as well as in lymphatic vessel sprouting assayed ex vivo. This is the first example of the complete inactivation of a single function of a multifunctional MMP and the use of this strategy to pursue its role.

https://openalex.org/W2012449208,"AHNAK/Desmoyokin is a giant protein which has been recently linked to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, cellular migration and invasion. Here, we investigated the role of AHNAK in the pathophysiology of larynx carcinoma-one of the major subtypes of head and neck cancer. To this end, we analysed AHNAK expression in tumor tissues from 83 larynx carcinoma patients in relation to overall survival. We found that tumoral AHNAK overexpression significantly associated with poor survival of these patients both in univariate and multivariate analysis. In further studies, we combined the prognostic value of AHNAK with selected markers of inflammation, such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (CD66b-positive cells). Both MIF and neutrophils have been linked to enhanced tumoral migration and poor clinical outcome in patients with orohypopharynx carcinoma-another major subtype of head and neck cancer. Interestingly, we found that synchronous high levels of AHNAK and MIF or AHNAK and neutrophils, respectively, were stronger predictors of poor survival than AHNAK alone. Synchronous high levels of all three markers were the strongest predictors of poor survival in our patient cohort. Taken together, our findings propose novel strategies for an accurate prognosis in larynx carcinoma and suggest potential mechanisms of inflammation-mediated tumor progression."

In mammals there are two main α subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-2α, and one β subunit (HIF-1β, also known as the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator). The protein stability of the α subunit is regulated in an oxygen-dependent manner. Under normoxic conditions, PHD constitutively hydroxylates HIF-α on specific prolyl residues. In the case of HIF-1α, the primary site of hydroxylation is Pro-564 (4Ivan M. Haberberger T. Gervasi D.C. Michelson K.S. Günzler V. Kondo K. Yang H. Sorokina I. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W.

Med. 2008; 359: 2685-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Moreover, PHD2 haplotypes are associated with high altitude adaptation in Tibetans (18Simonson T.S. Yang Y. Huff C.D. Yun H.

Biol. 2011; 12: 101-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). PHD2 is distinctive among the three PHDs in that it harbors at its N terminus a domain that is predicted to be a zinc finger of the Myeloid Nervy and DEAF-1 (MYND) type (20Taylor M.S. Characterization and comparative analysis of the EGLN gene family.Gene. 2001; 275: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The PHD:HIF:VHL pathway shows broad conservation in animals (21Loenarz C. Coleman M.L. Boleininger A. Schierwater B. Holland P.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor pathway regulates oxygen sensing in the simplest animal, Trichoplax adhaerens.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 22Rytkönen K.T. Williams T.A. Renshaw G.M. Primmer C.R. Nikinmaa M. Molecular evolution of the metazoan PHD-HIF oxygen-sensing system.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2011; 28: 1913-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and experiments demonstrate that it is functional in the simplest metazoan, Trichoplax adhaerens (21Loenarz C. Coleman M.L. Boleininger A. Schierwater B. Holland P.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor pathway regulates oxygen sensing in the simplest animal, Trichoplax adhaerens.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). T. adhaerens contains single isoforms for PHD, HIF-α, and VHL, and intriguingly, its PHD contains a MYND-type zinc finger homologous to that seen in mammalian PHD2. These observations indicate that prolyl hydroxylation is an ancient mechanism to transduce changes in oxygen concentration to changes in cellular function and furthermore suggest that mammalian PHD2 is the isoform most closely related to the single ancestral PHD. The HSP90 pathway is an even more ancient pathway, showing conservation in bacteria (23Taipale M. Jarosz D.F. Lindquist S. HSP90 at the hub of protein homeostasis. Emerging mechanistic insights.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). It is centered around the HSP90 chaperone protein. Although it was originally identified as a pathway that is heat-inducible and that promotes protein folding, it is clear that it plays a central role in the maturation of a multitude of client proteins, particularly ones involved in signal transduction and transcription. Indeed, HIF-1α is a client of the HSP90 pathway (24Isaacs J.S. Jung Y.J. Mimnaugh E.G. Martinez A. Cuttitta F. Neckers L.M. Hsp90 regulates a von Hippel Lindau-independent hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α-degradative pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29936-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). A salient feature of the HSP90 pathway is that it employs a set of co-chaperones that regulate the activity of HSP90 and can interact with client proteins (25Echtenkamp F.J. Freeman B.C. Expanding the cellular molecular chaperone network through the ubiquitous cochaperones.Biochimica et biophysica acta. 2012; 1823: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Li J. Soroka J. Buchner J. The Hsp90 chaperone machinery. Conformational dynamics and regulation by co-chaperones.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 624-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These co-chaperones show varying degrees of conservation in evolution (27Johnson J.L. Brown C. Plasticity of the Hsp90 chaperone machine in divergent eukaryotic organisms.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2009; 14: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As one example, the co-chaperone p23, which binds to HSP90 in an ATP-dependent manner and stabilizes a closed conformation of HSP90, shows extensive conservation. It is present, for example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The conservation of various HSP90 co-chaperones raises interesting questions as to the selective pressures that have maintained them in evolution. The PHDs site-specifically hydroxylate HIF-α on prolyl residues that occur in an LXXLAP motif (where X = any amino acid). In vitro experiments demonstrate that HIF-1α peptides as short as 19 amino acids in length that contain this motif are sufficient to allow for site-specific hydroxylation and subsequent recognition by VHL (5Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. von Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J.

Although the data imply that the core machinery of the pathway consists of PHD, HIF, and VHL, the extent to which it is integrated with other cellular pathways remains poorly understood. In the present report we identify a direct interaction between the MYND-type zinc finger of PHD2 and a peptide motif in select co-chaperones of the HSP90 pathway, including p23. We provide evidence for the functional importance of this interaction in promoting efficient HIF-α degradation. Taken together, the data establish a link between oxygen-sensing and the HSP90 pathway and suggest that this link emerged early in the evolution of metazoans. pcDNA5/FRT/TO-FLAG-PHD2 was constructed by subcloning the 1.5-kb HindIII/SphI fragment of pcDNA3-FLAG-PHD2 (30Huang J.

https://openalex.org/W2064980525,"Clustering analysis has a growing role in the study of co-expressed genes for gene discovery. Conventional binary and fuzzy clustering do not embrace the biological reality that some genes may be irrelevant for a problem and not be assigned to a cluster, while other genes may participate in several biological functions and should simultaneously belong to multiple clusters. Also, these algorithms cannot generate tight clusters that focus on their cores or wide clusters that overlap and contain all possibly relevant genes. In this paper, a new clustering paradigm is proposed. In this paradigm, all three eventualities of a gene being exclusively assigned to a single cluster, being assigned to multiple clusters, and being not assigned to any cluster are possible. These possibilities are realised through the primary novelty of the introduction of tunable binarization techniques. Results from multiple clustering experiments are aggregated to generate one fuzzy consensus partition matrix (CoPaM), which is then binarized to obtain the final binary partitions. This is referred to as Binarization of Consensus Partition Matrices (Bi-CoPaM). The method has been tested with a set of synthetic datasets and a set of five real yeast cell-cycle datasets. The results demonstrate its validity in generating relevant tight, wide, and complementary clusters that can meet requirements of different gene discovery studies."

https://openalex.org/W1997466140,"In the present paper we explored the capacity of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as host for heterologous expression of human Aquaporin-1. Aquaporin-1 cDNA was expressed from a galactose inducible promoter situated on a plasmid with an adjustable copy number. Human Aquaporin-1 was C-terminally tagged with yeast enhanced GFP for quantification of functional expression, determination of sub-cellular localization, estimation of in vivo folding efficiency and establishment of a purification protocol. Aquaporin-1 was found to constitute 8.5 percent of total membrane protein content after expression at 15°C in a yeast host over-producing the Gal4p transcriptional activator and growth in amino acid supplemented minimal medium. In-gel fluorescence combined with western blotting showed that low accumulation of correctly folded recombinant Aquaporin-1 at 30°C was due to in vivo mal-folding. Reduction of the expression temperature to 15°C almost completely prevented Aquaporin-1 mal-folding. Bioimaging of live yeast cells revealed that recombinant Aquaporin-1 accumulated in the yeast plasma membrane. A detergent screen for solubilization revealed that CYMAL-5 was superior in solubilizing recombinant Aquaporin-1 and generated a monodisperse protein preparation. A single Ni-affinity chromatography step was used to obtain almost pure Aquaporin-1. Recombinant Aquaporin-1 produced in S. cerevisiae was not N-glycosylated in contrast to the protein found in human erythrocytes."

Before, and 1, 3, and 6 months after, and 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery, we assessed the safety, efficacy, predictability, stability, and adverse events of the surgery in eyes undergoing toric ICL implantation.The logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (LogMAR) uncorrected visual acuity and LogMAR best spectacle-corrected visual acuity were -0.10 (corresponding to Snellen equivalents 20/16) ± 0.16 and -0.20 (corresponding to 20/12.5) ± 0.07, 3 years postoperatively, respectively. The safety and efficacy indices were 1.16 ± 0.20 and 0.94 ± 0.28. At 3 year, 82% and 98% of the eyes were within 0.5 and 1.0 D, respectively, of the targeted correction. Manifest refraction changes of -0.15 ± 0.31 D occurred from 1 month to 3 year. No vision-threatening complications occurred during the observation period.On the basis of the clinical results of this study, toric ICL implantation was good in all measures of safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability for the correction of moderate to high myopic astigmatism throughout a 3-year observation period."
https://openalex.org/W2016635407,"Calorie restriction (CR) is an intervention known to extend the lifespan of a wide variety of organisms. In S. cerevisiae, chronological lifespan is prolonged by decreasing glucose availability in the culture media, a model for CR. The mechanism has been proposed to involve an increase in the oxidative (versus fermentative) metabolism of glucose. Here, we measured wild-type and respiratory incompetent (ρ0) S. cerevisiae biomass formation, pH, oxygen and glucose consumption, and the evolution of ethanol, glycerol, acetate, pyruvate and succinate levels during the course of 28 days of chronological aging, aiming to identify metabolic changes responsible for the effects of CR. The concomitant and quantitative measurements allowed for calculations of conversion factors between different pairs of substrates and products, maximum specific substrate consumption and product formation rates and maximum specific growth rates. Interestingly, we found that the limitation of glucose availability in CR S. cerevisiae cultures hysteretically increases oxygen consumption rates many hours after the complete exhaustion of glucose from the media. Surprisingly, glucose-to-ethanol conversion and cellular growth supported by glucose were not quantitatively altered by CR. Instead, we found that CR primed the cells for earlier, faster and more efficient metabolism of respiratory substrates, especially ethanol. Since lifespan-enhancing effects of CR are absent in respiratory incompetent ρ0 cells, we propose that the hysteretic effect of glucose limitation on oxidative metabolism is central toward chronological lifespan extension by CR in this yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2026686692,"Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is an important negative regulator of T cell immune responses via interactions with PD-1 and CD80. However, PD-L1 can also act as a positive costimulator, but the relevant counterreceptor is not known. We analyzed the role of PD-L1 in CD8-T cell responses to infection with Listeria monocytogenes (LM) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). PD-L1 blockade impaired antigen-specific CD8 effector T cell expansion in response to LM, but not to VSV infection, particularly limiting short-lived effector cell differentiation. Simultaneous CD4-T cell depletion and anti-PD-L1 blockade revealed that PD-L1 provided costimulation even in the absence of CD4-T cells. Most importantly, specific blockade of PD-L1 binding to CD80 or to PD-1 did not recapitulate PDL-1 blockade. The results suggested that PD-L1 plays an important costimulatory role for antigen-specific CD8 T cells during LM infection perhaps through a distinct receptor or interaction epitope."

When overexpressed, v3 associates with membranes and triggers formation of filopodia. Here we found that membrane targeting of v3 is mediated by myristoylation and palmitoylation of its N-terminal MGC motif, through which v3 specifically targets membrane rafts. This was suggested by its localization in cholera toxin subunit B-stained membrane areas and also shown using lipid fractionation experiments. Utilizing site-directed mutant variants, we also found that v3-mediated generation of filopodia is independent of the Cys residues in its redox active site, but dependent upon its membrane raft targeting.

https://openalex.org/W2092253488,"After a tightly regulated developmental program in the thymus, ""mature"" single positive (SP) thymocytes leave the thymus and enter the periphery. These newly arrived recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) are phenotypically and functionally immature, and will complete a dynamic maturation in the peripheral lymphoid organs before being licensed to be resident naïve T cells. To study the early events occurring in the RTE maturation process, we identified the phenotype of CD4(+) pre-RTEs, a population of CD4(+) SP thymocytes that have acquired the thymus egress capability. Compared to peripheral naïve T cells, CD4(+) pre-RTEs displayed superior survival capability in lymphoreplete mice and faster proliferation under lymphopenic condition. The differences in Bcl2/Bim expression and/or heightened IL-7 signaling pathway may account for the pre-RTEs' better responsiveness to homeostatic signals. Qa2, the expression of which indicates the phenotypic maturation of SPs and RTEs, was found to be upregulated in CD4(+) pre-RTEs in thymic perivascular space. Migratory dendritic cells that surround this region contribute to Qa2 expression in pre-RTEs. The dendritic cell-driven Qa2 induction of CD4(+) pre-RTEs is independent of MHC class II and Aire molecules."

Transverse tubular (T-tubular) vacuolations occur in patients having statin-associated myopathy and, to a lesser extent, in statin-treated patients without myopathy. We have investigated quantitative changes in T-tubular morphology and looked for early indicators of T-tubular membrane repair in skeletal muscle biopsy samples from patients receiving cholesterol-lowering therapy who do not have myopathic side effects. Gene expression and protein levels of incipient membrane repair proteins were monitored in patients who tolerated statin treatment without myopathy and in statin-naive subjects. In addition, morphometry of the T-tubular system was performed. Only the gene expression for annexin A1 was up-regulated, whereas the expression of other repair genes remained unchanged. However, annexin A1 and dysferlin protein levels were significantly increased. In statin-treated patients, the volume fraction of the T-tubular system was significantly increased, but the volume fraction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum remained unchanged. A complex surface structure in combination with high mechanical loads makes skeletal muscle plasma membranes susceptible to injury.

Each Kv channel subunit consists of six transmembrane helices, the linker sequences that connect them, and N- and C-terminal modulatory domains. Helices S1 through S4 constitute the VSD, and helices S5, S6, and the intervening re-entrant pore loop make up the PD. The VSD response to changes in membrane potential originates from the S4 helix, which contains four to seven positive amino acids (depending on the channel type) and translocates through the changing electric field of the membrane to drive the opening and closing of the channel (9DeCaen P.G.

Physiol. 2012; 140: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) support a “sliding helix” model of Kv activation. The predominant feature of this model is a significant translation and rotation of the S4 helix relative to the rest of the VSD. The movement of S4 is constrained by and acts on the rest of the channel by non-covalent interactions with adjacent helices in the VSD and by covalent interactions with the extracellular loop that links the S3 and S4 helices as well as the intracellular loop that links the S4 and S5 helices. Thus, when the force on the S4 helix changes with membrane potential, the overall conformation of the channel protein changes. The sum of these energetic interactions within the protein and between the protein and the lipid bilayer is ultimately responsible for setting the V50 of the channel, the voltage at which half of the channels are in an open state and half are in a closed state. Although there is a growing consensus regarding the structure of Kv channels in the open and closed states, the mechanisms by which voltage sensitivity is modulated remain unclear. Even within the same subfamily, V50 can vary widely between Kv channels. In the Kv1 group, for example, published V50 values range from −46 mV in a lobster channel (20Kim M. Baro D.J. Lanning C.C. Doshi M. Farnham J. Moskowitz H.S. Peck J.H. Olivera B.M. Harris-Warrick R.M. Alternative splicing in the pore-forming region of shaker potassium channels.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to +22 mV in a jellyfish channel (21Jegla T. Grigoriev N. Gallin W.J. Salkoff L. Spencer A.N. Multiple Shaker potassium channels in a primitive metazoan.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7989-7999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 share 80% sequence identity and yet differ in voltage sensitivity by 25 mV, with V50 values of −30 mV and −5 mV, respectively (22Ramaswami M. Gautam M. Kamb A. Rudy B. Tanouye M.A. Mathew M.K. Human potassium channel genes: molecular cloning and functional expression.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1990; 1: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These differences in V50 despite sequence conservation indicate that precise control of V50 ultimately resides in the more variable, and generally less studied, regions such as interhelical loops. Besides the membrane lipid head groups (23Schmidt D. Jiang Q.X. MacKinnon R.

In a cnidarian Kv1 channel, the role of one of the S2 acidic residues in setting the V50 can be modified by the constraints of a short S3/S4 loop (27Klassen T.L. O'Mara M.L. Redstone M. Spencer A.N. Gallin W.J. Non-linear intramolecular interactions and voltage sensitivity of a KV1 family potassium channel from Polyorchis penicillatus (Eschscholtz 1829).J. Exp. Biol. 2008; 211: 3442-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Sequential truncation of the S3/S4 loop in the Shaker channel also changes voltage sensitivity and gating kinetics (28Gonzalez C. Rosenman E. Bezanilla F. Alvarez O. Latorre R. Modulation of the Shaker K(+) channel gating kinetics by the S3-S4 linker.J. Gen.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9617-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); however, this simple reduction of the wild type loop length could have several confounding effects that cannot be distinguished in a single truncation mutagenesis series. In this study, we have varied both the length and composition of the S3/S4 loop in the Kv1.2 channel to evaluate their contributions to the overall voltage sensitivity of the channel. The experimental results from the mutant channels were combined with molecular dynamics simulations of the same loops constrained by models of open and closed states of the channel. We found that both the length and the composition of the loop are responsible for an energetic constraint on the transition between the opened and closed states. We conclude that the highly variable range of lengths and compositions of S3/S4 linkers found in nature is one factor in the quantitative evolution of voltage sensitivity in the Kv1 family of voltage-gated cation channels. Full-length mouse Kv1.2 was purchased (OpenBiosystems, Huntsville, AL) and subcloned into the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression vector pXT7 (30Dominguez I. Itoh K. Sokol S.Y.

U.S.A. 1995; 92: 8498-8502Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar); note that mouse and rat Kv1.2 have identical amino acid sequences. To create loop variants, two opposing BbsI sites were introduced into the S3/S4 loop by overlapping PCR mutagenesis to create a construction vector. Annealed oligonucleotides with the correct sequence and overhangs were ligated into the BbsI-digested Kv1.2 vector. Sequences of all plasmids were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Plasmids were linearized with XbaI (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) for in vitro mRNA transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX). Injection volumes of the in vitro-transcribed mRNA were optimized to produce between 4 and 18 μA maximal current, as currents larger than ∼20 μA cause local distortions in membrane potential (31Baumgartner W.

During experiments, oocytes were bathed in a solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl 2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid to block native chloride currents (34Miledi R. Parker I. Chloride current induced by injection of calcium into Xenopus oocytes.J. Physiol. 1984; 357: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), pH 7.4. Ionic currents were recorded 24–48 h post-injection from X. laevis oocytes at room temperature using two-electrode voltage clamp as described previously (35Sand R.M. Atherton D.M. Spencer A.N.

Traces were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz with P/4 leak subtraction. Cells were held at a potential of −90 mV and test pulses were 50-ms in duration. Conductance was derived from tail current amplitudes fitted with double exponential decay functions. Individual G-V curves were normalized and fitted to a Boltzmann equation of the form (36Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F.

G/Gmax=1/(1+exp((Vm-V50)/b)4)(Eq. 1) The V50 in this equation is of one subunit; channel V50 values were calculated by solving for Vm when G/Gmax = 0.5. Data were collected and analyzed using pClamp (version 9; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and SigmaPlot (version 12; Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA). The open state models for rat Kv1.2 are based on the Protein Data Bank code 3LUT refinement (37Chen X. Wang Q. Ni F. Ma J. Structure of the full-length Shaker potassium channel Kv1.2 by normal-mode-based x-ray crystallographic refinement.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Crystal structure of a mammalian voltage-dependent Shaker family K+ channel.Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). The closed state models are based a structure inferred by Jensen et al. (16Jensen M.Ø. Jogini V. Borhani D.W. Leffler A.E. Dror R.O. Shaw D.E. Mechanism of voltage gating in potassium channels.Science. 2012; 336: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), based on the structure of a Kv1.2/Kv2.1 chimera; the Kv2.1 segment from that chimera was replaced with the homologous Kv1.2 sequence using SWISS-MODEL (38Bordoli L. Kiefer F. Arnold K. Benkert P. Battey J. Schwede T. Protein structure homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL workspace.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). The structures of the various sequence variants were obtained by using SWISS-MODEL for homology modeling and PyMOL (39DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2010Google Scholar) for simple mutagenesis; as such, these models should be considered as heuristic. Peptide structures were constructed in Protein Data Bank format using PyMOL (39DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2010Google Scholar), with the N terminus capped with an acetyl group and the C terminus capped with an amine group. Protein Data Bank files were processed using the GROMACS suite of programs (40Hess B. Kutzner C. van der Spoel D. Lindahl E. GROMACS 4: Algorithms for highly efficient, load-balanced, and scalable molecular simulation.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2008; 4: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (12348) Google Scholar), using the AMBER99-SB force field to produce a peptide in an aqueous environment with a NaCl concentration of 96 mm. An initial ensemble of conformations was generated by performing simulation under constant pressure and temperature (NPT) conditions (after appropriate pre-equilibration) for 100 ns. 10 conformations at 10-ns intervals were then selected and used as starting points for independent free energy simulations. For free energy calculations, each selected conformation was reprocessed into an aqueous environment with NaCl concentration of 96 mm, energy minimized, equilibrated under a constant volume and temperature regime followed by an NPT regime, and simulated under NPT conditions for 2 ns under an end-to-end distance constraint ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 nm in 20 equal increments, collecting data necessary for free energy calculations. The results of the simulations were processed to obtain estimates of the free energy differences between adjacent distance increments using the Bennett Acceptance Ratio (41Bennett C.H. Efficient Estimation of Free-Energy Differences from Monte-Carlo Data.J. Comput. Phys. 1976; 22: 245-268Crossref Scopus (2008) Google Scholar) as implemented in the g_bar program from the GROMACS suite. The structure of the S3 and S4 helices in the closed (Fig. 1A) (16Jensen M.Ø. Jogini V. Borhani D.W. Leffler A.E. Dror R.O. Shaw D.E. Mechanism of voltage gating in potassium channels.Science. 2012; 336: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and open (Fig. 1B) (37Chen X. Wang Q. Ni F. Ma J. Structure of the full-length Shaker potassium channel Kv1.2 by normal-mode-based x-ray crystallographic refinement.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11352-11357Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) state models show that the extracellular ends of the helices are translocated away from each other during channel closing. We wanted to determine whether the distance between the ends of the helices, and therefore the length of the linker, was the only constraint on the Gibbs free energy of activation (ΔGopen) or if the loop was interacting with the rest of the channel to modulate V50. We prepared 39 mutants of the mouse Kv1.2 channel (accession no. NM_008417), which is identical in amino acid sequence to the rat Kv1.2 channel (hereafter we will refer to this as a rat channel for consistency with other published results using the same amino acid sequence). Fig. 1C illustrates the mutagenesis where the 13 amino acids from the middle of the 18-amino-acid-long S3/S4 loop were replaced with the following: (i) homoloops, homopolymers of glutamate (Glu), glycine (Gly), and serine (Ser) ranging in length from 2 to 10 amino acids (except for Gly, where G9 was the longest loop); (ii) heteroloops, E7, G7, and S7 loops combined with three C-terminal residues consisting of E3, G3, S3, or glutamine-glutamine-alanine (QQA, the wild type C-terminal three amino acids) in all combinations; (iii) WT/endloops - wild type Kv1.2 linker with the C-terminal QQA replaced with E3, G3, or S3; or (iv) TEVloop, with a sequence that contained the target site for TEV protease. The mutants expressed in X. laevis oocytes all mediated delayed rectifier currents, with distinct V50 values and rates of activation and deactivation. The Gibbs free energy of activation (ΔGopen) of an intact channel can be decomposed into the free energy of the conformational change in the S3/S4 loops (ΔGloops) plus the free energy of the conformational change of the rest of the channel (ΔGcore) plus an unknown interaction energy (ΔGinter) that represents the difference in non-covalent interaction energy between the loop and the rest of the channel in the open and closed states. ΔGopen=ΔGcore+ΔGloops+ΔGinter(Eq. 2) To characterize the unknown interaction energy for the various mutant constructs, we first determined ΔGcore experimentally by cleaving the S3/S4 loops with TEV protease (i.e. by making ΔGloops + ΔGinter equal to zero) and determining the V50 of this modified channel (Fig. 2A). The V50 for the TEV digested loop mutant was −7.5 ± 0.9 mV, which was significantly different from the wild type channel (−13.3 ± 1.7 mV) and from the TEV mutant channel that was not digested with the TEV enzyme (−14.7 ± 1.4 mV) (Fig. 2A). The free energy of opening was calculated as shown in Equation 3, ΔGopen=13V50F(Eq. 3) where F is Faraday's constant and 13 represents the total gating charge that translocates during channel opening in rat Kv1.2 (42Khalili-Araghi F. Jogini V. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Tajkhorshid E. Roux B. Schulten K. Calculation of the gating charge for the Kv1.2 voltage-activated potassium channel.Biophys. J. 2010; 98: 2189-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This calculation yielded a ΔGcore of −9.4 ± 1.1 kJ/mol for the TEV-digested TEVloop mutant. Subtraction of ΔGcore from the ΔGopen of the wild type channel yields a net difference on ΔG of −7.3 ± 2.5 kJ/mol (Table 1), implying that each of the four wild type loops in the Kv1.2 channel stabilizes the open state to the extent of ∼1.8 ± 0.6 kJ/mol.TABLE 1ΔG values for mutant channelsLoopnV50S.E.ΔGloops + ΔGinterS.E.ΔGloopsS.E.ΔGinterS.E.TEV uncut9−14.71.4−9.02.1−9.12.10.13.0WT8−13.31.8−7.32.53.91.1−11.22.8G211422.762.13.6−19.71.381.73.8G37−15.21.5−9.72.2−12.10.92.52.4G48−23.81.2−20.41.9−1.00.5−19.52.0G59−13.91.5−8.02.2−4.20.9−3.92.4G69−10.71.3−4.02.0−2.80.4−1.22.0G79−10.71.2−4.01.9−0.70.6−3.32.0G89−9.61.2−2.61.9−1.30.3−1.31.9G99−9.20.8−2.11.5−1.20.6−1.01.6S2942.97.463.29.4−27.41.990.69.5S38−3.31.55.32.2−35.61.540.92.7S411−22.51.1−18.81.8−11.71.9−7.12.6S511−16.11.7−10.82.4−14.41.23.62.7S69−7.71.4−0.32.1−9.31.29.12.4S79−14.32.7−8.53.61.90.8−10.43.7S89−14.62.7−8.93.68.80.5−17.73.6S99−14.21.9−8.42.6−8.21.0−0.22.8S1010−13.72.1−7.82.91.90.8−9.73.0E21229.11.545.92.2−25.22.671.13.4E39−1.61.47.42.1−24.92.132.32.9E48−9.21.5−2.12.28.81.7−10.92.8E57−13.91.5−8.02.29.21.5−17.22.7E69−19.82−15.42.813.80.7−29.22.8E79−22.11.2−18.31.919.21.1−37.52.2E89−28.52.1−26.32.820.90.8−47.33.0E95−28.31.8−26.12.520.60.9−46.62.7E107−28.31.5−26.12.220.60.6−46.72.3WT-G39−16.41.6−11.22.35.70.6−16.82.4WT-S311−21.61.1−17.71.812.50.5−30.21.9WT-E39−22.90.6−19.31.4−2.81.6−16.62.1G7-QQA101.81.211.71.9−8.01.019.72.1G7-S39−13.61.6−7.72.3−6.20.8−1.52.4G7-E310−19.90.9−15.61.61.90.7−17.51.7E7-QQA10−23.31.4−19.82.120.90.5−40.72.2E7-G38−24.51.7−21.32.416.70.5−38.02.5E7-S3NDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDS-7-QQA100.11.29.51.92.11.07.42.1S7-G312−12.90.9−6.81.6−2.30.8−4.41.8S-7-E39−17.31−12.31.7−2.01.2−10.32.1 Open table in a new tab Changing the length and character of the S3/S4 loop shifted the midpoint of steady-state activation left or right on the voltage axis but did not greatly affect the slope in the linear portion of the sigmoid curve (Fig. 2, B–F). The effects of loop length and composition on V50 were pronounced among the homoloop mutants (Fig. 2, B–D). Loops with inserts consisting of only two residues (E2, G2, and S2) had extremely positive V50 values, showing shifts of approximately +40 to +55 mV compared with wild type. As the loop inserts were lengthened V50 values for all homoloop channels became more negative, approaching and sometimes becoming more hyperpolarized than that of the wild type channel. Glutamate loops produced the most negatively shifted V50 values; E6 through E10 had significantly more negative V50 values (−19 ± 2 mV for E6 and −28.3 ± 1.5 mV for E10) than wild type Kv1.2 (−13.3 ± 1.8 mV). Interestingly, G4 and S4 also manifested significantly hyperpolarized V50 values compared with wild type, approximately −24 and −22 mV, respectively. Because current models of the closing process involve the S4 helix moving a substantial distance in the intracellular direction relative to the rest of the VSD, thus pulling the C terminus of the S3/S4 loop into the extracellular vestibule of the VSD, we also constructed loop mutants in which the last three residues of the loops were swapped between all of E10, G10, S10, and wild type, to test whether changing the C-terminal end of the loop would alter ΔGopen by virtue of being pulled into a position in which it would directly interact with other VSD residues. The relative effects of varying just the C-terminal three amino acids in the loop insert on the conductance-voltage curve are shown in Fig. 2, E and F. Clearly, the composition of the C-terminal segment of the loop sequence has a significant effect on the channel V50 and thus the energy difference between open and closed states. Overall, the loop variants produced ΔGopen values ranging from −35.7 kJ/mol in E8 channels to +53.8 kJ/mol in S2 channels (Table 1). Subtracting ΔGcore from ΔGopen produced values ranging from −26.3 to +63.2 kJ/mol per channel. Thus, replacing each wild type S3/S4 linker with eight glutamate residues stabilized the open state by ∼6.5 kJ/mol/loop, while replacing it with two serine residues destabilized the open state by ∼15.8 kJ/mol/loop. Recalling Equation 2, these energies represent the sum of ΔGloop and ΔGinter. To find ΔGinter, we estimated ΔGloop through molecular dynamics simulations. The first step in estimating ΔGloop was to simulate untethered individual loop peptides in water and determine the Gibbs free energy as a function of loop end-to-end distance (Fig. 3). We then assumed the closed (2.02 nm) and open (1.37 nm) state distances predicted by recent models (Fig. 1, A and B) and found the free energy difference between those points on each curve. This difference represented ΔGloop in all subsequent energetic calculations. In addition, each curve had a single minimum corresponding to the most energetically favored end-to"

The safety of these therapies in combination with conventional anti-cancer therapies, including radiation therapy, can be studied in animal models. The effects of partial depletion of regulatory T (Treg) cells with an anti-CD25 antibody in conjunction with ionizing radiation on inflammation and tissue injury were analyzed in C57BL/6 mice. An anti-CD25 antibody (PC61) was administered 3 days prior to 13 Gy lower-half hemi-body irradiation (HBI). The blood, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) and inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs) were harvested at various times thereafter. Alterations in the proportion of leukocyte subsets including CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, Treg cells, B cells, NK cells, NK1.1(+) T cells, macrophages and granulocytes were analyzed by FACS. The lungs, liver, pancreas, stomach, jejunum, duodenum, ileum, colon and kidney were harvested and studied by H&E staining. Expression of inflammatory mediators in plasma and tissue were investigated by ELISA. HBI significantly decreased the leukocyte pool though the various leukocyte subsets had different sensitivities to HBI. The administration of PC61 significantly decreased the proportion of Treg cells in spleen, iLN, mLN and blood (reduction of approximately 60%). Irradiation significantly increased the proportion of Treg cells in the spleen, iLN and mLN. HBI induced a systemic inflammatory reaction as demonstrated by increased plasma levels of IL-6, KC/CXCL1 and circulating granulocytes in the blood. Neutrophils also infiltrated the small bowel. The same general patterns were observed whether or not Treg cells were partially depleted with PC61 prior to HBI. These data demonstrate that partial depletion of Treg cells in these mice does not influence HBI-induced inflammatory response and tissue injury, and that combining anti-CD25 therapy with radiation may be safe and well tolerated in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2071350425,"Dietary DNA is degraded into shorter DNA-fragments and single nucleosides in the gastrointestinal tract. Dietary DNA is mainly taken up as single nucleosides and bases, but even dietary DNA-fragments of up to a few hundred bp are able to cross the intestinal barrier and enter the blood stream. The molecular mechanisms behind transport of DNA-fragments across the intestine and the effects of this transport on the organism are currently unknown. Here we investigate the transport of DNA-fragments across the intestinal barrier, focusing on transport mechanisms and rates. The human intestinal epithelial cell line CaCo-2 was used as a model. As DNA material a PCR-fragment of 633 bp was used and quantitative real time PCR was used as detection method. DNA-fragments were found to be transported across polarized CaCo-2 cells in the apical to basolateral direction (AB). After 90 min the difference in directionality AB vs. BA was >103 fold. Even undegraded DNA-fragments of 633 bp could be detected in the basolateral receiver compartment at this time point. Transport of DNA-fragments was sensitive to low temperature and inhibition of endosomal acidification. DNA-transport across CaCo-2 cells was not competed out with oligodeoxynucleotides, fucoidan, heparin, heparan sulphate and dextrane sulphate, while linearized plasmid DNA, on the other hand, reduced transcytosis of DNA-fragments by a factor of approximately 2. Our findings therefore suggest that vesicular transport is mediating transcytosis of dietary DNA-fragments across intestinal cells and that DNA binding proteins are involved in this process. If we extrapolate our findings to in vivo conditions it could be hypothesized that this transport mechanism has a function in the immune system."

Elastase perfusion to induce AAA formation in A2AR-knockout (A2ARKO) and C57BL6/J wild-type (WT) mice resulted in nearly 100% larger aneurysms in A2ARKO compared to WT at d 14 (P < 0.05), with evidence of greater elastin fragmentation, more immune cell infiltration, and increased matrix metallatoproteinase (MMP) 9 expression (P<0.05). Separately, exogenous A2AR antagonism in elastase-perfused WT mice also resulted in larger aneurysms (P<0.05), while A2AR agonism limited aortic dilatation (P<0.05). Activated Thy-1.2+ T lymphocytes from WT mice treated in vitro with A2AR antagonist increased cytokine production, and treatment with A2AR agonist decreased cytokine production (P<0.05 for all). Primary activated CD4+ T lymphocytes from A2ARKO mice exhibited greater chemotaxis (P<0.05). A2AR antagonist increased chemotaxis of activated CD4+ cells from WT mice in vitro, and A2AR agonist reduced this effect (P<0.05). A2AR activation attenuates AAA formation partly by inhibiting immune cell recruitment and reducing elastin fragmentation. These findings support augmenting A2AR signaling as a putative target for limiting aneurysm formation.—Bhamidipati, C. M., Mehta, G. S., Moehle, C. W., Meher, A. K., Su, G., Vigneshwar, N.

Analysis at 75 d post-transplantation showed 2 of the 6 clones engrafting the intestine at 4- to 5-fold higher levels (5.03±0.089 and 5.04±0.15%, respectively) than the other clones (P<0.01), correlating with the percentage of donor-derived Musashi-1+ (12.01–14.17 vs. 1.2–3.8%; P<0.01) or leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)+ cells within the intestinal stem cell (ISC) region. Phenotypic and transcriptome analysis determined that the clones with enhanced intestinal contribution expressed high levels of Ephrin type B receptor 2 (EphB2). Intestinal explants demonstrated proliferation of the engrafted cells and ability to generate crypt-like structures in vitro still expressing EphB2. Additional transplants based on BMSC EphB2 expression demonstrated that, at 7 d post-transplant, the EphB2high BMSCs engrafted in the ISC region at levels of 2.1 ± 0.2%, while control EphB2low BMSCs engrafted at 0.3 ± 0.1% (P<0.01). Therefore we identified a marker for isolating and culturing an expandable subpopulation of BMSCs with enhanced intestinal homing and contribution to the ISC region.—Colletti, E., El Shabrawy, D., Soland, M., Yamagami, T., Mokhtari, S., Osborne, C., Schlauch, K., Zanjani, E.

https://openalex.org/W2011249532,"Yeast-based in vivo cloning is useful for cloning DNA fragments into plasmid vectors and is based on the ability of yeast to recombine the DNA fragments by homologous recombination. Although this method is efficient, it produces some by-products. We have developed an “ultra-low background DNA cloning system” on the basis of yeast-based in vivo cloning, by almost completely eliminating the generation of by-products and applying the method to commonly used Escherichia coli vectors, particularly those lacking yeast replication origins and carrying an ampicillin resistance gene (Ampr). First, we constructed a conversion cassette containing the DNA sequences in the following order: an Ampr 5′ UTR (untranslated region) and coding region, an autonomous replication sequence and a centromere sequence from yeast, a TRP1 yeast selectable marker, and an Ampr 3′ UTR. This cassette allowed conversion of the Ampr-containing vector into the yeast/E. coli shuttle vector through use of the Ampr sequence by homologous recombination. Furthermore, simultaneous transformation of the desired DNA fragment into yeast allowed cloning of this DNA fragment into the same vector. We rescued the plasmid vectors from all yeast transformants, and by-products containing the E. coli replication origin disappeared. Next, the rescued vectors were transformed into E. coli and the by-products containing the yeast replication origin disappeared. Thus, our method used yeast- and E. coli-specific “origins of replication” to eliminate the generation of by-products. Finally, we successfully cloned the DNA fragment into the vector with almost 100% efficiency."

Huxley written on 26 September 1857, Charles Darwin imagined a time to come ""though I shall not live to see it, when we shall have very fairly true genealogical trees of each great kingdom of nature"" (1). The publication of On the Origin of Species, two years later, prompted a century and a half of disagreement among zoologists proposing often wildly contradictory schemes of animal evolution. Clarity began to emerge with Field et al.'s landmark publication 25 years ago of an analysis of animal relationships based on ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences (2). The paper made zoologists realize that molecular biology could and should be applied to traditional zoological questions."
