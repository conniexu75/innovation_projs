Our own work, however, has indicated that, in addition to production of the peptide, transport of A across the microvascular endothelium (that is, the site of the blood−brain barrier) is essential in controlling A levels in the brain2, 3."

These biofunctional mimetics were therefore designated as “regenerating agents” in regard to their in vivo properties.In vitro, these biopolymers were able to protect various heparin-binding growth factors against proteolytic degradation as well as to inhibit the enzymatic activity of neutrophil elastase. In the present work, different dextran derivatives were tested for their capacity to inhibit the enzymatic activity of human plasmin. We show that dextran containing carboxymethyl, sulfate as well as benzylamide groups (RG1192 compound), was the most efficient inhibitor of plasmin amidolytic activity. The inhibition of plasmin by RG1192 can be classified as tight binding hyperbolic noncompetitive. One molecule of RG1192 bound 20 molecules of plasmin with a Ki of 2.8 × 10−8m. Analysis with an optical biosensor confirmed the high affinity of RG1192 for plasmin and revealed that this polymer equally binds plasminogen with a similar affinity (Kd = 3 × 10−8m). Competitive experiments carried out with 6-aminohexanoic acid and kringle proteolytic fragments identified the lysine-binding site domains of plasmin as the RG1192 binding sites. In addition, RG1192 blocked the generation of plasmin from Glu-plasminogen and inhibited the plasmin-mediated proteolysis of fibronectin and laminin. Data from the present in vitroinvestigation thus indicated that specific dextran derivatives can contribute to the regulation of plasmin activity by impeding the plasmin generation, as a result of their binding to plasminogen and also by directly affecting the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These biopolymers were obtained by controlled chemical substitution of dextran polymers by defined amounts of carboxymethyl, sulfate as well as hydrophobic groups such as benzylamide. As regards their in vivo properties, these biopolymers were denominated regenerating agents (RGTA).1 Our initial interpretation of the ability of these biopolymers to stimulate tissue repair was to postulate that these molecules acted as functional mimetics of heparin/heparan sulfate in terms of stabilizers, protectors, and potentiators of endogenously released heparin-binding growth factors. This hypothesis was supported by in vitroexperiments, which showed that these biopolymers protected some heparin-binding growth factors such as fibroblast growth factors and transforming growth factor β against proteolytic degradation and enhanced their bioavailability (3Meddahi A. Benoit J. Ayoub N. Sezeur A. Barritault D. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 1996; 31: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Tardieu M. Gamby C. Avramoglou T. Jozefonvicz J. Barritault D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A second interpretation of thein vivo wound healing properties of these polymers, which does not exclude the first, is that they could also act on some of the proteinases involved in tissue remodeling. This led us to report in a previous study that human neutrophil elastase was inhibited by specific dextran derivatives (7Meddahi A. Lemdjabar H. Caruelle J.P. Barritault D. Hornebeck W. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1996; 18: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Among other known proteinases involved in tissue remodeling, plasmin plays a key role, since it acts directly by hydrolyzing components of the basement membrane such as fibrin, fibronectin, and laminin and also acts indirectly by activating other enzymes such as matrix metalloproteases (8Alexander C.M. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). As regards the pivotal role of this enzyme in tissue remodeling, we have further investigated the effect of these dextran derivatives on the enzymatic activity of plasmin. We report that as for neutrophil elastase, human plasmin activity is inhibited by specific dextran derivatives that contained the aromatic residue benzylamide. Complementary studies revealed that this type of biopolymer also bind plasminogen and modulate plasmin activity in a noncompetitive manner via regulatory sites involving the lysine-binding site (LBS) domains of plasmin. The chromogenic substratesd-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (S-2251), pyro-Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA (S-2444), andd-Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA (S-2258) as well as human tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) were purchased from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden).

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig were from Diagnostic-Pasteur (Marne la Coquette, France). Immobilon P and ECL chemiluminescence were purchased from Millipore Corp. (Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France), and Superblock® blocking buffer was from Pierce. Recombinant mouse kringle 5 was prepared as described previously (10Cao Y. Chen A. An S. Ji R. Davidson D. Cao Y.

Porcine intestine heparin (H108; averageMr 12,000) with specific anticoagulant activity of 173 IU/mg was kindly provided by M. Petitou from Sanofi (France). The BIAcoreTM instrument, CM5 sensor chip, surfactant P-20, ethanolamine hydrochloride, N-hydroxysuccinimide, andN-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride were acquired from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Plasmin active site titration was determined withp-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate (Sigma) as described by Chase and Shaw (11Chase T. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Water-soluble modified dextrans were prepared from T40 dextran (average Mr 37,000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the method described by Mauzac et al. (12Mauzac M. Jozefonvicz J. Biomaterials. 1984; 5: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Compound RG1100 (Fig. 1) was synthesized from dextran T40 by carboxymethylation of OH residues with monochloroacetic acid treatment in aqueous NaOH at 50 °C, pH 10, for 20 min with constant stirring. The product was then precipitated with methanol and dried under vacuum. The presence of carboxymethyl groups was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy with the appearance of an absorption band at 1650 cm−1. Compound RG1503 (Fig. 1) was synthesized from a carboxymethylated dextran by O-sulfonation with 2 eq of chlorosulfonic acid in dry dichloromethane at room temperature for 2 h with constant stirring. The dichloromethane was eliminated by filtration, and the powdered O-sulfonated product was dissolved in water, adjusted to pH 7.3 with 3 m NaOH, ultrafiltered with a PLCGC 10 K membrane (Millipore, France), and freeze-dried. The presence of sulfate groups was indicated by infrared spectroscopy with the appearance of two absorption bands at 1250 and 1025 cm−1. Compound RG1192 (Fig. 1) was synthesized from a carboxymethylated dextran by amidation of the carboxylate residues with benzylamine followed byO-sulfonation. Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran was dissolved in H2O/EtOH, and carboxylate functions were activated withN-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline for 30 min at pH 3.5 at room temperature. 2 eq of free benzylamine were then added, and the reaction mixture was kept at room temperature overnight. The product was precipitated and washed with methanol and then dried under vacuum. The infrared spectrum confirmed the presence of benzylamide functions with the appearance of a new absorption band at 1750 cm−1, corresponding to the carbonyl bond of the amide. This derivatized carboxymethyl-benzylamide compound was thenO-sulfonated according to the above protocol. In addition, we elaborated a dextran sulfate (RG1003 compound, Fig.1) by directly substituting T40 dextran with sulfate groups according to the above O-sulfonation protocol. It is noteworthy that the conditions of O-sulfonation we used were originally described for sulfonation of aromatic hydrocarbon. It has been also reported that under the same conditions, hydroxyl groups can compete with aromatic groups to generate a mixture ofO- and C-sulfonates (13De Wit P. Woldhuis A.F. Cerfontain H. Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas. 1988; 107: 668-675Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This is illustrated during the course of the RG1192 synthesis, where total reactive groups present in its precursor form were distributed among 87 and 13% of hydroxyl and aromatic groups, respectively. To thus establish whether RG1192 contained a mixture of O- andC-sulfonates, a 1H NMR (200 MHz, D2O) spectroscopy study was undertaken. In the aromatic region spectrum, only a broad 1H peak at 7.15 ppm, assigned to the aromatic protons of unsubstituted benzylamide, was detected. As control, a C-sulfonated product was synthesized, and its analysis by 1H NMR showed two broad multiplets at 7.3 and 7.6 ppm. The absence of C-sulfonate groups was confirmed by13C NMR (75 MHz, D2O) spectrum, in which the13C signal at 142 ppm, present in theC-sulfonated product was not detected in the RG1192 product. We then concluded that as described previously for other dextran derivatives (14Maiga-Revel O. Chaubet F. Jozefonvicz J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1997; 32: 89-93Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), C-sulfonate groups were undetectable in the RG1192 compound and that O-sulfonation mainly occurred during treatment of derivatized carboxymethyl-benzylamide dextrans with chlorosulfonic acid. This dominant O-sulfonate formation may thus be explained by the higher content of OH groups (87%) as compared with aromatic groups (13%) present in the RG1192 precursor. The chemical characterization of all dextran derivatives was based on the degree of substitution (d.s.) of each individual group per glucosidic unit (Table I). Each d.s. value was determined by acidimetric titration for CH2COONa and SO3Na content and elementary analysis for CH2CONHCH2C6H5 and SO3Na content. All of these values were confirmed by1H NMR. Distribution of each group among the three reactive OH groups was also reported in Table I. Results showed that reactions of carboxymethylation and sulfonation on hydroxyl functions preferentially occurred on the C-2 position. These results are in agreement with those showing that the OH on C-2 position displayed the higher rate coefficient of dextran carboxymethylation (15Krenstsel L. Chaubet F. Rebrov A. Champion J. Ermakov I. Bittoun P. Fermandjian S. Litmanovich A. Plate N. Jozefonvicz J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1997; 33: 63-71Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The average molecular weight of each polymer (Table I) was determined by high performance size exclusion chromatography in 0.1 mNaNO3, using KB-804 and KB-805 aqueous gel filtration columns (Shodex, Japan) applied in series. The effluent was monitored with a mini Dawn light scattering detector and a RID 10 A refractometer (Touzard & Matignon, France). The flow rate was 0.7 ml/min. All of these polymers did not present any significant anticoagulant activity (less than 5 IU/mg as compared with 173 IU/mg for heparin) (6Tardieu M. Gamby C. Avramoglou T. Jozefonvicz J. Barritault D. J. Cell.

Enzymatic kinetics were monitored with a Philips PU8740 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder. The progress curves were recorded for 0.3–5 min, depending upon the reaction velocity, and less than 5% of the substrate was hydrolyzed during the rate measurement. Plasmin, trypsin, and α-chymotrypsin enzymatic activities were determined in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl at 37 °C and steady-state velocities were measured by following the release ofp-nitroaniline at 410 nm (ε = 8800m−1cm−1). Human tPA and uPA enzymatic activities were assayed in similar conditions at pH 8.8. To determine the kinetic constants kcat and Km, initial rates were measured as a function of substrate concentrations, and the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten rate equation using the GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). Thekcat and Km values for the plasmin/S-2251 system are 14 s−1 and 0.4 mm, and those for the plasmin/S-2444 system are 9 s−1 and 5.3 mm, respectively. The effect of various polymers on the different enzymatic activities was determined by reacting constant concentration of enzyme with increasing concentrations of polymers for 15 min at 37 °C and measuring the residual enzymatic activity with a synthetic substrate. For plasmin, the equilibrium dissociation constants (Ki) were measured with 8 nm of enzyme and 0.4 mm of substrate (S-2251). The Kivalues and their S.E. values were calculated by nonlinear regression using the integral equation editor of the GraphPad Prism software. For the determination of inhibitor-plasmin binding stoichiometries, 750 nm plasmin was used, and the substrate was S-2444 (0.4 mm). RG1192 polymer was labeled by reaction of its aldehydic reducing group with the hydrazide functional group of biocytin hydrazide using a modified method described by Nadkarni et al. (16Nadkarni V. Pervin A. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 mg of polymer were dissolved in 50 μl of formamide containing 50 mmbiocytin hydrazide and heat at 37 °C for 24 h. Free biocytin hydrazide and formamide were removed by gel filtration chromatography (Econo-Pac 10 DG) (Bio-Rad), and homogeneity of the labeled polymer was checked by gel permeation chromatography (TSK gel G4000 PWXL) (Tosohaas, Montgomeryville, PA). The immobilization procedure was carried out at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P-20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min according to the BIApplications handbook (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 25 μl of a mixture of 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride was injected over the surface of a carboxymethyl dextran surface sensor chip (CM5) to activate carboxyl groups. Then 50 μl of streptavidin (200 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5) was injected, followed by 25 μl of ethanolamine to block remaining active succinimide groups and a pulse of 10 mm HCl. Onto the streptavidin-immobilized surface, 10 μl of biotinylated RG1192 (1 mg/ml) was injected, followed by two pulses of 10 mm HCl to remove noncovalently attached ligand. The amount of RG1192 immobilized on the surface was 100 resonance units. Binding reactions were carried out at a flow rate of 10 μl/min at 25 °C. Various concentrations of plasmin or Glu-plasminogen in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.005% P-20 were injected over the RG1192-immobilized surface, and change in resonance signal was monitored according to time. Equal volumes of each protein were also injected over a streptavidin-immobilized surface to serve as a blank for subtraction of nonspecific binding of analyte. The sensor surfaces were regenerated with a pulse of 2 m NaCl between each injection of analyte. Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined as described in the BIAtechnology handbook (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). At steady state, the following is true,dRdt=ka×C(Rmax−Req)−kd×Req=0(Eq. 1) which may be rearranged as follows,Req=C×RmaxKd+C(Eq. 2) where Kd =kd/ka is the equilibrium dissociation constant, Req is the response value at steady state, Rmax is the maximal capacity of the sensor chip for binding analyte, and C is the molar concentration of analyte. Kd was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis by fitting the (Req, C) pairs to Equation 2 using the GraphPad Prism software. Plasmin (1.6 μm) and RG1192 (0.05–1 μm) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100 prior to the addition of 10 ng of fibronectin (0.5 nm). Following 4 h of incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.6 μm of aprotinin, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (7% (w/v) acrylamide) under reducing conditions. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred overnight at 4 °C to Immobilon-P membrane in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine. Membranes saturated with Superblock® blocking buffer were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human fibronectin Ig at a 1:1000 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.3% Superblock® blocking buffer. Antibodies were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and ECL chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Plasmin (0.8 μm) and RG1192 (0.05–2.5 μm) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100. 50 ng of laminin (2 nm) was then added and the reaction mixture was kept for additional 60 min. The reaction was stopped with 0.8 μm aprotinin, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (4–15% (w/v) acrylamide gradient) under reducing conditions. Transfer and hybridization were performed in the same way as for fibronectin, except that the first incubation was performed with polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse laminin Ig at a 1:1000 dilution. The generation of plasmin from Glu-plasminogen in the presence of RG1192 was analyzed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100 as follows. 3 μg of Glu-plasminogen (0.8 μm) was preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of RG1192 (0.05–1 μm) before the addition of uPA (20 nm). After 2 h of incubation, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% (w/v) acrylamide) under reducing conditions. Gels were then fixed and stained with Coomassie Brillant Blue R-250. Fig.2 shows the influence of increasing concentrations of various dextran derivatives obtained by sequential chemical substitutions of dextran polymers on the amidolytic activity of plasmin. Dextran substituted with carboxymethyl functions (RG1100) did not affect the activity of plasmin even for concentrations greater than 1 μm. Following O-sulfonation, the resulting derivatized polymer (RG1503) showed an inhibitory potential toward human plasmin (IC50 = 20 nm) with 70% of residual enzyme activity. This potential was, however, better than the one obtained with a dextran sulfate (RG1003), indicating a beneficial contribution of the carboxymethyl groups with respect to the antiproteinase activity of this polymer. Interestingly, when both carboxymethyl, sulfate and benzylamide groups were coupled to dextran glucosidic units (RG1192), a potent inhibitory activity of plasmin was observed. The IC50 value was 2 nm with 20% of residual enzyme activity. In contrast, heparin and heparan sulfate did not affect the activity of plasmin. Among the various dextran derivatives tested, RG1192 was the most efficient inhibitor of plasmin activity. The antiproteinase potency of this polymer was therefore investigated toward other serine proteinases such as trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, and the two human plasminogen activators, uPA and tPA (Fig.3). In the same concentration range used for plasmin, trypsin and uPA were insensitive to RG1192. α-Chymotrypsin activity was slightly affected by the presence of RG1192, whereas 70% of the tPA activity was inhibited at a saturating concentration of inhibitor. However, the inhibitory potential of RG1192 on tPA was lower than that of obtained with plasmin: IC50equal to 34 nm as compared with 2 nm for plasmin. The mechanism of the inhibition pattern of a single-substrate reaction can be schematically represented as follows, nE+nS⇄Ksn(ES)→kcatnE+nP++IIKi⇅⇅Ki′=αKiEnI+nS⇄αKs(ES)nI→βkcatEnI+nPSCHEME I where n is the number of free or substrate-bound plasmin molecules per molecule of inhibitor, Ki is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, α is a dimensionless number that affects the binding of substrate to the plasmin-inhibitor complex or that of inhibitor to enzyme-substrate complex, and β is a dimensionless factor that affects the catalytic constant kcat. Hyperbolic noncompetitive inhibition is characterized by α = 1 and 0 < β < 1. While classical inhibition does not depend upon the total enzyme concentration, tight binding inhibition does (17Bieth J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), since the concentration of the bound inhibitor [EI] is no longer negligible with respect to that of total inhibitor concentration [I]0. We therefore analyzed whether RG1192 and RG1503 behaved as tight binding inhibitors by measuring the inhibition of plasmin activity using different enzyme concentrations. The inhibition profiles obtained with RG1192 (Fig. 4) indicated tight binding inhibition, since plasmin inhibition decreased with the total enzyme concentration [E]0; IC50 = 2 and 8 nm for [E]0 = 8 and 150 nm, respectively. At high enzyme concentration that ensured pseudoirreversible binding of plasmin to inhibitor, the tight binding inhibitor titrated the enzyme (17Bieth J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Indeed, at [E]0 = 750 nm(Fig. 4, see inset), RG1192 titrated the enzyme with an equivalence point corresponding to the binding of about 20 molecules of plasmin per molecule of RG1192. Similar experiments demonstrated tight binding inhibition of plasmin by RG1503 and a 1:6 inhibitor/plasmin binding stoichiometry (data not shown). Since these two polymers behave as tight binding inhibitors, the analysis of steady-state velocities data and Kideterminations by means of the Dixon (18Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar) and/or Cornish-Bowden (19Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1974; 137: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) representation is unsuitable. We therefore used the complex steady-state rate equation (Equation 3) derived by Szedlacsek et al. (20Szedlacsek S.E. Ostafe V. Serban M. Vlad M.O. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which takes into account both the tightly binding behavior of the inhibitors and the residual enzymatic activity of the plasmin/inhibitor complexes,νiν0=ν0−ν∞2ν0(((A+n[I]0[E]0−1)2+4A)1/2+ν0+ν∞ν0−ν∞−A−n[I]0[E]0)(Eq. 3) withA=1+[S]0/Kmα+[S]0/Km×αKi[E]0(Eq. 4) andν∞=βkcat[E]0[S]0[S]0+αKm(Eq. 5) where νi/ν0 = enzyme velocity in the presence of inhibitor/enzyme velocity in the absence of inhibitor, ν∞ = limit of νi for saturating concentrations of inhibitor, and [I]0, [S]0, and [E]0 are the total concentration of inhibitor, substrate and plasmin, respectively. To calculate α and β, we measured and compared the kinetic parameters of the enzymatic reaction in the absence (kcat,Km) and in the presence (βkcat, αKm) of a saturating concentration of inhibitors. The Kivalues were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis by fitting the (νi/ν0, [I]0) pairs to Equation3, in which kcat, [S]0/Km, [E]0, α, β, and n were set as fixed parameters. The inhibition curves obtained with RG1503 (Fig.2) and RG1192 (Fig.4) have been calculated using 8 nm of plasmin, 0.4 mm of S-2251, and the best estimates ofKi. A good fit was obtained between the oretical curves and experimental data (R>0.99). Table II summarizes the parameters describing the inhibition of plasmin by RG1503 and RG1192. These two compounds behaved as tight binding hyperbolic noncompetitive inhibitors (α=1, β≠0) with Ki values in the 30 nm range for RG1192, whereas that for RG1503 is 3.7-fold higher. All measurements reported here were performed in 50mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 50mm NaCl. Increasing the ionic strength by the addition of NaCl resulted in a progressive reduction of the inhibitor potency of all dextran derivatives tested. At physiological ionic strength, only RG1192 retained an inhibitory capacity toward plasmin with 30% of residual enzymatic activity (data notshown). In these conditions, the new binding characteristics of RG1192-plasmin complex were α = 1, β=0.3, and Ki ="

Recently, the uptake through caveolae has emerged as an alternative internalization pathway, which seems to be directly related with some signal transduction pathways. However, the mechanisms, molecules, and structures regulating the transport of caveolin from the cell surface into the endocytic compartment are largely unknown. In this study, normal quiescent fibroblasts (normal rat kidney (NRK)) were used to demonstrate that epidermal growth factor causes partial redistribution of caveolin from the cell surface into a cellubrevin early endocytic compartment. Treatment of NRK cells with cytochalasin D or latrunculin A inhibits this pathway and the concomitant activation of Mek and mitotic-activated protein (MAP) kinase; however, if cells were pre-treated with filipin, cytochalasin D does not inhibit the phosphorylation of MAP kinase induced by epidermal growth factor. From these results we conclude that in NRK cells the intact actin cytoskeleton is necessary for the EGF-mediated transport of caveolin from the cell surface into the early endocytic compartment and the activation of MAP kinase pathway.

Biochemical studies revealed the complex molecular composition of caveolae (1Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). In general, the presence of caveolin, an integral membrane protein (21–24 kDa) (2Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) are the main molecular features of caveolae. According to a growing body of information, caveolae are not static invaginations in the plasma membrane; rather, they are capable of being internalized in a regulated way or under well defined conditions. Several studies have provided evidence for the internalization of different ligands through caveolae into endosomes (6Montesano R. Roth J. Robert A. Orci L. Nature. 1982; 296: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 7Tran D. Carpentier J.-L. Sawano F. Gorden P. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cytochem. 1994; 42: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) or cholesterol oxidase (13Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) showed a rapid and reversible modulation of caveolin from the cell surface. The caveolae system is now credited in having its main role in the organization and recruitment of signal transduction machinery, the transport of cholesterol, and the uptake of vitamins, toxins, and other less characterized molecules (1Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 14Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Thus, although the clathrin-coated pit/vesicle system is still the best known entrance into cells (15Orlandi P.A. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) and may be considered a default system for degradation, recycling, and to some extent, receptor-mediated transcytosis (in polarized epithelial cells), for a number of cell types there is now evidence that uptake of fluid phase and membrane-bound markers also occurs from non-clathrin-coated areas of the membrane. In fact, there is evidence that there may be more than one endocytic mechanism with independent operation and regulation (16Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar,17Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Since recent data suggest that signal transduction pathways also play a crucial role in the regulation of protein and membrane trafficking, we have addressed the question of the regulation of signal transduction from the caveolae into the endocytic compartment in normal quiescent fibroblasts. In general, the binding of growth factors to their cognate plasma membrane receptor initiates a kinase cascade that results in the activation of MAP1 kinase. A key intermediate in this cascade is the GTP-binding protein Ras, which appears to control the recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane after EGF binding. At the plasma membrane, Raf-1 is activated and becomes available to phosphorylate Mek, the next kinase in the cascade. Recently, we showed that endosomes isolated from quiescent rat liver contain a basal activity of Raf-1 and Mek restricted to the early/sorting endocytic compartment (18Pol A. Calvo M. Enrich C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and also that these early endocytic structures were highly enriched with cellubrevin, a protein of the v-SNARE (vesicle-associated SNAP receptor) family (19Calvo M. Pol A. Lu A. Ortega D. Pons M. Blasi J. Enrich C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7910-7917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate by confocal microscopy and biochemical procedures that the treatment with EGF triggers the recruitment of caveolin from the cell surface into the endocytic compartment. In normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, the integrity of caveolae at the plasma membrane and the intact actin cytoskeleton seem to be crucial requirements for caveolin recruitment into the early, cellubrevin-positive, endocytic compartment and activation of MAP kinase. Cell culture media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.; fluorescently conjugated antibodies were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-cellubrevin antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Joan Blasi, (University of Barcelona) (20Majó G. Aguado F. Blasi J. Marsal J. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); the rabbit polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to caveolin were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Antibodies to MAP kinase, Mek, and Mek-P were from New England Biolabs, Inc (Beverly, MA); anti-Rab5 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse monoclonal antibody to lgp120 (GM10) was provided by Drs. K. Siddle and J. Hutton, University of Cambridge. Cholesterol oxidase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and filipin was from Sigma. Latrunculin A and dextran-Texas red (Mr 10,000) were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). NRK-44F cells were made quiescent by growing them to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and then kept for 3 days in the same medium but with 0.5% FCS. Cells were activated from quiescence by the addition for 30 min of 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigma, receptor grade) or 7.5 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor or 10% FCS. Incubation was stopped by incubation in ice-cold PBS. In double immunolabeling experiments to detect caveolin and cellubrevin, the cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilized for 15 min in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% saponin. After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with mouse anti-caveolin 1 (1:100) and with rabbit anti-cellubrevin (1:150) or mouse anti-lgp120 (1:200) in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% saponin. Coverslips were then washed three times in PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with corresponding secondary antibodies (rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse and fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies) in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% saponin. After three washes in PBS-saponin and PBS, samples were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins was performed in 10 or 12% polyacrylamide, as described by Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, polypeptides (3– 5 μg of protein/channel) were transferred electrophoretically at 60 V for 60 to 90 min at 4 °C (depending on the protein to be identified) to Immobilon-P Transfer Membranes (Millipore), and antigens were identified using specific antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% powdered skimmed milk, and finally the reaction product was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Image analysis of Western blots and band quantification was performed with a Bio-Image system (Millipore). The protein content of the samples was measured by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. To analyze the effect of cholesterol-disrupting agents on the recruitment of caveolin from the cell surface to endosomes and the subsequent activation of MAP kinase, NRK cells were washed in PBS and, before the EGF treatment, pre-treated with cholesterol oxidase, (0.75 units/ml) for 10 min (13Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), filipin (5 μg/ml) for 90 min (9Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), cytochalasin D for 5 min (10 μg/ml), or latrunculin A (1 μm) for 5 min (23Lamaze C. Fujimoto L.M. Yin H.L. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20332-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Cells were then lysed in 2% SDS, 67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, scraped, and sonicated, and cell extracts were electrophoresed and transferred to P-Immobilon membranes for immunoblotting with anti-Mek or anti-MAP kinase antibodies. In some experiments cells on coverslips were prepared for immunocytochemistry after the treatment with cholesterol or actin-disrupting agents. NRK cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 10% FCS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin containing 10 mg/ml lysine-fixable dextran-Texas red (Mr 10,000) for 5 min (pulse) at 37 °C (24Apodaca G. Enrich C. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19005-19013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Washing the cells in ice-cold PBS stopped the uptake, and cells were then returned to culture in normal medium for various lengths of time at 37 °C (chase). When the uptake of dextran was combined with immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed for 2 h at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in 40 mm sodium phosphate, 75 mm lysine buffer, pH 7.4, containing 9.1 mmsodium periodate and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, PBS, 20 mm glycine for 10 min. Cells were subsequently incubated with antibodies and processed for fluorescence microscopy as described above. Cells grown in a 150-cm2 tissue culture flask (×6) were washed in ice-cold PBS, scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation in a table centrifuge (750 rpm, 5 min). Cells were then washed in homogenization buffer (HB: 10 mm Tris, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4), pelleted (2,500 rpm, 15 min), resuspended in 1 ml of HB containing protease inhibitors, and homogenized by 10–15 passages through a 22-gauge needle. After centrifugation (2,500 rpm, 15 min) the post-nuclear supernatant was collected (2 ml), layered over 6 ml of 27% (v/v) Percoll in HB, and centrifuged (21,000 rpm, 90 min, 4 °C) in a 50 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments) (25Green S, A. Zimmer K.P. Griffiths G. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 500 μl were collected from the bottom of the tube (the last two lightest fractions were not collected). Finally, in some experiments subcellular fractionation was also conducted using OptiPrepTM (Nycomed, Oslo) density gradients. Briefly, NRK cells were fasted for 2–3 days and then pre-treated with cytochalasin D (or latrunculin A) or filipin and finally activated with EGF. Cells were scraped and homogenized with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors by passing 10 times through a 22-gauge needle at 4 °C. The post-nuclear supernatant (350 μl) was then mixed (1:1) with OptiPrepTM (60%) and loaded at the bottom of the following OptiPrepTM gradient: 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 22.5, 25, and 27.5%. OptiPrepTM solutions (220 μl, each layer) were prepared with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA. Tubes were then centrifuged for 90 min at 35,000 rpm in a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Finally, samples (150 μl) were collected from the top of tubes and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-SDS and Western blotting. In a previous work we demonstrated that in rat liver EGF induces the recruitment of transduction machinery of the MAP kinase cascade from the plasma membrane to the early endocytic compartment where some elements of this machinery are eventually phosphorylated and activated (18Pol A. Calvo M. Enrich C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether growth factor treatment causes redistribution of caveolin, a marker for caveolae, from the cell surface to the endocytic compartment of NRK cells. NRK cells were made quiescent following growth in 0.5% FCS for 2–3 days, then 20 ng/ml of EGF (receptor grade), FCS (10%), or 7.5 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor was added to the medium. After 30 min, cells were fixed and double-labeled for caveolin and cellubrevin as an endosomal marker (12Pol A. Calvo M. Lu A. Enrich C. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Calvo M. Pol A. Lu A. Ortega D. Pons M. Blasi J. Enrich C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7910-7917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig.1). In non-treated NRK cells the two antibodies labeled distinct compartments; anti-cellubrevin antibody labeled punctate structures restricted to the perinuclear region of the cells (Fig. 1b), whereas the monoclonal anti-caveolin labeled discrete domains and fine punctate structures on the cell surface (Fig. 1 a). When cells were incubated with EGF (for 30 min), a significant change was observed in the distribution of caveolin (Fig.1 d, in 60–80% of the cells), but not in the pattern of cellubrevin (Fig. 1 e). The degree of co-localization after the EGF treatment was higher, especially in the peri-nuclear region (see insets in Fig. 1). Experiments treating the cells with 10% FCS or platelet-derived growth factor gave similar result (not shown). These results suggest that EGF treatment cause caveolin redistribution in endosomal compartments. To further characterize the cellubrevin endocytic structures, double-labeling experiments with anti-lgp120 (pre-lysosomal) and anti-cellubrevin antibodies were performed. Fig.2 shows that cellubrevin is mostly excluded from the pre-lysosomal compartment (Fig. 2 a). Although cellubrevin has been characterized as an endosomal marker (recycling endosomes) in different cell types (26Bottger G. Nagelkerken B. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29191-29197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Annaert W.G. Becker B. Kistner U. Reth M. Jahn R. J.

For this reason we performed double immunolabeling experiments with anti-cellubrevin and a Golgi marker, the anti-Golgi 58K protein. Confocal microscopy showed very little co-localization in the tubular trans-Golgi membranes (not shown). We also performed internalization experiments with a fluid-phase ligand (dextran-Texas Red). Fig. 2 b shows the internalization of dextran-Texas Red in NRK cells at different times double-labeled with anti-cellubrevin. Dextran was detected only in the cellubrevin-positive structures at earlier time points (5–10 min). In some experiments, we studied the internalization of transferrin-FITC (for receptor-mediated endocytosis); most of the transferrin-FITC reached the cellubrevin compartment after 15 min and remained (data not shown). Finally, sub-cellular fractionation was performed to examine the distribution of cellubrevin-containing structures in NRK cells. Fig.3 shows the fractions isolated from a 27% Percoll density gradient analyzed by immunoblotting with different markers: lgp120 (pre-lysosomes), Rab5 (early endosomes and plasma membrane), and cellubrevin. Cellubrevin and Rab5 were in the same range of density (fractions 4 to 8), whereas lgp120 was confined to the high density region (fractions 2 to 5). Recently, the same gradient was used to analyze the intracellular location of annexin VI and β-hexosaminidase (32Pons M. Ihrke G. Koch S. Biermer M. Pol A. Grewal T. Jäckle S. Enrich C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that in NRK cells cellubrevin is concentrated in an early/sorting endocytic compartment involved in the recycling of transferrin (31Daro E. van der Sluijs P. Galli T. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9559-9564Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This endocytic compartment is the intracellular target organelle for caveolin after EGF activation. It has been shown that agents perturbing plasma membrane cholesterol or the actin cortex have crucial consequences for endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits and caveolae (23Lamaze C. Fujimoto L.M.

Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2000; 1: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, to study whether EGF-induced caveolin internalization is a requirement or precedes the activation of signal transduction in the endocytic compartment, two approaches were undertaken: disruption of caveolae by treating the cells with agents that interfere with cholesterol and actin cytoskeleton perturbation. The MAP kinase activation was monitored by Western blotting in the post-nuclear supernatant obtained from quiescent NRK cells 15 min after addition of EGF using a specific antibody to the phosphorylated form of MAP kinase, ERK-1 and ERK-2. Fig. 4 shows the differential effects of treatments on the EGF-mediated MAP kinase activation. Fig.4 a shows the dose-dependent inhibition of MAP kinase (ERK1 and ERK2) by increasing amounts of cytochalasin D in cells incubated with EGF for 15 min. Neither cholesterol oxidase nor filipin has any effect on the EGF-induced activation of MAP kinase; although cytochalasin D had an inhibitory effect in activated cells (+EGF) treated with cholesterol oxidase, the MAP kinase was not inhibited by cytochalasin D in those cells treated with filipin. Cholesterol oxidase activates MAP kinase even in the absence of growth factors; filipin had no effect (Fig. 4 b). To establish whether the mechanisms described above are exclusive of the EGF-mediated pathway or may represent a more general cell activation response, the same experiments but using medium with 10% FCS (which contains a complex mixture of growth factors) and latrunculin A (as an actin-disrupting agent of the cortical actin cytoskeleton), were performed. Fig. 4 c shows that treatment of quiescent cells with 10% FCS has similar effects on the MAP kinase activation as those reported with EGF. Under these conditions cholesterol oxidase treatment was enough to induce the activation of MAP kinase. Latrunculin A as well as cytochalasin D inhibited MAP kinase activation in response to 10% FCS even after cholesterol oxidase pretreatment, but latrunculin A did not inhibit MAP kinase activation in cells pretreated with filipin (data not shown). Finally, a specific antibody to the phosphorylated form of Mek, the upstream kinase responsible for MAP kinase activation, was used to determine whether the changes described above are restricted to a single step of the MAP kinase cascade. Fig. 4 c also shows the Mek activity running in parallel with the activity of its substrate. Taken together, the results of the present study show that agents that disrupt caveolae and interfere with their internalization and functioning have significant effects on growth factor signaling pathways. To ascertain whether cytochalasin D or latrunculin A controls the internalization of caveolae or merely inhibit MAP kinase activation, two approaches were followed: (i) by immunocytochemistry, to find out whether these actin-disrupting agents or those interfering with cholesterol block the internalization of caveolin after EGF treatment; (ii) by subcellular fractionation to analyze the flotation patterns of caveolin after the same treatments. Fig. 5 shows the immunocytochemical patterns of caveolin in NRK cells after different treatments with (panels b, d, f, h, and j) or without EGF (a, c, e,g, and i). Using a polyclonal anti-caveolin antibody in non-treated cells (control, without EGF), caveolin was localized at the cell surface and in the peri-nuclear (Golgi) region of NRK cells. When cells were pre-treated with agents that disrupt the actin cytoskeleton no changes in the caveolin distribution were observed in response to EGF (see Fig. 5, panels c,d, e, and f), and most of the caveolin remained at the cell surface. This indicates that disorganization of actin interferes with the internalization of caveolin induced by EGF. However, when cells were treated with cholesterol oxidase or filipin (Fig. 5, panels g, h, i, and j) and then activated with EGF, fixed, labeled with anti-caveolin, and analyzed at the confocal microscope, it can be observed that in both cases the treatment did not interfere with internalization of caveolin triggered by EGF. Finally, to confirm the immunocytochemical data and further demonstrate changes in caveolin distribution in response to EGF, we used OptiPrepTM density gradients. Membrane rafts are relatively insoluble in non-ionic detergents (e.g. Triton X-100) on ice and can be recovered with certain membrane proteins (e.g.caveolin) as insoluble complexes (36Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 37Smart E.J. Ying Y-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Some of these cholesterol-sphingolipid membrane rafts float at low density compared with detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton or detergent-soluble complexes, which remain at higher densities. Caveolin floats in OptiPrepTM gradients (up to 20% OptiPrepTM) after Triton X-100 solubilization. However, endosomes, detergent-soluble proteins, and cytoskeleton-associated structures remain in the heavy fractions of the gradient (38Oliferenko S. Paiha K. Harder T. Gerke V. Schwärzler C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Günthert U. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). After EGF treatment, caveolae detach from the membranes and become lighter in the gradient (up to 12% OptiPrepTM). Fig.6 shows that there was a shift in the density of caveolin in OptiPrepTM gradients in those samples treated with EGF (Fig. 6 b) compared with the control (no EGF) (Fig. 6 a). On the other hand and in agreement with previous studies (38Oliferenko S. Paiha K. Harder T. Gerke V. Schwärzler C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Günthert U. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), flotation of caveolin was not affected when the cells were treated with latrunculin A. However, when those cells treated with latrunculin A were activated with EGF, a more homogeneous distribution of caveolin was detected throughout the gradient, but certain accumulation of caveolin peaking in the same fractions as the control without EGF can be observed (Fig.6 c). Finally, for those cells treated with filipin (plus EGF), although caveolin was detected all over the gradient, a peak with an increased amount can be observed in the lightest fractions, similar to the control plus EGF (Fig. 6 d). In addition to caveolin, we also analyzed the behavior of Mek (total) and Mek-P in the same OptiPrepTM density gradients (Fig. 6,g–j). Both were detected at the bottom of the gradients in cells not treated with EGF and at the same density as caveolin (of non-treated cells) in those cells stimulated with EGF; since Mek interacts with caveolin (in the caveolae), it is likely that it can be transported “ensemble” to the endocytic compartment where it can be phosphorylated, a situation similar to that shown in the liver where Mek is mainly in caveolae but Mek-P was found in early endosomes. Therefore, caveolin in low density fractions of the OptiPrepTM gradients could correspond to the vesicles that move from the cell surface to the early endosomes, transporting Mek to this endocytic compartment where it can be eventually phosphorylated (activated) (18Pol A. Calvo M. Enrich C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with the immunocytochemical studies in Fig. 5. As mentioned above, in these gradients early endosomes where located at the bottom of the OptiPrepTM gradients (Fig. 6 e, Rab5). Interestingly, after treatment of EGF, Rab5 showed a slight displacement similar to Mek-P. Finally, we analyzed the expression of Mek after latrunculin A or filipin treatments. In all cases the distribution of Mek parallels with that of caveolin (data not shown). Whether caveolin found in densities 12–20% OptiPrepTMafter EGF treatment represents caveolae detached and on the way to the endocytic compartment is still uncertain. However, it seems that phosphorylation of Mek does not occur in these intermediate structures nor in plasma membrane caveolae, since Mek-P does not float with caveolin.

https://openalex.org/W2094330871,"Leukotriene B(4) is a potent lipid mediator known to be implicated mainly in inflammatory actions. Previous pharmacological studies indicated the existence of only one class of G protein-coupled receptor for leukotriene B(4), for which a candidate gene, namely BLT, had been identified. Here we report the isolation of another gene encoding a functional G protein-coupled receptor for leukotriene B(4), named JULF2. JULF2 is a novel G protein-coupled receptor of 358 amino acids that shares 36.6% amino acid identity with human BLT. According to genomic information, the JULF2 gene is located on the chromosome 14, about 4 kilobases upstream of the BLT gene. During screening of endogenous ligands for JULF2, we found that leukotriene B(4) induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells, stably expressing JULF2. Additionally, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing exogenous JULF2 showed chemotactic responses with leukotriene B(4) in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. A large amount of JULF2 mRNA was detected in the human spleen and the peripheral blood leukocytes. Furthermore, JULF2 mRNA was expressed in mononuclear lymphocytes, in which BLT mRNA was barely detected. The discovery of this second leukotriene B(4) receptor will eventually lead to a better understanding of the classification of leukotriene B(4) receptors and reconsideration of the pathophysiological role of leukotriene B(4)."
