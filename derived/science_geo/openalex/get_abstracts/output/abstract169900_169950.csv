It should be safe, economic and reasonably clean. Little energy needs to be expended to overcome potential energy changes, but a great deal is lost through friction (for cars about 10 kWh per 100 km) and low-efficiency energy conversion. Vehicles can be run either by connecting them to a continuous supply of energy or by storing energy on board. Hydrogen would be ideal as a synthetic fuel because it is lightweight, highly abundant and its oxidation product (water) is environmentally benign, but storage remains a problem. Here we present recent developments in the search for innovative materials with high hydrogen-storage capacity."

https://openalex.org/W2109446031,"The plant hormone auxin is central in many aspects of plant development. Previous studies have implicated the ubiquitin-ligase SCF(TIR1) and the AUX/IAA proteins in auxin response. Dominant mutations in several AUX/IAA genes confer pleiotropic auxin-related phenotypes, whereas recessive mutations affecting the function of SCF(TIR1) decrease auxin response. Here we show that SCF(TIR1) is required for AUX/IAA degradation. We demonstrate that SCF(TIR1) interacts with AXR2/IAA7 and AXR3/IAA17, and that domain II of these proteins is necessary and sufficient for this interaction. Further, auxin stimulates binding of SCF(TIR1) to the AUX/IAA proteins, and their degradation. Because domain II is conserved in nearly all AUX/IAA proteins in Arabidopsis, we propose that auxin promotes the degradation of this large family of transcriptional regulators, leading to diverse downstream effects."

This apoptosis inhibitor also has an evolutionarily conserved role as a mitotic spindle checkpoint protein. Previous studies on p53-repressed genes have implicated several genes involved in the G2/M transition of the cell cycle as targets of negative regulation by p53. However, few targets of p53 repression that are anti-apoptotic have been identified. This study identifies the anti-apoptotic survivin gene as a p53-repressed gene. Notably, Survivin repression by p53 is shown to be distinct from p53-dependent growth arrest. Chromatin immunoprecipitations indicate that p53 binds the survivinpromoter in vivo; immunobinding studies indicate that this site overlaps with a binding site for E2F transcription factors and is subtly distinct from a canonical p53-transactivating element. Thesurvivin-binding site contains a 3-nucleotide spacer between the two decamer “half-sites” of the p53 consensus element; deletion of this spacer is sufficient to convert thesurvivin site into a transactivating element. Finally, we show that overexpression of Survivin in cells sensitive to p53-dependent cell death markedly inhibits apoptosis induced by ultraviolet light. The identification ofsurvivin as a p53 repressed gene should aid in the elucidation of the contribution of transcriptional repression to p53-dependent apoptosis.

Although these genes share homology in their coding regions, they are transcribed in a reverse orientation and appear to share no regulatory or promoter regions (1Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the survivincoding region revealed a conserved motif present at the amino terminus that identified it as a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)1 family. This motif, or baculovirus IAP repeat domain, has been shown to mediate the interaction with, and inhibition of, the caspase family of proteolytic enzymes, which are the penultimate mediators of apoptosis (2Tamm I. Wang Y. Sausville E. Scudiero D.A. Vigna N. Oltersdorf T. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5315-5320PubMed Google Scholar, 3Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Consistent with its predicted anti-apoptotic function, expression of antisense RNA for Survivin is sufficient to induce apoptosis in a number of human tumor cell lines (4Ambrosini G. Adida C. Sirugo G. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11177-11182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 5Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchiso P.C.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2805-2809PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated expression of Survivin would be predicted to promote tumorigenesis, and in fact Survivin is highly expressed in a number of tumor types, including neuroblastoma, colorectal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma; in these tumors, Survivin overexpression is correlated with poor prognosis (7Adida C. Berrebi D. Peuchmaur M. Reyes-Mugica M. Altieri D.C. Lancet. 1998; 351: 882-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 8Islam A. Nageyama H. Takada N. Kawamoto T.

Tenjo T. Tanigawa N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5071-5074PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, analysis of the differences in gene expression between normal and tumor cells has revealed that survivin is one of the genes most consistently overexpressed in tumor cells relative to normal tissue (10Velculescu V.E. Madden S.L. Zhang L. Lash A.E. et al.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 387-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Survivin is expressed widely in fetal tissues, but becomes restricted during development, and appears to be negligibly expressed in the majority of adult tissues (1Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar, 11Adida C. Crotty P.L. McGrath J. Berrebi D. Diebold J. Altieri D.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 43-49PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of Survivin is also cell cycle-regulated. This gene is repressed in the G1phase of the cell cycle and is highly expressed in G2/M (12Li F. Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This cell cycle regulation appears to rely on the presence of two CDE elements (cell cycle-dependentelements) that are downstream of the transcriptional start site (12Li F. Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), although a proximal CHR element (cyclinhomology region) may also play a role. During mitosis, Survivin protein binds the mitotic spindle, and there is evidence that via this interaction this protein monitors mitotic spindle integrity; it is hypothesized that Survivin controls the elimination by apoptosis of those cells with aberrantly formed mitotic spindles (5Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchiso P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 13Li F. Ackermann E.J. Bennett C.F. Rothermel A.L. Plescia J. Tognin S. Villa A. Marchiso P.C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). This role for Survivin is evolutionarily conserved, as it is shared among homologues in yeast (14Uren A.G. Beilharz T. O'Connell M.J. Bugg S.J. Van Driel R. Vaux D.L. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10170-10175Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans (15Fraser A.G. James C. Evan G.I. Hengartner M.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 292-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Although deregulation of survivin gene expression appears to be a common and significant event in tumorigenesis, little is known regarding the important regulators of the expression of this gene in normal and tumor cells. Like Survivin, the p53 tumor suppressor protein is also a critical mediator of apoptosis and tumorigenesis. p53 is a nuclear transcription factor that is latent in normal cells but becomes activated by a variety of cellular stresses such as DNA damage, hypoxia (insufficient oxygen), and the presence of activated oncogenes (for review see Ref.16Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Following induction of p53 by these stresses, p53 up-regulates a set of genes that can promote cell death and growth arrest, such as p21waf1, bax, fas, andKILLER/DR5 (for review see Ref. 17Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). p53 also negatively regulates the expression of a separate set of genes; in some cases this negative regulation has been shown to be important for the induction of apoptosis (18Miyashita T. Harigai M. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3131-3135PubMed Google Scholar, 19Murphy M. Hinman A. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 20Roperch J.P. Alvaro V. Prieur S. Tuynder M. Nemani M. Lethrosne F. Piouffre L. Gendron M.C. Israeli D. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R. Telerman A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The exact nature of the binding site for p53 in repressed promoters, and how this site differs from that in transactivated promoters, has only begun to be elucidated. The mechanism of repression by p53 is also becoming more clearly elucidated; specifically, at least one mechanism whereby p53 negatively regulates gene expression involves an association between p53 and histone deacetylases (HDACs). This p53-HDAC interaction is mediated by binding of p53 to the co-repressor protein Sin3. The p53-Sin3 interaction targets HDACs to the promoters of p53-repressed genes, where HDACs serve to deacetylate histones and create a chromatin environment that is unfavorable for transcription (21Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In several studies the transcriptional repression activity of p53 has been implicated in p53-dependent apoptosis; notable in these studies is the finding that deletion of the proline-rich domain of p53 renders this protein competent as a transactivator but unable to induce apoptosis or to repress transcription (22Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 23Sakamuro D. Sabbatini P. White E. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Venot C. Maratrat M. Dureuil C. Conseiller E. Bracco L. Debussche L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4668-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Additionally, tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 that are impaired for apoptosis induction are likewise unable to repress transcription, yet retain the ability to activate transcription (25Ryan K.M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3692-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In support of the positive association between p53-mediated repression and apoptosis, we recently mapped the Sin3-binding domain of p53 to the proline-rich domain, which is critical for apoptosis induction by p53 (26Zilfou J.T. Hoffman W.H. Sank M. George D.L. Murphy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3974-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These and other studies raise the possibility that p53 may transcriptionally repress genes with anti-apoptotic activity. In a search for genes that are negatively regulated by p53, we and others identified several genes with roles in the control of the G2/M phase of the cell cycle that are repressed following induction of wild type p53. These genes include stathmin,Map4, cyclin B1, cdc2, andcdc25c (27Ahn J. Murphy M. Kratowicz S. Wang A. Levine A.J. George D.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5954-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Innocente S.A. Abrahamson J.L. Cogswell J.P. Lee J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 29Taylor W.R. Schonthal A.H. Galente J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1998-2006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Repression of these genes following DNA damage has been shown to require wild type p53 and is hypothesized to constitute a DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint (31Badie C. Itzhaki J.E. Sullivan M.J. Carpenter A.J. Porter A.C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2358-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). These studies prompted us to test the possibility that Survivin, which binds to the mitotic spindle and exhibits anti-apoptotic activity, might likewise be subject to negative regulation by p53. Our studies have identified survivin as a gene that is potently repressed, at both the RNA and protein levels, following p53 induction in cells with both endogenous and inducible p53. The identification ofsurvivin as a p53-repressed gene should aid in the elucidation of the mechanism of transcriptional repression by p53 and in the estimation of the contribution of this activity to p53-dependent programmed cell death. MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. The human melanoma cell line CaCl and the derivative clone expressing the HPV E6 gene were cultured as described (27Ahn J. Murphy M. Kratowicz S. Wang A. Levine A.J. George D.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5954-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The human osteosarcoma cell lines Saos2 and U2OS (kindly provided by Peter Adams, Fox Chase Cancer Center), the immortalized murine p21 knock-out fibroblasts (WD-50-5 cells, kindly provided by James Sherley, MIT, and established from cultures derived from Tyler Jacks, MIT), and the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line H1299 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. Murine Val5 cells, containing the temperature-sensitive valine 135 allele of p53, human Val138 cells containing the valine 138 allele, and human tsp73 cells were maintained as described (33Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D.C. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 34Pochampally R. Li C. Lu W. Chen L. Luftig R. Lin J. Chen J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commin. 2000; 279: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted all cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. For treatment with ultraviolet light, cells were irradiated with 0–10 J/m2 (as noted) of UV-C with a Spectroline X series ultraviolet lamp, and output was monitored with a traceable UV light meter (Fisher). For drug treatment, cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml adriamycin (doxorubicin, Sigma) or dilution vehicle alone for 24 h. p53 induction was monitored by Western analysis of 100 μg of protein as described (21Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), using 0.1 μg/ml DO-1 (Ab-6, Calbiochem) or 421 (Ab-1, Calbiochem). The full-length coding region for Survivin was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using 5 μg of total RNA from the H1299 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, using the Access Reverse Transcription-PCR kit (Promega) and the following oligonucleotides: forward 5′-ATGAGATACCATGGGTGCCCCGACG-3′, reverse 5′-TTAAGGATCCCTGCTCGATGGCACG-3′. The cDNA was cloned into the pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen) and subjected to DNA sequence analysis for sequence confirmation. Total RNA was isolated from cells using CsCl purification (19Murphy M. Hinman A. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or using Trizol, as per the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Northern analyses were performed as described (19Murphy M. Hinman A. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Probes for Northerns were radiolabeled using random primers (Prime-It-II, Stratagene) and [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Autoradiographs were quantitated using NIH image software. Western analysis was performed essentially as described (21Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC Protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein (between 50 and 120 μg) were run on 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred overnight onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Western blots were incubated in antibody in 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST). Blots were incubated with primary antibody at the following dilutions: p53 Ab-6 (Calbiochem) 1:1000, actin, AC-15 (Sigma) at 1:5000, p21waf1 (Calbiochem) 1:1000, and Survivin (Oncogene Science) 1:1000. Blots were washed with PBST and incubated in horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and developed via the chemiluminescence protocol provided by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Approximately 1.1 kb of the survivinpromoter region was generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen) using the following oligonucleotides: forward 5′-CTGGCCATAGAACCAGAGAAGTGA-3′, reverse 5′-CCACCTCTGCCAACGGGTCCCGCG-3′, to generate the plasmid SpI. This sequence represents nucleotides 1821–2912 of the humansurvivin gene, GenBankTM accession numberU75285. DNA sequence analysis confirmed the sequence of this region. The survivin promoter was then cloned into the promoterless luciferase vector pGL2-basic (Promega) to generate the plasmid SpII, for use in transfections and luciferase assays. The SpV deletion construct was generated from the SpI plasmid following digestion with SmaI and HindIII, generation of blunt ends by Klenow fill-in, and re-ligated; this promoter construct contains nucleotides 2331–2912 of the human survivin gene/promoter. For deletion of the p53-binding site in the survivinpromoter, the SpV plasmid was digested with SacII, which flanks the p53-binding site. Digestion of SpV with SacII and religation of this construct eliminates the p53-binding site, as well as approximately 30 nucleotides upstream of the site, to generate the construct SpV-Δp53BS. The Sp-min construct consists of the p53-binding site and the adjacent E2F-binding site; this construct was generated using PCR using the following overlapping oligonucleotides: 5′-AAAGGTACCGGGCGTGCGCTCCCGACATG-3′ and 5′-AAACTCGAGGGCGCGCCGCGGGGCATGTCG-3′. This fragment was cloned into the plasmid pGL3-E1B-TATA, kindly provided by James Manfredi (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). The SpVII construct was generated in an identical manner, except that oligonucleotides were designed that deleted the 3-nucleotide spacer in the p53-binding site. H1299, SaoS-2, or WD-50-5 (p21 −/− cells) cells were seeded in 10-cm plates at 1 × 106 cells/plate and allowed to settle overnight. The next morning cells were transfected with 4 μg of firefly luciferase reporter construct and 2–4 μg of Renilla luciferase construct (pRL-CMV or pRL-tk, Promega) or SV40 β-galactosidase, along with the indicated amounts of p53 expression plasmid (in pRc/CMV) using Fugene, according to protocols derived from the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 24 h, the cells were harvested and lysed, and dual luciferase assays were performed as per the protocol derived from the manufacturer (Promega) on a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Luciferase activity was normalized to total protein levels, as well as to Renillaluciferase activity or β-galactosidase activity; β-galactosidase assays were performed according to protocols derived from the manufacturer (Promega). Cyclin-dependent kinase assays were performed essentially as described (35Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar), using 250 μg of whole cell extract immunoprecipitated with 0.5 μg of polyclonal antisera to Cdk2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cyclin E, and cyclin A. Following immunoprecipitation and washing, 1 μg of histone H1 (Sigma) was used as a substrate in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 5 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium 32 °C orthovanadate, and 125 ng/μl cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma). 0.5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 800 Ci/mmol) was added to each reaction, and 0.5 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as a negative control. Following incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, reactions were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE. Cells for flow cytometry were fixed in ethanol and stained with propidium iodide as described (19Murphy M. Hinman A. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FacScan. G1, S (synthesis), and G2/M populations were calculated using the program CellQuest. Immunoselection of the p53-binding site in the survivin promoter was performed essentially as described (33Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D.C. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 36McKay R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 471-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100–200 μg of whole cell extract from 10.1 (p53 null) or Val5 cells grown at (wt p53) was incubated with 300,000 cpm of end-labeled probe for the survivin promoter in McKay binding buffer (10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1.25 μg/μl poly(dI/dC) (Amersham Biosciences) and 1 μg each 421 and 1620 monoclonal antibody. Following incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose and washed extensively in McKay washing buffer (2% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, phenol/chloroform extracted, precipitated, and resolved on 4% non-denaturing acrylamide gels. For competition experiments, a 20 5-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA was preincubated with extract for 10 min prior to the binding reaction. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed exactly as described (21Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) using primers specific for the survivin promoter and polyclonal antisera specific for p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and acetylated histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). To ensure for linearity, PCRs were sampled and analyzed following 25, 30, and 35 cycles. The Survivin cDNA was mutagenized to convert it to a constitutively active anti-apoptotic form by changing the threonine residue at amino acid 34 to glutamic acid (T34E), using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). This mutant, which had significantly less toxicity than the wild type cDNA, was cloned into a CMV-driven plasmid (CMV-neo-Bam3) and transfected into CaCl cells. Subclones were isolated and analyzed for apoptosis induction following treatment with ultraviolet radiation using annexin V assays (R & D Systems), as well as immunofluorescence and Western analysis using the p85 PARP antibody, which is specific for the caspase-cleaved form of PARP, according to protocols derived from the supplier (Promega). Previous studies using DNA micro-array technology to identify candidate p53-repressed genes revealed that a number of genes with roles in G2/M progression, including several genes that encode microtubule components, are subject to negative regulation by p53 (30Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We sought to test the hypothesis that, like these genes, the microtubule-associated protein Survivin might likewise be negatively regulated by p53. For these studies the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line Val138 was utilized; these cells are derived from p53-null H1299 cells and are stably transfected with a temperature-sensitive p53 allele encoding valine at codon 138. The p53 protein in these cells exists in a mutant conformation at 39 °C, and temperature shift to 32 °C induces a wild type conformation of p53 and concomitant growth arrest (34Pochampally R. Li C. Lu W. Chen L. Luftig R. Lin J. Chen J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commin. 2000; 279: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone for Survivin, generated by reverse transcription-PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”) was utilized as a probe in Northern analyses of Val138 cells cultured at 39 °C (mutant p53) or temperature-shifted to 32 °C (wt p53) for 24 h. As shown in the Northern analysis in Fig.1A, temperature shift of parental H1299 cells had no effect on Survivin RNA levels (lanes 1 and 2). However, temperature shift in Val138 cells resulted in a significant decrease in Survivin levels (lanes 3 and 4), whereas the levels of the housekeeping genegapdh and the IAP gene XIAP remained unchanged (see Fig. 1). In an effort to examine the effects of endogenous p53 induction onsurvivin gene expression, human tumor cell lines containing wild type p53 were treated with the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin (adriamycin), which is a potent inducer of p53 protein and p53-dependent transcriptional activity. Treatment of the human MCF-7 breast carcinoma and the human melanoma cell line CaCl with doxorubicin led to significant decreases in the steady state level of Survivin messenger RNA as early as 12 h after treatment (see Fig.1B). Similarly, treatment of the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS (wt p53) with doxorubicin led to significant induction of p53 and a 5-fold decrease in Survivin protein after 24 h (Fig.1C). In contrast, such decreased levels did not occur following identical treatment of Saos2 human osteosarcoma cells, which are null for p53 (Fig. 1C, lane 4). To extend these studies, we performed Western analysis of p53 and Survivin in matched human tumor cell lines that differ in p53 status, following treatment with doxorubicin. CaCl is a human melanoma cell line with wt p53; CaCl/E6 is a clonal derivative of this cell line that stably expresses the human papillomavirus protein E6, which targets p53 for degradation (27Ahn J. Murphy M. Kratowicz S. Wang A. Levine A.J. George D.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5954-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, the CaCl/E6 line has significantly reduced p53 levels compared with parental CaCl cells, and doxorubicin treatment failed to up-regulate the p53-induced protein p21waf1. Similarly, doxorubicin treatment failed to cause down-regulation of Survivin in CaCl/E6 cells, indicating a requirement for wt p53 for this process. Flow cytometric analyses indicated that both cell lines undergo G2/M arrest following doxorubicin treatment, indicating that Survivin down-regulation was unlikely to be an indirect effect of p53-induced G1 arrest in these cells (see below). Because thesurvivin gene is known to be transcriptionally repressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, it became important to eliminate the possibility that repression of Survivin by p53 was a side effect of the induction of G1 growth arrest by this protein. Immunoblots of MCF-7 cells treated with doxorubicin indicated that, as expected, p53 levels were induced, and Survivin levels were markedly decreased following treatment (Fig.2A). Flow cytometric analysis of these cells indicated that they were growth-arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle following doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 2B); such a failure of human tumor cell lines with wt p53 to growth arrest in G1 following doxorubicin and gamma irradiation treatment has been noted by others (37Choki I. Sourla A. Reyes-Moreno C. Koutsilieris M. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 4213-4224PubMed Google Scholar, 38Janicke R.U. Engels I.H. Dunkern T. Kaina B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Porter A.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5043-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In an effort to confirm that these doxorubicin-treated cells were in fact arrested in G2/M, we performed cyclin-dependent kinase assays in MCF-7 cells before and after drug treatment. These assays indicated that the activity of the G1-specific cyclin E-associated kinase, as well as the Cdk2 kinase, were dramatically reduced in MCF-7 cells following doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 9). Additionally, the kinase activity associated with cyclin A, the S phase cyclin, was also markedly reduced (Fig. 2C, lane 6), as would be expected for cells in G2/M. Because the cyclin B1 and cdc2 genes are subject to transcriptional repression by p53, the activity of these enzymes was not analyzed; however, the combined data support the premise that doxorubicin-treated MCF7 cells are arrested in G2/M. We extended these studies in efforts to better separate the ability of p53 to down-regulate Survivin from its ability to induce G"

BMP-2 signals via two types of receptors (BRI and BRII) that are expressed at the cell surface as homomeric as well as heteromeric complexes. Prior to ligand binding, a low but measurable level of BMP-receptors is found in preformed hetero-oligomeric complexes. The major fraction of the receptors is recruited into hetero-oligomeric complexes only after ligand addition. For this, BMP-2 binds first to the high affinity receptor BRI and then recruits BRII into the signaling complex. However, ligand binding to the preformed complex composed of BRII and BRI is still required for signaling, suggesting that it may mediate activating conformational changes. Using several approaches we have addressed the following questions: (i) Are preformed complexes incompetent of signaling in the absence of BMP-2? (ii) Which domains of the BRII receptors are essential for this complex formation? (iii) Are there differences in signals sent from BMP-inducedversus preformed receptor complexes? By measuring the activation of Smads, of p38 MAPK and of alkaline phosphatase, we show that the ability of kinase-deficient BRII receptor mutants to inhibit BMP signaling depends on their ability to form heteromeric complexes with BRI. Importantly, a BRII mutant that is incapable in forming preassembled receptor complexes but recruits into a BMP-induced receptor complex does not interfere with the Smad pathway but does inhibit the induction of alkaline phosphatase as well as p38 phosphorylation. These results indicate that signals induced by binding of BMP-2 to preformed receptor complexes activate the Smad pathway, whereas BMP-2-induced recruitment of receptors activates a different, Smad-independent pathway resulting in the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity via p38 MAPK.

BMPs are able to induce the formation of bone at nonbony sites in the adult animal by influencing the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells along the cartilage lineage pathway. BMPs act on osteoblasts as well as chondrocytes but also on many other cell types such as neuronal cells (2Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7632-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Receptors of both types are needed to form a functional complex to initiate further signaling events. Activated BMP type I receptors phosphorylate Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 (R-Smads), which then assemble into heteromeric complexes with Smad4 (Co-Smad) and translocate into the nucleus to regulate transcription of target genes (9Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In addition, BMP receptors initiate other signaling pathways, distinct from the Smad pathway, resulting in the activation of p38 MAPK and JNK (11Kimura N. Matsuo R. Shibuya H. Nakashima K. Taga T. J.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that the oligomerization pattern of the BMP receptors is very different from that of the related TGF-β receptors and is more flexible and susceptible to modulation by ligand (14Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Multiple BMP receptor oligomers are present at the cell surface prior to ligand binding, with heterocomplexes of BRII with BRI-a and BRI-b being the most prominent (14Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This subpopulation of preformed heteromeric receptor complexes is so far unique for the BMP receptors within the TGF-β receptor superfamily; it implies that, if such complexes transduce specific ligand-induced signals, they should be mediated by conformational changes within the subunits in the complex upon ligand binding. BMP-2 binding mediates a significant elevation in the amount of the heteromeric BMP receptor complexes, as well as in that of homomeric BRI complexes (singly expressed BRII cannot bind ligand). Thus, there are two modes of BMP receptor hetero-oligomerization: one, which occurs prior to ligand binding, and the other, which is ligand-mediated. To study whether these different complexes also activate different signaling pathways, we generated BRII receptor mutants that were defective in their ability to associate with BRI subtypes into preformed complexes. These mutants enabled us to dissect two different pathways, which are initiated by two different modes of BMP receptor oligomerization. Preformed complexes trigger the Smad pathway, whereas BMP-2-induced signaling complexes trigger an independent pathway resulting in the induction of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The latter pathway is mediated through activation of p38 MAPK. Recombinant human BMP-2 was prepared as described previously (15Ruppert R. Hoffmann E. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). 9E10 (α-myc, directed against the myc tag (16Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell.

Anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 antibody recognizing the phosphorylated form of Smad1, -5, and -8 was a gift from P. ten Dijke. Polyclonal antisera (rabbit) were raised against specific peptides from the BMP receptors (14Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol.

Peroxidase-goat anti-mouse IgG or peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Dianova, protein A-Sepharose and protein G-Sepharose CL-4B from Sigma Chemical Co., and disuccinimidyl suberate from Pierce. Cy3-GαR and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-GαM IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. The anti-phospho p38 antiserum was from Promega. The cell lines COS7 (CRL 1651) and C2C12 (CRL 1772) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. MC3T3 cells were obtained from P. ten Dijke. The construct pCDTR1, containing as insert the entire human transferrin receptor (TfR) cDNA, was a gift from F. H. Ruddle (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The BMP-receptors were epitope-tagged as described by us earlier (14Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To generate truncated versions of BRII we used recombinant PCR mutagenesis by introducing stop codons at the indicated position (TC3 at 1500, BRII-SF at 1587, TC4 at 1911, TC5 at 2133, and TC6 at 2238; nucleotide numbers are given according to a previous study (5Kawabata M.

All mutagenesis oligonucleotides, therefore, had the same 5′ sequence: 5′-GCA ACG TCT AGA TCA TGA TCA-3′. The obtained fragments were digested with DraI/XbaI and subcloned into the vector with either the HA-epitope-tagged or myc-epitope-tagged BRII (14Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W.

The cDNAs encoding the truncations TC7 and TC8 were generated in the same way except that the fragments were digested with BglII instead of DraI (stop codons: TC7 at 2946, TC8 at 3064). TC1 was cloned by digestion of the PCR fragment of TC3 with HindIII/XbaI. The fragment was subcloned in pcDNA1 (Invitrogen) resulting in 560 amino acids from BRII and five additional amino acids from pcDNA1 at the C terminus (EGPIL). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The generated BRII truncation mutants resulted in proteins with the following length: TC1 (207 amino acids), TC3 (500 amino acids), BRII-SF (529 amino acids), TC4 (637 amino acids), TC5 (711 amino acids), TC6 (746 amino acids), TC7 (982 amino acids), and TC8 (1021 amino acids). All the constructs contained either the HA or myc tag at the N terminus, because they were generated from the tagged BRII forms described by us earlier (14Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The previously described myc- or HA-tagged versions of the full-length BMP receptors (including BRI-a and BRI-b) were also employed in the studies. The expression of the TC mutants of BRII was tested in transfected COS7 cells (see Figs.

Similar levels were obtained for co-patching of the TfR with other receptors (BRII or the type II TGF-β receptor). H, quantification of the co-patching data. The pairs of co-transfected receptors are designated by theletters corresponding to the representative panels (A–G). Superimposed red and greenimages were analyzed by counting the numbers of green,red, and yellow patches (counting at least 100 patches per cell on 10–15 cells in each case).

For immunoprecipitation or ligand cross-linking, transfections were performed on cells grown in 10-cm plates, using 7–10 μg of DNA per construct. For immunofluorescence co-patching experiments, cells were grown on glass coverslips in 30-mm dishes and transfected with 0.25–0.5 μg of DNA per construct. All experiments were performed 44–48 h after transfection. Transfected COS7 or untransfected MC3T3 or C2C12 cells were washed and incubated with ligand (BMP-2) in KRH buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 128 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl) at 4 °C as described under “Ligand Binding and Cross-linking.” Control dishes were incubated with buffer alone. They were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, benzamidine-HCl, pepstatin, and antipain, 1 mm PMSF) at 4 °C for 40 min. Epitope-tagged receptors were immunoprecipitated from extracts of transfected COS7 cells by 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies (α-HA; 20 μg/ml, 4 °C, 2 h) followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (30 μl of 1:1 suspension in PBS, 1 h, 4 °C) or by 9E10 (α-myc; 20 μg/ml) antibodies followed by protein G-Sepharose. Endogenous receptors from MC3T3 or C2C12 cells were precipitated using specific rabbit anti-peptide antisera (FB15 for BRI-a, FB63 for BRI-b, and FB60 for BRII; 1:500 dilution, 4 °C, 2 h) followed by protein A-Sepharose. As control the corresponding preimmune sera were used. The beads were washed three times with PBS. For immunoprecipitations, the bound protein was eluted by heating the beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing mercaptoethanol (3 min, 95 °C) and subjected to 10–12% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was done according to standard protocols. After electrotransfer and blocking (10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 3% BSA, room temperature, 1 h), the blot was incubated with the monoclonal antibodies 9E10 (20 μg/ml), 12CA5 (10 μg/ml) for 12 h at 4 °C. Detection of adsorbed antibodies was performed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), employing Peroxidase-GαM diluted 1:10,000.

Before binding and cross-linking, C2C12 and MC3T3 cells were starved for 12 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FCS. Confluent 10-cm plates of transfected COS cells or 70% confluent 14-cm plates of C2C12 or MC3T3 cells were incubated for 2–6 h at 4 °C with 5 nm125I-BMP-2 in KRH buffer containing 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA. For MC3T3 and C2C12 cells, 0.01% Tween 20 was added. Cross-linking was performed with disuccinimidyl suberate as described previously for TGF-β (22Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Henis Y.I. Plamondon J. O'Connor M.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22215-22218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking was stopped by adding sucrose to a final concentration of 7% in KRH. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. Metabolic labeling was performed as described previously (23Chen Y.G. Liu F. Massague J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). 48 h after transient transfection COS7 cells were rinsed twice with and then starved in serum-free DMEM minus cysteine and methionine for 120 min at 37 °C. The medium was then replaced with medium supplemented with 0.2 mm oxidized glutathione (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a mixture (1 mCi/ml) of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (DuPont) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA in PBS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, benzamidine-HCl, pepstatin and antipain, 1 mm PMSF) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were immunoprecipitated as indicated and proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To measure oligomerization of BMP receptor mutants directly at the cell surface, we employed antibody-mediated immunofluorescence co-patching of epitope-tagged receptors, described by us recently (14Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J.

COS7 cells grown on glass coverslips were co-transfected transiently using DEAE-dextran by pairs of receptors carrying different epitope tags (for example, myc-BRI-a together with HA-BRII, HA-BRI-b together with myc-TC1, or an epitope-tagged BMP receptor together with the unrelated TfR as a control) in mammalian expression vectors (pcDNA1, except for the TfR, which was in pCD). After 44–48 h, the cells were blocked with normal goat IgG (200 μg/ml, 45 min, 4 °C, in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1% BSA) and labeled in the cold (to avoid internalization and enable exclusive cell surface labeling) in the same buffer with primary anti-tag IgG (20 μg/ml, 45 min): rabbit HA.11 against the HA tag (BAbCO) together with either mouse α-myc (BAbCO) or mouse B3/25 against the TfR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This was followed by labeling/patching with secondary IgG-Cy3-GαR and FITC-GαM (20 μg/ml, 45 min, 4 °C). After washing, the cells were fixed in methanol (5 min, −20 °C) followed by acetone (2 min, −20 °C) and mounted in SlowFade (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence digital images were recorded using a charge-coupled device camera as described (14Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The FITC and Cy3 images were exported in TIFF format to Photoshop (Adobe) and superimposed. The numbers of red, green, and yellow (superimposed red and green) patches were counted on the computer screen, counting at least 100 patches per cell on 10–15 cells in each case. MC3T3 cells were transfected with the indicated BMP receptor constructs. 24 h (for Smad phosphorylation) or 44 h (for phosphorylation of p38) post-transfection, cells were starved for 24 h (Smad) or 5 h (p38 phosphorylation) in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FCS. The cells were then incubated with 20 nmBMP-2 in low serum for 30 min (Smad) or 90 min (p38) and solubilized in TNE lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Boehringer complete mixture and 1 mmPMSF) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, and 25 mm Na3VO4) for 10 min on ice. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE. C2C12 and MC3T3 cells (1 × 106 cells per well of 6-well dish) were transfected by electroporation using pSBE-luc (26Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and the indicated BMP receptor constructs as described by us earlier (14Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). After 7 h in complete medium, cells were starved in medium with 0.5% FCS (4–6 h) and incubated with or without 10 nm BMP-2 in low serum for additional 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured using a dual-luciferase assay system (Promega). C2C12 cells (1 × 106 cells per well of 6-well dish) were transfected by electroporation using 8 μg of pRL-Tk (Promega) as reference for transfection efficiency and 10 μg of BMP receptor constructs (in double-receptor transfections, 5 μg of each receptor; in transfections with a single BMP receptor, 5 μg of pcDNA1-βGal replaced the second BMP receptor construct). After 7 h in complete medium, cells were starved in medium with 0.2% FCS (4–6 h). They were incubated with or without 50 nm BMP-2 in low serum for 3 days. Renilla luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system from Promega. Lysates were normalized to protein content. Alkaline phosphatase was measured using standard protocols (27Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). To study hetero-complex formation between BRII and BRI-a or BRI-b, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies on COS7 cells co-transfected with a truncated HA-tagged BRII (HA-TC1, -TC3, -BRII-SF, -TC4, -TC5, -TC6, -TC7, -TC8; Fig.1) and myc-tagged BRI-a or BRI-b. After cell lysis, BRI-a or BRI-b were immunoprecipitated with α-myc antibodies or with polyclonal antisera recognizing the receptors specifically (14Gilboa L. Nohe A. Geissendorfer T. Sebald W. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Blots were analyzed with α-HA followed by peroxidase-goat-anti-mouse IgG. Whereas the BRII truncation mutants HA-TC8, -TC7, -TC6, -TC5, and -TC4 were able to be expressed in preformed complexes with myc-BRI-b (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–5), HA-TC3 was not (Fig. 2 A, lane 8). The expression of HA-TC3 was shown in cells transfected with HA-TC3 and myc-BRI-b, immunoprecipitated and blotted with the same antibody (α-HA) (Fig.2 A, lane 6).

https://openalex.org/W1663512656,"When voluntary saccadic eye movements are made to a silently ticking clock, observers sometimes think that the second hand takes longer than normal to move to its next position1. For a short period, the clock appears to have stopped (chronostasis). Here we show that the illusion occurs because the brain extends the percept of the saccadic target backwards in time to just before the onset of the saccade. This occurs every time we move the eyes but it is only perceived when an external time reference alerts us to the phenomenon. The illusion does not seem to depend on the shift of spatial attention that accompanies the saccade. However, if the target is moved unpredictably during the saccade, breaking perception of the target's spatial continuity, then the illusion disappears. We suggest that temporal extension of the target's percept is one of the mechanisms that ‘fill in’ the perceptual ‘gap’ during saccadic suppression. The effect is critically linked to perceptual mechanisms that identify a target's spatial stability."
https://openalex.org/W1851952707,"The activation of ubiquitin and related protein modifiers is catalysed by members of the E1 enzyme family that use ATP for the covalent self-attachment of the modifiers to a conserved cysteine. The Escherichia coli proteins MoeB and MoaD are involved in molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis, an evolutionarily conserved pathway. The MoeB- and E1-catalysed reactions are mechanistically similar, and despite a lack of sequence similarity, MoaD and ubiquitin display the same fold including a conserved carboxy-terminal Gly-Gly motif. Similar to the E1 enzymes, MoeB activates the C terminus of MoaD to form an acyl-adenylate. Subsequently, a sulphurtransferase converts the MoaD acyl-adenylate to a thiocarboxylate that acts as the sulphur donor during Moco biosynthesis. These findings suggest that ubiquitin and E1 are derived from two ancestral genes closely related to moaD and moeB. Here we present the crystal structures of the MoeB-MoaD complex in its apo, ATP-bound, and MoaD-adenylate forms, and highlight the functional similarities between the MoeB- and E1-substrate complexes. These structures provide a molecular framework for understanding the activation of ubiquitin, Rub, SUMO and the sulphur incorporation step during Moco and thiamine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2002645780,"The Escherichia coli H-NS protein is a nucleoid-associated protein involved in both transcription regulation and DNA compaction. Each of these processes involves H-NS-mediated bridge formation between adjacent DNA helices. With respect to transcription regulation, preferential binding sites in the promoter regions of different genes have been reported, and generally these regions are curved. Often H-NS binding sites overlap with promoter core regions or with binding sites of other regulatory factors. Not in all cases, however, transcriptional repression is the result of preferential binding by H-NS to promoter regions leading to occlusion of the RNA polymerase. In the case of the rrnB P1, H-NS actually stimulates open complex formation by forming a ternary RNAP.H-NS.DNA complex, while simultaneously stabilizing it to such an extent that promoter clearance cannot occur. To define the mechanism by which H-NS interferes at this step in the initiation pathway, the architecture of the RNAP.H-NS.DNA complex was analyzed by scanning force microscopy (SFM). The SFM images show that the DNA flanking the RNA polymerase in open initiation complexes is bridged by H-NS. On the basis of these data, we present a model for the specific repression of transcription initiation at the rrnB P1 by H-NS."
https://openalex.org/W1993984710,"Histamine has been shown to play a role in arthropod vision; it is the major neurotransmitter of arthropod photoreceptors. Histamine-gated chloride channels have been identified in insect optic lobes. We report the first isolation of cDNA clones encoding histamine-gated chloride channel subunits from the fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster. The encoded proteins, HisCl1 and HisCl2, share 60% amino acid identity with each other. The closest structural homologue is the human glycine α3 receptor, which shares 45 and 43% amino acid identity respectively. Northern hybridization analysis suggested that hisCl1 and hisCl2mRNAs are predominantly expressed in the insect eye. Oocytes injected with in vitro transcribed RNA, encoding either HisCl1 or HisCl2, produced substantial chloride currents in response to histamine but not in response to GABA, glycine, and glutamate. The histamine sensitivity was similar to that observed in insect laminar neurons. Histamine-activated currents were not blocked by picrotoxinin, fipronil, strychnine, or the H2 antagonist cimetidine. Co-injection of both hisCl1 and hisCl2 RNAs resulted in expression of a histamine-gated chloride channel with increased sensitivity to histamine, demonstrating coassembly of the subunits.

InDrosophila, immunocytochemistry has shown high levels of histamine in photoreceptors and their synapses (2Sarthy P.V. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1757-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Pollack I. Hofbauer A. Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 266: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Further, histidine decarboxylase activity has been demonstrated inDrosophila photoreceptors, suggesting that histamine is synthesized in these cells (2Sarthy P.V. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1757-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Drosophila mutants that are deficient in the hdc gene coding for histamine decarboxylase have been identified (4Burg M.G. Sarthy P.V. Koliantz G. Pak W.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and flies homozygous for the null mutation appear to be blind (5Melzig J. Buchner S. Wiebel F. Wolf R. Burg M. Pak W.L. Buchner E. J. Comp. Physiol. 1996; 179: 763-773Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although light-dependent release of histamine from photoreceptors has not yet been demonstrated, exposure of the fly postsynaptic neuron to histamine mimics the effects of light (6Hardie R.C. J. Comp. Physiol. 1987; 161: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Phototransduction of invertebrates has been most extensively studied in insects, but histamine has been implicated as a neurotransmitter in photoreceptors of several other invertebrate species including barnacles and the horseshoe crab Limulus (7Callaway J.C. Stuart A.E. Microsc Res Tech. 1999; 44: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Battelle B.A. Calman B.G. Andrews A.W. Grieco F.D. Mleziva M.B. Callaway J.C. Stuart A.E. J. Comp.

Brandstatter J.H. Fletcher E.L. Becker C.M. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 1411-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Outside of phototransduction, histamine also appears to be the neurotransmitter in some mechanosensory neurons inDrosophila (10Buchner E. Buchner S. Burg M.G. Hofbauer A. Pak W.L. Pollack I. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 273: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and in lobster stomatogastric, cardiac, and olfactory neurons (11Claiborne B.J. Selverston A.L. J.

Grunert U. Ache B.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1989; 145: 133-146PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the molecular nature of the histamine receptor in these neurons is unknown. The laminar neurons that are postsynaptic to insect photoreceptors respond to light with a rapid, chloride-mediated hyperpolarization that can be mimicked by application of histamine (6Hardie R.C. J. Comp. Physiol. 1987; 161: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These laminar neurons were isolated from optic lobes of several insect species, and the histamine receptor was characterized as a ligand-gated chloride channel (14Hardie R.C. Nature. 1989; 339: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 15Skingsley D.R. Laughlin S.B. Hardie R.C. J. Comp. Physiol. 1995; 176: 611-623Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We report the first cloning of two histamine-gated ion channel subunits. These subunits, HisCl1 and HisCl2, were cloned from Drosophilausing a genomics approach to identify novel sequences within theDrosophila genome that possess homology to ligand-gated ion channel subunits. When expressed in oocytes, the resulting channels are permeable to chloride and activated by histamine but are unaffected by several other neurotransmitters known to interact with ligand-gated ion channels. HisCl1 and HisCl2 subunits can form heteromultimeric channels with increased sensitivity to histamine. Heteromultimeric channels as well as HisCl1 homomultimers are reversibly activated by the insecticide ivermectin. All ivermectin used was in the form of ivermectin phosphate. Ivermectin phosphate and fipronil were from the Merck sample collection. All other compounds were from Sigma. The Drosophila genomic data base was searched for sequences with similarity to Drosophila GluClα (GenBankTM accession number U58776) using a Compugen Biocel XLP hardware search engine (Petach Tikva, Israel). Two sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AC007805 and AC007815) potentially encoding novel ligand-gated ion channels were identified from the genomic sequences. Exons from the hisCl1 gene were found on AC007805, whereas hisCl2 exons were found onAC007815. Drosophila total RNA was subjected to reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) using the following forward primers: for hisCl1,5′-CTTGCACAAAGCTGGCGTG-3′ and 5′-GTGAGCAGTATCGCATATTG-3′ and forhisCl2, 5′-TTTGCACAGACGTGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-ACAGGAATACCGCCTGCTC-3′; and the following reverse primers: forhisCl1, 5′-GTAGTTATTTGATATGTCTAGC-3′ and 5′-ACCTGTTGAGTACTCTATAG-3′ and for hisCl2,5′-TTCATTTCGGATGAGGGCCAC-3′. The amplified fragments were each ∼500 bp in length and were verified by sequencing. 5′ and 3′ cDNA sequences were obtained by the RACE procedure. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from Oregon R Drosophila using the Oligotex mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen), and double-stranded cDNA was generated using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). For 3′-RACE, two gene-specific forward primers for hisCl1 were 5′-CATCTTCCTTGCACAAAGCTGGCGTG-3′ and 5′-CATGAGTGAGCAGTATCGCATATTG-3′, and for hisCl2 were 5′-TGTGTTCTTTGCACAGACGTGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-TATGACACAGGAATACCGCCTGCTC-3′. For 5′-RACE, two gene-specific reverse primers were as follows: for hisCl1,5′-GTCTAGCTGCGGCAACTCAATCTCCGTG-3′ and 5′-CTCGATCATCATGGAGCAGATTTGCGTG-3′ and for hisCl2,5′-CGCCGTTTCATTTCGGATGAGGGCCAC-3′ and 5′-CAGGCTTTCCATTTGCAGCTTGCACTCC-3′. First round PCR and nested PCR were performed according to the protocol of the Marathon cDNA amplification kit with a modified 5′-RACE PCR cycle: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 1 min; 5 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 4 min; followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Miniprep DNA was screened by restriction digestion. 5–8 clones of each PCR reaction were sequenced. The following primers were designed to generate full-length clones forhisCl1, forward primer 5′-CAATCGTCGCGATAACTCTGCCG-3′, reverse primers 5′-CCTTTATTTATACACTACATGGTAATC-3′ and 5′-TGTTTACGCTCTATTCCTTCGGAG-3′; and for hisCl2, forward primer 5′-AACTGCCAAGACGTTTAGAACGG-3′ and reverse primers 5′-TACAATTCACTTAGGCTACATCAGC-3′ and 5′-GGCTACATCAGCTACTACGTCAC-3′. The first round PCR thermal cycle was: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min; 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 2 min 30 s; 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s; and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. The second round PCR cycle was programmed as: 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min; 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s; 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s; 20 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s; and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. The Advantage 2 PCR Kit purchased fromCLONTECH was used to generate cDNA with 2 μl of the first PCR product as the template. The cDNA PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The amino acid sequences of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans non-acetylcholine ligand-gated ion channels and human GABA- and glycine-gated ion channels were truncated after the third transmembrane domain and aligned using the MultiClustal approach (16Yuan J. Amend A. Borkowski J. DeMarco R. Bailey W. Liu Y. Xie G. Blevins R. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 862-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) for an optimized multiple sequence alignment. The best alignment was achieved using ClustalW version 1.8 and a pairwise gap opening penalty of 13, a gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the PAM series matrix. The multiple alignment gap opening penalty was 5 with a gap extension penalty of 0.095 using the Identity matrix. The protein sequences used in Figs. 1 and 2 were derived from the following GenBankTMaccession numbers: sw:q08832, sw:p25123, sw:p34903, sw:p18505, sw:o14764, sw:p78334, sw:q99928, sw:o00591, sw:p24046, sw:p23415, sw:p48167, pir:s50864, gp:u41113, gp:AJ002232, pir:s60749, rsp:np_061028. The neighbor-joining plot shown in Fig. 2 was also constructed using the MultiClustal approach. The pairwise alignment gap opening penalty was 20 with a gap extension penalty of 0.5 using the PAM series matrix. The multiple alignment gap opening penalty was 11 with a gap extension penalty of 0.1 using the Identity matrix. The resulting alignment was bootstrapped 1000× in ClustalW, and the derived neighbor-joining plot was constructed using TreeView.Figure 2Phylogenetic analysis. The neighbor-joining plot was derived from an optimized multiple sequence alignment of Drosophila and C. elegansnon-acetylcholine ligand-gated ion channels and human GABA- and glycine-gated chloride channels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Total RNA was prepared from whole flies and heads of adult Oregon R and Eya (eyes absent)Drosophila using the Trizol protocol (Invitrogen) and size separated on a 1.5% Seakem GTG-agarose/formaldehyde gel. Approximately 10 μg of RNA was transferred to a nylon-based membrane and hybridized at high stringency (50% formamide, 2× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSCPE, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (at 42 °C for >20 h) with a probe specific for hisCl2 and washed for 30 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 58 °C, followed by a wash for 30 min in 0.2× SSC, and 0.1% SDS at 58 °C. The membrane was then stripped in 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% sodium pyrophosphate, and 1× Denhardt's at 65 °C for 1.5 h and re-hybridized under the same conditions with a probe specific forhisCl1. The following primers were used to generate the DNA probes: for hisCl1, forward, 5′-CAATCGTCGCGATAACTCTGCCG-3′; reverse, 5′-TGTTTACGCTCTATTCCTTCGG-3′; and forhisCl2, forward, 5′-AGGACATCAAGCGTTACGAC-3′; reverse, 5′-AGTTTCGGCTTGGGTAGTTC-3′. A PCR strategy was used to add the T7 promoter sequence upstream of the initiating methionine and a poly(A)+ tail following the stop codon. The primers used for generating in vitro transcribed RNA were as follows: for hisCl1,5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGGTGTTCATAATGCAAAGCC-3′ and 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCATAGGAACGTTGTCCAATAGAC-3′; and forhisCl2, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCACATTAAAATGGTGTTC-3′ and 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCTTATAGATACTCGTAGAAC-3′. PCR products were purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and were used directly as templates in the in vitro transcription reaction (mMessage mMachineTM, Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. After unincorporated nucleotides and cap analog were removed using G-50 spin columns, the RNA was recovered by phenol/CHCl3 extraction followed by LiCl or isopropyl alcohol precipitation, and resuspended in nuclease-free water at a final concentration of 200 ng/μl. In vitro transcribed RNAs encoding hisCl1 andhisCl2 were injected into X. laevis oocytes for electrophysiological analysis. Oocytes were prepared as previously described (17Arena J.P. Liu K.K. Paress P.S. Cully D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 368-374PubMed Google Scholar) and were studied by two-electrode voltage clamp for 1–4 days following an injection with 50 nl of 100 ng/μl RNA. Co-injections used 50 nl of 100 ng/μl of each RNA species or 200 ng/μl total RNA. In one experiment where the RNA concentration was lowered to 1 ng/μl, no differences were seen in channel properties including histamine sensitivity. Currents were measured using a Dagan CA-1 amplifier interfaced to a Macintosh 7100/80 computer. Data were acquired at 100 Hz using Pulse software (Heka Electronics). During recording, oocytes were continuously superfused with a solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.5 mm BaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Drugs were dissolved in Me2SO and applied in the recording solution at ≤0.1% Me2SO. All experiments were performed at room temperature from a holding potential of 0 mV. At this holding potential, endogenous currents were 77 ± 20 nA in 14 mock-injected or uninjected oocytes from three frogs. In comparison, histamine-activated currents were typically in the range of 1–2 μA. Between experiments, oocytes were held at −30 mV, close to the oocyte resting potential. Histamine dose-response curves were fit to the Hill equation of the form: I = Imax/(1 + (EC50/L)n), where n is the Hill coefficient, L is the concentration of drug, and Imax is the current activated by saturating drug concentrations. To identify novel invertebrate ligand-gated ion channels, theDrosophila genomic data base was examined for sequences sharing homology with the Drosophila glutamate-gated chloride channel subunit GluClα. Two partial sequences were identified, AC007805 (hisCl1) and AC007815(hisCl2), which are located on Drosophila melanogaster chromosome 3 at map positions 86F and 92B, respectively. The full-length cDNAs, hisCl1 (1518 nucleotides) and hisCl2 (2073 nucleotides), corresponding to these partial sequences were cloned by PCR and 5′- and 3′-RACE. ThehisCl1 and hisCl2 cDNAs contain 199 and 330 nucleotides 5′of the open reading frame with TGA and TAA stop codons at base 1477 and 1785, respectively. The largest open reading frames share 67% nucleotide identity and predict proteins of 426 and 485 amino acids for HisCl1 and HisCl2 respectively, which share 60% amino acid identity (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequences for both genes contain four predicted transmembrane regions (M1–M4) and four cysteine residues homologous to the cysteine residues conserved in all glycine- and glutamate-gated chloride channels. HisCl1 and HisCl2 share the greatest identity with human glycine receptor α subunits and exhibit 45 and 43% amino acid identity with human Gly α3, respectively (Fig. 1). A cDNA clone encoding HisCl1 and containing a four amino acid deletion (Ser375-Ala-Leu-Gln378) within the M3–M4 intracellular loop was identified suggesting the existence of splice variants. No functional difference between the two clones was observed, and data shown were obtained with the larger of the two. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that HisCl1 and HisCl2 subunits are most closely related to the human glycine receptor α and β subunits as shown in the neighbor-joining plot of Fig.2. Both the human glycine receptors and the HisCl channels reside in the same subclade, whereas the invertebrate glutamate and vertebrate GABA receptors are found in separate subclades. These results suggest that the glycine receptors and the HisCl channels share a common ancestor. To date, glycine-gated chloride channels have not been identified in invertebrates.Drosophila rdl, a GABA-gated chloride channel subunit, is the most closely related insect homologue to the HisCl proteins. Likewise, human GABA receptors appear to be closely related to the HisCl proteins, although more distantly than the glycine receptors. Expression of the hisCl genes was assessed by Northern hybridization analysis of RNA of wild-type and eyelessDrosophila strains (Fig. 3). Total RNA was isolated from whole animals and heads of wild-typeOregon R and the vision-deficient mutantEya, which lacks eyes and lamina and has a smaller medulla.hisCl1 and hisCl2 DNA probes hybridized with transcripts in RNAs isolated from heads of both strains. The size of the detected transcripts was ∼2 kb for hisCl1 and 2.5 kb for hisCl2, in agreement with predictions from the primary sequence. No hybridization was detected in the lanes corresponding to whole Drosophila RNA from either strain, suggesting thathisCl1 and hisCl2 are primarily expressed in the head. Further, the intensity of the bands detected by hisCl1and hisCl2 in head RNA from Oregon R flies was greater than that seen with Eya flies, indicating that the two genes are most abundantly expressed in Drosophilaeyes. Injection of hisCl1 RNA into Xenopus oocytes resulted in expression of substantial histamine-activated currents not seen in uninjected oocytes (Fig.4A). At a holding potential of 0 mV, micromolar concentrations of histamine rapidly activated outward currents that deactivated quickly after wash-out of histamine. In the same oocytes, 1 mm glutamate, glycine, aspartate, GABA and acetylcholine failed to elicit a response. The insecticide ivermectin activated a current, although with a much slower time-course. The current produced in response to 1 μm ivermectin was ∼10% of the histamine-activated current (Fig. 4A); the average value seen in eight oocytes was 13 ± 5%. Compared with glutamate-gated chloride channels, HisCl1 channels were less sensitive to ivermectin, and the response was readily reversible upon wash-out. Under standard recording conditions, histamine-activated currents reversed at −21 mV, consistent with the equilibrium potential for chloride. Reducing the extracellular chloride concentration from 105 to 14 mm, by substituting gluconate for chloride, produced a 29 mV positive shift in the reversal potential and greatly reduced the outward current during voltage ramps from −120 to +60 mV (Fig.4B). These results suggest that in hisCl1RNA-injected oocytes, histamine activates a chloride conductance. Oocyte injection of hisCl2 RNA also resulted in histamine-activated chloride currents insensitive to glutamate, glycine, GABA, and acetylcholine (Fig. 4C). In contrast to HisCl1-expressing oocytes, 1 μm ivermectin did not activate measurable currents or potentiate histamine-activated currents in oocytes injected with hisCl2 RNA. Neither HisCl1 nor HisCl2 channels were blocked by 10 μm fipronil, picrotoxinin, or strychnine, drugs known to block other ligand-gated chloride channels, or by 10 μm of the H2 antagonist cimetidine (data not shown). Co-injection of hisCl1 and hisCl2 RNAs produced a spontaneous current in the absence of channel agonists. This spontaneous current was dependent on external chloride concentration and reversed near the predicted reversal potential for a chloride current (data not shown). It was seen in all oocytes co-injected withhisCl1 and hisCl2 RNAs, but not in oocytes injected with equal amounts of either RNA alone or with either RNA combined with RNA-encoding Drosophila GluClα. The spontaneous current is thought to result from the opening of heteromeric channels in the absence of an agonist, although direct proof for this hypothesis awaits the discovery of a HisCl channel blocker. Application of micromolar and submicromolar concentrations of histamine but not glutamate, glycine, GABA, or acetylcholine activated additional current (Fig. 4D). Oocytes expressing both subunits were more sensitive to histamine than oocytes expressing HisCl1 or HisCl2 homomultimers. Representative histamine dose-response curves are shown in Fig. 4E. Fitting the data to the Hill equation yielded an EC50 of 0.78 μm for thehisCl1 and hisCl2 co-injected oocytes as compared with 3.1 and 15.5 for the hisCl1-injected and thehisCl2-injected oocytes, respectively. Average EC50 were 0.87 ± 0.38 μm (mean ± S.D., n = 4) for the coexpression of hisCl1and hisCl2, 4.2 ± 1.3 μm(n = 3) for hisCl1, and 14.0 ± 2.5 μm (n = 5) for hisCl2. Statistical analysis shows that the EC50 obtained with oocytes coexpressing HisCl1 and HisCl2 was significantly different from that obtained with expression of either clone alone (p< 0.05). Therefore, HisCl1 and HisCl2 subunits appear to form a functional heteromultimer with properties distinct from the two homomultimers. Histamine dose-response curves in co-injected oocytes were slightly less steep than those in oocytes injected with either subunit alone, illustrated by a Hill coefficient of 1.3 ± 0.1 (n = 4) for coinjected oocytes compared with 1.6 ± 0.5 (n = 3) and 2.7 ± 1.0 (n = 5) for hisCl1- and hisCl2-injected oocytes respectively. A possible explanation for the reduced steepness is the presence of HisCl1 and/or HisCl2 homomultimers in addition to the heteromultimer. Like HisCl1 homomultimers, the heteromultimer was reversibly activated by micromolar concentrations of ivermectin (Fig.4D). In oocytes co-injected with hisCl1 andhisCl2 RNAs, 1 μm ivermectin activated 46 ± 13% (n = 7) of the current activated by saturating concentrations of histamine (data not shown), compared with 13 ± 5% (n = 8, p < 0.001) in oocytes expressing HisCl1 alone. The increased sensitivity to ivermectin in the co-injected oocytes is inconsistent with activation of a subpopulation of HisCl1 homomultimers and provides further evidence for the formation of HisCl1/HisCl2 heteromultimers. DNAs encoding two histamine-gated chloride channel subunits from the fruit fly D. melanogaster have been cloned and expressed in oocytes. The subunits, HisCl1 and HisCl2, belong to the family of ligand-gated chloride channels and are phylogenetically related to vertebrate glycine-gated channel α subunits. Histamine is known as a neurotransmitter in arthropod photoreceptors and histamine-activated chloride conductances, as well as single channels, have been reported in insect laminar neurons. The histamine sensitivity and pharmacology obtained with oocytes expressing HisCl1 and/or HisCl2 were similar to what has been reported for native histamine-activated chloride channels from insect laminar neurons (14Hardie R.C. Nature. 1989; 339: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 15Skingsley D.R. Laughlin S.B. Hardie R.C. J. Comp. Physiol. 1995; 176: 611-623Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We propose that HisCl1 and HisCl2 are the molecular correlates of the histamine-gated chloride channels known to play a role in arthropod phototransduction. Northern blot analysis suggested that hisCl1 andhisCl2 are predominantly expressed in theDrosophila eye. Earlier observations have shown that histamine synthesis and histidine decarboxylase activity are reduced in extracts of Eya heads compared with extracts of wild-type heads ( Sarthy, Ref. 2Sarthy P.V. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1757-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hisCl2 is located in a region on chromosome 3 known to contain genes that play a role in the visual system. The ora transientless orort gene was mapped to an interval includinghisCl2, and mutations in the ort gene lead to visual behavior-defective phenotypes (18The FlyBase ConsortiumNucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Electroretinograms obtained from ort mutants lack the membrane potential transients typically seen at the onset and offset of a light stimulus (19O'Tousa J.E. Leonard D.S. Pak W.L. J. Neurogenetics. 1989; 6: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because these transients originate from cells in the lamina (20Coombe P.E. J. Comp. Physiol. 1986; 159: 655-665Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the ort gene may play a role in photoreceptor signaling (19O'Tousa J.E. Leonard D.S. Pak W.L. J. Neurogenetics. 1989; 6: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been postulated that theort gene may encode a histamine-gated ion channel. The chromosomal map location of hisCl2 is consistent withhisCl2 being the ort gene; however, future identification of the molecular nature of the genetic defects inort mutants will confirm whether hisCl2 is theort gene. The hisCl1 gene maps to a region on chromosome 3 separate from ort, and genes involved inDrosophila phototransduction or vision have not been reported in this region. Both hisCl1 and hisCl2 mRNAs appear to be abundant in wild-type Drosophila eyes. In oocytes HisCl1 and HisCl2 form functional heteromultimeric channels. However, the subunit composition of the native channel in laminar neurons is not known. Histamine dose-response curves in Drosophila laminar neurons were characterized by an EC50 of 24 μm (15Skingsley D.R. Laughlin S.B. Hardie R.C. J. Comp. Physiol. 1995; 176: 611-623Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and EC50s ranging from 16 to 60 were found for four other insect species (14Hardie R.C. Nature. 1989; 339: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 15Skingsley D.R. Laughlin S.B. Hardie R.C. J. Comp. Physiol. 1995; 176: 611-623Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In oocytes, the histamine sensitivity of HisCl2 homomultimers most closely matches that seen in native neurons, suggesting that HisCl2 is the major subunit expressed in these neurons. Assuming that the ort gene is HisCl2, this predominant expression of HisCl2 would also explain the absence of on- and off-transients in electroretinograms from ort flies. However, if HisCl2 homomultimers underlie the chloride conductances in laminar neurons, the role of HisCl1 remains unclear. The low level expression of hisCl RNAs detected inEya heads parallels the low levels of histamine synthesis found in locust optic lobe and metathoracic ganglion (21Elias M.S. Evans P.D. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that HisCl channels serve a function outside of phototransduction, and a growing body of evidence suggests that histamine is the neurotransmitter in Drosophilamechanosensory neurons (5Melzig J. Buchner S. Wiebel F. Wolf R. Burg M. Pak W.L. Buchner E. J. Comp. Physiol. 1996; 179: 763-773Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Buchner E. Buchner S. Burg M.G. Hofbauer A. Pak W.L. Pollack I.

In addition to arthropods, histamine functions as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the mammalian brain, and histaminergic neurons play an important role in thermoregulation, cardiovascular control, and arousal (23Schwartz J.-C. Arrang J.-M. Garbarg M. Pollard H. Ruat M. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Three pharmacologically distinct receptor subtypes (H1–H3) have been described and cloned (24Gantz I. Schaffer M. DelValle J. Logsdon C. Campbell V. Uhler M. Yamada T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 25Yamashita M. Fukui H. Sugama K. Horio Y. Ito S. Mizuguchi H. Wada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). All three subtypes appear to be G-protein coupled receptors and share no significant sequence homology with hisCl1 or hisCl2. Recently, Hatton and Yang (28Hatton G.I. Yang Q.Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2974-2982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) inferred the existence of a mammalian ionotropic histamine receptor from electrophysiological and pharmacological studies of an intact synapse in slices of rat hypothalamus. Histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary (TM) region of the hypothalamus are well characterized and project to many areas of the brain including the supraoptic nucleus, hippocampus, and brain stem (23Schwartz J.-C. Arrang J.-M. Garbarg M. Pollard H. Ruat M. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). In the supraoptic nucleus, projections from the TM region synapse on vasopressin and oxytocin neurons. Studying the histaminergic input to oxytocin neurons, Yang and Hatton (27Yang Q.Z. Hatton G.I. Neuroscience. 1994; 61: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) found that TM region stimulation inhibited oxytocin neurons by activating a chloride conductance that was insensitive to bicuculline and strychnine and blocked by picrotoxin and the H2 antagonists famotidine and cimetidine (27Yang Q.Z. Hatton G.I. Neuroscience. 1994; 61: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Hatton G.I. Yang Q.Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2974-2982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the inhibition of oxytocin neurons did not appear to be G-protein mediated, Hatton and Yang concluded that it was caused by activation of histamine-gated chloride channels with pharmacology overlapping that of H2 receptors. In contrast to the chloride conductance described by Yang and Hatton, HisCl1 and/or HisCl2 channels expressed in oocytes were not sensitive to block by picrotoxin and cimetidine. A search of the human genomic data base did not reveal any obvious human homologues of the Drosophila hisCl1 andhisCl2 genes. Until the molecular nature of the channels underlying the inhibitory chloride conductance in oxytocin neurons has been determined, the existence of human homologues of HisCl1 and HisCl2 remains uncertain.

The SMN complex plays an important role in the cytoplasmic assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and likely other RNPs in pre-mRNA splicing and in the assembly of transcriptosomes.

Furthermore, Gemin5 interacts with several of the snRNP core proteins including SmB, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, and SmE, suggesting that it participates in the activities of the SMN complex in snRNP assembly. Immunolocalization studies demonstrate that Gemin5 is found in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, where it colocalizes with SMN in gems. The presence of 13 WD repeat domains in the amino-terminal half of Gemin5 and a coiled-coil motif near its carboxyl terminus indicate that it may form a large heteromeric complex and engage in multiple interactions.

Furthermore, SMN is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, most likely by ensuring the regeneration of functionally active snRNPs or other components of the spliceosome (19Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N.

The identification of all the constituents of the SMN complex is an essential step toward understanding the precise molecular mechanism of SMN function in these processes. Here we report the identification by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7832) Google Scholar, 33Wilm M.

Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar), the molecular cloning, and the characterization of a novel component of the SMN complex that we term Gemin5. Gemin5 is a novel, large tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat protein that binds to SMN both in vivo and in vitro. In HeLa cells, Gemin5, like the other components of the SMN complex, is found in the cytoplasm, the nucleoplasm, and in nuclear foci where it colocalizes with SMN. cDNA corresponding to the open reading frame of Gemin5 was amplified from a HeLa cDNA library using sequence-specific primers and Pfu Turbo (Stratagene). The full-length cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1D/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen). For amino-terminal GST fusion, a partial Gemin5 cDNA encoding amino acids 43–1508 was cloned into the pGex-5x-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Furthermore, a partial Gemin5 cDNA encoding amino acids 694–1508 was cloned into the pET28b vector (Novagen). The plasmid constructs for the Sm proteins, His-SMN, and His-SmB were previously described (13Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

Anti-Gemin5 antiserum was produced in mice as follows; His-Gemin5 (amino acids 694–1508) was expressed from a pET bacterial expression system (Novagen) in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by electro-elution from the insoluble fraction. Polyclonal antiserum was prepared by immunizing Balb/C mice with this purified, carboxyl-terminal half of Gemin5. Subsequent to immunoprecipitation from total HeLa cell extract using anti-Gemin3 (11G9) and anti-SMN (2B1) mouse monoclonal antibodies, a protein band of ∼170 kDa was excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. The protein was reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin in-gel (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7832) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides in the supernatant were desalted and concentrated on an OligoR2 (Perseptive) micro column packed in a GELoader tip (Eppendorf). Mass mapping and sequencing was performed on a QSTAR Pulsar mass spectrometer (MDS Sciex, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (MDS Proteomics, Denmark). Peptide sequence tags (35Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar) were assigned in the spectra and searched against the EST division of GenBankTM using the Protein and Peptide Software Suite (PPSS) from MDS Proteomics. HeLa and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed using the Geneporter system as specified by the manufacturer (Gene Therapy Systems). Transfected cells were processed for coimmunoprecipitation experiments 24 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitations were performed using total HEK293T cell lysate prepared in the presence of RSB-200 buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2) containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.)-bound anti-V5 antibody or GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.)-bound 2B1 antibody as previously described (34Pinol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and immunoblotting was conducted according to Liu et al. (13Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin as follows; anti-V5 1:1000; anti-Gemin5 1:500; 2B1 1:1000; 2E17 1:500; 12H12 1:500; 17D10 1:500; peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG plus IgM 1:4000. HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were briefly washed in PBS, fixed in 2% formaldehyde PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in acetone for 1 min at −20 °C. Cells were blocked in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. For double-labeling immunofluorescence experiments, incubations with anti-Gemin5 antiserum and anti-SMN/exon7 antibody were followed by incubations with the respective secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG for anti-Gemin5 and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG for anti-SMN/exon7). Incubations were carried out for 1 h at room temperature, and all antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (anti-Gemin5 1:250; anti-SMN/exon7 1:500; Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 1:500). Laser confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Leica TCS four-dimensional confocal microscope. GST-Gemin5 fusion protein was expressed from the pGex-5x-1 vector in the E. colistrain BL21 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as specified by the manufacturer. All proteins tested were produced by in vitro-coupled transcription and translation (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using full-length cDNAs. 2 μg of purified GST, GST-SMN, GST-Gemin2 (13Liu Q.

S. Biochemical Corp.). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were pelleted and washed five times with RSB-200. Subsequently, the bound fractions were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved on 11.5 or 15% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were fixed and processed for fluorography by treatment with Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For direct binding, purified GST or GST-Gemin5 proteins (2 μg) bound to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were incubated with 1 μg of purified T7/His-tagged SMN or T7/His-tagged SmB (14Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) in 0.5 ml of RSB-200 buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed 6 times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer. The bound fraction was eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-T7 tag antibody (Novagen; diluted 1:10,000 in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin). We have previously identified proteins that associate with SMN in vivo by coimmunoprecipitations followed by mass spectrometry of the immunopurified proteins (13Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), Gemin3 (14Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and Gemin4 (16Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Yong J. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and contains Sm proteins (13Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, we here describe the identification of one of the last major constituents of the SMN complex that has not yet been characterized, a protein of ∼170 kDa that consistently coimmunoprecipitates with anti-SMN and anti-Gemin3 antibodies from total HeLa cell lysates (Fig.1). The 170-kDa protein band was digested with trypsin, and more than 20 of the recovered peptides were sequenced using nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7832) Google Scholar, 33Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). During sequencing, real-time data base searches were performed. Three partial cDNA clones with the GenBankTM accession numbersAK022748, AL117665, and BC008776 were retrieved using the peptide sequence tag algorithm. Upon alignment, these overlapping cDNAs are predicted to encode a putative protein of 1,508 amino acid residues. Clone AK022748 codes for the amino portion of the protein and comprises 741 amino acids. The predicted first methionine is preceded by an upstream in-frame stop codon. Clones AL117665 and BC008776 code for 1,224 amino acid and 921 amino acid segments of the protein, respectively, and include its carboxyl terminus. 51 peptide masses matched to the assembled protein sequence covering 375 of the 1,508 amino acid residues (25% sequence coverage at a mass accuracy below 15 ppm). Using sequence-specific primers, we isolated the full-length cDNA of this novel protein from a HeLa cDNA library. The open reading frame predicts a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 168.5 kDa and an estimated pI of 6.14 (amino acid sequence given in Fig. 2 B). Because this protein is a component of the SMN complex and colocalized with SMN in nuclear foci (see below), we name it Gemin5.Figure 2Gemin5 encodes a protein containing 13 WD repeats and a coiled-coil motif. A, schematic representation of the modular structure of Gemin5. WD repeat domains are marked by red ovals, and the coiled-coil motif is marked by a blue oval. B, amino acid sequence of human Gemin5. Amino acids that constitute WD repeats are typed inwhite with a red background, and the ones that form the coiled-coil motif are in white with a blue background. The Gemin5 GenBank accession number is AY063750.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further analysis of the Gemin5 sequence using various protein motif search engines revealed the presence of up to 13 WD repeats in its amino-terminal half and a coiled-coil near its carboxyl terminus (Rep-V1.1 search tool (37Andrade M.A. Ponting C.P. Gibson T.J. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 521-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar); MultiCoil software (38Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar); schematically depicted in Fig. 2 A). WD repeats form stable propeller-shaped platforms that serve as protein-protein interaction domains (39Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Given the fact that Gemin5 contains 13 of these repeats (Rep-V1.1 search tool (37Andrade M.A. Ponting C.P. Gibson T.J. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 521-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)), the protein may either shape one large propeller structure or possibly two or more smaller ones (39Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil formed by amino acids 1362–1392 is predicted to permit Gemin5 to oligomerize as a trimer (maximum trimeric residue probability of 0.67, MultiCoil software (38Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar)). To further confirm that Gemin5 is part of the SMN complexin vivo, we constructed a V5 epitope tag of the Gemin5 open reading frame, transfected it into HEK293T cells, and performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Total cell lysates were prepared from V5-Gemin5-transfected cells, and immunoprecipitations were carried out using the anti-V5 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted, and probed with several antibodies specific for known components of the SMN complex. As shown in Fig.3 A, the anti-V5 antibody specifically immunoprecipitated SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3, and Gemin4 (second lane). These proteins were neither detectable in similar immunoprecipitates from untransfected HEK293T cells using the anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 3 A, third lane) nor in immunoprecipitates from transfected cells using the non-immune antibody SP2/0 (Fig. 3 A, fourth lane). Furthermore, the abundant heterogeneous nuclear RNP A1 protein was not present in the anti-V5 immunoprecipitate, providing additional evidence for the specificity of the immunoprecipitations. In a reciprocal approach, total cell lysates from untransfected HEK293T cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-SMN antibody 2B1, and the immunoprecipitate was probed with anti-Gemin5 antiserum. This antiserum specifically recognized a single protein of the expected size of Gemin5 on an immunoblot of total HeLa cell lysate (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Fig. 3 C, Western blotting of the 2B1 immunoprecipitate using the anti-Gemin5 antiserum provided further evidence that Gemin5 associates with SMN in vivo(second lane). The absence of a detectable signal for Gemin5 in the SP2/0 immunoprecipitate further confirmed the specificity of the immunoprecipitations (Fig. 3 C, third lane). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Gemin5 is a component of the SMN complex in vivo. To determine the subcellular localization of Gemin5, we performed indirect laser confocal immunofluoresence microscopy using mouse polyclonal anti-Gemin5 antiserum on HeLa cells. As depicted in Fig.4 A, the anti-Gemin5 antiserum displayed a strong general staining throughout the cytoplasm. In the nucleus, there was a weaker but significant staining of the nucleoplasm and a prominent labeling of nuclear foci (see below; Ref. 17Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This localization pattern is similar to that of SMN, Gemin2, and Gemin3 and partially overlaps with that of Gemin4, which is also detectable in the nucleoli (13Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 14Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J.

Most strikingly, Gemin5 and SMN colocalize in gems, as demonstrated by double-labeling immunofluorescence using a polyclonal anti-SMN antibody and anti-Gemin5 antiserum (Figs. 4, A, B, and merged imageC). To perform these double-labeling experiments, we used a rabbit polyclonal anti-SMN antibody because none of our anti-SMN monoclonal antibodies were compatible with the mouse polyclonal anti-Gemin5 antiserum. This rabbit antibody and the various mouse monoclonal anti-SMN antibodies we have show a very similar staining pattern to that seen for Gemin5 (13Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G.

In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant activities of ebselen using a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated mouse skin model. Double pretreatments of mouse skin with ebselen significantly inhibited TPA-induced formation of thiobarbituric acid-reacting substance, known as an overall oxidative damage biomarker, in mouse epidermis, suggesting that ebselen indeed acts as an antioxidant in mouse skin. The antioxidative effect of ebselen is attributed to its selective blockade of leukocyte infiltration and activation leading to attenuation of the H2O2level. In in vitro studies, ebselen inhibited TPA-induced superoxide generation in differentiated HL-60 cells and lipopolysaccharide-induced cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression in RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time that ebselen potentiated phase II enzyme activities, including NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase1 and glutathioneS-transferase in cultured hepatocytes and in mouse skin.

Chronic inflammation appears to be linked to epithelial tumorigenesis in the lung, the bowel, the bladder, the colon, and the skin. Although the mechanisms by which inflammatory cells show their carcinogenic effects remain unclear, some potential pathways have been proposed (1Cerutti P.A. Trump B.F. Cancer Cell. 1991; 3: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with UV light, endotoxins, or chemical tumor promoters are known to lead to chemotaxis, differentiation, and infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes, including granulocytes and monocytes, which produce reactive oxygen species (ROS),1 prostaglandins (PGs), and cytokines. In fact, there is mounting evidence showing treatments of mouse skin with single or multiple doses of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induce production of superoxide anion (O⨪2) (2Schwarz M.

Thus, leukocyte activation resulting in ROS generation coupled to excessive production of chemotactic factors may play an important role in chronic inflammation and hyperplasia in mouse skin (7Nakamura Y.

Double applications of phorbol esters was required for triggering production of ROS, including H2O2, lipid hydroperoxide, and peroxy radicals in mouse skin (9Kensler T.W. Egner P.A. Moore K.G.

Ji C. Blair I.A. Marnett L.J. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2937-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The available data reported previously suggested that each application induces two distinguishable biochemical events, namely, “priming” and “activation” (10Ji C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17842-17878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The former is characterized as recruitment of inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes by chemotactic factors to inflammatory regions and edema formation. The latter is the process of activation of neutrophil- or other oxidant-producing cells, including keratinocytes, in which the second TPA application of phorbol ester induces oxidative stress. In addition, Sisskin et al. (21Sisskin E.E. Gray T. Barrett J.C. Carcinogenesis. 1982; 3: 1459-1463Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) pointed out that the result of a single topical application of TPA might not predict the response with multiple treatments for tumor promotion. Conversely, our recent studies have suggested that the double TPA application experiment is appropriate to predict the inhibitory potential of test compounds for chronic inflammation or tumor promotion in epithelial tissues, including not only skin but also digestive tract (22Tanaka T. Kawabata K. Kakumoto M. Makita H. Matsunaga K. Mori H. Satoh K. Hara A. Murakami A. Ohigashi H. Koshimizu K. Jpn. J.

Ebselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one; see Fig. 1 below) is a non-toxic seleno-organic drug that has been extensively studied during the last decade. It is now under active investigation as a neuroprotective agent in clinical trial (25Parnham M. Sies H. Exp. Opin. Invest. Drug. 2000; 9: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A substantial part of the pharmacological profile of ebselen appears to be due to its action as an antioxidant with a unique mode of action. A number of other antioxidants such as α-tocopherol and probucol act as scavengers of free radicals and thus prevent lipid peroxidation, including secondary reaction triggered by them. In contrast, ebselen is a poor radical scavenger, if at all, but it is an effective scavenger of organic hydroperoxides, in particular, of lipid hydroperoxides. Thus, the particular interest in this drug is that ebselen mimics glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities in particular that of phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx (26Maiorino M. Roveri A. Ursini F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 295: 404-409Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There is some indication that the pseudoenzymatic catalytic activity may contribute in part to the pharmacodynamic profile of ebselen. However, it becomes plausible that ebselen displays a unique pattern of chemical reactions, which is not restricted to the GPx reaction (for review, see Ref. 27Schewe T. Gen. Pharmcol. 1995; 26: 1153-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Ebselen actually inhibits at low concentrations a number of enzymes involved in inflammation such as lipoxygenases, nitric-oxide synthases, NADPH oxidase, protein kinase C, and H+/K+-ATPase (26Maiorino M. Roveri A. Ursini F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 295: 404-409Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ebselen also suppresses inflammation in a variety of experimental animal models. Although its antioxidant capacities have been extensively investigated, relatively little is known about its anticarcinogenic activity. A previous study showed that ebselen inhibited TPA-induced down-regulation in gap-junctional intercellular communication (28Hu J. Engman L. Cotgreave I.A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Reduction of gap-junctional intercellular communication has been proposed to be involved in the development of a number of pathogeneses, especially carcinogenesis. More recently, inhibition of ebselen on aflatoxin B1-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in Fischer 344 rats and involvement of its antioxidative property in the anticarcinogenic effect have been reported (29Yang C.-F. Liu J. Wasser S. Shen H.-M. Tan C.-E. Ong C.N. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 2237-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic aspect of ebselen as an antioxidant in inflammatory oxidative events responsible for tumor promotion remains to be fully elucidated and is the topic of this report. In the present study, we attempted to determine whether ebselen inhibits the priming and/or activation stages in the double TPA application model of mouse skin. To discuss the mode of action mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of ebselen, the suppressive effect of ebselen on COX-2 expression was examined. Our studies also demonstrated for the first time that addition of ebselen to cultured rat liver epithelial cells and mouse skin results in induction of phase II enzyme, including glutathione S-transferase (GST) and NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase (NQO1), which may also participate in in vivo antioxidative effect of ebselen. Ebselen was kindly provided from Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. TPA was obtained from Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA. RPMI 1640 medium was purchased from Invitrogen, Rockville, MD. All other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan. Female ICR mice (7 weeks old) were obtained from Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan. Until the day of the experiment, mice were allowed free access to drink water and a commercial laboratory diet (MF; Oriental Yeast Co., Kyoto, Japan). Animals were treated in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation of Kyoto University and Nagoya University. Animals were maintained in a room controlled at 24 ± 2 °C with a relative humidity of 60 ± 5% and a 12-h light/dark cycle (6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.). The back of each mouse was shaved with surgical clippers 2 days before each experiment. One group was composed of five female ICR mice housed five per cage. Ebselen was topically applied to the shaved area of dorsal skin at various times before application of TPA solution (8.1 nmol/0.1 ml in acetone). This TPA dose (8.1 nmol) was used for the potentiation of oxidative responses compared with the dose for tumor promotion (1.6 nmol). The same doses of ebselen and TPA or acetone were applied twice at an interval of 24 h for H2O2 determination. Although the timing (24 h apart) of the double TPA application was different from tumor promotion protocol, the levels of oxidative stress were nearly the same when the time between the two TPA treatments was 24–72 h (data not shown). Mice treated by the double-treatment protocol were sacrificed 1 h after the last TPA treatment. The H2O2 content was determined by the phenol red-horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) method (3Wei H. Wei L. Frenkel K. Bowen R. Barnes S. Nutr. Cancer. 1993; 20: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar,7Nakamura Y. Murakami A. Ohto Y. Torikai K. Tanaka T. Ohigashi H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4832-4839PubMed Google Scholar). The final results are expressed as equivalents of nanomoles of H2O2 per skin punch on the basis of a standard curve of HRPO-mediated oxidation of phenol red by H2O2. The level of thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) in mouse epidermis was determined by our previously reported method (7Nakamura Y. Murakami A. Ohto Y. Torikai K. Tanaka T. Ohigashi H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4832-4839PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nakamura Y. Torikai K. Ohigashi H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 967-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The final results are expressed as equivalents of nanomoles of malondialdehyde per square centimeters on the basis of a standard line of TBARS formation using the authentic malondialdehyde. The modifying effect for single TPA application-induced inflammation was determined by two biomarkers, edema formation and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, as previously reported (3Wei H. Wei L. Frenkel K. Bowen R. Barnes S. Nutr. Cancer. 1993; 20: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura Y. Murakami A. Ohto Y. Torikai K. Tanaka T. Ohigashi H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4832-4839PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 18 h after a single application of TPA. Mouse skin punches were obtained with an 8-mm-diameter cork borer and weighed using an analytical balance. The IE were expressed by the relative increasing ratio of the weight of a treated punch to that of a control punch; inhibitory effect (IE) (%) = [(TPA alone) − (test compound plus TPA)]/[(TPA) − (vehicle)] × 100. The MPO activity was calculated from the linear portion of the curve and expressed as units of MPO per skin punch. One unit of MPO activity was defined as the activity that degraded 1 μmol of H2O2 per min at 25 °C. Rat liver epithelial RL34 and human promyelocytoid HL-60 cells were obtained from the Health Science Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan (30Yamada M. Okigaki T. Awai M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1987; 12: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Collins S.J. Gallo R.C. Gallagher R.E. Nature. 1977; 270: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were kindly donated by Ohtsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Ohtsu, Japan). RL34 cells were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), pyruvic acid (0.11 mg/ml), and 0.37% NaHCO3 at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. RL34 cells were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were exposed to the test compound dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) solution (final concentration 0.5%) in the growing medium as mentioned above. Confluent RAW 264.7 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/ml) and ebselen. After 20 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/150 mm NaCl/1% Triton X-100/0.5% sodium deoxycholate/0.1% SDS/100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min with a solution containing 0.8% digitonin and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.8). Each cell lysate was then treated with Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min at 100 °C (32Laemmuli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE slab gels. One gel was used for staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the other was transblotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), incubated with Block Ace (40 mg/ml) for blocking, washed, and then treated with the antibody. This procedure was followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to IgG and ECL reagents. The bands were visualized by exposure of the membrane to autoradiography film. Inhibitory tests of TPA-induced O2 generation in Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells were done as previously reported (7Nakamura Y. Murakami A. Ohto Y. Torikai K. Tanaka T. Ohigashi H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4832-4839PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nakamura Y. Kawamoto N. Ohto Y. Torikai K. Murakami A. Ohigashi H. Cancer Lett. 1999; 140: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, to determine the inhibitory effect of O⨪2 generation, a test compound dissolved in 5 μl of Me2SO was added to Me2SO-induced differentiated HL-60 cell suspension and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were washed with PBS twice for removal of the extracellular test compound to eliminate O⨪2scavenging effect. TPA (100 nm) and cytochrome csolution (1 μg/ml) were added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated for another 15 min. The reaction was terminated by placing it on ice. After centrifugation at 250 × g, the visible absorption at 550 nm was measured. The inhibitory effect was expressed by the relative decreasing ratio of absorbance of a test compound to the control experiment. GST activity was measured using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate according to the method of Habig et al. (33Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NQO1 activity was determined by the Prochaska test (34Prochaska H.J. Santamaria A.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. RL34 cells were grown for 24 h in 96-well plates (10,000 per well) and then exposed to serial dilutions of the chemicals. The ebselen-treated and untreated cells were rinsed twice with PBS (pH 7.0) and lysed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min with a solution containing 0.8% digitonin and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.8). Each whole cell lysate was then treated with Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min at 100 °C (32Laemmuli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The samples (20 μg) were run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE slab gels. One gel was used for staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and the other was transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane with a semi-dry blotting cell (Trans-Blot SD, Bio-Rad), incubated with Block Ace (40 mg/ml) for blocking, washed, and then treated with the antibody. A 3.0-kb fragment between −2.9 kb (EcoRI) and +59 bp (AccI) of GSTP1was inserted into the HindIII site of pSV0CAT and designated as ECAT (35Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). 1CAT was constructed from the ECAT by using appropriate restriction enzymes (35Sakai M. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9456-9460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). RL34 cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid construct by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure described by Chen and Okayama (36Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Cell lysates were obtained after five freeze-thaw cycles in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The protein was equalized and used for CAT assay. The degree of was determined by reading the intensity of the spots using the Fuji-BAS 2000 system (Fuji Photo, Tokyo, Japan). Double applications of phorbol esters trigger ROS production in mouse skin (9Kensler T.W. Egner P.A. Moore K.G. Taffe B.G. Twerdok L.E. Trush M.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1987; 90: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Ji C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17842-17878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wei H. Frenkel K.

Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2937-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The available data reported previously suggest that each application induces two distinguishable biochemical events, namely, priming and activation (10Ji C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17842-17878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The former is characterized as recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils by chemotactic factors to inflammatory regions and edema formation. The latter is the process of activation of neutrophils or other oxidant-producing cells, including keratinocytes, in which the second TPA application of phorbol esters induces oxidative stress. Importantly, the TPA dose used in the present experiment is in the tumor promotion range (1–10 nmol). First, we investigated whether ebselen showed antioxidative activity against double TPA application-induced oxidative damage in mouse skin (Fig.1). The oxidative damage was evaluated by the TBARS level, a well-known biomarker of overall oxidative damage to cellular constituents such as membrane lipids. The quantitative data for the levels of TBARS formation in mouse epidermis homogenate are shown in Fig. 2. The increased level of TBARS caused by the double TPA application was significantly higher than that of the control (0.35 ± 0.06versus 0.13 ± 0.02 nmol/cm2,p < 0.001). The double pretreatment of ebselen (810 nmol) 30 min before each TPA treatment inhibited the increase in the TBARS level (0.23 ± 0.05 nmol/cm2, p< 0.05 versus TPA). Reducing effect of ebselen on the TBARS level was dose-dependent. Thus, topically applied ebselen actually acts as an antioxidant in mouse skin. Although TBARS formation in vivo is considered not to reflect a single particular phenomenon but to indicate widespread oxidative damage, TBARS is known to be formed downstream of H2O2 generation in the presence of a metal ion as a catalyst. Therefore, we examined whether ebselen inhibits dermal oxidative damage via suppression of the ROS generating system, including leukocytes in inflamed regions. As shown in Fig.3A, double applications of 8.1 nmol of TPA at 24-h interval increased the level of H2O2 by about 5-fold (1.07 ± 0.20versus 5.02 ± 0.78 nmol/skin punch, p< 0.001) to that in the control mice treated twice with acetone instead of TPA. Pretreatment of ebselen (810 nmol; 100-fold dose of TPA) before each TPA treatment strongly inhibited H2O2 formation (2.56 ± 0.74 nmol/skin punch, inhibitory effect (IE) = 62%). Reducing effect of ebselen on the H2O2 level was dose-dependent (data not shown). To distinguish whether ebselen inhibits the priming or activation phase in a double TPA application model, ebselen was co-administered with either the first (priming) or second (activation) dose of TPA. Fig. 3A also shows the inhibitory effects of ebselen applied prior to either the first or second TPA treatment on H2O2generation in mouse skin. A greater decrease in the H2O2 level was observed in the mice to which ebselen was co-administered in the priming phase (1.94 ± 0.39 nmol/skin punch, IE = 78%) than in the activation phase (3.63 ± 0.31 nmol/skin punch, IE = 35%). The result that ebselen potently suppressed the priming phase of the double TPA application-induced H2O2 generation led us to determine whether ebselen influenced the chemotactic action of TPA in mouse skin. The effects of ebselen on the single application of TPA-induced skin edema formation and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were thus examined. A single TPA application (8.1 nmol) resulted in edema formation (as measured by the weight of skin punch) by 1.9-fold (64.7 ± 17.1 versus 34.0 ± 6.1 mg/skin punch,p < 0.001) and increased the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (as measured by MPO activity) by 25-fold (12.04 ± 3.22 versus 0.47 ± 0.23 unit/skin punch, p < 0.001) as compared with the control (Fig.3B). The pretreatment of ebselen at a 100-fold molar dose to TPA (810 nmol) potently reduced the skin edema formation and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (65 and 82%, respectively). These data are consistent with the inhibitory effect of ebselen on TPA-induced H2O2 generation and suggested that protection against the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocyte by TPA may be responsible at least in part for such an effect. One of the most common events after topical application of TPA onto mouse skin is an inflammatory response mediated by the increased metabolism of arachidonic acid by induced levels of the enzymes such as cyclooxygenase (COX). The COX family of genes consists of COX-1 (constitutive COX) and COX-2 (inducible COX). An increased level of PGE2, one of the major products of COX, has been linked with the increased expression of COX-2, which is expressed in mouse epidermis after topical treatment with TPA with no change in COX-1 expression (37Muller-Decker K. Scholz K. Marks F. Furstenberger G. Mol. Carcinog. 1995; 12: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, we assessed the effect of ebselen treatment on COX-2 expression using LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells in terms of COX-2 protein level. As shown in Fig. 4A, compared with the negative control, LPS treatment resulted in a strong increase in COX-2 protein. However, ebselen treatment resulted in significant inhibition of the COX-2 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. The 50 μm ebselen completely attenuated COX-2 protein to the negative control level. Moreover, 100 μm ebselen reduced the COX-2 level to 50% of the control level, indicating that ebselen attenuated the basal induction of COX-2. The treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with TPA or ebselen did not produce any change in the expression of COX-1 protein (data not shown). Ebselen, applied in the activation phase when ROS are generated by inflammatory cells, significantly inhibited H2O2 generation in mouse skin (Fig.3A). We, therefore, examined the inhibitory effects of ebselen on ROS generation in cultured leukocytes. The differentiated HL-60 cell system was chosen as a model of the NADPH oxidase system (38Thompson B.Y. Sivam G. Britigan B.E. Rosen G.M. Cohen M.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1988; 43: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To directly confirm whether or not ebselen inhibits NADPH oxidase, TPA stimulation was carried out after removing ebselen from the reaction mixture by washing with PBS. As shown in Fig.4B, ebselen at a concentration of 10 μmstrongly inhibited the O⨪2 generation by 62%. The suppressing effect of ebselen on TPA-stimulated O⨪2 generation was dose-dependent and much stronger than that of quercetin, a well-known antioxidative plant flavonol. These results suggested that the suppression of neutrophilic NADPH oxidase acti"

Activation of the receptor is dictated by association with androgen (ligand) and through interaction with co-activators and co-repressors. We have shown previously that cyclin D1 functions as a co-repressor to inhibit ligand-dependent androgen receptor activation. We demonstrate that cyclin D1 directly binds the N terminus of the androgen receptor and that this interaction is independent of ligand. Furthermore, we show that the interaction occurs in the nucleus and does not require the LXXLL motif of cyclin D1. Although two distinct transactivation domains exist in the N terminus (AF-1 and AF-5), the data shown support the hypothesis that cyclin D1 targets the AF-1 transactivation function. The constitutively active AF-5 domain was refractory to cyclin D1 inhibition. By contrast, cyclin D1 completely abolished androgen receptor activity, even in the presence of potent androgen receptor co-activators. This action of cyclin D1 at least partially required de-acetylase activity. Finally, we show that transient, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 results in reduced cell cycle progression in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells independent of CDK4 association. Collectively, our data support a model wherein cyclin D1 has a mitogenic (CDK4-dependent) function and an anti-mitogenic function (dependent on regulation of the AF-1 domain) that can collectively control the rate of androgen-dependent cellular proliferation. These findings provide insight into the non-cell cycle functions of cyclin D1 and provide the impetus to study its pleiotropic effects in androgen-dependent cells, especially prostatic adenocarcinomas.

Development, growth, and survival of prostatic epithelia are dependent on serum androgen, which exerts its biological effect through the AR (4Isaacs J.T. Prostate. 1984; 5: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 5Jenster G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 407-421PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hayward S.W. Rosen M.A. Cunha G.R. Br. J. Urol. 1997; 79: 18-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that aberrant or inappropriate activation of the AR facilitates the formation of prostate hyperplasias or neoplasias. Given the importance of the AR in prostate cancer progression, it is critical to determine its precise mode of regulation. The AR is expressed at high levels in prostatic epithelial cells and is activated in this cell type by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a high affinity ligand for the AR (1Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1996; 192: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Chang C.S. Kokontis J. Liao S.T. Science. 1988; 240: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Prior to DHT binding, the AR exists diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cell and is held inactive through the interaction of specific heat shock proteins (8Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar,9Kallio P.J. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, heat shock proteins are displaced. The receptor then dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and modulates transcription from discrete DNA sequences, termed androgen-responsive elements (10Zhou Z.X. Sar M. Simental J.A. Lane M.V. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13115-13123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem.

Biol. 2001; 76: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). From androgen-responsive elements, the receptor is capable of mediating transactivation and potential transcriptional repression (13Jenster G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 143: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although activation of the AR is clearly required for prostate proliferation, its critical transcription targets have yet to be identified. The best known target of the AR is prostate-specific antigen (PSA), whose expression levels are monitored clinically to diagnose aberrant prostate growth (14Pettaway C.A. Tech. Urol. 1998; 4: 35-42PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cleutjens K.B. van Eekelen C.C. van der Korput H.A. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. J. Biol.

Rev. 1991; 13: 200-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Like all nuclear receptors, the AR is loosely divided into three functional domains as follows: a C-terminal ligand binding domain, a DNA binding domain, and a variable N-terminal region (17Jenster G. van der Korput J.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Brinkmann A.O. Blok L.J. de Ruiter P.E. Doesburg P. Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Trapman J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although in other nuclear receptors the C-terminal ligand binding domain contains a potent transactivation function, the C-terminal transactivation domain of the AR (AF-2) is relatively weak (18Brinkmann A.O. Blok L.J. de Ruiter P.E. Doesburg P. Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Trapman J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 19Berrevoets C.A. Doesburg P.

A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The AR is unique in that two additional transactivation functions exist in the N terminus, termed AF-1 and AF-5 (21Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7341-7346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 22Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. van Vroonhoven C. van der Kwast T.H. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Like AF-2, the AF-1 transactivation function is dependent on ligand binding to the receptor (2Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 317-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By contrast, AF-5 transactivation is constitutively active (21Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7341-7346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar,22Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. van Vroonhoven C. van der Kwast T.H. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, it is hypothesized that the C terminus folds in such a way as to inhibit N-terminal transactivation domains (2Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 317-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Berrevoets C.A. Doesburg P. Steketee K. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C terminus permits ligand-independent AF-5 activation, supporting this hypothesis (21Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7341-7346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In the full-length receptor it is suggested that ligand binding fosters a conformational change that promotes interaction of the N-terminal and C-terminal transactivation functions (25Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Apart from these regulatory mechanisms, emerging evidence makes clear that meaningful activation of transcription also requires the recruitment of transcriptional co-modifiers (13Jenster G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 143: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 27Bevan C. Parker M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The AR is known to interact with a series of co-activators, and a smaller subset of co-repressors (13Jenster G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 143: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol.

Interaction with these regulatory proteins shows some specificity with regard to transactivation functions. For example, TIF-1 and GRIP2 are known to act on the C-terminal AF-2 domain, whereas SRC1 also interacts with and activates the N-terminal transactivation functions (19Berrevoets C.A. Doesburg P. Steketee K. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 28Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 29Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The net result of co-activator recruitment is to stimulate transcription of target genes, at least in part through the modification of histones. Several known co-activators (e.g. P/CAF, p300, and SRC-1) contain inherent histone acetylation activity (HAT) (30Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 31Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar, 32Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). This enzymatic activity is critical because histone acetylation is thought to relax chromatin, thereby facilitating DNA unwinding required for gene transcription (33Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 34Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Co-activators that lack HAT activity (e.g. ARA70) are speculated to function by recruiting HATs to the promoter complex (35Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Counter-balancing the effect of these co-activators are the co-repressors. As might be expected, these proteins are thought to either harbor intrinsic histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity or to recruit HDACs to the receptor complex (33Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 34Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The AR is speculated to interact with general HDAC recruiting proteins, such as NcoR and SMRT (36Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 37Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The mechanisms governing these interactions have yet to be fully explored. Intriguingly, we have previously identified cyclin D1 as a co-modifier of AR activity (38Knudsen K.E. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2297-2301PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 has an important role in cell cycle control as a required component of the CDK4 kinase complex (39Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4977) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 binds CDK4 directly and initiates CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, RB (40Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 41Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Because inactivation of RB is required for cell cycle progression, cyclin D1 is requisite for cellular proliferation (42Lukas J. Pagano M. Staskova Z. Draetta G. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 707-718PubMed Google Scholar). Outside of this role in the cell cycle, cyclin D1 is known to bind estrogen receptor (ER)-α and activate its transactivation function in the absence of ligand (43Zwijsen R.M. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar,44Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This function of cyclin D1 requires its LXXLL motif and is thought to involve the recruitment of SRC-1 (45Zwijsen R.M. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have demonstrated previously (38Knudsen K.E. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2297-2301PubMed Google Scholar) an additional role for cyclin D1. We showed that cyclin D1 interacts with the AR in vivo and inhibits its transactivation potential, without affecting AR expression. This inhibition is independent of CDK4 and thus also independent of the role of cyclin D1 in RB phosphorylation. We demonstrate that cyclin D1 binds with high affinity to the N terminus of the AR and inhibits the AF-1 transactivation function. We show that the inhibitory action of cyclin D1 is dominant to both HAT and non-HAT co-activators and that the complete action of cyclin D1 requires regulation of acetylation. Interestingly, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 or a mutant incapable of binding to CDK4 reduced the proliferative index of an androgen-dependent prostatic cell line (LNCaP), indicating that cyclin D1-induced AR inhibition acts to limit cellular proliferation in this cell type. These data put forth the hypothesis that cyclin D1 has dual roles in androgen-dependent cell types as follows: one that is CDK4-dependent and initiates cell cycle progression and another that is independent of CDK4 and counter-balances its mitogenic activity in androgen-dependent cells. Thus, our results classify cyclin D1 as a potent AR co-repressor and provide the impetus to study deregulation of the cyclin D1/AR interaction in prostate carcinoma. CV1, C33A, and LNCaP cell lines were obtained from ATCC and maintained in a 5% CO2incubator. CV1 and C33A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). For CV1 and C33A reporter assays, 10% charcoal dextran-treated FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were utilized. LNCaP cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A was obtained from Sigma. CV1 or C33A cells were transfected in the absence of androgen with the indicated plasmid constructs using the BES/calcium phosphate protocol (46Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Post-transfection, CV1 and C33A cells were allowed to recover for a period of 5–6 h and then supplemented with 0.1 nmdihydrotestosterone (DHT; Sigma), 1 nm R1881, or 0.1% ethanol vehicle (ETOH) for 18 h. Following stimulation, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was quantified using the Promega luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase activity was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency and measured by classic colorimetric assay or Galacto-Star protocols (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The pSG5AR wild type androgen receptor expression plasmid and pSG5-ARA70 were kindly provided by Dr. Chawnshang Chang (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY) (35Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Garrison N. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8720-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Plasmid encoding H2B-GFP was a gift of Dr. G. Wahl (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). pCMVp300 was the gift of Dr. T. Kouzarides (Wellcome/CRC Institute). CMV-P/CAF was the generous gift of Dr. S. Y. R. Dent (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The pGEMARΔC, wtAR-pGEM, pAR1–501, pAR1–661, pAR506–918, and pAR623–918 have been described previously (51Lu J. Danielsen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31528-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The CMV-CD44 construct was the generous gift of Dr. L. Sherman (University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH). pGEX 3× cyclin D1-GST was provided by Dr. M. Roussel (St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN). The cyclin D1-KE construct was provided by Dr. R. Weinberg (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) encoding plasmid, Green lantern 2, was supplied from Invitrogen. Cells transfected as described above were pelleted and lysed in a NETN (20 mmTris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) solution containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml 1,10-phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 60 mmβ-glycerophosphate. Lysates were subjected to brief sonication and clarified by centrifugation. For immunoblots, equal protein was loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For co-immunoprecipitations, equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against cyclin D1 (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), E1A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or MDM2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Precipitates were recovered through incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Input, bound, and flow-through fractions were obtained from each reaction and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. Antisera against GFP were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Bio-Rad) and enhanced chemiluminescence enhancer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used to visualize proteins. 35S-Labeled wild type and mutant androgen receptor proteins were generated using the TnT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system for in vitro transcription and translation (Promega), in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended protocol. NEG-772 Easytag Express Protein Labeling Mix was utilized for 35S-protein labeling (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were performed in a total volume of 50 μl. GST-cyclin D1 was transformed into BL21 bacteria as specified by Novagen (Madison, WI). Cyclin D1 expression was induced through 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside addition for a period of 3–5 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 4 ml of NET-N plus 0.003% Sarkosyl, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors (NET-N + SPP). The resuspended pellets were sonicated and then supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Lysed pellets were subjected to clarification. A portion of the remaining lysate was run on a SDS-PAGE gel and Coomassie-stained to verify expression (data not shown). From the total lysate 3 ml were removed and added to 50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads, which were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed 6 times with 1 ml of NET-N+SPP. In vitro translated proteins were incubated with the beads for 1.5 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were subsequently washed 5 times with 1 ml of NET-N + SPP. Input (4% of reaction), flow-through (3% of initial unbound fraction), and bound (10% of bound proteins prior to washing) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, the gel was incubated in Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL), as specified by the manufacturer. Proteins were detected via autoradiography. LNCaP cells were seeded in 6-well dishes on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. On the following day, cells were transfected using FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. 4 μg of wild type pRc/CMV-cyclin D1, cyclin D1-KE, or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA) constructs were transfected overnight along with 1 μg of H2B-GFP. Following transfection, the media were replaced, and cells were permitted to express the constructs for 18 h. Subsequently, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Amersham Biosciences) was added for a 16-h labeling period. Coverslips were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline. BrdUrd incorporation was determined by indirect immunofluorescence as previously described (52Knudsen K.E. Arden K.C. Cavenee W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20213-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in duplicate and at least 200 transfected cells were tallied per coverslip. We have shown previously that cyclin D1 does not affect AR expression but binds to the AR and inhibits its ligand-dependent transactivation (38Knudsen K.E. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2297-2301PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying this inhibitory action of cyclin D1 was not determined. Because cyclin D1 modulates ER-α activity through its LXXLL motif (43Zwijsen R.M. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 44Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the ability of cyclin D1 to inhibit AR activity may also rely on this interaction site. To test this hypothesis, we employed a characterized mutant of cyclin D1 (cyclin D1-LALA) that is defective in the LXXLL motif and lacks the ability to modulate ER function (45Zwijsen R.M.

CV1 cells, which express no endogenous AR (data not shown), were co-transfected in the absence of steroid hormones with plasmids encoding the human AR (pSG5-AR), PSA61LUC (a reporter for the AR containing a 6.1-kb fragment of the endogenous prostate-specific antigen promoter), and either wild type cyclin D1 or cyclin D1-LALA. CMV-β-gal was included in all transfections for reporter assay, as a control for transfection efficiency. In parallel experiments, androgen receptor expression was monitored via immunoblot and compared with co-transfected GFP. Subsequent to transfection, cells were treated with either 1 nm R1881 (Fig.1A), 0.1 nm DHT (Fig. 1B), or 0.1% ethanol vehicle. Treatment was continued for 16 h at which time cells were harvested, lysed, and monitored for either luciferase and β-galactosidase activity or for AR and GFP expression. Relative luciferase activity is shown. In accordance with previous observations (38Knudsen K.E. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2297-2301PubMed Google Scholar), R1881 up-regulated AR activity ∼5-fold during the stimulation period (Fig. 1A), whereas the physiological concentration of DHT stimulated AR activity ∼10–12-fold above vehicle treatment (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Transfection of multiple constructs did not affect AR expression (Fig. 1B, lower panel), but in both instances, wild type cyclin D1 and cyclin D1-LALA reduced its activity in the presence of ligand to basal levels (Fig. 1, A andB). These data indicate that the LXXLL motif of cyclin D1 is dispensable for inhibition of ligand-dependent AR transactivation potential. These findings predict that the cyclin D1-LALA mutant would retain binding to the AR. To verify this hypothesis, CV1 cells were transfected at equal ratios with expression plasmid for the wild type AR and cyclin D1-LALA. T"

HS/heparin co-ordinate the interaction of FGFs with their receptors (FGFRs) and are thought to play a critical role in receptor dimerization. Biochemical and crystallographic studies, conducted mainly with FGF-2 or FGF-1 and FGF receptors 1 and 2, suggests that an octasaccharide is the minimal length required for FGF- and FGFR-induced dimerization and subsequent activation. In addition, 6-O-sulfate groups are thought to be essential for binding of HS to FGFR and for receptor dimerization. We show here that oligosaccharides shorter than 8 sugar units support activation of FGFR2 IIIb by FGF-1 and interaction of FGFR4 with FGF-1. In contrast, only relatively long oligosaccharides supported receptor binding and activation in the FGF-1·FGFR1 or FGF-7·FGFR2 IIIb setting. In addition, both 6-O- and 2-O-desulfated heparin activated FGF-1 signaling via FGFR2 IIIb, whereas neither one stimulated FGF-1 signaling via FGFR1 or FGF-7 via FGFR2 IIIb. These findings indicate that the structure of HS required for activating FGFs is dictated by the specific FGF and FGFR combination. These different requirements may reflect the differences in the mode by which a given FGFR interacts with the various FGFs.

FGFs regulate the growth, differentiation, survival, and migration of a wide variety of cell types and have been implicated in a number of diseases including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Acidic FGF (termed aFGF or FGF-1) and basic FGF (termed bFGF or FGF-2) were the first to be isolated. They act on a wide spectrum of tissues and cell types and play an important role in a multitude of physiological and pathological processes including embryonic development, neuronal survival, angiogenesis, wound repair, and tumor growth (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The keratinocyte growth factor (KGF or FGF-7) is unique among its family members, because, unlike the other FGFs that have broad cell type specificity, FGF-7 acts predominantly on cells of epithelial origin to elicit a variety of responses including cell proliferation and cell migration (3Rubin J.S.

Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic. Acid. Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Further diversity is provided by an alternative splicing mechanism that generates receptor isoforms with altered ligand binding properties (2McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic. Acid. Res.

FGF-1 interacts with the four known FGFRs and their isoforms that have been characterized so far, whereas FGF-7 interacts only with a splice variant of FGFR2 known as the KGFR or FGFR2 IIIb isoform (9Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L. Burgess W.H. Chan A.M. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 10Miki T. Fleming T.P.

Rubin J.S. Wong J. Ron D. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 223-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and it binds FGF-1 with an affinity similar to that observed for FGF-7 (9Miki T. Bottaro D.P.

Binding of FGFs to their receptors induces FGFR dimerization, a step that is essential for subsequent receptor activation and triggering of downstream intracellular signaling events (14Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar).In addition to FGFRs, FGFs interact with the sulfated domains of heparan sulfate (HS) moieties of cell surface and extracellular matrix-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (15David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 16Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). FGFs can also interact with heparin, a highly sulfated polysaccharide that shares structural similarity with heparan sulfates and can therefore mimic their action (16Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). HS protect FGFs from heat inactivation and proteolytic degradation and also provide an extracellular reservoir from which FGFs can be rapidly released (17Vlodavsky I. Miao H.Q. Medalion B. Danagher P. Ron D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the absence of HS, FGFs can activate their receptors but only at very high concentrations, and in most cell systems studied, FGFs do not induce cell growth in HS deficient cells (18Fannon M. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I.

Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24653-24660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Addition of HS to physiological concentrations of FGFs can increase their efficacy by 2–3 orders of magnitude, and the effect on bioactivity correlates well with effects on primary receptor binding (18Fannon M. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36132-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HS can also dictate specificity of FGF·FGFR binding, depending, most likely, on the fine structure of their sulfated domains (19Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36132-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1343-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).It has been suggested that this dependence of the growth-stimulatory activity of FGFs on HS is because of the polysaccharide facilitating binding of FGFs to the FGFRs, most likely by stabilizing ligand-receptor complexes (22Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It was also proposed that HS are essential for FGFR dimerization. According to this model, binding of HS to FGF induces oligomerization of the ligand, which in turn enables receptor dimerization and subsequent activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase (23Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural studies demonstrated that HS indeed induce FGF oligomerization (24Moy F.J. Safran M. Seddon A.P. Kitchen D. Bohlen P. Aviezer D. Yayon A. Powers R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4782-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). However, the concentrations of FGF and HS required are far higher than concentrations regarded as being physiologically relevant and only a minor fraction of the total FGF is oligomerized (19Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36132-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By contrast, at physiological concentrations of FGF, and heparin concentrations required for full biological activity, the primary form of FGF is monomeric (19Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36132-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The FGF-induced oligomerization model gained further support from the findings that at least an octasaccharide is required to activate FGF-2 (25Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 26Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 114-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies showed that a hexasaccharide is unable to dimerize FGF-1, and recent resolution of the crystal structure of FGF-1·FGFR2·heparin complex suggested that a glycosaminoglycan shorter than an octasaccharide would not be able to cross-link ligand and receptor (28DiGabriele A.D.

Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies, it was reported that synthetic di- and trisaccharides can activate FGF-2 signaling, but this observation has not been independently confirmed (30Ornitz D.M. Herr A.B. Nilsson M. Westman J. Svahn C.M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition, other studies suggested that a monomer of FGF2 or FGF-7 could form an active signaling complex (31Sher I. Weizman A. Lubinsky-Mink S. Lang T. Adir N. Schomburg D. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35016-35022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32Pye D.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

Little is known about the structural requirements of HS and heparin for other FGF-FGFR interactions. In the present work we studied the effect of heparin oligosaccharides of variable size, and selectively desulfated heparins, on stimulating FGF-1 and FGF-7 activities via FGFR2 IIIb, and FGF-1 with other FGFRs. We show here that FGF-1 and FGF-7 vary considerably in the saccharide structures required for supporting their ability to bind and activate FGFR2 IIIb. Moreover, we show that the minimal saccharide length required for productive interaction of FGF-1 with its different high affinity receptors can be shorter than an octasaccharide, depending on the FGFR type.DISCUSSIONIn the present work we investigated the influence of heparin and heparin saccharides on growth factor and receptor selectivity. We compared the effect of length and sulfate composition of heparin on the productive interaction of two distinct FGFs with the same FGFR and their effect on interaction of the same FGF with three different FGFRs. The study was performed with FGF-7 and FGF-1. These two FGFs are ideal for investigating such questions because FGF-7 exhibits a unique FGFR specificity, whereas FGF-1 is a universal FGFR ligand (9Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2685-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar).We found that FGF-1 and FGF-7 markedly differ in their HS requirements for interaction and activation of FGFR2 IIIb. First, sugar units as short as a disaccharide could activate FGF-1 signaling via FGFR2 IIIb, whereas the activation of FGF-7 required quite long saccharides. The potency of each of the short saccharides correlated with their relative affinity for FGF-1 and FGF-7. Second, these two growth factors differ in their mode of interaction with cell-associated HS. FGF-7 interacted similarly with both the 2-O- and the 6-O-DS heparins, whereas FGF-1 exhibited appreciable binding to the 6-O-DS heparin and little or no binding to the 2-O-DS heparin. Third, the O-desulfated heparins displayed different effects on receptor binding and biological activity of each growth factor. Both types of desulfated heparin molecules potentiated receptor binding and biological activity of FGF-1 but failed to activate FGF-7. As expected from their promoting effect, neither of the desulfated molecules could antagonize the promoting effect of heparin on FGF-1 activity. In the case of FGF-7, the 6-O-DS heparin exhibited weak inhibitory activity at very high concentrations. However, at such high concentrations, native heparin also inhibits the biological activity of FGF-7 (19Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J.

Thus, similar to the situation observed for FGFR2 IIIb, interaction of FGF-1 with FGFR4 is supported by short saccharides. By contrast, potentiation of FGF-1·FGFR1 interaction was observed only with relatively long saccharides. Efficient binding of FGF-1 to FGFR1 differed also with respect to sulfate requirements because neither 2-O- nor 6-O-DS supported interaction, in agreement with their reported effect on FGF-1 activity in cells expressing FGFR1 (26Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations show that structural requirements in the polysaccharide co-receptor for FGF activation differ not only between distinct FGFs, but also for a given FGF, depending on the FGFR that interacts with the growth factor.Co-crystallization of FGF-1 with heparin, in the absence or presence of FGFR and biochemical studies, suggest that FGF-1 interacts with both the 2-O- and the 6-O-sulfate groups (28DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 29Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 47Ishihara M. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, it was demonstrated recently that a sequence motif of IdoUA, 2S-GlcNS, 6S-IdoUA, 2S centrally positioned in a DP8 S-domain from HS, is essential for high affinity binding of FGF-1 (49Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Gimenez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; Google Scholar). The currently observed stimulatory effect of 2-O-DS or 6-O-DS heparin on the interaction of FGF-1 with FGFR2 IIIb is consistent with the existence of binding sites for each of the sulfate groups on FGF-1. Furthermore, our binding competition studies suggest that the affinity of 2-O-sulfate groups to FGF-1 is significantly higher than that of the 6-O-sulfate group (see Fig. 6). However, this difference in affinity is not translated to differences in their stimulatory activity at least when heparin is used as the FGF cofactor. It seems that both 6-O- and 2-O-sulfates are required to achieve a maximal biological response because the level of stimulation by each one was lower than that of native heparin. Binding of 6-O- and 2-O-sulfates to FGF-1 can also explain why 6-O-DS heparin did not antagonize the stimulatory effect of native heparin on FGF-1·FGFR2 IIIb (present work) and also FGF-1·FGFR1 interaction, albeit that, in the later case, 6-O-DS has no stimulatory activity (26Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect FGF-1 differs from FGF-2, where 6-O-DS acts as strong antagonist of the stimulatory effect of heparin of FGF-2 activity via FGFR1 (26Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To explain the antagonistic effect of 6-O-DS heparin on FGF-2 activity, it was suggested that that 6-O-sulfate group is required for another interaction, with the FGFR being the most probable candidate (26Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resolved structure of the FGFR2·FGF-1·heparin complex also points to the involvement of the 6-O-sulfate group in receptor interaction, but the biological significance of this interaction has yet to be confirmed (29Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Here we show that 6-O-sulfation in heparin is not critical for productive interaction between FGF-1·FGFR2 IIIb, but it is required to increase efficacy of the growth factor. Because the affinity of 6-O-DS heparin for FGF-1 is rather low, we assume that binding of this sulfate group to another molecule could contribute cooperatively to enhance ligand-receptor interaction. Interaction with another molecule may also explain the observed effects with FGF-7 because sulfation in both positions is required for FGF-7 activity. Previous studies suggest that heparin at stimulatory concentrations does not bind FGFR2 IIIb (50LaRochelle W.J. Sakaguchi K. Atabey N. Cheon H.G. Takagi Y. Kinaia T. Day R.M. Miki T. Burgess W.H.

In addition, high affinity binding of both FGF-1 and FGF-7 to soluble FGFR2 IIIb is not dependent on heparin, whereas efficient binding to the native receptor requires heparin (19Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J. Biol.

Bottaro D.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1765-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the other interactions may take place not with FGFR2 IIIb but rather with a different cell surface molecule that imposes a restriction on ligand/receptor interaction, and sulfation may be required to alleviate this restriction. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that FGFR2 IIIb may have low affinity for HS/heparin in solution, and binding of heparin to the growth factor increases affinity of the glycosaminoglycan for the receptor.The question as to whether two FGF molecules bridged by HS are required to induce FGFR dimerization is rather controversial. On the one hand, the recently resolved crystal structures of several FGF·FGFR complexes suggest that two molecules of FGF are required for receptor dimerization even in the absence of heparin (29Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 51Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M.

A. 2000; 97: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The resolved structure of FGF-1·FGFR2·heparin complex revealed that heparin dimerizes the two FGF molecules and also makes contacts with one of the receptors (29Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Based on this structure, it was suggested that at least an octasaccharide would be required for these interactions. The finding that a hexasaccharide cannot induce FGF-1 dimerization in solution supports this proposal (28DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there exist a large body of findings that are not compatible with this model. These include the present findings that FGF-1 signaling via FGFR2 IIIb and its binding to FGFR4 can be activated by short saccharides and previous reports, suggesting that a single FGF molecule is sufficient for FGFR dimerization (31Sher I.

Moreover, FGF-1 or FGF-7 dimers are not observed using nearly physiological concentrations of growth factors and stimulatory concentrations of heparin (19Berman B. Ostrovsky O. Shlissel M. Lang T. Regan D. Vlodavsky I. Ishai-Michaeli R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36132-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). How can these differences be reconciled? One possibility is that short saccharides may still induce FGF dimerization. In general, long saccharides dimerize FGFs via binding to the major heparin-binding pocket in each molecule. Short saccharides (DP2–DP6) are not long enough to span the distance between the two binding pockets (54Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan V. Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M. Waksman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To explain how synthetic di- and trisaccharides could activate FGF-2, it was proposed that FGF-2 dimers can be generated by self-association and the synthetic saccharides stabilize the self-associated dimers by binding to a minor heparin-binding site located in each molecule in the plane where self-association take place (54Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan V. Herr A.B. Ornitz D.M. Waksman G. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, self-association of FGF-1 has not been observed (28DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility would be that FGFs could activate their receptor via structurally distinct mechanisms. Another possibility is that FGFRs are activated via one mechanism, and the discrepancy between biological and structural data is that there may be a difference between the biologically active signaling complexes and the complexes revealed in the crystallographic data.The present findings that signaling induced by the same FGF via different FGFRs can have distinct structural requirement in HS lends further support to the importance of HS diversity in regulating FGF activities. How this regulation is achieved is not clear yet. Previous studies, together with observations that effects of HS on ligand/receptor binding correlate with effects on biological activity, suggest that HS can modulate kinetic parameters of FGF·FGFR interactions (Refs. 18Fannon M.

To determine whether hair keratin genes are targets for this transcription factor, we analyzed the HOXC13 responsiveness of human hair keratin genes, whose expression matched that of nuclear HOXC13, immunologically revealed in cells of the lower hair-forming compartment of the human anagen hair follicle. We show that HOXC13, but not a homeobox-deleted HOXC13, strongly activated the promoters of the genes, with the respective proximal promoter regions being sufficient for optimal activation. The hair keratin promoters contained numerous putative Hox binding core motifs TAAT, TTAT, and TTAC. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that HOXC13 bound exclusively to distinct TAAT and TTAT core motifs that were clearly concentrated in the proximal promoter regions. A comparison of the sequences flanking HOXC13 binding and nonbinding core motifs, respectively, allowed the deduction of an extended 8-bp HOXC13 consensus binding sequence TT(A/T)ATNPuPu. Thus, the DNA binding conditions for HOXC13 were distinct from those of other members of the paralogous group 13, i.e. murine Hoxb13 and HOXd13, for which previous investigations yielded the consensus binding sequence TTTA(T/C)NPuPu.

In mammals the 39 Hox genes are organized into four separate chromosomal clusters, Hoxathrough Hoxd. Based upon sequence homology and location within a cluster, these genes have been divided into 13 paralogous groups (for reviews see Refs. 1Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Bürglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 2Maconochie M. Nonchev S. Morrison A. Krumlauf R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Due to sequence homologies within the conserved homeobox, Hox genes are related to DrosophilaHOM-C genes with the paralogs 9–13 all being related to the Abd-B gene (3Izpisua-Belmonte J. Falkenstein H. Dollé P. Renucci A. Duboule D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2279-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). During embryonic development, paralogous genes located at the 3′-end of each cluster are activated first, whereas the more 5′-genes are transcribed progressively later. In addition, there is spatial colinearity of position in a cluster such that members of successive paralogous groups have increasingly posterior-anterior limits of expression (4Peterson R.L. Papenbrock T. Davda M.M. Awgulewitsch A. Mech. Dev. 1994; 47: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Capecchi M.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1997; LXII: 273-281Google Scholar). Thus, recent studies on the expression of Hoxc13 during mouse embryogenesis have shown that this 5′-most gene of the Hoxc gene cluster is first expressed at E10.5 in the tail bud (4Peterson R.L. Papenbrock T. Davda M.M. Awgulewitsch A. Mech. Dev. 1994; 47: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), followed at E12.5 in the epithelia of the wrist and ankle regions of the limbs in which its expression becomes localized to the developing foot pads and nails at E13.5 (6Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the studies also revealed that at later embryonic stages, Hoxc13 expression obviously deviated from the code of colinearity, as it also occurred in both vibrissae and all body hair follicles, in the filiform papillae of tongue epithelium and in footpad epidermis (6Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). At postnatal day 7, Hoxc13 transcripts in growing anagen hair follicles were seen mainly in the matrix of the hair bulb and the precortical region of the hair shaft and could also be demonstrated at the base of the posterior unit of the filiform tongue papilla (6Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, besides defects in caudal tail vertebrae, Hoxc13-null mice showed malformation of nails and filiform tongue papillae, and, notwithstanding morphologically normal looking hair follicles, totally lacked vibrissae and pelage hairs due to the premature fracture of hair shafts at the surface of the skin (Ref. 6Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar and for reviews see Refs. 7Duboule D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,8Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 4: 244-247Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since in the mouse, most of these Hoxc13 expressing anatomical regions are also known sites of hair keratin synthesis (9, 10 and references therein), it has been hypothesized that Hoxc13 might possess special functions in hair and filiform papillae development by being involved in the control of hair keratin gene expression (6Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 7Duboule D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 4: 244-247Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In line with this assumption, recent investigations in Hoxc13-overexpressing mice have shown that a variety of hair follicle-specific genes are regulated by this transcription factor (11Tkatchenko A.V. Visconti R.P. Shang L. Papenbrock T. Pruett N.D. Ito T. Ogawa M. Awgulewitsch A. Development. 2001; 128: 1547-1558PubMed Google Scholar).In the past years, our laboratory has elucidated the organization of the human type I and type II hair keratin gene loci and characterized the sequential expression of their members during trichocyte differentiation (12Rogers M.A. Winter H.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and investigated whether they are target genes for HOXC13. In the present study, we provide strong evidence that these hair keratin genes are transcriptionally up-regulated by HOXC13 primarily via binding of the transcription factor to distinct core recognition motifs, TAAT and TTAT, in the respective proximal promoters.DISCUSSIONHox genes encode transcription factors that act as master switches during embryonic development by controlling the activities of a plethora of downstream target genes. The knowledge about direct Hox target genes is presently poor and most of them have been identified in the fruit fly Drosophila (22Graba Y. Aragnol D. Pradel J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In mammals both the Hoxc8-mediated repression of the osteopontin gene and the HOXA5-controlled activation of the progesterone receptor gene have recently been investigated at the molecular level (23Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Raman V. Tamori A. Vali M. Zeller K. Korz D. Sukumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26551-26555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Based on strong evidence indicating a regulatory function of Hoxc13 for hair follicle-specific genes in mice, which either under- or overexpressed this transcription factor (6Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Tkatchenko A.V. Visconti R.P. Shang L. Papenbrock T. Pruett N.D. Ito T. Ogawa M. Awgulewitsch A. Development. 2001; 128: 1547-1558PubMed Google Scholar), the present study was aimed at investigating whether human hair keratin genes are targets for HOXC13. A prerequisite thereof was the demonstration of HOXC13 expression in the adult human anagen hair follicle. Using a HOXC13-specific antiserum, we extended the existing murine Hoxc13 mRNA expression data (6Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) by showing that within the hair-forming compartment of the hair follicle, HOXC13 was strongly present in the nuclei of cells of the entire matrix, including cells lining the dermal papilla, the lower hair cuticle and cortex, in which, however, HOXC13 expression gradually vanished. In beard hairs, cells in the lowermost portion of the central medulla also contained HOXC13 protein in their nuclei. Accordingly, we generated β-galactosidase reporter gene constructs with promoter fragments of type I hair keratin genes hHa2,hHa5, and ϕhHaA, which are expressed in these regions (13Langbein L.

Genet. 2001; 108: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), for cotransfection studies with a HOXC13 expression vector. These studies clearly showed that hair keratin promoters strongly activated the reporter gene in the presence of functional but not homeobox deleted HOXC13.Numerous investigations, relying essentially on both DNA site selection protocols and gelshift assays with appropriate oligonucleotides, have provided evidence that Hox proteins may activate or repress their target genes (23Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Raman V. Tamori A. Vali M. Zeller K. Korz D. Sukumar S. J.

It could be demonstrated that Hox proteins of paralogous groups 1–8 bound preferentially to TAAT core motifs, while both DrosophilaAbd-B protein and Abd-B-like Hox9–13 paralogs exhibited a binding preference for both TTAT and TTAC core motifs (18Ekker S.C.

Notwithstanding these apparent binding site preferences, we have screened the endogenous promoters of the functional hair keratin geneshHa5 and hHa2 for all three versions of the core motif. EMSA showed that of the 30 putative core binding motifs collectively present in the two hair keratin promoters, only 10 bound to HOXC13, with six of them being concentrated in the respective proximal promoter regions. In accordance with the existing rules for the site selection preference of Abd-B protein and Hox9–13 paralogs (18Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8198-8206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we confirmed a generally strong binding of HOXC13 to three oligonucleotides containing TTAT motifs. However, while virtually no binding was observed for TTAC motifs, surprisingly, HOXC13 clearly bound to seven oligonucleotides containing TAAT motifs. Collectively, the intensities of the TTAT or TAAT HOXC13 binding complexes were comparably strong. This finding clearly contrasted to previous binding studies with the murine Hoxb13 and d13 paralogs, which did not efficiently select for TAAT motifs, but rather exhibited a strong preference for TTAC motifs (19Shen W.F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Lawrence H.J. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 20Shen W.F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8198-8206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Given that HOXC13 binding to both TTAT and TAAT motifs in the hair keratin promoters was not observed with a truncated HOXC13 protein and that in addition, the binding complexes could be specifically supershifted with the HOXC13 antiserum, these data clearly demonstrated a direct binding of HOXC13 to these core motifs in the hair keratin promoters.Previous analyses of the binding sequences for Abd-B-like Hox proteins also revealed distinct base constraints in the regions flanking the core motifs (18Ekker S.C.

An inspection of all 10 HOXC13 binding core motifs of the endogenous hHa5 and hHa2 hair keratin promoters showed that these were invariably preceded 5′ by a T and followed 3′ by a variable nucleotide and, as a rule, by two purine residues, thus giving rise to an extended 8-bp consensus-binding sequence TT(A/T)ATNPuPu. Obviously, the T in position 1 is generally mandatory for binding since it was invariably present in oligonucleotides that were site-selected with bothDrosophila Abd-B protein (18Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and a large number of Abd-B-like Hox proteins (Hoxb9, Hoxa10, Hoxa11, Hoxd12, Hoxd13, Hoxb13 (19Shen W.F. Montgomery J.C.

Moreover, its selective substitution in the extended HOXC13 consensus binding sequence entailed a complete abolishment of HOXC13 binding. Whether the T upstream of position 1 of the consensus sequence, which preceded 8 of 11 HOXC13 binding sequences (Fig. 7), is involved in binding remains to be seen. Regarding base constraints 3′ to the core motifs, Drosophila Abd-B protein seems to prefer a G in position six of the consensus sequence (18Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I.

In contrast, efficient binding of bothDrosophila Abd-B protein and Abd-B-like Hox members requires a purine base in position 7 of the consensus sequence (18–20 and this study).

Thus the present data on the optimal sequences necessary for binding of the three Hox13 paralogs investigated so far suggest that all require a purine base in position 8 of the consensus sequence, which distinguishes them from the remaining Abd-B-like Hox members. Within the paralogous group 13, however, HOXC13 differs from Hoxb13 and Hoxd13 by the absolute need of a T in position 5, while the others also accept a C. Conversely, while there seems to be an absolute constraint for a T in position 3 for efficient Hoxb13 and Hoxd13 binding, HOXC13 seems to prefer an A, which is normally discriminatory for the binding of Hox1–8 proteins (18Ekker S.C.

Remarkably, HOXC13-dependent transactivation was also observed for a β-galactosidase construct containing a proximal promoter region of the medullar hair keratin genehHa7,3 which, however, exhibited only one HOXC13 binding TTAATGAG consensus binding sequence. This strongly suggests that both TAAT and TTAT core motifs are involved in HOXC13-mediated reporter gene activation. Whether the relatively low β-galactosidase gene activation observed after cotransfection of pHOXC13 with the 0.2 bp hHa7 promoter construct as compared with that obtained with the corresponding hHa5 andhHa2 promoter constructs is indicative of a hierarchy within TAAT and TTAT core motifs regarding their individual contribution to gene activation can only be resolved by detailed mutation/deletion studies of the critical core motifs of the hair keratin promoters.It is evident that hair keratin promoters would be well suited for studies aimed at investigating the role of cofactors that influence Hox binding. It has been shown that for efficient binding to their consensus sequences, Hox9–10 paralogs either associate with members of Exd/Pbx (25Mann R.S. Chan S.K.

In contrast, Hox11–13 paralogs are only able to interact with Meis1, but have been shown to bind equally strong to their consensus sequence in the absence of Meis1(19–21). These studies were performed using oligonucleotides containing either the Edx/Pbx binding consensus sequence ATGAT or the Meis1 binding sequence TGACAG contiguous with a Hox binding sequence (19Shen W.F.

Since all HOXC13 binding oligonucleotides derived from thehHa5 and hHa2 promoters lacked a Meis1 binding sequence adjacent to the extended HOXC13 binding sequence, none of the two HOXC13 binding complexes consistently observed in our bandshift assays can be attributed to a HOXC13-Meis1 interaction. Meis1 binding consensus sequences are, however, present in both hair keratin promoters. The hHa5 promoter contains two TGACAG motifs, one immediately upstream of the 0.3a5 fragment, the other being located 15 nucleotides upstream of the first motif (see Fig. 4), while in thehHa2 promoter one TGACAG motif lies within the proximal 0.3a2 fragment, 27 nucleotides upstream of the nonbinding TAAT motif 4 (see Fig. 5). Both Meis1 binding studies, and in particular cotransfection studies of appropriately tailored and mutated/deletedhHa2 and hHa5 promoter fragments with a Meis1 expression vector into cells with constitutive HOXC13 expression, will help to better define the relevance of this cofactor for HOXC13 mediated gene activation.Our evidence in vitro for HOXC13-mediated hair keratin gene expression needs to be considered in the context of a recent study that showed that Hoxc13 overexpression in mice led to fragile hairs concomitant with a drastic down-regulation of late, hair-specific genes encoding members of the large multigene family of hair keratin-associated proteins, KAPs (28Powell B.C.

Shang L. Papenbrock T. Pruett N.D. Ito T. Ogawa M. Awgulewitsch A. Development. 2001; 128: 1547-1558PubMed Google Scholar). We believe that this observation is due to a selective shift of overexpressed Hoxc13 into the mid- to upper cortical compartment (11Tkatchenko A.V. Visconti R.P. Shang L. Papenbrock T. Pruett N.D. Ito T. Ogawa M. Awgulewitsch A. Development. 2001; 128: 1547-1558PubMed Google Scholar), where it may aberrantly affect KAP gene expression. In contrast, our finding that in normal anagen hair follicles, the nuclear HOXC13 expression pattern in the lower hair-forming compartment coincides with that of the hair keratins investigated her, strongly speaks for a gene-activating function of HOXC13 during early trichocyte differentiation. Hox genes encode evolutionarily conserved transcription factors that are important gene regulators involved in cell fate determination during embryonic development. In mammals the 39 Hox genes are organized into four separate chromosomal clusters, Hoxathrough Hoxd. Based upon sequence homology and location within a cluster, these genes have been divided into 13 paralogous groups (for reviews see Refs. 1Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Bürglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 2Maconochie M. Nonchev S. Morrison A. Krumlauf R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Due to sequence homologies within the conserved homeobox, Hox genes are related to DrosophilaHOM-C genes with the paralogs 9–13 all being related to the Abd-B gene (3Izpisua-Belmonte J. Falkenstein H. Dollé P. Renucci A. Duboule D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2279-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). During embryonic development, paralogous genes located at the 3′-end of each cluster are activated first, whereas the more 5′-genes are transcribed progressively later. In addition, there is spatial colinearity of position in a cluster such that members of successive paralogous groups have increasingly posterior-anterior limits of expression (4Peterson R.L. Papenbrock T. Davda M.M. Awgulewitsch A. Mech. Dev. 1994; 47: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Capecchi M.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1997; LXII: 273-281Google Scholar). Thus, recent studies on the expression of Hoxc13 during mouse embryogenesis have shown that this 5′-most gene of the Hoxc gene cluster is first expressed at E10.5 in the tail bud (4Peterson R.L. Papenbrock T. Davda M.M. Awgulewitsch A. Mech. Dev. 1994; 47: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), followed at E12.5 in the epithelia of the wrist and ankle regions of the limbs in which its expression becomes localized to the developing foot pads and nails at E13.5 (6Godwin A.R. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the studies also revealed that at later embryonic stages, Hoxc13 expression obviously deviated from the code of colinearity, as it also occurred in both vibrissae and all body hair follicles, in the filiform papillae of tongue epithelium and in footpad epidermis (6Godwin A.R.

https://openalex.org/W2142614472,"PIKfyve enzymatic activity is required in maintaining late endocytic membrane integrity. PIKfyve is a dual specificity enzyme that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and PtdIns 3-P at the 5-hydroxyl and unidentified endogenous protein substrate(s). To determine which of these activities (lipidversus protein kinase activity) is responsible for endomembrane homeostasis we analyzed a double mutant PIKfyveK1999E/K2000E. These substitutions in the putative lipid-substrate activation loop nearly completely abrogated the lipid kinase activity without any significant effect on the protein kinase activity of PIKfyveK1999E/K2000E. Expression of PIKfyveK1999E/K2000E in COS cells induced a dramatic dominant-negative effect in the form of endomembrane swelling and vacuolation. In addition, the lipid-substrate specificity of PIKfyve was modified by introducing single mutations in Lys-1999 or Lys-2000. This yielded proteins with preferentially abrogated synthesis of PtdIns 5-P (PIKfyveK2000E) or PtdIns 3,5-P2(PIKfyveK1999E), of which only the PIKfyveK1999E mutant induced the characteristic endomembrane defects upon cell transfection. Furthermore, phosphoinositide microinjection into cells demonstrated a selective ability of PtdIns 3,5-P2 to correct the endomembrane defects induced by the dominant-negative PIKfyve lipid kinase-deficient mutants. Thus, PtdIns 3,5-P2 production by PIKfyve is crucial for endomembrane integrity, and Lys-1999 most likely directs the PIKfyve interactions with the 3-phosphate group in PtdIns 3-P."

Ubiquitination includes a cascade of three classes of enzymes, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1,1 the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc or E2, and the ubiquitin ligase E3. After activation of a ubiquitin by E1, E2 and E3 cooperate to catalyze the formation of a multiubiquitin chain on a protein substrate. The E3 enzymes or the protein complexes with a ligase activity are believed to target the substrate for selective ubiquitination and a subsequent turnover by a large protease complex, the 26 S proteosome. There are two distinct groups of human ubiquitin ligases, the HECT domain E3 enzymes, including E6-associated protein (E6AP) and NEDD4, and the RING finger E3 enzymes, including SCF (Skp1-cullin-F box), VBC (VHL-Elongin B-Elongin C), APC (anaphase-promoting complex) and other single RING finger proteins such as c-Cbl and MDM2 (7Jackson P.K.

The HECT sequence of ∼200 amino acids is highly conserved in the C-terminal catalytic domain of family members from yeast to mammals. The HECT-domain protein forms a thiol ester bond with a ubiquitin at the active cysteine residue and transfers the ubiquitin directly to the substrate (8Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S.

However, the overall mechanisms by which these ubiquitin ligases recognize the target proteins remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we focused on characterizing the human HECT-domain protein, a counterpart of the regulator of cell proliferation and the putative tumor suppressorhyperplastic discs in Drosophila melanogaster, termed hHYD. The hyperplastic discs gene was initially cloned by investigating temperature-sensitive mutants that caused imaginal disc overgrowth in larvae at restrictive temperatures (11Mansfield E.

Recently, hHYD, also named EDD, was reported to be transcriptionally induced by progestin in human breast cancer cells, suggesting a role for hHYD in hormone-mediated cell regulation in higher eukaryotes (13Callagham M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3479-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here, we identified that hHYD interacts with DNA topoisomerase-IIβ-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) (14Yamane K. Tsuruo T.

Interestingly, TopBP1 shows the presence of BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT) domains, which are found in many molecules involved in DNA damage response and checkpoint-mediated repair including BRCA1, p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (NBS1), x-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1), DNA ligases 3 and 4, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (16Anderson L.

Biochemically, specific E2 enzymes transferred ubiquitin molecules to hHYD, resulting in the ubiquitination of TopBP1. TopBP1 was usually ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome, whereas X-irradiation reduced the ubiquitination of TopBP1 via the phosphorylation, causing the colocalization of TopBP1 with γ-H2AX in DNA break sites. Our observations demonstrated that hHYD regulates TopBP1 for the DNA damage response. We performed a tblastn data base search using the amino acid sequences of the hyd inDrosophila and found several human EST clones homologous to the sequences. Using human cDNA libraries and cDNA fragments, PCR amplifications were performed to isolate full-length hHYD. We identified a 8397-base pair cDNA that contained a single large open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 2798 amino acid residues (GenBankTM accession number U95000). The hHYD showed sequences similar to those of EDD (GenBankTM accession number AF006010). Yeast strain L40 carrying pBTM116HA-hHYD (amino acids 2520–2798) was transformed with the HeLa and skeletal muscle cDNA libraries constructed in pGAD-GH (CLONTECH) by electroporation. Transformants were screened for growth on a minimal synthetic defined plate media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine prototrophy. Histidine-positive colonies were subjected to β-galactosidase assay. Plasmids harboring cDNA were recovered from positive colonies, and the nucleotide sequence of plasmid DNA was determined. The COS-7, U2OS cells, and immortalized human fibroblasts were seeded in a RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The expression plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells by the liposome-mediated gene transfer method. To generate bacterially expressed proteins, the C-terminal region of hHYD (residues 2520–2798) was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pGEX-2TH vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The recombinant GST-hHYD, E1, and E2 enzymes and the C-terminal region of TopBP1 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) or DH5α and purified from bacterial extracts as described elsewhere (20Anan T. Nagata Y. Koga H. Honda Y. Yabuki N. Miyamoto C. Kuwano A. Matsuda I. Endo F. Saya H. Nakao M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified cDNA for full-length hHYD was also subcloned into pFastBac-HT baculovirus expression vector (Invitrogen). The hHYD protein was expressed in insect Sf9 cells and purified from the extract according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR-amplified cDNAs encoding hHYD, TopBP1, and its C-terminal deletion mutants, Δ1 (residues 1–1080) and Δ2 (residues 1–660), were subcloned into a pcDNA3-FLAG expression vector. The substitution from the active site cysteine residue (at position 2767 of hHYD) to alanine was performed by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Antiserums against hHYD and TopBP1 were prepared by the subcutaneous immunization of rabbits and rats with the above recombinant proteins. The antibodies were then affinity-purified by using the immunized proteins. Cell lysates were prepared with a sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue). Samples containing equal amounts of protein (15 μg) were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters with a constant current of 140 mA for 2 h. The filters were blocked with PBS containing 10% skim milk and then incubated with anti-hHYD and anti-TopBP1 polyclonal antibodies and anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-Myc 9E10, and anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in PBS containing 0.03% Tween 20 for 1 h and washed 3 times for 7 min each wash with PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20. Next the filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 40 min, and then specific proteins were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 3% aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.5 μm pepstatin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate in PBS (pH 8.0)). An appropriate antibody was added to the lysate and incubated for 8 h. The immunocomplexes were collected with protein (G+A)-conjugated agarose and washed with a buffer (25 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) (21Nagata Y. Anan T. Yoshida T. Mizukami T.

For the phosphorylation assay, immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with λ protein phosphatase (New England BioLabs) at 30°C for 1 h. The fibroblasts were washed 2 times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with diluted anti-hHYD, anti-TopBP1 and anti-γ-H2AX antibodies in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with Cy3- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 60 min. After washing again with PBS, samples were mounted in 80% glycerol and visualized with a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Ubiquitin transfer and conjugation were performed as reported previously (20Anan T. Nagata Y. Koga H. Honda Y. Yabuki N. Miyamoto C. Kuwano A. Matsuda I. Endo F. Saya H. Nakao M.

Reaction mixtures contained ∼0.15 μg of E1, 0.5 μg of each E2, 1.0 μg of bacterially expressed hHYD or baculovirus-expressed hHYD, and 0.5 μg of Myc-tagged ubiquitin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 5 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mm ATP, 2 mm ATPγS, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by incubating the mixtures for 20 min at 25 °C in a sample buffer and electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE. To identify a protein factor that interacts with hHYD, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of HeLa and skeletal muscle cDNA libraries utilizing the region of amino acids 2520–2798, which contains the HECT domain and its N-terminal portion of hHYD as bait (Fig.1A). From a screening of ∼12 × 106 independent transformants, 10 clones were β-galactosidase-positive on histidine-deficient plates. From the positive clones, we isolated 2 independent cDNA clones encoding the C-terminal region of TopBP1 (amino acids 645–1522). Yeast cells expressing both hHYD and TopBP1 grew selectively on plate media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (Fig. 1B). TopBP1 possessed eight tandem repeats of the BRCT domain. DNA topoisomerase IIβ, which catalyzes transient breaks and topological changes of DNA for replication and chromosome segregation, was originally reported to bind the C-terminal half of TopBP1 (amino acids 862–1522) (15Yamane K. Kawabata M. Tsuruo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To examine whether TopBP1 specifically interacts with hHYD, FLAG-tagged TopBP1 was expressed in COS-7 cells for immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-hHYD and anti-NEDD4 polyclonal antibodies. NEDD4 is another member of the HECT-domain ligases with distinct features in the N-terminal region of the protein (20Anan T. Nagata Y. Koga H. Honda Y. Yabuki N. Miyamoto C. Kuwano A. Matsuda I. Endo F. Saya H. Nakao M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody revealed that overexpressed TopBP1 was detected in the hHYD- but not in the NEDD4-immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C). Both endogenous hHYD and NEDD4 were present in these immunoprecipitates (data not shown). To determine the region of TopBP1 interacting with hHYD, we constructed two C-terminal deletion mutants of FLAG-TopBP1, Δ1 and Δ2, containing the regions of amino acids 1–1080 and 1–660, respectively (Fig. 1A). Native hHYD was immunoprecipitated with anti-hHYD antibodies from FLAG-TopBP1-expressing cells, and an anti-FLAG antibody detected each of the FLAG-TopBP1 proteins (Fig. 1D). Full-length TopBP1 and the Δ1 mutant were coprecipitated with hHYD (lanes 2and 4), whereas the Δ2 mutant was scarcely found in the hHYD immunoprecipitate (lane 6). Approximately 0.5% of overexpressed full-length TopBP1 in the input lysate was expected to associate with hHYD. The FLAG-TopBP1 proteins were equally expressed before immunoprecipitation (lanes 1, 3, and5). Collectively, hHYD interacts with the minimal region of the amino acids 661–1080 including BRCT5 and BRCT6 of TopBP1, suggesting a specific interaction of hHYD and TopBP1. In Fig.1E, we show expression plasmids for hHYD and TopBP1 in COS-7 cells along with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against recombinant hHYD and TopBP1 proteins. Western blot analysis showed that FLAG-tagged hHYD and TopBP1 were detected using appropriate antibodies in the transfected cells (lanes 2 and 4, andlanes 8 and 10, respectively). In addition, the anti-hHYD antibodies cross-reacted with endogenous protein (lane 3), whereas the anti-TopBP1 antibodies contributed few bands in the mock-transfected cells (lane 9), probably due to the low levels of native TopBP1 in intact cells. To identify the E1-E2-hHYD pathway, we first analyzedin vitro ubiquitin transfer to glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fused hHYD (amino acids 2520–2798) containing the HECT region. The reaction was performed in the presence of ATP using bacterially expressed proteins including E1, UbcH4 (E2), GST-hHYD, and Myc-ubiquitin, and the results were obtained with or without the addition of the reducing-agent dithiothreitol (100 mm) (Fig. 2A). The use of an anti-Myc antibody showed that hHYD efficiently formed adducts with Myc-ubiquitin in the presence of E1 and UbcH4. In contrast, the addition of dithiothreitol diminished the intensity of the bands corresponding to UbcH4-ubiquitin and hHYD-ubiquitin conjugates. The E1-ubiquitin seemed to be hardly visible in the gel. Neither E1 nor UbcH4 alone transferred ubiquitin to hHYD. The appearance of two close-migrating bands of hHYD-ubiquitin might have represented hHYD conjugated with ubiquitins as with other HECT proteins (8Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 20Anan T. Nagata Y. Koga H. Honda Y. Yabuki N. Miyamoto C. Kuwano A. Matsuda I. Endo F. Saya H. Nakao M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and Huibregtse et al. (8Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) suggest an autoubiquitination or an intramolecular transfer of ubiquitins. The magnification showed the relative locations of hHYD and hHYD-ubiquitins on reprobing the same membrane with anti-hHYD antibodies (lower panel). To determine the E2 enzymes coupled to hHYD, we utilized nine kinds of recombinant E2 proteins in the presence of E1 and hHYD. hHYD accepted ubiquitin molecules especially from UbcH4, UbcH5B, and UbcH5C and weakly from UbcH7 (data not shown). We next constituted the E1-E2-hHYD cascade using a baculovirus-expressed full-length hHYD (Fig. 2B). For in vitroubiquitination, E1, full-length hHYD, Myc-ubiquitin, and the C-terminal region of TopBP1 were incubated with each of the E2 enzymes, and the state of TopBP1 was examined with anti-TopBP1 and anti-Myc antibodies. The combinations of hHYD with UbcH4, UbcH5B, and UbcH5C strongly induced the ubiquitination of TopBP1. In addition, TopBP1 was weakly ubiquitinated in the presence of UbcH2A (HHR6A), UbcH2B (HHR6B), and UbcH7. No such activities were found with UbcH3 (CDC34), UbcH6, or UbcH8 (human homologue of yeast Ubc8). To confirm reaction specificity between hHYD and TopBP1, we demonstrated that preincubating with anti-hHYD and anti-TopBP1 antibodies abolished the E1-UbcH4-hHYD-TopBP1 cascade (Fig. 2C). Neither control antibodies including rabbit IgG, anti-NEDD4, and preimmune serum nor any of the heat-inactivated antibodies inhibited the reaction. All the recombinant proteins and the antibodies were correctly added, and repeated experiments gave very similar results. To confirm the ubiquitin ligase activity of hHYD in the cells, we expressed FLAG-tagged, wild- and mutant-type hHYD together with HA-tagged ubiquitin. The mutant hHYD(C/A) substituted the active site cysteine with alanine at amino acid 2767. hHYD was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody from the transfected cells, and the immune complexes were probed with an anti-HA antibody (Fig.3A). The anti-HA reactive, high molecular mass proteins were detected as ubiquitinated forms of the substrates (lane 2). The use of proteosome inhibitor MG132 resulted in the accumulation of multiple ubiquitinated proteins (lane 3), indicating that these ubiquitinated proteins were naturally degraded by the proteosome. In contrast, ubiquitinated proteins were only scantly coprecipitated with the mutant hHYD (lane 4), demonstrating that hHYD normally ubiquitinates cellular proteins. FLAG-hHYD was similarly immunoprecipitated (lanes 2–4). To directly clarify the ubiquitination of TopBP1, both FLAG-TopBP1 and HA-ubiquitin were expressed in COS-7 cells. TopBP1 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates, after frequent washings, were detected with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3B). High molecular mass ubiquitinated TopBP1 appeared in the upper part of the unconjugated form (lane 5), and the proteosome inhibition by MG132 markedly accumulated the ubiquitinated proteins (lane 6). Mock transfection lacked such ubiquitinated bands (lanes 4). A slight decrease of TopBP1 itself in the MG132-treated input lysate might reflect the considerable increase of the ubiquitinated forms rather than TopBP1 itself (lanes 3 and 6). Taken together, these results showed that TopBP1 is ubiquitinated in the cells as well as in vitro. To further conclude the multiple ubiquitination of TopBP1 in the cells, we expressed both FLAG-TopBP1 and HA-ubiquitin in COS-7 cells. Immunoprecipitates with the anti-HA antibodies were probed with anti-TopBP1 antibodies (Fig.4A), providing the evidence for the ubiquitinated and some degraded TopBP1 (lane 6). The proteosome inhibition by MG132 markedly augmented the ubiquitin-conjugated forms of TopBP1 (lane 7). Mock transfection showed no bands that cross-reacted to the anti-TopBP1 antibodies (lane 5). Next, the fact that BRCT-domain proteins are involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint prompted us to test whether X-irradiation affects the TopBP1 ubiquitination (lane 8). Despite the presence of MG132, it is of great interest that irradiation (12 Gy) strongly diminished the ubiquitinated TopBP1. Furthermore, we then analyzed the ubiquitination of endogenous TopBP1 after DNA damage in U2OS cells that have been proved to properly respond to various DNA damages. TopBP1 was immunoprecipitated and detected with the anti-TopBP1 antibodies (Fig.4B). There were the high molecular bands corresponding to TopBP1 in addition to the unconjugated form under the proteosome inhibition by MG132 (lane 2). As was the case in COS-7 cells, irradiation (12 Gy) dramatically reduced the probably ubiquitinated forms of TopBP1 (lane 3). We did not find such conjugated forms of the protein in the control (lane 1). In addition, unconjugated TopBP1 tended to be slow migrating in lane 3. Because BRCT-domain proteins are mostly phosphorylated under DNA damage, we investigated whether irradiation (12 Gy) causes the phosphorylation of TopBP1 (Fig. 4C). Irradiation-induced mobility shift of TopBP1 was found in lane 2, and it was restored to the original state similar to the control by λ protein phosphatase (lane 3). The amount of TopBP1 seemed to increase in the damaged cells. Immunoprecipitation with preimmune antibodies gave no such bands (lanes 4–6). Taken together, these suggested that DNA double strand breaks induce the phosphorylated form of TopBP1 and inhibit the TopBP1 ubiquitination in the cells. We visualized the localization of cellular hHYD and TopBP1 in immortalized human fibroblasts. A confocal laser-scanning microscopic analysis of the intact and X-irradiated cells was performed using anti-hHYD and anti-TopBP1 antibodies (Fig. 4D). Both TopBP1 and hHYD formed fine speckles in the nucleus of the intact cells (a and b). Although the TopBP1 foci were very small, the fraction of TopBP1 appeared to associate with hHYD (c). Interestingly, TopBP1 formed multiple discrete foci in the nucleus at 8 h after irradiation (12 Gy) (d), whereas a number of hHYD foci were detected in the irradiated cells (e). TopBP1 did not specifically coexist with hHYD in the damaged cells (f). To further investigate the sites of TopBP1 localization after DNA damage, we examined whether TopBP1 colocalizes with a phosphorylated histone variant γ-H2AX, which has been proved to sense and bind DNA strand breaks (23Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar, 24Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4156) Google Scholar) (Fig.4E). The irradiation induced stable colocalization of TopBP1 and γ-H2AX in the nucleus (j and k), indicating the association of TopBP1 with the damaged DNA sites. In addition, the immunoreactivity of TopBP1 significantly increased in the damaged cells, supporting the irradiation-dependent stabilization of TopBP1 (d and j). The evidence for both ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of hHYD and TopBP1 as a substrate for hHYD-mediated ubiquitination may shed light on the molecular basis of cellular DNA damage response. TopBP1 was found to be usually ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome in intact cells. X-irradiation seemed to abolish TopBP1 degradation and induced the stable complex formation of TopBP1 with other molecules in double strand DNA breaks. The finding that hHYD bound the region containing BRCT domains of TopBP1 suggests the possible association between hHYD and other BRCT-containing proteins. With DNA damage, BRCT-domain proteins are reported to be phosphorylated and are necessary for activation of many of the cell cycle checkpoint proteins (16Anderson L. Henderson C. Adachi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1719-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 18Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 25Zhou B-B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). We observed that TopBP1 is also phosphorylated in irradiated cells. DNA damage stimulated the colocalization of TopBP1 with the sensing protein γ-H2AX into the DNA breaks, and TopBP1 is likely to contribute to the formation of a nuclear environment for the protection of DNA ends and for their repair. TopBP1 is associated with human DNA topoisomerase IIβ and appeared to be involved in DNA replication during the early S phase (26Potter T. Gohde W. Wedemeyer N. Kohnlein W. Radiat. Res. 2000; 154: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Reduced expression of TopBP1 by antisense oligonucleotides decreased cell viability after DNA damage, suggesting the biological significance of TopBP1 (14Yamane K. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5194-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mutagen-sensitive-101 (mus101) gene of Drosophila, which links DNA repair, replication, and condensation of heterochromatin in mitosis, encoded a protein with seven BRCT domains highly analogous to the overall structure of TopBP1 (27Yamamoto R.R. Axton J.M. Yamamoto Y. Saunders R.D. Glover D.M. Henderson D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 711-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mus101 mutants conferred larval hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Likewise, the yeast BRCT-containing protein, Cut5, was demonstrated to interact with Chk1 kinase, a key molecule in DNA damage and cell cycle regulation (19Saka Y. Esashi F. Matsusaka T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Gene Dev. 1997; 11: 3387-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thus, these three BRCT-containing proteins may play similar roles in the DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint. HECT-domain proteins participate in important physiological pathways, and the HECT domain is able to interact with E2 enzymes and assemble the ubiquitin chains. Meanwhile, the N-terminal extended region of the protein may mediate selective interactions with substrate proteins and factors involved in subcellular localization. The evidence that TopBP1 is ubiquitinated by hHYD in vitro was clearly indicated in Fig. 2. Using similar assays shown in Fig. 3, however, we failed to directly analyze ubiquitinated forms of TopBP1 in the hHYD immunoprecipitates from the cells expressing wild- or active cysteine mutant-type hHYD together with TopBP1 and HA-tagged ubiquitin because repeated experiments unfortunately resulted in fluctuating levels of these proteins (data not shown). This might suggest the delicate balance of E3 enzyme and its substrate in the cell. Until now, it is known that human E6AP ubiquitinates tumor suppressor protein p53 in the presence of E6 oncoprotein from Papillomavirus (9Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 10Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) and HHR23A, one of the human homologues of the yeast DNA repair protein Rad23, as the E6-independent target (28Kumar S. Talis A.L. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18785-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, E6AP was found as the gene mutated in several cases of Angelman syndrome, a genetic neurobehavioral disorder that includes severe mental retardation, microcephaly, ataxic gait with jerky arm movements, hyperactivity and inappropriate laughter, and seizures (29Matsuura T. Sutcliffe J.S. Fang P. Galjaard R.J. Jiang Y.H. Benton C.S. Rommens J.M. Beaudet A.L. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 30Kishino T. Lalande M. Wagstaff J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 70-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NEDD4 is a ubiquitin ligase for the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (22Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The C terminus of each epithelial sodium channel subunit contains a PPXY motif, which is required for interaction with the WW domains of the NEDD4. Disruption of this interaction, as in Liddle's syndrome, where mutations alter the PY motif of the subunit, results in increased epithelial sodium channel activity, leading to the heritable hypertension. We demonstrated that ubiquitination of TopBP1 by hHYD exemplifies ubiquitin conjugation linked to the DNA damage response. hHYD is the human homologue of the regulator of cell proliferation and the putative tumor suppressor hyperplastic discs in D. melanogaster. The alterations in the hyperplastic discsgene caused imaginal disc overgrowth and various developmental abnormalities (11Mansfield E. Hersperger E. Bigges J. Shearn A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Martin P. Martin A. Shearn A. Dev. Biol. 1977; 55: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Very recently, TopBP1 was reported to implicate in DNA replication and checkpoint control (31Makiniemi M. Hillukkala T. Tuusa J. Reini K. Vaara M. Huang D. Pospiech H. Majuri I. Westerling T. Makela T.P. Syvaoja J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30399-30406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In S phase, TopBP1 colocalizes with BRCA1 to foci that are not replicated DNA sites, meanwhile inhibition of DNA synthesis causes relocalization of both TopBP1 and BRCA1 to replication forks. Thus DNA damage induces formation of distinct TopBP1 foci in S phase. TopBP1 also interacts with checkpoint protein hRad9. At present, the precise roles of TopBP1 in DNA damage and cell cycle control is not clear. Nevertheless, our data suggested the possible importance of hHYD-mediated ubiquitination of TopBP1 for cell regulation and DNA damage response. We thank the Kazusa DNA Research Institute for the cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession number D87448) encoding TopBP1, Hoffmann-La Roche for providing the E2 expression vectors, and Y. Fukushima for secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2023668418,"Ligand-dependent gene transcription mediated by the nuclear receptors involves the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators to the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which leads to interaction with the basal transcription machinery, and ultimately with RNA polymerase II. Although most of these coactivators are ubiquitously expressed, a tissue-selective coactivator, PGC-1, has recently been characterized. Because PGC-1 and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) possess an overlapping tissue distribution, we investigated whether PGC-1 is a coactivator for the retinoid X receptors. In a transient transfection assay, PGC-1 augments ligand-stimulated RXR transcription. Furthermore, PGC-1 efficiently enhances the RXR element-driven reporter gene transcription by all three RXR isoforms. An immunoprecipitation assay reveals that PGC-1 and RXRα interact in vivo. In addition, a glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assay showed that this interaction requires the presence of the LXXLL motif of PGC-1. We demonstrate further, in a mammalian two-hybrid assay, that this physical interaction also requires the presence of the AF-2 region of RXR to interact with the LXXLL motif of PGC-1, which is consistent with our protein·protein interaction results. A time-resolved fluorescence assay shows that a peptide within the NR box of PGC-1 is efficiently recruited by a ligand-bound RXRα in vitro. Finally, PGC-1 and TIF2 synergistically enhance ligand-activated RXRα transcriptional activity. Taken together, these results indicate that PGC-1 is a bona fide coactivator for RXRα."
https://openalex.org/W2137066151,"Genetic alteration of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which monitors DNA damage and operates cell cycle checkpoints, is a major factor in the development of human malignancies. The p53 protein belongs to a family that also includes two structurally related proteins, p63 and p73. Although all three proteins share similar transcriptional functions and antiproliferative effects, each of them appears to play a distinct role in development and tumor suppression. One of the principal regulators of p53 activity is the MDM2 protein. The interaction of MDM2 with p53 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity and targets p53 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The ability of MDM2 to inhibit p53 functions is antagonized by the ARF oncosuppressor protein. We show here that like p53, the p63α and p63γ isoforms are able to associate with human MDM2 (HDM2). Overexpression of HDM2 increased the steady-state level of intracellular p63 and enhanced its transcriptional activity. Both effects appeared to be counteracted by ARF coexpression. These data indicate that p63 can be activated by HDM2 under conditions in which p53 is inhibited. Therefore, HDM2 expression could support p63-specific transcriptional functions on a common set of genes, keeping interference by p53 at a minimum.

Unlike p53, it shows a complex pattern of expression due to alternative splicing and promoter usage that results in multiple isoforms with different biological activities (1Chen X. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,2Lohrum M.A. Vousden K.H.

Initiation of transcription in exon 1 produces the TA isotypes, containing the evolutionarily conserved transactivation, DNA-binding, and oligomerization domains, whereas initiation in exon 3′ gives rise to the ΔN isotypes that lack the TA domain (3Yang A.

Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar). p63 shows a remarkable structural similarity to p53 and to the related p73 protein: ∼60% of the amino acids of the human p63 and p73 proteins in the region corresponding to the DNA-binding domain are identical to those of p53 (4Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M. Ikawa S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In contrast with the ubiquitous expression of p53, p63 exhibits a rather tissue-specific distribution in that it is most detectable in the basal layer of stratified epithelia, including the epidermis, where the ΔNp63α isotype is predominantly expressed (3Yang A.

However, it is still not known how the expression of different isoforms of p63 is regulated in different tissues and during development. All three members of the p53 family share similar transcriptional functions, as p63 and p73 can also activate many of the p53 target genes, although with varying efficiency (5Shimada A. Kato S. Enjo K. Osada M. Ikawa Y. Kohno K. Obinata M. Kanamaru R. Ikawa S. Ishioka C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2781-2786PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, like p73, p63 is able to induce apoptosis and growth suppression in a manner similar to p53 (4Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M. Ikawa S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Molecular alterations of p63 or p73 in human cancers appear to be rare; unlike p53-deficient mice, those lacking p73 or p63 show no increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumorigenesis (6Yang A.

Viral oncoproteins such as SV40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1B, and human papilloma virus E6, which bind and inactivate p53, do not target p73 and p63 (2Lohrum M.A. Vousden K.H.

This is most dramatically illustrated by reports showing that p63-deficient mice have severe defects in limb and skin development (9Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A.

Regulation of the p53 protein occurs to a large extent through control of protein stability, and the MDM2 (murine double minute2) protein has been shown to play a key role in targeting p53 for degradation (2Lohrum M.A. Vousden K.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 197-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ARF (alternativereading frame) protein, one of the alternative products of the INK4a locus, binds to the MDM2 protein, preventing MDM2-dependent p53 degradation and transcriptional silencing (12Weber J.D.T. Roussel L.J. Sherr M.F. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Concerning the other members of the p53 family, it has recently been demonstrated that p73 also binds MDM2. MDM2 inhibits p73-dependent transcription by masking the p73 transactivation domain and/or disrupting the interaction of p73 with p300/CBP (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein), but it is clearly not involved in the degradation of p73 (13Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated whether HDM2 (human homolog of murine doubleminute 2) and ARF are involved in the control of p63 functions. We have found that p63 is able to physically interact with HDM2. Overexpression of HDM2 increased the steady-state level of intracellular p63 and enhanced its transcriptional activity. Both effects were counteracted by ARF coexpression. Because of its opposite effects on p53 and p63 protein stability and transcriptional activity, MDM2 expression could support p63-specific transcriptional functions on a common set of genes, at the same time reducing interference by p53. The p63γ and p63α cDNAs were isolated from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library using a PCR-based technique and cloned into the BamHI site of the pcDNA3-His expression vector (Invitrogen) to express them as Xpress epitope-tagged proteins. The amplification sequence consisted of 35 cycles of 98 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, after starting with a denaturation step at 95 °C and ending with an extending step at 72 °C for 10 min. A common p63 forward primer (5′-CGGGATCCATGTCCCAGAGCACACAGACAAATG) and a p63α-specific (5′-GCGTAGTTTCTCCTCCCCCTCACTCCTAGGCG) or a p63γ-specific (5′-GGTTTGGCTAGTCACATGGTATCCCTAGGCG) reverse primer were employed to obtain p63α and p63γ, respectively. Wild-type p53 in pcDNA3 and the L22Q/W23S p53 mutant in the pCMV vector were from Dr. G. Del Sal (originally from Dr. A. J. Levine). The 1.8-kb fragment containing the wild-type p53 cDNA was retrieved by EcoRI digestion and ligated into the pcDNA3-His vector to express p53 as an Xpress epitope-tagged protein. The human Mdm2(HDM2) cDNA cloned into the bacterial pGEX4T3 expression vector was from Dr. S. Soddu (originally from Dr. D. George). The BP100-CAT reporter, containing two copies of the p53RE motif derived from the HDM2 intronic promoter, was provided by Dr. G. Del Sal (originally from Dr. B. Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore). Human Mdm2 (HDM2) was from Dr. B. Vogelstein. The 2.4-kb fragment containing the p21WAFpromoter was retrieved from the pGL3-p21 (pWWP) plasmid (14El Deiry W.S.T. Velculescu T. Levy D.B. Parson D.B. Trent R. Lin J.M. Mercer D. Kinzler W.E. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7903) Google Scholar) and ligated into the HindIII site of the pCAT0 plasmid to obtain the WAF-CAT1 reporter construct. The 680-bp SalI-PstIARF-CAT reporter from the ARF promoter will be described elsewhere. 2T. Parisi, A. Pollice, A. Di Cristofano, V. Calabrò, and G. LaMantia, submitted for publication. TheARF cDNA, previously described (15Calabrò V. Di Parisi T. Cristofano A. La Mantia G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2157-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), was cloned into the pcDNA3.1-His mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The pEGFP-C1 expression vector (CLONTECH) containing DNA sequences for the enhanced green fluorescent protein was used for normalization of transfection efficiency. Saos2, C33A, and COS-7 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For CAT assays, C33A cells (1 × 105) were seeded in 100-mm diameter dishes and transiently transfected (16 h later) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Equal amounts of expression plasmids for p53, p63γ, and p63α were cotransfected along with the p21WAF-CAT, BP100-CAT, or ARF promoter reporter construct. The total amount of transfected DNA (20 μg) was kept constant using empty vector DNA when necessary. Cells were collected 30–48 h after transfection; equal quantities of proteins, determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Munchen, Germany), were assayed for CAT activity using 0.1 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol and 4 mm acetyl-CoA. Separated products were detected and quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) and ImageQuant software. The pCMV-βgal plasmid (1.5 μg) was used to normalize CAT values for transfection efficiency. Saos2 cells (2.5 × 105) were seeded into six-well multiplates and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) under the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. At 48 h after transfection, equal quantities of proteins (determined by the Bradford method) were assayed for CAT activity. The amounts of MDM2 and ARF expression plasmids used in the transactivation experiments are indicated in the legends. The GST-HDM2 fusion protein cloned into bacterial pGEX4T3 was expressed inEscherichia coli under the inducible lac promoter and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 12B column. Protein-protein association assay was conducted as follows. 20 μl of in vitro translated, 35S-labeled p63γ, p63α, L22Q/W23S p53, or wild-type p53 (TNT, Promega) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the GST-HDM2 fusion protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (200-μl total reaction volume). The mixtures were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The bound proteins were analyzed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. Saos2 cells (three 60-mm dishes) were transfected with 2 μg of parental pcDNA3-His, p63α, and p63γ with or without 2 μg of HDM2 expression plasmid with LipofectAMINE 2000. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). Debris was removed by centrifugation. Lysates (0.5 mg of protein) were precleared with 30 μl of protein A-agarose (50% slurry) and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of polyclonal anti-p63 antibody (H-137, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fresh protein A beads (30 μl) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were loaded directly onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel after two washes with immunoprecipitation buffer. The co-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-MDM2 (smp14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Xpress (Invitrogen) antibodies. Saos2 and COS-7 cells (2.5 × 105in six-well plates) were transfected using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. The pEGFP-C1 expression vector was included in these experiments as a control of transfection efficiency. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested by scraping in 100 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5% deoxycholate and lysed by sonication. Expression levels of both the transfected p63 and ARF proteins were determined by Western blotting using the anti-Xpress antibodies. The identity of the p63 bands was confirmed using anti-p63 antibodies (N-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The p21WAF protein was revealed using mouse anti-human p21 antibody 6B6 (Pierce). Human MDM2 (HDM2) was detected with antibody smp14. The p53 protein was detected with the anti-Xpress antibodies or monoclonal mouse anti-human p53 antibody Pab240 (Pierce) as indicated. Bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). To compare the stability of p63α and p63γ, Saos2 cells expressing the indicated cDNAs were treated with cycloheximide (final concentration of 80 μg/ml) and harvested at the indicated time points. Cells were processed for Western blotting as described above. The 26 S proteasome inhibitor ALLN (50 μm; Sigma) was used. Tubulin was detected with an anti-tubulin antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For reverse transcriptase-PCR, 24 h after transfection, cells were collected, and total RNA was isolated using the Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. 500 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using 200 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen) and PCR-amplified as described above. The 600-bp fragment of the human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene was amplified using the following primers: 5′-CCTGCTGGATTACATTAAAGCACTG and 5′- CCTGAAGTACTCATTATAGTCAAGG. The p63γ and p63α cDNAs encode proteins of 448 and 641 amino acids, respectively (4Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M. Ikawa S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The longer α isoform possesses an extended C-terminal region of 187 residues; but the rest of the protein, with the exception of the last 40 residues of the γ isoform, is shared by the two protein isoforms. The C-terminal region of p63α includes a sterile α-motif that has been described as a putative protein-protein interaction domain (16De Levrero M. Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Wang J.Y. Melino G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1661-1670PubMed Google Scholar). The three major domains of p53 (NH2-terminal transactivation, DNA-binding, and oligomerization domains) are conserved in both the γ and α isoforms. We isolated the p63γ and p63α cDNAs by reverse transcriptase-PCR from a human skeletal muscle library and cloned them into the pcDNA3.1-His expression vector. Before assessing the effect of HDM2 on the transcriptional activity of both p63 isoforms, it was of interest to compare the transcriptional properties of the two p63 isotypes on two canonical p53-responsive promoters, p21WAFand HDM2 (BP100-CAT). C33A (p53−/−) and Saos2 cell lines, which not only lack endogenous p53, but also exhibit low levels of p73 (17Lee C.W. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4171-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), were transfected with equal amounts of p63γ or p63α expression vector together with the CAT reporter plasmids. As a positive control, we also transfected a p53 expression vector. As shown in Fig.1 (A and B), both p63 isoforms stimulated CAT activity, although a significant difference in efficiency was observed: p63α enhanced CAT expression driven from either promoter less strongly than p63γ in both cell lines. Although the ARF promoter does not contain p53-binding elements, it is trans-repressed by p53 (18Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6457-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar),2suggesting the existence of an autoregulatory feedback loop limiting the effect of ARF on p53 stabilization. Based on the functional similarity between p53 and p63, we tested whether or not p63 was also able to inhibit transcription driven by the human ARFpromoter. C33A cells were cotransfected with the ARF-CAT reporter plasmid and the p53, p63γ, or p63α expression plasmid. Fig. 1C shows that both p63γ and p63α reducedARF-CAT expression, although less efficiently than p53. These results indicate that p63 also shares thetrans-repression ability with p53. Again, p63γ appears to be more efficient than the α isoform. To investigate whether the differences observed in the transcriptional properties of p63γ and p63α were due to different expression levels of the α and γ isoforms, we measured the protein levels of the two isotypes 48 h after transfection in the Saos2 cell line. The stronger transcriptional activity of p63γ cannot be attributed to a higher expression level, as Western blot analysis revealed that p63α levels exceeded those of p63γ (Fig.2A). Similar results were obtained in COS-7 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the extended C-terminal region, which distinguishes p63α from p63γ, could influence the level of the p63 protein, perhaps altering its half-life. We assessed this possibility by introducing expression vectors for p63α and p63γ into Saos2 cells and following their protein levels after treatment with cycloheximide (19Gu J. Chen D. Rosenblum J. Rubin R.M. Yuan Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because cycloheximide inhibits de novo protein synthesis, the half-life of the proteins could be determined by Western blot analysis in cells treated with the drug. As Fig. 2B clearly shows, p63α had a markedly prolonged half-life. Because MDM2 inhibited both p53 and p73 transcriptional activity, we wanted to determine whether it also affected p63-driven transcription. To investigate this point, we cotransfected Saos2 cells with the BP100-CAT reporter plasmid, p63γ (Fig.3A), or p63α (Fig.3B) as transactivator and increasing amounts of HDM2. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B, third andfourth bars), cotransfection of p63γ or p63α and HDM2 expression plasmids in 1:2 and 1:4 molar ratios produced a remarkable enhancement of p63 transcriptional activity. As a control, we performed the same experiment using p53 as transactivator. As expected, coexpression of HDM2 considerably reduced the p53 transcriptional activity measured on the BP100-CAT reporter (Fig. 3C). A 1:1 molar ratio (second bar) of p53 to HDM2 was already sufficient to reduce the p53 transcriptional activity to 46% with respect to that observed without HDM2, and increasing amounts of HDM2 caused no more than an additional 10–16% reduction of p53 transcriptional activity. The interaction between MDM2 and p53 inhibits the p53 transactivation ability and targets p53 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Taking into account the effect of HDM2 on p63 transactivation ability, we decided to assess the effect of HDM2 expression on the level of the p63 protein. First, we wanted to test whether p63 may physically interact with HDM2. Extensive mutational analyses of the HDM2-binding domain of p53 (FSDLW) have identified Phe19, Leu22, and Trp23 as the critical residues for transcriptional activation and p53 binding by MDM2. We observed that these amino acid residues, except for a conservative Leu22-to-Ile substitution, are present in the p63 MDM2-binding domain (FQHIW). The p63γ and p63α proteins were synthesized and [35S]Met-labeled by an in vitro transcription/translation assay. The L22Q/W23S p53 mutant protein, which is unable to interact with MDM2 (20Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), and wild-type p53 were obtained in a similar way. SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography revealed that proteins of the expected size and in comparable amounts were obtained in all cases (data not shown). The reticulocyte lysates were then incubated with the GSH-agarose-immobilized GST-HDM2 fusion protein. After appropriate washing, the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Fig.4A shows that the interaction of both p63γ and p63α with the GST-HDM2 protein was comparable to that of wild-type p53. Using the mutant p53 protein, a negligible amount of protein was detected. To confirm the interaction between p63 and HDM2 in intact cells, we cotransfected Saos2 cells with p63α or p63γ and the HDM2-encoding expression vector. Cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-p63 antibody H-137 and probed with the monoclonal anti-MDM2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, HDM2 was co-immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal anti-p63 antibody when coexpressed with p63α or p63γ. Binding of MDM2 to p53 is required for targeting p53 for degradation (21Haupt Y. Mayd R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3679) Google Scholar); p73, however, binds to MDM2, but is refractory to MDM2-mediated degradation (13Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), indicating that binding to MDM2 is necessary but not sufficient for degradation. Recent findings indicate that a proline-rich sequence (from amino acid 92 to 112) of p53 is a degradation signal (19Gu J. Chen D. Rosenblum J. Rubin R.M. Yuan Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This degradation signal is not present in the p73 and p63 proteins. To elucidate the effect of HDM2 on p63 protein levels, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with equal amounts of p53 (Fig. 5A) and p63α (Fig. 5B) and increasing amounts of HDM2 expression vector. 0.5 μg of plasmid pEGFP-C1 were included as the transfection control. Cellular lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against the Xpress epitope (Fig. 5B). The identity of the p63 bands was then confirmed using an antibody raised against the N terminus of the p63 protein (data not shown). The p53 protein was revealed with an antibody raised against an epitope corresponding to amino acids 156–214 of the human p53 protein (Fig.5A), whereas the HDM2 protein was revealed with an antibody raised against an epitope corresponding to amino acids 154–167 of the human MDM2 protein (Fig. 5, A and B). Anti-GFP immunoblotting demonstrated that, in all cases, comparable transfection efficiency was achieved. HDM2-induced degradation of the p53 protein was detected easily, and the effect was found to be dose-dependent (Fig. 5A). Moreover, as the COS-7 cells expressed detectable levels of the endogenous p53 protein (Fig.5A, lanes 1–3), a reduction of the endogenous p53 protein level was seen when HDM2 was overexpressed. In contrast, overexpression of HDM2 resulted in a remarkable increase in the level of the p63α protein (Fig. 5B). Moreover, a parallel increase in the level of endogenous p21WAF was observed (Fig.5B). Because we observed an effect of HDM2 on the p63 transcriptional activity in Saos2 cells, we performed similar experiments in this cell line with both p63 isoforms; and again, we noticed a progressive rise in the level of the p63α protein when increasing amounts of HDM2 were cotransfected (Fig. 5C). To determine whether the elevation in the p63α protein level was due to an increase in transcription or stability of p63α mRNA, we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments. Fig.6A shows that the relative level of p63α mRNA was similar in the presence and absence of HDM2, suggesting that the effect of MDM2 on p63 may be post-translational. Fig. 6B shows that, after treatment with ALLN, a proteasome inhibitor, more p63α protein was detected, suggesting that the p63α protein may be degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway. Significantly, ALLN did not further increase the level of p63α in the presence of HDM2, suggesting that HDM2 and ALLN may both act to prevent proteasome-dependent degradation. Similar results were obtained with the p63γ isotype (data not shown). Hence, HDM2 increases p63 protein levels under conditions in which p53 is degraded. Among the growing number of proteins that interact with MDM2, particular interest has recently been focused on ARF, which is encoded by the INK4a locus. Because ARF binds to the MDM2 protein, preventing MDM2-dependent p53 degradation and transcriptional silencing (12Weber J.D.T. Roussel L.J. Sherr M.F. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 22Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), we predicted that ARF could counteract the effect of MDM2 on p63. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected, in Saos2 cells, the BP100-CAT (Fig. 7A) orWAF-CAT (data not shown) reporter with a fixed amount of HDM2 and increasing amounts of ARF. We used a molar ratio (4:1) of HDM2 to p63α that we know results in a strong enhancement of p63 transcriptional activation and protein stabilization (Figs.3B, fourth bar; and 5C, lane 4). As shown in Fig. 7A, when increasing amounts of ARF were added, the increase in p63 transcriptional activity induced by HDM2 was progressively abolished. No effect was observed on the p63-driven transcription of the reporter plasmids when only ARF was expressed (Fig. 7A, sixth bar). We then tested whether or not ARF was also able to reduce the HDM2-induced enhancement of the p63 protein level. The p63α expression plasmid was transfected in the Saos2 cell line with or without a fixed amount of HDM2 expression vector and increasing amounts of ARF vector (Fig.7B). Exogenous expression of HDM2 produced an increase in the p63 level (Fig. 7B, lane 5) that was progressively abolished by the addition of increasing amounts of ARF expression vector (lanes 6–8). Moreover, as the Saos2 cells expressed detectable levels of endogenous HDM2 proteins (Fig.7B, lane 1), a slight reduction of the p63 protein level was also seen when ARF alone was overexpressed (lanes 2–4). Similar results were obtained using the p63γ expression vector (data not shown). Although there exists extensive information on the relationship between MDM2 and p53, far less is known about a possible functional interaction of MDM2 with p63. In this study, we report that MDM2 overexpression causes an increase in overall p63 protein levels due, at least in part, to a reduced rate of p63 protein degradation. Moreover, although MDM2 represses p53 transcriptional activity, enforced MDM2 expression causes instead a considerable enhancement of p63-mediated transcription, which can be ascribed to the increase in transcriptionally active p63 protein. While this paper was in preparation, several studies were published reporting conflicting results on the functional relationship between p63 and the MDM2 protein. For instance, it was reported that exogenously expressed MDM2 represses p63-mediated transcription (23Kadakia M. Slader C. Berberich S. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was proposed that MDM2 is unable to affect its half-life or its transcriptional function (24Little N. Jochemsen A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4576-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in conflict with the present and above-mentioned papers. It is well documented that transiently transfected p63 is able to strongly induce the endogenous MDM2 protein (25Yang A. McKeon F. Nat. Res. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and we repeatedly observed that only at a low level of p63 exogenous expression is the induction of endogenous MDM2 negligible, so that the stabilization effect by transfected MDM2 becomes apparent. However, compared with our results, both Kadakiaet al. (23Kadakia M. Slader C. Berberich S. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and Little and Jochemsen (24Little N. Jochemsen A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4576-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) obtained remarkably higher levels of p63α and p63γ exogenous expression, already sufficient to induce expression of endogenous MDM2. A possible explanation of the apparent discrepancy with our results is that, under their experimental conditions, p63 exogenous protein had already undergone stabilization, so that addition of exogenous MDM2 caused no further effect. Moreover, we also demonstrate that p63 proteins are able to form a complex with HDM2 both in vitro and in mammalian cells, suggesting that the mechanism through which HDM2 regulates p63 expression requires a physical interaction between these proteins. Because it is well established that ARF stabilizes p53 by binding and sequestering MDM2, we expected ARF to exert an inhibitory effect on p63 protein stabilization. In fact, ARF coexpression abolishes both MDM2-induced p63 protein stabilization and transcriptional activation, giving further evidence that p63-MDM2 interaction has a functional role. A recent analysis of the molecular interactions of p63 in a yeast two-hybrid system (26Kojima T. Ikawua Y. Katoh I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1170-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggested that p63 does not associate with MDM2 family proteins. However, this analysis was performed using only the N-terminal portion of the p63 protein (amino acids 1–111), so it cannot be excluded that other regions of the protein are essential for the p63-MDM2 interaction or that some tertiary structure formed by a more extended region may also be required for the binding. On the other hand, Little and Jochemsen (24Little N. Jochemsen A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4576-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) detected a weak interaction by an in vitro assay, but this could not be confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. Because we observed that MDM2 displays a lower affinity for p63 than it does for p53, it is possible that the use of less efficient antibodies or more stringent washing conditions could have hampered the analysis of the protein-protein interaction by immunoprecipitation. Remarkably, MDM2 has been reported to facilitate p63 export from the nucleus (23Kadakia M. Slader C. Berberich S. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but whether a direct MDM2 association with p63 is required for this activity remains to be elucidated. Until recently, a similarly controversial question has been how MDM2 regulates the stability and transcriptional activity of the third member of the p53 family, the p73 protein (27Balint E. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3923-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 28Ongkeko W.M. Wang X.Q. Siu W.Y. Lau A.W. Yamashita K. Harris A.L. Cox L.S. Poon R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 829-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Now a clear picture is emerging: MDM2 interacts with p73, stabilizing and enhancing its growth-suppressive function (29Daujat S. Neel H. Piette J. Trends Genetics. 2001; 17: 459-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, in sharp contrast to p53, MDM2 induces p73 to form nuclear aggregates that colocalize with MDM2 (30Gu J. Nie L. Kawai H. Yuan Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6703-6707PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, p73 levels are increased in MDM2-expressing cells (30Gu J. Nie L. Kawai H. Yuan Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6703-6707PubMed Google Scholar). Both p63 and p73 therefore bind to MDM2, but are refractory to MDM2-mediated degradation, indicating that binding is necessary but not sufficient for degradation. These results are not surprising given that, although the N-terminal MDM2-binding motif of p53 is conserved in both p63 and p73 (31Momand J. Wu H. Dasgupta G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), p53 has a unique sequence element (amino acids 92–112) that functions as a signal for MDM2-mediated degradation (19Gu J. Chen D. Rosenblum J. Rubin R.M. Yuan Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). How this sequence of p53 functions as a degradation signal remains to be defined. Although we have not determined the precise mechanism by which MDM2 increases p63 protein levels, our data argue that, like the proteasome inhibitor ALLN, MDM2 may act by preventing p63 proteasome-dependent degradation. In addition to MDM2, the p300/CBP protein has also been shown to play a role in allowing efficient p53 degradation. Surprisingly, loss of p300 activity results in an inability to stabilize p53 in response to DNA damage, indicating that there is a complex relationship between p300 and p53 stability (32Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the reason why p73 is refractory to MDM2 degradation might be related to the observation that, unlike p53, p73 is unable to bind both MDM2 and p300 simultaneously (13Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism could also explain the p63 resistance to MDM2 degradation. We are currently investigating the relationship between p63 and the p300/CBP coactivator as well as the exact pathway through which MDM2 induces an increase in p63 intracellular levels. In conclusion, MDM2 seems to regulate p53 and its homologs through completely opposite mechanisms, suggesting that both p73 and p63 could be involved in specific cellular defense mechanisms against the deregulated expression of MDM2. We can also speculate that, in cells expressing both p63 and p53 proteins, certain stimuli that up-regulate MDM2 can, at the same time, activate p63 functions by keeping p53 activity at a minimum, whereas oncogenic stimuli that induce the ARF protein can cause the opposite. Moreover, once activated, p63 might contribute to its activation by keeping the level of ARF transcription low. These considerations suggest that the role of p63 may not be as central as that of p53 in tumor suppression, although it cannot be excluded that p63 could provide a protection from cancer development in tissues expressing both p53 and p63 proteins. The role of p73 and p63 during normal development, the identification of differentiation genes specifically activated by p63 and p73 but not by p53 (33De Laurenzi V. Rossi A. Terrinoni A.

Commun. 2000; 273: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the difference in the ability to transactivate p53 target genes all strongly support the notion that these proteins, although closely related, have differentiated distinct physiological functions. The difference observed in the mechanisms adopted by MDM2 to control their functions further supports this emerging view. We thank Rosaria Terracciano for technical help and Drs. G. Del Sal, S.

Many Gram-negative bacteria, for example, can grow on compounds as different as methylamine, ethanol, and glucose as their sole source of carbon and energy (1Matsumoto T. Biochim. Biophys.

The crucial, first step in the catabolism of such compounds is often an oxidation reaction catalyzed by a class of periplasmic enzymes called quinoproteins. Quinoproteins are oxidoreductases that possess one of four different quinone compounds instead of nicotinamide or flavin cofactors (4Salisbury S.A. Forrest H.S. Cruse W.B.T. Kennard O.

Biochem. 1991; 200: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Two different types of PQQ-containing alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) have been characterized. The first type includes quinoprotein ethanol dehydrogenases (EDHs) from several Pseudomonas species (9Groen B. Frank Jr., J. Duine J.A. Biochem.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5187-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) complexes have provided detailed insights into the dehydrogenation reaction. A recent MDH structure revealed the presence of a PQQ intermediate in the catalytic mechanism (28Zheng Y.J. Xia Z. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Bruice T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 432-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data have clearly shown how sGDH and MDH react with their substrates and, although no information has so far been available to substantiate this hypothesis, it has been argued that the same mechanism operates in the other quinoprotein ADHs (29Oubrie A. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, much less is known about how these enzymes catalyze the electron transfer reactions from reduced PQQ (PQQH2) to the natural electron acceptors. To obtain more information about these reactions, the QH-ADH fromComamonas testosteroni has been studied extensively (30Geerlof A. Rakels J.J. Straathof A.J. Heijnen J.J. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31de Jong G.A.H. Geerlof A. Stoorvogel J. Jongejan J.A. de Vries S. Duine J.A. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1996; 235: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This enzyme consists of two distinct functional domains. The N-terminal domain binds PQQ and calcium in the active site and is homologous to the PQQ-binding domains of all quinoprotein ADHs. The C-terminal domain has a covalently attached heme c and is similar to some cytochrome c proteins (33Stoorvogel J. Kraayveld D.E. Van Sluis C.A. De Jongejan J.A. Vries S. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). QH-ADH oxidizes primary alcohols and aldehydes in the PQQ-binding domain (31de Jong G.A.H. Geerlof A. Stoorvogel J. Jongejan J.A. de Vries S. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Subsequently, protons and electrons are removed from PQQH2. The protons are released into the periplasm, thus contributing to the proton-motive force. The electrons are transferred one by one to the heme c in the C-terminal domain (30Geerlof A. Rakels J.J. Straathof A.J. Heijnen J.J. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32de Jong G.A.H. Caldeira J. Sun J. Jongejan J.A. de Vries S. Loehr T.M. Moura I. Moura J.J. Duine J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9451-9458Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); from there they are carried by the blue copper protein azurin to a terminal cytochrome oxidase (34Matsushita K. Yamashita T. Aoki N. Toyama H. Adachi O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6111-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Alcohol oxidation is thus efficiently coupled to the generation of an electrochemical gradient, which in turn drives ATP synthesis. Further advances in understanding the mechanisms of proton and electron transfer in QH-ADH, and in PQQ-dependent proteins in general, have awaited the determination of the three-dimensional structure of QH-ADH. QH-ADH was purified fromC. testosteroni cells grown on ethanol (31de Jong G.A.H. Geerlof A. Stoorvogel J. Jongejan J.A. de Vries S. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The enzyme was crystallized using polyethylene glycol 6000 as the precipitant (35Oubrie A. Huizinga E.G. Rozeboom H.J.

Open table in a new tab The orientation and position of the PQQ domain were determined by molecular replacement using the program EPMR (37Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr.

The six best solutions were very similar, having a correlation coefficient of 26.7% and an R-factor of 54.7%. The model was improved by rigid body refinement and several cycles of manual rebuilding using the program O (39Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and refinement using the simulated annealing protocol from CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Niles M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). At this point it was impossible to recognize features in the electron density that could account for the presence of the heme cdomain. Moreover, exhaustive rotational searches using numerous cytochrome c models were unsuccessful. Therefore, alternative methods were used to determine the structure of the cytochrome domain. First, a multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data set was collected at beam line BM14 at the ESRF in Grenoble, France (Table I). These data were processed and reduced with DENZO/SCALEPACK (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Although the MAD data did not yield good phases, anomalous and dispersive Patterson maps calculated with programs from the CCP4 suite (42Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) showed intense peaks and clearly identified the position of iron, and thereby that of heme c, in the unit cell. Secondly, QH-ADH crystals have special optical properties. When viewed under plane-polarized light, their intense orange color caused by the presence of the heme group disappears completely. This property was used to show that the heme rings in the crystals are oriented within 10° of the c axis and parallel to the crystallographic b axis (35Oubrie A. Huizinga E.G. Rozeboom H.J. De Kalk K.H. Jong G.A.H. Duine J.A. Dijkstra B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1732-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). With this information, a heme group could be positioned correctly in the electron density. After many rounds of alternated model building and refinement using various protocols from CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Niles M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar), the electron density maps improved considerably and the auto-building routine of the ARP-WARP package (43Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar) was used to trace the model. Further refinement resulted in a final model consisting of one QH-ADH monomer (residues 1–675), one calcium ion, one PQQ and one heme c cofactor, 1029 water molecules, and three glycerol molecules. Three residues (Asn181, Gly182, and Gly566) are different from the published amino acid sequence (33Stoorvogel J. Kraayveld D.E. Van Sluis C.A. De Jongejan J.A. Vries S. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and Trp512 has been modified to contain a hydroxyl group attached to its CD1 atom. A large fragment of electron density, present in the active site, has been modeled as tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (38Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26227) Google Scholar) (PDB accession code 1KB0). The three-dimensional structure of QH-ADH (677 residues) consists of two distinct domains connected by a long linker (residues 567–590), which spans the whole length of the protein (Fig. 1). The respective orientation of the two domains is completely different from that published in a rudimentary homology model (44Jongejan A. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cytochrome domain is located on top of the dehydrogenase. The edge-to-edge distance and the angle between PQQ and heme c are 12.9 Å and 74°, respectively. The surface area buried between the two domains, as calculated with the program Surface (42Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar), is 1028 Å2 on each domain. Direct interdomain contacts (ignoring the connecting loop) involve residues 66–67, 109–110, 113, 118, 430–437, 440, 446, 541, and 546–550 from the dehydrogenase and residues 598, 601–607, 609, 614–619, 643–646, 648, and 653 from cytochrome c. Most of these interactions are hydrophobic. In addition, 16 direct and several solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds stabilize the respective orientation of the domains. Two different channels can be identified in the structure: one leads from the solvent to the PQQ-binding site, whereas the other contains a chain of hydrogen-bonded water molecules that connects the bulk solvent to a cavity between the two domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1–566) has a β-propeller fold (Fig. 1) and is very similar to the PQQ-binding domains of MDH (21Blake C.C. Ghosh M. Harlos K. Avezoux A. Anthony C. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 2000; 297: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The core of the structure is formed by eight four-stranded β-sheets arranged in a radial manner. Six of the eight β-sheets contain one copy of a conserved sequence called the tryptophan-docking motif. The conserved residues cause a tryptophan residue to be buried in a hydrophobic pocket and to stack onto the peptide bond of a glycine residue located on a neighboring β-sheet. The tryptophan-docking motif probably stabilizes the β-propeller fold. It has been described in more detail for MDH (22Ghosh M. Anthony C. Harlos K. Goodwin M.G. Blake C.

Biol. 2000; 297: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PQQ is located near the top of the β-propeller in a hydrophobic cavity that is accessible through a deep and narrow channel. Because PQQ and its orthoquinone moiety in particular are essentially planar, the cofactor is presumably in the aromatic PQQH2 form. PQQH2 was also shown to be planar in a sGDH-PQQH2-glucose complex (27Oubrie A. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Olsthoorn A.J.J. Duine J.A. Dijkstra B.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5187-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas oxidized PQQ had a tilted geometry in a high-resolution structure of sGDH (26Oubrie A. Rozeboom H.J. Dijkstra B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11787-11791Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PQQH2 has in-plane hydrogen-bonding interactions with the side chains of Glu70, Arg122, Thr167, Asn263, Asp308, Lys335, Asn394, and Trp395, and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Ala183, Ala184, and Val544 (Fig. 2A). In addition, it ligates the active site calcium with its O5, N6, and O7A atoms in an identical fashion to all other PQQ-dependent proteins of known structure. One side of the tricyclic ring system of PQQ stacks on the side chain of Trp245, and the other side interacts with a disulfide bond. This bond is made between the strictly conserved, adjacent cysteines 116 and 117 (Fig. 2A). The formation of this vicinal disulfide bond creates an eight-membered ring structure and forces the peptide bond in a nonplanar trans configuration. A disulfide bridge between adjacent residues is extremely rare, which suggests that it has an important biological function. The C-terminal domain (residues 591–677) classifies as a type I cytochrome c. The structure is comprised of five α-helical segments that enclose thec-type heme (Fig. 1), which is covalently attached to Cys604 and Cys607 (Fig. 2B). The heme-iron is coordinated by His608 and Met647, and it is in a low-spin hexa-coordinated state, as was shown previously by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and resonance Raman spectroscopy (31de Jong G.A.H. Geerlof A. Stoorvogel J. Jongejan J.A. de Vries S. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32de Jong G.A.H. Caldeira J. Sun J. Jongejan J.A. de Vries S. Loehr T.M. Moura I. Moura J.J. Duine J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9451-9458Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two of the methyl groups (CMA and CMB) of the heme are surrounded by hydrophobic residues (Cys604, Leu622, Met625, Ile630, Leu633, Tyr629, Phe636, Val637, Leu662, and Ile666; Fig.2B), as was suggested by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (32de Jong G.A.H. Caldeira J. Sun J. Jongejan J.A. de Vries S. Loehr T.M. Moura I. Moura J.J. Duine J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9451-9458Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The other two methyl groups (CMC and CMD) are in a more hydrophilic environment (not shown). The pyrrole ring to which either CMC or CMD is attached experiences an increase in spin density upon addition of PQQ to PQQ-deficient protein. This could be caused by a rotation of the axial heme-iron ligand Met647 around its Cγ-Sδ bond (32de Jong G.A.H. Caldeira J. Sun J. Jongejan J.A. de Vries S. Loehr T.M. Moura I. Moura J.J. Duine J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9451-9458Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but unfortunately the three-dimensional structure does not provide clues about this. The substrate-binding site is located near PQQ in a hydrophobic cavity. This cavity is much larger than that of MDH and EDH and accounts for the relatively broad substrate specificity of QH-ADH. It contains a ring-shaped electron density, which has been interpreted as tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid (Fig. 3). The presence of this compound in the active site may result from the oxidation of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) by QH-ADH. The conversions of THFA to tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid by the 61% identical, THFA-oxidizing QH-ADH from Ralstonia eutropha (16Zarnt G. Schrader T. Andreesen J.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Zarnt G. Schrader T. Andreesen J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1954-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and of bulky primary alcohols to the corresponding acids by the Comamonas enzyme (31de Jong G.A.H. Geerlof A. Stoorvogel J. Jongejan J.A. de Vries S. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have been described. Except for Tyr390, which is replaced by a Phe, all residues that interact with tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid are identical between the R. eutropha and C. testosteroni QH-ADHs, making it likely that the C. testosteroni enzyme can also degrade THFA. THFA is frequently used as an organic solvent in industry, and therefore it may have contaminated solutions for protein production, purification, and/or crystallization. Tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid is tightly bound: the tetrahydrofuran ring makes van der Waals contacts with the hydrophobic wall of the cavity formed by residues Trp267, Pro389, Tyr390, Trp440, Phe446, Val544, and Phe606 (Fig.3). The carboxylic acid O2A atom is hydrogen-bonded to Asp308 (OD2 atom at 2.3 Å) and Glu185 (OE1 at 3.0 Å), whereas the O2B atom is bound to Glu185 (OE1 at 2.5 Å), Cys116 (SG at 3.0 Å), and Cys117 (SG at 2.9 Å). Because these interactions include direct contacts between several carboxylate groups, at least one of them should be in the carboxylic acid form. Unfortunately, this is not resolved in the present x-ray structure. As the product of two subsequent oxidation reactions catalyzed by QH-ADH, tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid is the first catalytically relevant molecule to be bound in the active site of a Q-ADH. It therefore provides valuable information about the amino acid residues involved in the oxidation reactions of this class of enzymes and their catalytic function, as will be discussed in the next section. The mechanism of alcohol oxidation has been extensively studied for MDH and sGDH (glucose is a secondary alcohol). These enzymes oxidize their substrates according to a mechanism involving base-catalyzed proton abstraction in concert with direct hydride transfer from the substrate to the C5 atom of PQQ and subsequent tautomerization of the PQQ intermediate to PQQH2 (Fig.4A). The C5 atom is susceptible to nucleophilic addition because of polarization of the C5–O5 bond by calcium (27Oubrie A. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Olsthoorn A.J.J. Duine J.A. Dijkstra B.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5187-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Zheng Y.J. Xia Z. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Bruice T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 432-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Oubrie A. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 46Dewanti A.R. Duine J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9384-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because the catalytic machinery of MDH is strictly conserved in QH-ADH, the mechanisms of alcohol oxidation are most likely identical for both enzymes. In QH-ADH, the side chains of Glu185 and Asp308 ligate the oxygen atoms of tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid (Fig. 3). Because both amino acid residues are conserved, either one of them could, in principle, act as the general base to catalyze proton abstraction. However, the hydrogen bond between tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid and Asp308 is shorter (2.3 Å) than that between the acid and Glu185 (3.0 Å), and in MDH the equivalent of Asp308, not of Glu185, is hydrogen-bonded to the only active site water molecule (28Zheng Y.J. Xia Z. Chen Z. Mathews F.S. Bruice T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 432-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, Asp308 is in a similar position to His144, the catalytic base in the sGDH (27Oubrie A. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Olsthoorn A.J.J. Duine J.A. Dijkstra B.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5187-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the conserved Asp308functions as the catalytic base in the oxidation reactions. The mechanism of aldehyde oxidation is different from alcohol oxidation because the conversion of an aldehyde into an acid requires the addition of a hydroxyl group. Under the assumption that the same catalytic machinery is used for such a reaction, the following mechanism for the oxidation of aldehydes by QH-ADH may be proposed on the basis of the binding of tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid in the active site (Fig. 4B): Asp308 is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule and the aldehyde substrate is bound with its oxygen atom to the OE1 atom of Glu185 and the SG atoms of Cys116 and Cys117. Asp308 abstracts a proton from the hydrogen-bonded water, and the resultant hydroxyl ion performs a nucleophilic attack on the aldehyde C1 atom to yield the corresponding acid. This occurs in concert with hydride transfer from the aldehyde C1 to the PQQ C5 atom. This mechanism involves a shift in binding position for aldehydes (oxygen atom is bound to Glu185), compared with alcohols (oxygen atom close to Asp308). Kinetic evidence is available to substantiate the existence of such an alternative binding site (30Geerlof A. Rakels J.J. Straathof A.J. Heijnen J.J. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because heme c is a one-electron acceptor, the two electrons from PQQH2 must be transferred in two separate steps. The PQQ intermediate between these steps is the free-radical PQQH, which was identified by EPR spectroscopy (31de Jong G.A.H. Geerlof A. Stoorvogel J. Jongejan J.A. de Vries S. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The redox centers and the intervening protein medium in QH-ADH are shown in Fig.5. The shortest distance between PQQ and heme c is 12.9 Å. The conserved disulfide bond between Cys116 and Cys117 is positioned right between PQQ and heme c. Asp118 and Arg67 are also located between the cofactors. Asp118 is conserved in all PQQ-dependent ADHs, including MDHs, whereas Arg67 is present in all ADHs with the exception of some MDHs (not shown). Other residues located in the vicinity of the redox sites but not involved in cofactor binding are much less conserved. In addition, several water molecules are located in the interface between the redox centers. The electron transfer rate in biological systems is strongly related to the edge-to-edge distance between the redox centers involved (47Moser C.C. Keske J.M. Warncke K. Farid R.S. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1992; 355: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). Electrons can travel up to about 14 Å between two redox centers through the protein medium, but transfer over longer distances always involves additional redox sites (48Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). The 12.9 Å distance between PQQ and heme c is thus one of the longest between functional redox centers determined so far and close to the maximum travel distance of electrons. Using this distance and a calculated value of 0.63 for the atomic density between the two cofactors, a maximum electron transfer rate of 1.0 × 105 s−1could be predicted (48Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar) with the program Harlem (49Kurnikov I.V. Harlem Computer Program. University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh2000Google Scholar). This value is much higher than that of substrate oxidation (kcat = 17 s−1), consistent with kinetic data showing that the influence of electron transfer on the kinetic mechanism of QH-ADH is negligible (30Geerlof A. Rakels J.J. Straathof A.J. Heijnen J.J. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The intervening protein medium is another important parameter for electron transfer. For PQQ-dependent ADHs, this is stressed by the fact that reduction of the disulfide bond between the active site cysteines in MDH completely abolished electron transfer from MDH to cytochrome cL (21Blake C.C. Ghosh M. Harlos K. Avezoux A. Anthony C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The intervening medium may have several different functions in QH-ADH. Given the large separation between PQQ and heme c, close to the maximum distance electrons may travel, one function of the medium may be to reduce that distance by providing an additional redox center. In principle, the disulfide bond between cysteines 116 and 117 could act as such by accepting two electrons and two protons. A disulfide bond involved in redox reactions is indeed located close to an iron-sulfur cofactor in the ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductase system (50Dai S. Schwendtmayer C. Schurmann P. Ramaswamy S. Eklund H. Science. 2000; 287: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, biochemical experiments indicate that the disulfide bond of quinoprotein MDH is not reduced during the redox cycle (51Avezoux A. Goodwin M.G. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that it does not function as a redox center in PQQ-dependent enzymes. Alternatively, the active site disulfide bridge may ensure conformational rigidity of the loop between PQQ and heme c. This rigidity may be required to maintain the level of nuclear density, which is 0.63 and below the average value of 0.76 (48Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). Substitution of (one of) the cysteines by other amino acids would thus lead to increased flexibility and possibly to a significantly lower nuclear density, which in turn would have a negative effect on the electron transfer rates. As a third function, the protein medium could be directly involved in the conduction of electrons. In this case, electron transfer would proceed through specific pathway tubes that may or may not be dynamically controlled (52Balabin I.A. Onuchic J.N. Science. 2000; 290: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The pathways involve covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and through-space jumps (53Beratan D.N. Onuchic J.N. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Science. 1992; 258: 1740-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Optimal electron transfer pathways calculated with Harlem (49Kurnikov I.V. Harlem Computer Program. University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh2000Google Scholar) involve atoms of PQQH2, Cys116, Cys117, a water molecule, Cys607, and heme c (Fig.5A). A second, longer and therefore possibly less efficient, pathway could include PQQH2, Cys117, Asp118, Arg67, and heme c. In conclusion, it appears that the disulfide bond between Cys116 and Cys117, and possibly the side chains of Asp118 and Arg67, are essential for efficient electron transfer from PQQH2 to hemec, whatever their precise function may be. Proton pathways usually consist of hydrogen-bonded networks of proton donor and acceptor groups, either water molecules or amino acid side chains (54Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar, 55Stowell M.H. McPhillips T.M. Rees D.C. Soltis S.M. Abresch E. Feher G. Science. 1997; 276: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Such a network extends from the hydroxyl groups of PQQH2 to the solvent via Lys335, Asp308, Glu185, a water-filled chamber between the two domains, and Arg67(Fig. 5B). It is disrupted only once by a distance of 4.7 Å between two water molecules. We propose this network as a channel for proton transfer to the solvent, i.e. the periplasm. The physiological electron acceptors of PQQ-dependent ADHs are cytochrome cproteins. The redox centers involved in the electron transfer reactions are thus the same. All quinoprotein ADHs including MDH are homologous to QH-ADH, and especially the bridging protein material between the two redox centers is highly conserved. Moreover, the distance between the two cofactors in the complex of MDH and cytochrome cL was estimated to be 15 Å (56Harris T.K. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), close to the value observed in QH-ADH. Also, the residues proposed to be involved in proton transfer are conserved. Therefore, the mechanisms of electron and proton transfer may well be identical in all PQQ-dependent ADHs. In conclusion, the structure of QH-ADH is the first of the type II quinoprotein ADHs. It reveals the presence of tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid in the active site, and the position of this oxidation product provides valuable information on the amino acid residues involved in the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the structure shows that electron transfer from PQQH2 to hemec is a long-range reaction, for which the presence of a disulfide bond between two adjacent cysteines appears essential. A water channel delineates a possible pathway for proton transfer from PQQH2 to the solvent.

Initially, PS is largely confined to the inner leaflet of the MV membrane (9Majeska R.J. Wuthier R.E. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1979; 27: 41-46Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previous transmission electron microscopic (TEM) studies have shown that the first mineral formed in MV is associated with the inner aspect of the membrane (10Anderson H.C. Bone Miner. 1992; 17: 107-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Later, the crystals appear to emerge through the membrane and trigger formation of radial clusters of mineral centered on the remnant of the original vesicle. How the crystals penetrate the MV membrane is currently unknown. While it is possible that simple physical force mediates this process (11Skrtic D. Eanes E.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 50: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), there is indirect evidence that latent lipolytic enzymes become activated during Ca2+accumulation and facilitate breakdown of the membrane. To explore this latter possibility, the composition of lipids in MV was analyzed during the course of MV-mediated mineralization in vitro. matrix vesicles phosphatidylserine transmission electron microscopy high performance thin-layer chromatography high performance liquid chromatography evaporative light scattering free fatty acids monoacylglycerols collagenase-released MV synthetic cartilage lymph phosphatidylinositol free cholesterol diacylglycerols phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine sphingomyelin lysophosphatidylserine lysophosphatidylinositol lysophosphatidylethanolamine lysophosphatidylcholine matrix vesicles phosphatidylserine transmission electron microscopy high performance thin-layer chromatography high performance liquid chromatography evaporative light scattering free fatty acids monoacylglycerols collagenase-released MV synthetic cartilage lymph phosphatidylinositol free cholesterol diacylglycerols phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine sphingomyelin lysophosphatidylserine lysophosphatidylinositol lysophosphatidylethanolamine lysophosphatidylcholine Since previous work had shown that not all lipids were readily extracted from mineralizing tissues (12Eisenberg E.

Tissue Res. 1977; 24: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), resident MV lipids were extracted both before and after demineralization using both neutral and acidic lipid solvents. Lipid composition was analyzed qualitatively by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) and quantitatively by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an evaporative light scattering (ELS) detector, which enabled accurate quantitation of the various lipids. Our findings reveal that extensive phospholipid degradation occurred during MV calcification, and this was accompanied by a concomitant rise in the amount of free fatty acids (FFA) apparently released by phospholipases present in the vesicles. The breakdown of MV phospholipids was accompanied by a substantial reduction in the extractability of certain phospholipids, and the composition of MV lipids changed significantly during the process of mineralization. In particular, PS, which became progressively more tightly complexed with nascent mineral, could only be fully extracted after demineralization. It was not only protected from degradation, but was actually synthesized, apparently by a base-exchange mechanism. Large batches of collagenase-released matrix vesicles (CRMV) were isolated from the metatarsal growth plate cartilage of 6− to 8-week-old broiler strain chickens using previously described methods (14Wu L.N.Y.

The trypsin solution was removed; tissue slices were rinsed twice with SCL and digested with collagenase (200 units/g of tissue, type IA, Sigma) at 37 °C for 3−3.5 h. The partially digested tissue was vortexed, and the suspension centrifuged as previously reported to sediment the CRMV (14Wu L.N.Y. Genge B.R. Dunkelberger D.G. LeGeros R.Z. Concannon B. Wuthier R.E.

The pellet was resuspended as a stock containing 5.0 mg of vesicle protein/ml in SCL modified to have one-half the normal level of Ca2+ to prevent dissolution of labile Ca2+ and Pi (16McLean F.M.

Protein levels were determined by the Lowryet al. method (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To have sufficient material for accurate lipid analyses, the large-scale preparations of CRMV (∼20 mg of protein) were allowed to mineralize by incubation in 600 ml of SCL at 37 °C. At each time point (0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h) for lipid analysis a 110-ml sample was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min to sediment the CRMV. The resulting pellets were transferred to individual glass tubes for lipid extraction after resuspension in ∼150 μl of SCL. Mineral formation in samples of the incubation mixture was monitored by light scattering, essentially as described previously (14Wu L.N.Y. Genge B.R. Dunkelberger D.G. LeGeros R.Z. Concannon B. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4404-4411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from the CRMV pellets, essentially as previously described (18Wuthier R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 68-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For qualitative HPTLC analyses, the vesicle pellets were extracted with chloroform, methanol (2:1) (v/v) (∼20 ml/ml aqueous medium), followed by sonication for 1−2 min (extract 1). The tubes were then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 12 min to sediment the insoluble residue. Initially, after collecting the lipid-containing supernatant, a second extraction with chloroform,methanol,HCl (200:100:1) (v/v/v) was performed, assuming that any mineral-complexed would be readily extractable. However, subsequent work revealed that significant amounts of the acidic phospholipids remained in the residue. Therefore, for all studies reported here, after the initial lipid extraction, the CRMV pellets were then demineralized with 0.5 m sodium salt EDTA for 20 min at room temperature and sedimented by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 12 min. After removal of the supernatant, the decalcified residue was reextracted using chloroform,methanol,HCl (200:100:1) (v/v/v) (extract 2), which was found to quantitatively remove the remaining lipids. The crude extracts were dried under N2 and partitioned through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove non-lipid contaminants (19Wuthier R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 558-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For qualitative analysis, the pure lipids from the preceding steps were analyzed by HPTLC on Whatman LHP-K silica gel plates as described previously (20Banerjee P. Buse J.T. Dawson G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Wu L.N.Y. Yoshimori T. Genge B.R. Sauer G.R. Kirsch T. Ishikawa Y. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25084-25094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mixtures containing 10 μg each of various lipid standards were applied to separate lanes on the same plate as the MV lipid samples. Lipids were visualized by spraying with cupric-phosphoric acid charring reagent (10% CuSO4 in 8% H3PO4) and heating at 180 °C for 10 min in an oven (20Banerjee P. Buse J.T. Dawson G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). HTLC plates were photographed and digitized for semi-quantitative estimation of lipid levels. For accurate quantitative analysis, the lipids were analyzed using a Shimadzu HPLC (SCL-10A Systems Controller, SIL-10A Auto Injector, Dual LC-10AT Liquid Chromatographs to provide the gradients). The HPLC system was equipped with an Alltech Varex MKIII ELS detector system. Lipids were separated on a Lichrosorb SI-100 4.6 × 250 mm, 10 μm particle size, HPLC column supplied by Alltech Inc. Injection volume was 30−50 μl (autosampler). The two mobile phases used were as follows: A, methanol,water (80:20) (v/v); B, chloroform,methanol,0.1% formic acid (80:20:0.1) (v/v/v). The following gradient program was used: 1) 92% B,8% A for 6 min; 2) 92% B,8% A to 56% B,44% A in 21 min; 3) 56% B,44% A to 20% B,80% A in 2 min, 4) 20% B,80% A to 100% B in 1 min, 5) 100% B to 92% B,8% A in 3 min. Total run time was 33 min, with a solvent flow rate of 1 ml/min. Nitrogen gas, 11.6 pounds per square inch, was used as the carrier at a flow rate of 2.02 standard liters per min in the ELS detector, which was operated at 72 °C. Mineralization induced by the isolated CRMV was monitored by formation of mineral from the SCL during the incubation period. As had been previously observed, there was a progressive induction of mineral formation during incubation of the CRMV with SCL (Fig. 1 A). As is typical of MV mineralization, there was a short lag period (∼1 h) during which minimal Ca2+ accumulation occurred; thereafter, the rate of mineral formation increased rapidly and by 6 h mineral formation was ∼80% of maximum. Fig. 1 Bshows an electron micrograph of early MV mineralization made after 2 h of incubation in SCL. Three different methods of analysis were used to assess the lipid composition of CRMV, both before and after incubation with SCL, which induced mineral formation. Initially, for qualitative analysis, HPTLC was used to analyze the various polar and nonpolar lipid classes present in extracts of CRMV made before and after demineralization. From these studies it was evident that significant changes in lipid composition were occurring during MV calcification. Most notable was the dramatic disappearance of PS and phosphatidyl inositol (PI) in extracts made before decalcification after only ∼2 h of incubation (Fig.2 A). Also there were progressive increases in the levels of FFA and in the band that included free cholesterol (CH) and 1,2-diacylglycerols (DG). On the other hand, there was a strikingly different lipid composition in extracts made after decalcification (Fig. 2 B). Here there was a dramatic increase in the levels of PS at time points when MV calcification was in rapid progress. While densitometric scans of the HPTLC plates afforded reasonable estimation of the levels of individual lipids present, we used HPLC to more accurately measure the quantitative changes in lipid composition. Initially, we employed a highly sensitive UV detection system at 205 nm to quantitate lipids present (22Hurst W.J. Martin R.A., Jr. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1984; 61: 1462-1463Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). But because of the variability in sensitivity to individual lipids, which depended on the degree of fatty acid unsaturation, we found this HPLC technique of limited utility. With careful calibration, some useful information was obtained. However, ELS detection proved to be the method of choice for quantitation of the individual lipid classes, since it was not dependent on chromophores. Shown in TableI are the percentages of the total phospholipid of various lipid classes in combined extracts made before and after decalcification at successive time points fromT 0 to T 24.Table IChanges in matrix vesicle lipid composition during in vitro calcificationLipidIncubation timeh024624% of the total phospholipidPE(16) 16.9 ± 1.3(9) 15.8 ± 1.7(9) 12.4 ± 1.1(9) 13.3 ± 1.9(8) 15.7 ± 3.6LPE(16) 6.0 ± 1.0(9) 6.2 ± 1.5(9) 6.1 ± 1.5(9) 6.6 ± 1.8(8) 10.8 ± 2.3PS(16) 9.2 ± 1.7(9) 10.8 ± 2.9(9) 12.6 ± 3.1(9) 15.0 ± 4.3(8) 19.2 ± 4.5LPS(13) 0.05 ± 0.04(6) 0.8 ± 0.5(6) 2.4 ± 1.1(6) 1.5 ± 0.6(5) 3.3 ± 1.8PC(16) 52.1 ± 2.8(9) 57.6 ± 5.9(9) 57.6 ± 6.8(9) 56.1 ± 8.3(8) 38.0 ± 8.3LPC(13) 1.2 ± 0.6(6) 0.6 ± 0.5(6) 0.9 ± 0.6(6) 0.7 ± 0.4(5) 2.7 ± 1.8PI(13) 4.0 ± 0.6(6) 2.8 ± 0.7(6) 2.1 ± 0.9(6) 1.9 ± 0.8(5) 2.0 ± 2.0LPI(12) 1.4 ± 0.4(6) 0.1 ± 0.0(6) 0.2 ± 0.1(6) 0.2 ± 0.2(5) 1.0 ± 1.0SPH(13) 8.4 ± 0.8(6) 5.1 ± 0.7(6) 5.0 ± 1.2(6) 4.2 ± 1.2(5) 2.6 ± 1.4Values are the mean ± S.E. of replicate analyses, the number shown in parentheses before each.

The reason there are more replicates shown here than in studies where lipid composition was analyzed separately in extracts made before and after demineralization is because in a number of initial experiments the lipids present in the two extracts were combined before analysis. In general agreement with previous analyses (23Wuthier R.E. Fed. Proc. 1976; 35: 117-121PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wuthier R.E. Wians F.H., Jr. Giancola M.S. Dragic S.S. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1431-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), atT 0, phosphatidylcholine (PC) was the major phospholipid in MV, representing about 50% of the total. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), ∼17%, PS ∼9%, sphingomyelin (SPH), ∼8%, monoacyl (i.e. lyso)phosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), ∼6%, and PI, ∼4% were the principal lipids. Low levels of lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), 1.4%, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), 1.2%, and lysophosphatidylserine (LPS), 0.05% were the only other phospholipids consistently detected. With time, in each successive set of extracts, the lipid composition progressively changed. The most notable changes were the significant increases in the levels of PS, LPS, and LPE and the progressive disappearance of both PI and SPH (Table I). However, these values were based on the analyses of lipids present in extracts taken at the successive points during MV calcification. During this period, changes in lipid composition were occurring due to both variable lipid degradation and to specific effects on extractability caused by the selective binding of certain lipids to the newly forming mineral. Because of this, an attempt was made to normalize the progressive changes occurring in total lipid composition by combining data on total polar and nonpolar lipids from extracts taken before and after decalcification at T 0 to serve as a baseline for changes in individual lipid classes occurring at subsequent time points. These changes were then expressed as a percentage of the original amount of each lipid class at successive time points. Combining data on lipids extractable before and after demineralization at each time point caused only modest (±10%) overall change in the total lipid (phospholipid + nonpolar lipid) content to occur during MV-induced calcification. However, when the fate of the total phospholipid was separated from that of the total nonpolar lipid, major progressive changes in each type of lipid were evident (Fig.3 A). Whereas the amount of total phospholipid underwent rapid and progressive decline, the opposite occurred with the nonpolar lipid. After 6 h of incubation, only about 50% of the original phospholipid remained, whereas a nearly 33% increase over the original amount of nonpolar lipid was seen. By 24 h, only about 20% of the total phospholipid remained, whereas the amount of nonpolar lipid had increased 66% above its original level. Examination of the combined data on individual lipids extractable before or after demineralization revealed major differences in the stability of each class of phospholipid (TableII). These revealed that rapid degradation of the acidic phospholipids PS and PI occurred; for both lipids only about 50% of the original remained after 2 h of incubation. However, surprisingly, PS “recovered” and returned to nearly 75% of the original by 24 h. In contrast, levels of PI continued their rapid decline and by 24 h, less than 10% of the original lipid remained. SPH also showed very rapid and continuous degradation, whereas breakdown of PE and PC was significantly slower. The changes in the content of lysophospholipids were complex and will be elaborated on later. However, overall the HPLC findings corroborate and clarify the qualitative impression observed upon HPTLC analyses.Table IIRecovery of matrix vesicle lipids during in vitro calcificationLipidIncubation timeh024624% of the original phospholipid classPE(6) 100 ± 0(6) 84 ± 17(6) 61 ± 11(6) 46 ± 8(6) 25 ± 4LPE(6) 100 ± 0(6) 62 ± 22(6) 55 ± 21(6) 53 ± 25(6) 51 ± 30PS(6) 100 ± 0(6) 56 ± 14(6) 72 ± 8(6) 73 ± 9(6) 77 ± 12LPS(3) 100 ± 0(3) 108 ± 10(3) 193 ± 12(3) 119 ± 13(3) 199 ± 56PC(6) 100 ± 0(6) 87 ± 16(6) 79 ± 16(6) 70 ± 15(6) 24 ± 11PI(6) 100 ± 0(6) 48 ± 20(6) 19 ± 10(6) 16 ± 10(6) 8 ± 8SPH(6) 100 ± 0(6) 63 ± 15(6) 34 ± 11(6) 22 ± 7(5) 7 ± 5Total(6) 100 ± 0(6) 70 ± 12(6) 61 ± 1(6) 52 ± 9(5) 22 ± 4Values are the mean ± S.E. of replicate analyses, the number shown in parentheses before each.

As MV calcification progressed with time, the percentage of the total phospholipid extractable before demineralization decreased concomitantly, and correspondingly, the proportion extractable only after demineralization increased (Fig. 3 B). At T 0, nearly 95% of the total phospholipid present was extractable before demineralization; however, after 4 h of incubation, by which time mineralization was well in progress, less than 80% was extractable. By 24 h, only about 70% of the remaining phospholipid could be extracted prior to demineralization. This indicated that with calcification, progressively more of the surviving phospholipid was bound to the mineral and could not be extracted until the vesicles were demineralized. In contrast, the extractability of the nonpolar lipid was much less affected by mineralization. At T 0, about 90% of the nonpolar lipid was extractable before demineralization. With time this increased to about 93–94% (data not shown). Corroborating the impression gained by HPTLC, analysis by HPLC revealed that MV mineralization had a profound effect on the extractability and survival of the two principal acidic phospholipids, PS and PI. At T 0 before exposure to the mineralizing solution, about 90% of the PS was extractable before demineralization; however, after only 2 h of incubation, only 5% of the original PS was extractable (Fig.4 A). There was a corresponding major increase in the proportion of the original PS that survived and could be extracted only after demineralization. This increased from ∼10% at T 0 to about 75% atT 4 and remained at this level thereafter.Figure 4Changes in the percentage of individual phospholipid classes recoverable in extracts made before (closed symbols) and after (open symbols) demineralization.

Data presented are the percentages at each time point during progressive stages of MV calcification of the original amount of each phospholipid class recovered in extracts made before and after demineralization, expressed as the mean ± S.E. The means are from six separate analyses for all lipid classes except SPH, for which only five analyses were available at 24 h and LPS, for which only three analyses were available at all time points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A similar pattern of extractability was seen with PI, but as noted in Table II, there was major degradation of this lipid during MV mineralization. At T 0, again about 90% of the PI was extractable, but after 2 h of incubation, in contrast to PS, almost one-third of the original PI could still be extracted (Fig.4 B). However, by T 4 and thereafter, no PI was extractable before demineralization. Again, in contrast to PS, there was much less of the original PI that could be extracted after demineralization. This value rose from ∼7% atT 0 to a maximum of only about 18–20% of the original at T 4, decreasing gradually thereafter. This indicated that much less of the original PI became complexed and stabilized by the newly forming mineral and thus was susceptible to degradation. In contrast to the acidic phospholipids, mineralization had only a minor effect on the extractability of the neutral phospholipids. For PE, about 90% of the original was extractable before demineralization at T 0. The remaining 10% was apparently complexed with the mineral and not extractable (Fig. 4 C) and was protected from degradation, persisting throughout the 24 h of incubation. However, the amount of PE that was not complexed rapidly decreased, indicating that it was rapidly degraded. Essentially all (>95%) of the choline-containing phospholipids, PC and SPH, were extractable before demineralization, regardless of the length of incubation or extent of mineralization. Fig. 4 Dreveals that PC was readily extractable before demineralization; however, its rate of degradation was slower than most other phospholipids, remaining essentially linear throughout the incubation. By 24 h, only about 20% of the original PC remained. Fig.4 E shows that SPH, also unprotected by complexation with the mineral, was rapidly degraded. By 4 h, only about one-third of the original SPH remained, and by 24 h there was only about 5% of the original left. Thus, in contrast to all of the other diacyl phospholipids, PS largely survived being protected by the newly forming mineral and resynthesized from other lipids (see later). Evident in all lipid extracts of MV were significant amounts of lysophospholipids. LPE, the monoacyl derivative of PE, was the most abundant form representing ∼6% of the total phospholipid for most of the incubation (Table I). As evident from Fig. 4 F, almost 95% of the LPE present initially was extractable before demineralization. However this rapidly declined; by 4 h only about one-third, and by 24 h less than 20% of the original LPE could be so extracted. On the other hand, the amount of LPE not extractable until after demineralization increased progressively during MV calcification, rising from ∼5% atT 0 to ∼35% at T 24. The other lyso-derivatives detected during MV calcification were LPI, LPC, and LPS. Small amounts of LPI and LPC (1.4 and 1.2% of the total PL, respectively) were present initially, but there were only trace amounts of LPS (Table I). While levels of LPI and LPC generally decreased thereafter, levels of LPS increased. At 4 h, in lipids extractable after decalcification, levels of LPS were dramatically increased (Fig.4 G). This corresponds to the ti"

Since PKC α, β2, δ, ε, and ζ were expressed in rat pancreatic islets, we prepared each wild type (WT) and dominant negative type (DN) PKC isoform (α, β2, δ, ε, and ζ)-expressing adenovirus to examine the effect of each PKC isoform on c-myc expression. In isolated rat pancreatic islets, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of WT PKC β2, but not other PKC isoforms, markedly increased c-myc expression.

Finally, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of WT PKC β2, but not of other PKC isoforms, leads to suppression of the insulin gene transcription in pancreatic islets.

Moreover, some PKC isoforms are activated by hyperglycemia and associated with vascular abnormalities in cardiovascular, retinal, and renal tissues. There are multiple PKC isoforms including the classical PKCs (α, β1, β2, and γ), novel PKCs (δ, ε, and θ), and atypical PKCs (ζ and λ). Among these isoforms, PKC β is thought to be mainly involved in development of diabetic complications. Transgenic mice overexpressing PKC β in myocardium developed cardiac hypertrophy and failure (18Wakasaki H. Koya D. Schuen F.J. Jirousek M.R. Ways D.K. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. King G.L. Proc. Natl.

Furthermore, various other diabetic complications found in diabetes such as microvascular or renal dysfunction in diabetic rats were ameliorated by treatment with a PKC β inhibitor (19Ishii H.

Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress may explain some of the adverse effects of PKC β, since antioxidant treatment can inhibit PKC activation and reverse glucose-induced vascular dysfunction (15Kunisaki K.

Various PKC isoforms have been identified in pancreatic islets, and PKC has been postulated to play a role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (21Ito A. Saito N. Taniguchi H. Chiba T. Kikkawa U.

Among the various potential molecular mechanisms, we postulate that the transcription factor c-Myc exerts an inhibitory effect on insulin gene transcription and therefore contributes to some of this deterioration of β-cell function. This hypothesis fits with the finding that islet c-mycexpression is induced in several diabetic models (9Jonas J.-C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Iikova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J.

Moreover, we have obtained data indicating that induction of c-Myc expression suppresses the insulin gene transcription by inhibiting NeuroD/BETA2-mediated transcriptional activation (11Kaneto H. Sharma A. Suzuma K. Laybutt D.R. Xu G. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: A80Google Scholar).In the present study, we have found that c-myc expression is induced by high glucose levels and that this induction was suppressed by the PKC-specific inhibitor GF109203X or TPA pretreatment, a condition known to inhibit PKC activity (Fig. 1). In contrast, c-myc gene expression was directly induced by acute exposure to TPA. Thus, these data suggest that high glucose levels induce c-myc gene expression in a PKC-dependent manner, which fits with previous studies showing that PKC is activated under diabetic conditions (13Koya D.

The PKC isoforms α, β2, δ, ε, and ζ were found to be present in rat pancreatic islets, and PKC activity was increased by high glucose concentrations (Fig. 2). Furthermore, it was found that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PKC β2, but not PKC α, δ, ε, or ζ, induced c-myc gene transcription (Figs. 3A and 4B) and that induction of c-myc gene transcription by high glucose levels was suppressed with overexpression of DN PKC β2, but not by DN PKC α, δ, ε, or ζ (Fig. 4C).The pathways through which high glucose levels stimulate PKC activity in pancreatic islets are unknown. One possibility is reactive oxygen species (27Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7195) Google Scholar), which are produced in various tissues in the diabetic state and are suspected to be involved in the development of diabetic complications (28Baynes J.W.

King G.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar,30Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.-P.

However, in experiments using the antioxidantN-acetyl-l-cysteine, we were unable to show that reactive oxygen species are involved in the glucose-induced increase in c-myc expression (Fig. 1C). We also asked if the stress-related kinases such as JNK and p38 MAPK (27Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7195) Google Scholar, 36Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, 37Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar) were involved in glucose-mediated c-myc induction, but induction of c-myc promoter activity and mRNA levels in βTC1 cells and primary islets was not suppressed by overexpression of DN JNK or p38 MAPK inhibitor (Figs. 3B and 4C), suggesting a lack of involvement of these pathways. From these studies we have not been able to identify the mechanisms through which PKC β2 is activated by high glucose levels, but diacylglycerol, which is known to activate PKC in many other systems (13Koya D. King G.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), must be considered as a strong candidate.As shown in this study, PKC β2 specifically induces c-mycexpression (Figs. 3A and 4B) and suppresses the insulin gene transcription (Fig. 5). Also, we found recently that adenovirus-mediated c-Myc overexpression suppresses the insulin gene transcription (11Kaneto H. Sharma A. Suzuma K. Laybutt D.R. Xu G. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: A80Google Scholar), which supports the concept that PKC β2-mediated c-Myc induction leads to suppression of insulin gene transcription. However, we must acknowledge the possibility that the effect of PKC β2 on insulin gene transcription is not totally exerted through c-Myc induction; several other factors could be induced or activated by PKC β2 and exert a suppressive effect on insulin gene transcription. Also, since several PKC isoforms are detected in rat pancreatic islets (Fig. 2A), we do not know that the increase of total PKC activity with high glucose levels (Fig. 2, B andC) is accounted for specifically by PKC β2. Nonetheless, we feel that strong circumstantial evidence is provided to support a link between high glucose concentrations, activation of PKC β2, induction of c-myc expression, and subsequent inhibition of insulin gene transcription. At present, it seems safe to conclude that the PKC β2-c-Myc axis is at least one of the candidate pathways that lead to suppression of insulin gene transcription.In considering the inhibitory influences of PKC β2 and c-Myc upon insulin gene expression, an obvious question is why high glucose acting through PKC β2 and c-Myc does not lead to inhibition of insulin gene expression more rapidly. It is known that glucose has a positive influence upon the insulin promoter (26Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39German M.S. Wang J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4067-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), although islets cultured in high glucose concentrations for several days have only modest elevations in insulin mRNA (35Kaneto H. Xu G. Song K.-H. Suzuma K. Bonner-Weir S. Sharma A. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31099-31104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Also, it is known that the transcription factor PDX-1 is activated after acute exposure to high glucose levels, which should lead to enhancement of insulin promoter activity (40Macfarlane W.M.

Thus, we assume that the inhibitory effect of increased c-Myc levels is counterbalanced by activation of PDX-1, which may obscure the effect of c-Myc. In contrast, with chronic exposure to hyperglycemia, as occurs in the diabetic state, the expression and activity of PDX-1 are decreased (9Jonas J.-C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Iikova H. Patane G.

Robertson R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: A80Google Scholar).In conclusion, PKC β2 regulates c-myc expression, leading to suppression of the insulin gene transcription, and overexpression of DN PKC β2 inhibits c-myc induction by high glucose in pancreatic β-cells. These results imply that the PKC β2-c-Myc pathway is responsible for some of the β-cell glucose toxicity found in diabetes. It is well known that hyperglycemia contributes to the deterioration in pancreatic β-cell function found in diabetes (1Weir G.C. Laybutt D.R. Kaneto H. Bonner-Weir S. Sharma A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 154-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this being characterized by phenotypic changes that include a decline of the insulin gene transcription and degranulation of β-cells (2Bonner-Weir S. Trent D.F. Weir G.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 1544-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 3Robertson R.P. Zhang H.-J. Pyzdrowski H. Walseth T.F. J. Clin.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These adverse effects of chronic hyperglycemia have been called glucose toxicity. To explain the molecular basis of these phenomena, we have postulated that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor c-Myc (6Evan G.I. Littlewood T.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 7Dang C.V. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 8Pelengaris S. Rudolph B.

In the presence of hyperglycemia, expression of many β-cell-associated genes is decreased, but c-myc expression is induced. This increase of c-myc mRNA has been found in the partial pancreatectomy model of diabetes and in rats made hyperglycemic with glucose clamps, with the change in c-myc expression correlating with graded levels of hyperglycemia (9Jonas J.-C.

It has been reported that marked c-Myc activation in β-cells of transgenic mice leads to extensive β-cell apoptosis and diabetes (8Pelengaris S. Rudolph B. Littlewood T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found recently that adenovirus-mediated c-Myc overexpression suppresses the insulin gene transcription by inhibiting NeuroD/BETA2-mediated transcriptional activation (11Kaneto H. Sharma A. Suzuma K. Laybutt D.R. Xu G. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: A80Google Scholar). Thus, we feel that hyperglycemia-mediated c-myc induction is likely to be involved in β-cell dysfunction found in diabetes. However, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of c-mycexpression in β-cells are unknown. Protein kinase C (PKC)1 is an important mediator of signal transduction in response to several cellular signals (12Nishizuka Y.

Moreover, some PKC isoforms are activated by hyperglycemia and associated with vascular abnormalities in cardiovascular, retinal, and renal tissues. There are multiple PKC isoforms including the classical PKCs (α, β1, β2, and γ), novel PKCs (δ, ε, and θ), and atypical PKCs (ζ and λ).

Furthermore, various other diabetic complications found in diabetes such as microvascular or renal dysfunction in diabetic rats were ameliorated by treatment with a PKC β inhibitor (19Ishii H.

Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress may explain some of the adverse effects of PKC β, since antioxidant treatment can inhibit PKC activation and reverse glucose-induced vascular dysfunction (15Kunisaki K.

Among the various potential molecular mechanisms, we postulate that the transcription factor c-Myc exerts an inhibitory effect on insulin gene transcription and therefore contributes to some of this deterioration of β-cell function.

https://openalex.org/W2004991037,"Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a physical interaction between CD46 and DLG4. CD46 is a ubiquitous human cell-surface receptor for the complement components C3b and C4b and for measles virus and human herpesvirus 6. DLG4 is a scaffold protein important for neuronal signaling and is homologous to theDrosophila tumor suppressor DLG. We show that an interaction between CD46 and DLG4 is important for polarization in epithelial cells. Specifically, we show (i) biochemical evidence for an interaction between CD46 and DLG4, (ii) that this interaction is specific for the Cyt1 (but not Cyt2) domain of CD46, (iii) that both CD46 and an alternatively spliced isoform of DLG4 are polarized in normal human epithelial cells, and (iv) that the polarized expression of CD46 in epithelial cells requires the DLG4-binding domain and alters with expression of a truncated form of DLG4. This is the first identification of a direct and cytoplasmic domain-specific interaction between CD46 and an intracellular signaling molecule and provides a molecular mechanism for the polarization of CD46.

In addition to the effects of CD46 on the activity of complement, it has recently become clear that signaling through CD46 can have important effects on both innate and acquired immunity. For instance, signaling through CD46 can affect the production of interleukin-12, macrophage inflammatory protein-1a, and nitric oxide by macrophages; the production of interleukin-6 by astrocytes; IgE class switching in B cells; and proliferation of T cells (10Karp C.L.

CD46 is alternatively spliced to give two different cytoplasmic domains (Cyt1 and Cyt2) (see Fig. 1A), each of which is expressed in every cell type examined to date (6Russell S.M. Sparrow R.L. McKenzie I.F.C. Purcell D.F.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains have different signaling characteristics: (i) expression of Cyt1 causes a preferential increase in the production of nitric oxide by macrophages (13Hirano A. Yang Z. Katayama Y. Korte-Sarfaty J. Wong T.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4776-4785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and (ii) only the Cyt2 domain can be phosphorylated on tyrosine and coprecipitates with a 38-kDa phosphorylated protein (17Wang G. Liszewski M.K. Chan A.C. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1839-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains are only 28 and 35 amino acids long, respectively, and are therefore likely to signal via interactions with other intracellular proteins. CD46 has been co-immunoprecipitated with SHP-1 in macrophages (18Kurita-Taniguchi M. Fukui A. Hazeki K. Hirano A. Tsuji S. Matsumoto M. Watanabe M. Ueda S. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5143-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and antibodies to CD46 can cause the phosphorylation of p120cbl and LAT in T cells (15Astier A. Trescol-Biemont M.C. Azocar O. Lamouille B. Rabourdin-Combe C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6091-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These observations describe cellular processes that can be affected by CD46; but as yet, we cannot describe the molecular pathways through which CD46 affects cell events. As a first step toward elucidating these pathways, we sought to identify proteins that interact with the different cytoplasmic domains by a yeast two-hybrid screen. We show here that the Cyt1 domain interacts with DLG4, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family of proteins that provides a scaffold for the assembly of signaling complexes. DLG4, also called PSD (postsynaptic density)-95 or SAP (synapse-associated protein)-90, is one of a family of four human proteins. This family shares a single homolog in Drosophila: a tumor suppressor called DLG (Discs Large) (19Woods D.F. Bryant P.J.

DLG proteins have multiple protein-protein interaction motifs: three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase-like domain (GuK). By virtue of their PDZ domains, DLG proteins are part of a larger family of proteins that are polarized and that recruit other proteins to a polarized domain in neurons and epithelial cells (22Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 37Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 38Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Thus, the interactions of PDZ domain-containing proteins with each other, with membrane-bound receptors, and with the cytoskeleton serve to define and regulate polarization and to coordinate signaling networks. PDZ domains are 90-amino acid modules that classically interact with the C-terminal 4 residues of proteins with the sequenceX(S/T)X(I/L/V). DLG4 has previously been shown to interact with receptors that are important for neuronal signaling and is localized to the postsynaptic density region of neurons. Results described herein indicate that DLG4 interacts with CD46, a protein not known to play a role in synaptic signaling. We show that the C-terminal 4 residues of the Cyt1 domain (FTSL) of CD46 interact with the PDZ3 domain of DLG4. We also show colocalization of CD46 and DLG in epithelial tissues and describe evidence suggesting that this interaction is important for the polarization of CD46 in epithelial cells. The sequence encoding the Cyt1 domain of CD46 was fused in frame to the Gal4-binding domain (Gal4-BD) in the pAS2.1 vector (CLONTECH). The vector was transformed into PJ69-4A yeast cells (39James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), selected on Trp-deficient medium, and screened for expression of the bait by immunoblotting with an antibody to the Gal4-BD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The yeast cells were further transformed with a library of the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4-AD) fused to cDNA from human peripheral blood lymphocytes activated with phytohemagglutinin and selected on Trp/Leu/His-deficient medium with 3 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Of 3 × 106 independent clones screened, 112 colonies grew on both His- and Ade-deficient medium. DNA was extracted from each of these colonies and characterized by restriction digestion and sequencing. DNA from one colony corresponded to a partial cDNA sequence of human DLG4. To test for specificity, yeast were cotransformed with bait and prey vectors, selected on Leu/Trp-deficient plates, and then streaked onto both Ade- and His-deficient medium and assessed for growth. Control clones for these tests included pLAM-Gal4 (CLONTECH) and Gal4-ABP280 (40Browne K.A Johnstone R.W. Jans D.A. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39262-39266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and vectors expressing the Gal4-BD and Gal4-AD alone. At least four clones were tested for each transformation, and clones were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the Gal4-AD and Gal4-BD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively, to ensure equivalent protein expression. The mutant constructs used in yeast two-hybrid specificity tests were derived from the original Gal4-BD-Cyt1 fusion used in the screen and the Gal4-AD-DLG4 fusion isolated from the screen. Mutations were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primer sequences were as follows, with the underlined residues indicating mutations from the original sequence: GTAAAATTTACTTCTCGCTGAGAAGGAGAGATG and CATCTCTCCTTCTCAGCGAGAAGTAAATTTTAC for Gal4-BD-Cyt1(L358R) and CD46-Cyt1(L358R), CAGCCGATTCGAGGCCTAGATCCACGACCTTCG and CGAACCTCGTGGATCTAGGCCTCGAATCGGCTG for Gal4-AD-DLG4(trunc), and CGAATTGTGATCCACGCGGGCTCCACGGGCCTG and CAGGCCCGTGGAGCCCGCGTGGATCACAATTCG for Gal4-AD-DLG4mutPDZ3. To generate an expression construct of DLG4, the 5′-region was amplified from cDNA from human spleen poly(A)+ RNA and fused to the DLG4 fragment isolated in the yeast-two hybrid screen using splice overlap extension PCR. This splice variant of DLG4 (which lacks exon 20) (44Stathakis D.G. Udar N. Sandgren O. Andreasson S. Bryant P.J. Small K. Forsman-Semb K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2250-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was then subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and fully sequenced. The splice variant of DLG4 that encodes an intact GuK domain was created using an amplified GuK-encoding domain from pooled human leukemic cells by reverse transcription-PCR. The PCR product contained FseI and EcoRI restriction sites, which allowed insertion into the original expression construct of DLG4. Sequence coding for the PDZ3 domain of DLG4 was amplified from the original yeast two-hybrid clone and fused in frame to the coding region of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH) using EcoRI sites. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were created in the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using CD46-Cyt1 and CD46-Cyt2 sequences amplified from Gly342 to beyond the stop codon. Molecular modeling of the peptide FTSL bound to the PDZ3 domain was performed using the known x-ray crystallographic structure of the PDZ3 domain of DLG4 in complex with its peptide ligand QTSV (41Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1BE9). Computer graphics Program O (42Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. O: The Manual. Uppsala University Press, Uppsala1994Google Scholar) was used to replace side chains of QTSV with those of FTSL, C-β and peptide main chain atoms were unaltered. Using Program O rotamers, FTSL side chains were modeled for stereochemical fit and favorable contact with the PDZ domain. For transient expression, the MDCK epithelial cell line or the 293T human kidney epithelial cell line was transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and analyzed 2–3 days later. Stable transfectants of MDCK cells were selected in G418 for resistance to neomycin and then screened for expression of CD46 or DLG4 by immunofluorescence or flow cytometry. The antibodies used were anti-DLG4 mouse monoclonal antibodies K28/43 and K28/86.2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The rabbit polyclonal antibody 1839 was raised against the recombinant extracellular domain of CD46. Clones were generated by limiting dilution. To obtain double transfectants, cells were transfected with CD46, selected, cloned, and then transfected with EGFP-PDZ3 and enriched by flow cytometry. MDCK cells were grown to confluency on polyester Transwell membranes (24 mm, 0.4-μm pore size). The apical and basolateral regions of the cells were stained by incubation with primary and secondary antibodies in the inside of the insert (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)) or the base of the well (Fluo594), respectively. The membranes were removed from the insert with a scalpel blade and sealed on a slide with ProLong Antifade. Immunofluorescence was analyzed using a Bio-Rad confocal scanning microscope (Model MRC1000). The 488-nm line from a krypton/argon laser was used to excite the FITC-tagged secondary antibody, and emission was detected through a 522-nm filter. The 568-nm line from a krypton/argon laser was used to excite the Fluo594-tagged secondary antibody, and emission was detected through a 605-nm filter. Optical sections were recorded at 0.4-μm vertical steps, with each image averaged for seven scans. All images were processed using the Comos program (Bio-Rad) and Cas Version 4.02 (confocal assistant software, Todd Clark Brelje). Staining patterns are representative of the staining observed in at least three clones of each construct transfected, and staining with subclass control antibodies indicated that the staining was specific. Sections of human kidney were fixed in methanol at 37 °C for 18 h, blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin, and immunolabeled in 0.8% bovine serum albumin with primary antibody and then with biotinylated swine anti-mouse/rabbit secondary antibody. Signal was amplified with streptavidin-coupled peroxidase and visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzadine (Dako). Bound antibody was detected with streptavidin-coupled peroxidase and 3,3′-diaminobenzadine. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. We screened for proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic domains of CD46 by a yeast two-hybrid assay using a library derived from activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Two separate baits were used in the screen in which the cytoplasmic domains of CD46 (CD46-Cyt1 and CD46-Cyt2) (Fig.1, A and B,rows i and ii) were fused to the Gal4-BD (Gal4-BD-Cyt1 (Fig. 1B, row iv) and Gal4-BD-Cyt2 (Fig. 1B, row vi)). After screening with the Gal4-BD-Cyt1 clone, a partial cDNA clone encoding DLG4 (PSD-95) was isolated (43Stathakis D.G. Hoover K.B. You Z. Bryant P.J. Genomics. 1997; 44: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Full-length DLG4 includes five domains known to be important for protein-protein interactions, namely three PDZ domains, one SH3 domain, and a GuK-like domain (Fig. 1C, row i). The clone we isolated corresponded to a previously described alternatively spliced variant (a deletion of exon 20, which causes a frameshift leading to a premature termination) (44Stathakis D.G. Udar N. Sandgren O. Andreasson S. Bryant P.J. Small K. Forsman-Semb K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2250-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in which the GuK domain was truncated by 102 amino acids (termed DLG4-delGuK) (Fig.1C, row ii). Protein encoded by the yeast clone (termed Gal4-AD-DLG4) (Fig. 1C, row iii) contained the Gal4-AD fused in frame to the C-terminal 45 amino acids of PDZ2 (starting at nucleotide 1590 within the PDZ2 domain) (43Stathakis D.G. Hoover K.B. You Z. Bryant P.J. Genomics. 1997; 44: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the complete PDZ3 domain, the SH3 domain, and the N-terminal part of the GuK domain. Thus, the only intact modules were the PDZ3 and SH3 domains. To map the domains of each protein that are important for the interaction, we compared the growth of yeast transformed with CD46 and either the DLG4 fusion from the yeast two-hybrid screen (Gal4-AD-DLG4) or mutants thereof (Fig. 1, B and C). Cotransformation of Gal4-BD-Cyt1 and Gal4-AD-DLG4 allowed growth on selective media (Fig. 2A,part i), indicating that these proteins interact. However, mutation of Arg318 adjacent to the GLGF domain of PDZ3 (Gal4-AD-DLG4mutPDZ3) (Fig. 1C, row v), critical for binding to other C-terminal peptides (41Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), completely abrogated growth (Fig. 2A, part ii), indicating that a functional PDZ domain is required for interaction of the fusion protein. Truncation of the Gal4-DLG4 clone at the end of PDZ3 (Gal4-AD-DLG4(trunc)) allowed growth, although at a consistently reduced rate (Fig. 2A, part iii). This clone contains only the C-terminal 45 amino acids of the PDZ2 domain and the complete PDZ3 domain. Coexpression of Gal4-BD-Cyt1 with an irrelevant Gal4-AD fusion protein (Gal4-AD-ABP280) did not confer growth (Fig.2A, part iv), indicating that the interactions between CD46 and DLG4 fusion proteins are specific. These data indicate that Gal4-AD-DLG4 interacts with the Cyt1 domain via the PDZ3 domain, but suggest that the C-terminal region of the molecule might enhance binding. We next investigated the regions of CD46 that are important for binding to DLG4. Cotransformation of Gal4-AD-DLG4 with Gal4-BD-Cyt1 gave the expected growth (Fig. 2B, part i), but cotransformation of Gal4-AD-DLG4 with Gal4-BD-Cyt2 did not confer growth (part ii). This indicated that the binding of DLG4 was specific for the Cyt1 isoforms of CD46. As the C-terminal 4 residues of the Cyt1 domain (FTSL) fit the consensus for binding to PDZ domains, we tested whether these residues interact with the PDZ3 domain of DLG4. Mutation of the C-terminal leucine residue of CD46 (Gal4-BD-Cyt1(L358R)) (Fig. 1B, row iii) completely abrogated growth (Fig. 2B, part iii), indicating that the C terminus of CD46 is important for binding to DLG4. Cotransformation with two irrelevant Gal4-BD fusion proteins did not confer growth (Fig. 2B, part iv andv). These data show that the Cyt1 (but not Cyt2) domain of CD46 binds to DLG4 through its C terminus and are consistent with the hypothesis that the consensus DLG4-binding site within CD46-Cyt1 (the FTSL sequence) is necessary for the interaction. We tested whether the interaction between CD46 and DLG4 can be replicated in a system other than the yeast two-hybrid system using DLG4 expressed in mammalian cells. The transformed human kidney cell line 293T was transfected with vector alone or either alternatively spliced variant of DLG4 (DLG4 and DLG4-delGuK) (Fig. 1C, rows i and ii). Transfected cells were lysed and incubated with beads coupled to GST or the GST-Cyt1 (Fig. 1B,row vii) or GST-Cyt2 (row viii) fusion protein. Transfection of the two splice variants of DLG4 gave equivalent levels of expression and the expected difference in size between the splice variants (Fig. 3). A band of lower molecular mass was also seen when DLG4 was transfected, consistent with previous reports (45Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It is thought that this band might be generated by proteolytic cleavage of the N terminus (45Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In each case, the GST-Cyt1 fusion protein interacted with DLG4, but neither GST alone nor GST-Cyt2 interacted. Interestingly, the lower molecular mass form of DLG4 consistently bound more strongly to GST-Cyt1, perhaps indicating that the modification causing this form affects the binding of DLG4 to CD46. We attempted to co-immunoprecipitate CD46 and DLG from the transfected 293T cells using endogenous CD46. We were unable to do this and in fact found that CD46 and DLG were not colocalized in these cells (DLG expression was predominantly cytoplasmic) (data not shown). The intracellular localization of DLG is regulated by complex mechanisms that may be cell specific; and therefore, it is possible that CD46 and DLG are colocalized and able to interact only in certain cell types. Other cell types in which CD46 and DLG do colocalize (see below) expressed DLG at levels too low to allow for efficient co-immunoprecipitation with the available antibodies. However, our data with GST fusion proteins indicate that the Cyt1 domain of CD46 can interact with both alternatively spliced isoforms of DLG4 expressed by mammalian cells, but the Cyt2 domain does not interact with DLG4. Although the C terminus of the Cyt1 domain contains the consensus sequence for PDZ binding (X(S/T)X(I/L/V)), the Phe residue at position −3 differs from the charged residue at this position in proteins previously reported to bind to DLG4. The crystal structure of the PDZ3 domain of DLG4 has been solved, both without peptide and with the C terminus of CRIPT (an intracellular protein that binds to PDZ3 of DLG4 via the C-terminal sequence, QTSV) (32Niethammer M.

Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). We used this structure (Fig. 4A) to model the C terminus of CD46-Cyt1 in the groove of PDZ3 (Fig. 4B). The 4-residue segment binds to the PDZ domain through antiparallel main chain interactions with a β-sheet of the domain. The carboxylate group of the peptide is recognized by a network of main chain amides provided by the loop sequence Gly322-Leu323-Gly324-Phe325as well as by the Arg318 side chain. Additional side chain contacts and a hydrophobic pocket determine the selectivity of the C-terminal consensus sequence. In this model, the Cyt1 domain fits in the groove with no obstructions; and although two hydrogen bonds are lost compared with the CRIPT structure, this is unlikely to prevent the interaction. A carboxyl-terminal leucine in place of valine is possible with slight adjustment to the hydrophobic pocket, considering local steric constraints and potential van der Waals contacts. Thus, the Cyt1 domain peptide sequence FTSL of CD46 can be accommodated by a PDZ3-binding pocket. Many PDZ domain-containing proteins, including DLG1, are expressed in epithelial cells, where they regulate cell polarization (37Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 38Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).

Depending on the virus, this expression can be regulated at different levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational (1Maia I.G. Seron K. Haenni A. Bernardi F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 367-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For (+)-strand RNA viruses, many utilize RNA-templated transcription of subgenomic (sg)1 mRNAs to allow for regulated expression of specific viral genes (2Miller W.A. Koev G. Virology. 2000; 273: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which sg mRNAs are synthesized can vary, but the messages produced share the common property of encoding open reading frames (ORFs) that are located 3′-proximally in the viral genomes. Because such 3′-proximal ORFs are generally translationally silent within the context of these genomes, sg mRNA production provides a mode for their efficient translation as well as a mechanism to regulate the timing and amount of viral protein produced (2Miller W.A. Koev G. Virology. 2000; 273: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms for sg mRNA transcription are well-established: (i) synthesis of sg mRNAs from a full-length (−)-strand genomic template via internal initiation (3Miller W.A. Dreher T.W. Hall T.C. Nature. 1985; 313: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4Siegel R.W. Adkins S. Kao C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A third possible mechanism that has been proposed involves premature termination during (−)-strand synthesis of the genome followed by use of the 3′-truncated product as a template to transcribe sg mRNAs (7Zhong W. Rueckert R.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2716-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Miller W.A. Brown C.M. Wang S. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 3-13Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Sit T.L. Vaewhongs A.A. Lommel S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although this latter model is consistent with data generated from studies on an assortment of (+)-strand RNA viruses (9Sit T.L. Vaewhongs A.A. Lommel S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 10Choi I. Ostrovsky M. Zhang G. White K.A. J. Biol.

Virol. 2000; 74: 11724-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), overwhelming evidence for this mechanism is still lacking.Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is the prototype member of both the genus Tombusvirus and the family Tombusviridae. Its (+)-strand RNA genome of ∼4.8 kb encodes five functional ORFs (Fig.1A) (12Hearne P.Q. Knorr D.A. Hillman B.I. Morris T.J. Virology. 1990; 177: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The viral RNA polymerase (p92) and accessory RNA replication protein (p33) are both translated from the genome, the former via translational readthrough of the amber termination codon of the latter (Fig. 1A) (12Hearne P.Q. Knorr D.A. Hillman B.I. Morris T.J. Virology. 1990; 177: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 13Oster S.K. Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5845-5851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the more 3′-proximal coat protein (CP) ORF (p41) and the overlapping ORFs encoding the movement (p22) and defense (p19) proteins are expressed from two sg mRNAs that are synthesized during TBSV infections (Fig.1A) (14Hillman B.I. Hearne P. Rochon D. Morris T.J. Virology. 1989; 169: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Scholthof H.B. Scholthof K.B. Kikkert M. Jackson A.O.

A. 1999; 96: 14147-14152Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of the smaller of the two sg mRNAs, sg mRNA2, has been studied previously and RNA sequences important for efficient production of this message have been identified both proximal and distal to its initiation site (17Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Efficient accumulation of this sg mRNA requires a long-distance base pairing interaction between a sequence within the core element (CE), located just 5′ to the sg mRNA2 initiation site, and a complementary sequence within the distal element (DE) some ∼1100 nucleotides (nt) upstream (Fig. 1A) (17Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This interaction functions in the (+)-strand of the viral genome and is proposed to mediate the proper positioning of other subelements within the DE and CE (10Choi I. Ostrovsky M. Zhang G. White K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41761-41768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additionally, the production of (−)-strand sg mRNA2 occurs independently of (+)-strand sg mRNA2 accumulation (10Choi I. Ostrovsky M. Zhang G. White K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41761-41768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This latter finding, along with the observed (+)-strand activity of the CE/DE interaction, is consistent with a premature termination mechanism for sg mRNA2 transcription.Essentially nothing is known about the regulatory RNA elements involved in the synthesis of sg mRNA1. This message is critical for a successful viral infection because it allows for the efficient expression of CP, 180 subunits of which are present in each assembled particle (14Hillman B.I. Hearne P. Rochon D. Morris T.J. Virology. 1989; 169: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Currently, all that is known about sg mRNA1 transcription is that it can be effectively eliminated by the introduction of substitutions at and immediately 5′ to its site of initiation (17Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have sought to define RNA sequences and higher order structures within the TBSV genome that are important for sg mRNA1 transcription. Our results provide evidence for a long-distance RNA·RNA interaction that mediates the accumulation of sg mRNA1. The data also indicate that this interaction occurs in the (+)-strand, likely acts in cis, specifically mediates the accumulation of (−)-strand sg mRNA1, and is responsible for regulating expression from an ectopic transcriptional initiation site. The properties of this long-distance RNA·RNA interaction are compared and contrasted with those of the DE/CE interaction involved in regulating sg mRNA2 accumulation. Collectively, these data provide additional insight into how sg mRNAs are transcribed in TBSV.DISCUSSIONOur analysis of the TBSV genome has allowed us to identify sequences and structures that are important for sg mRNA1 accumulation. Specifically, two sequences, AS1 and RS1, were found to be essential for efficient sg mRNA1 accumulation, and the data support a functional requirement for their base pairing in the (+)-strand. Additionally, the AS1/RS1 interaction was found to be important specifically for (−)-strand sg mRNA1 accumulation and was shown to regulate sg mRNA1 production from an ectopic initiation site. These data support a role for this long-distance RNA·RNA interaction in regulating transcriptional activity.Structural and Functional Features of the AS1/RS1 InteractionThe distant positioning and comparatively small size of AS1 and RS1 prompt the following questions: (i) how do these sequences find each other in the context of the genome? and (ii) could this interaction be facilitated and/or stabilized by other RNA elements? Our MFOLD analysis of tombusvirus sequences suggests that the global folding of the genome likely assists in the formation of this base paired segment in cis via colocalizing the participating sequences. Additionally, local structures could also be involved in mediating this interaction. Therefore, we analyzed AS1 and its flanking sequence by MFOLD for potential structures that could facilitate the AS1/RS1 interaction. Different conformations of a SL structure were predicted depending on the parameters used for the analysis, however, a common feature in each was the presence of all or most of AS1 within a terminal loop (Fig.7). This positioning, in a predicted single-stranded region, could facilitate the presentation of AS1 for base pairing with RS1. Surprisingly, one of the predicted conformers (ΔG = −7.9 at 22 °C) is strikingly similar in general structure to the trans-acting hairpin activator of sg mRNA transcription in the bipartite (+)-strand virus red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) (Fig. 7) (9Sit T.L. Vaewhongs A.A. Lommel S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In RCNMV, the nucleotides in the terminal loop of the hairpin activator in genomic RNA-2 interactin trans with a sequence just 5′ to the sg mRNA transcriptional initiation site in genomic RNA-1, thereby facilitating sg mRNA accumulation. It was proposed that, as with other bimolecular interactions, the base pairing of these elements would be favored by high concentrations of RNA-1 and RNA-2, which occur late in the infection (9Sit T.L. Vaewhongs A.A. Lommel S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This is also the time at which CP, which is translated from the induced RCNMV sg mRNA, is required in large quantities for encapsidation of progeny RNA genomes. The sg mRNA1 of TBSV also encodes CP, therefore, a similar concentration-dependent mechanism for controlling appropriate timing of induction of CP (i.e. late in the infection when progeny genomes are abundant) could also apply. Consistent with this notion are the observed accumulation profiles of sg mRNA1 and sg mRNA2 for TBSV and other tombusviruses during 24-h protoplast infections (17Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Johnson J.C. Rochon D.M. Virology. 1995; 214: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Tavazza M. Lucioli A. Calogero A. Pay A. Tavazza R. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1515-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). sg mRNA2 is detectable earliest in the infection, however, its accumulation then levels out at intermediate time points. In contrast, sg mRNA1 accumulation is low early in the infection but increases at later time points. The lack of functional complementation in co-infections with AS1- and RS1-defective mutants suggests that these elements do not function efficientlyin trans. However, because the two mutants could conceivably localize to different replication sites within coinfected cells, these results do not preclude the involvement of intermolecular interactions in WT infections.Figure 7MFOLD analysis of AS1 and its flanking sequences predicts the formation of stem-loop structures. Analysis of AS1 and its immediately adjacent sequences by MFOLD predicts stem-loop structures in which all or most of the AS1 nucleotides (inbold) reside in the terminal loop. Different optimal and suboptimal conformations are predicted at 37° C using MFOLD version 3.1 or at 22° C using MFOLD version 2.3, and the corresponding free energy values are indicated below each structure. The sequence shown is entirely conserved in sequenced tombusviruses, except for an adenylate (denoted by an asterisk) that is a guanylate in CNV and TBSV-S. For comparison, the predicted structure of the RCNMV trans-activator hairpin is shown to theright (9Sit T.L. Vaewhongs A.A. Lommel S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Formation of the AS1/RS1 helix is clearly essential for efficient sg mRNA1 accumulation, however, the precise nature of this interaction is unknown. It is possible that the base pairing interaction between AS1 and RS1 nucleates the formation of a larger more complex structure. For the RS1 context, the existence of an adjacent secondary structure, SL1sg1, is supported by MFOLD and comparative sequence analysis (Fig.1B). The formation of such a structure could further stabilize the AS1/RS1 helix through coaxial stacking (Fig.8A). Stabilization of higher order RNA structures by coaxial stacking of helices is quite common (26Batey R.T. Rambo R.P. Doudna J.A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 2326-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and may be involved in stabilizing other RNA structures within the TBSV genome (27Wu B. Vanti W.B. White K.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the AS1/RS1 interaction, additional types of stabilizing interactions could also exist. For instance, the sequence just 3′ to AS1 is complementary to the sequence just 5′ to SL1sg1, thus base pairing of these sequences could further stabilize the AS1/RS1 helix (Fig. 8A). The above examples illustrate the potential for this RNA interaction to be more complex and these putative structural features are being investigated.Figure 8RNA secondary structure models for the sequences involved in modulating sg mRNA1 and sg mRNA2 transcription in TBSV.

The previously characterized DE/CE interaction, which is required for efficient sg mRNA2 production, shares both similarities and differences with the AS1/RS1 interaction (Fig. 8, compare A with B). Similarities between the predicted structures include: (i) the key base pairing interactions involve sequences just 5′ to the sites of initiation; (ii) the long-distance interactions span similar distances (∼1000–1100 nt); (iii) the functional interactions occur in the (+)-strand and; (iv) similar sequences surround the initiating nucleotides (underlined, 5′-CUUGA(C/A)CAAGA). There are, however, some distinct differences: (i) the overall RNA structures predicted share no striking similarities, other than those listed above; (ii) the AS1/RS1 base pairing interaction is smaller than the DE/CE base pairing interaction (7 versus 12 bp) and; (iii) the spacing of the base pairing interaction relative to the initiation nucleotides are different (3 versus 11 nt). It is possible that this latter difference reflects unique structural features that contribute to distinct activities for these RNA complexes (e.g. timing and/or amount of sg mRNA synthesized). Alternatively, the structure currently proposed for sg mRNA2 may be incomplete and could be lacking, for example, an additional base pairing interaction involving the CE-C sequence that would correspond to the AS1/RS1 helix. In potato virus X (PVX) long-distance base pairing interactions involving the 5′ terminus of the genome and sequences just 5′ to the initiation sites of its two sg mRNAs act to regulate sg mRNA accumulation (28Kim K.H. Hemenway C.L. Virology. 1997; 232: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Kim K.H. Hemenway C.L. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The spacing between the end of the helix formed and the initiating nucleotides in both of these cases is 11 nt. In contrast, the corresponding spacing in RCNMV is 2 nt. Considering that RCNMV, but not PVX, is closely related to TBSV, and that the spacing for sg mRNA1 in TBSV is 3 nt, the latter of the two possibilities described above seems more plausible and is being explored.We have now defined two working RNA secondary structural models for RNA complexes involved in regulating sg mRNA accumulation in TBSV (Fig.8). Our data indicate that these structures function in the (+)-strand of the genome and likely regulate steps in the transcriptional process. It is interesting to note that, if both long-distance interactions were to occur simultaneously, the RNA complexes would be in close proximity to each another (Fig. 8). Such an association may be relevant to their function and could represent a type of multicomplex center where both structures are conveniently serviced by colocalized cis-and/or trans-acting elements. Some overlap in sequence function is suggested by the dependence of both sg mRNA1 and sg mRNA2 on RS1 (Fig. 3A). However, if sg mRNA2 is directly dependent on the sequence of RS1 (as opposed to its coding capacity, see below), it does not appear to rely on the AS1/RS1 interaction, because there was no recovery of sg mRNA2 levels when this helix was restored (Fig. 3A). Alternatively, it is possible that the minor modification to the extreme C terminus of p92 in RS1m1 is responsible for the observed defect. Indeed, modifications of viral RNA replication proteins have been found to specifically affect sg mRNA levels (30van Dinten L.C. den Boon J.A. Wassenaar A.L. Spaan W.J. Snijder E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 31van Marle G. van Dinten L.C. Spaan W.J. Luytjes W. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5274-5281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Viewed collectively, the information gathered on sg mRNA regulatory RNA elements in TBSV are consistent with their involvement in transcriptional regulation via a premature termination mechanism (10Choi I. Ostrovsky M. Zhang G. White K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41761-41768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,17Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar): (i) Accumulation of sg mRNA (−)-strands occurs independently of complementary (+)-strand accumulation, as would be expected if (−)-strands are synthesized first and then function as templates for (+)-strand synthesis. (ii) The key secondary structures function in the (+)-strand of the genome, as would be predicted for elements implicated in modulating (−)-strand accumulation. (iii) The AS1/RS1 interaction is required specifically for mediating (−)-strand sg mRNA1 accumulation, in accordance with a putative role for this element in promoting premature termination of (−)-strand synthesis. Although these data are consistent with a premature mechanism, they do not preclude alternative transcriptional models. Therefore, further studies will be necessary to determine conclusively the mechanism(s) utilized by TBSV for sg mRNA transcription. Viral infections of eukaryotic cells are complex processes that require regulated expression of a variety of viral genes. Depending on the virus, this expression can be regulated at different levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational (1Maia I.G. Seron K. Haenni A. Bernardi F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 367-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For (+)-strand RNA viruses, many utilize RNA-templated transcription of subgenomic (sg)1 mRNAs to allow for regulated expression of specific viral genes (2Miller W.A. Koev G. Virology. 2000; 273: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which sg mRNAs are synthesized can vary, but the messages produced share the common property of encoding open reading frames (ORFs) that are located 3′-proximally in the viral genomes. Because such 3′-proximal ORFs are generally translationally silent within the context of these genomes, sg mRNA production provides a mode for their efficient translation as well as a mechanism to regulate the timing and amount of viral protein produced (2Miller W.A. Koev G. Virology. 2000; 273: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms for sg mRNA transcription are well-established: (i) synthesis of sg mRNAs from a full-length (−)-strand genomic template via internal initiation (3Miller W.A. Dreher T.W. Hall T.C.

A third possible mechanism that has been proposed involves premature termination during (−)-strand synthesis of the genome followed by use of the 3′-truncated product as a template to transcribe sg mRNAs (7Zhong W.

Virol. 2000; 74: 11724-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), overwhelming evidence for this mechanism is still lacking. Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is the prototype member of both the genus Tombusvirus and the family Tombusviridae. Its (+)-strand RNA genome of ∼4.8 kb encodes five functional ORFs (Fig.1A) (12Hearne P.Q. Knorr D.A. Hillman B.I. Morris T.J. Virology. 1990; 177: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The viral RNA polymerase (p92) and accessory RNA replication protein (p33) are both translated from the genome, the former via translational readthrough of the amber termination codon of the latter (Fig. 1A) (12Hearne P.Q.

Virol. 1998; 72: 5845-5851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the more 3′-proximal coat protein (CP) ORF (p41) and the overlapping ORFs encoding the movement (p22) and defense (p19) proteins are expressed from two sg mRNAs that are synthesized during TBSV infections (Fig.1A) (14Hillman B.I.

The transcriptional regulation of the smaller of the two sg mRNAs, sg mRNA2, has been studied previously and RNA sequences important for efficient production of this message have been identified both proximal and distal to its initiation site (17Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Efficient accumulation of this sg mRNA requires a long-distance base pairing interaction between a sequence within the core element (CE), located just 5′ to the sg mRNA2 initiation site, and a complementary sequence within the distal element (DE) some ∼1100 nucleotides (nt) upstream (Fig. 1A) (17Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This interaction functions in the (+)-strand of the viral genome and is proposed to mediate the proper positioning of other subelements within the DE and CE (10Choi I. Ostrovsky M. Zhang G. White K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41761-41768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additionally, the production of (−)-strand sg mRNA2 occurs independently of (+)-strand sg mRNA2 accumulation (10Choi I. Ostrovsky M. Zhang G. White K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41761-41768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This latter finding, along with the observed (+)-strand activity of the CE/DE interaction, is consistent with a premature termination mechanism for sg mRNA2 transcription. Essentially nothing is known about the regulatory RNA elements involved in the synthesis of sg mRNA1. This message is critical for a successful viral infection because it allows for the efficient expression of CP, 180 subunits of which are present in each assembled particle (14Hillman B.I. Hearne P. Rochon D. Morris T.J. Virology. 1989; 169: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Currently, all that is known about sg mRNA1 transcription is that it can be effectively eliminated by the introduction of substitutions at and immediately 5′ to its site of initiation (17Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have sought to define RNA sequences and higher order structures within the TBSV genome that are important for sg mRNA1 transcription. Our results provide evidence for a long-distance RNA·RNA interaction that mediates the accumulation of sg mRNA1. The data also indicate that this interaction occurs in the"

By taking lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) micelles as a membrane model, we have shown by 1H NMR study that the binding of heparin-derived hexasaccharide (Hep-6) to CTX at the β-strand region can induce conformational changes of CTX near its membrane binding loops and promote the binding activity of CTX toward LPC.

The available x-ray and NMR structures of CTXs are similar with a short antiparallel double-stranded β-sheet connected by loop I and with a long antiparallel triple-stranded β-sheet connected by loop II and III. Two distinct types of CTXs, i.e. P- and S-type, can be distinguished by the presence of Pro30 and Ser28, respectively, near the tip of second finger (loop II) based on its binding activity toward neutral phospholipid bilayers and micelles (3Chien K.-Y.

P-type CTXs, including the major CTX A3 from Taiwan cobra (Naja atra) venom, have been shown to induce a reversible formation of an extra outwardly rectifying conductance in bullfrog atrial myocytes (4Wu W. J. Toxicol. 1997; 16: 115-134Google Scholar) and also redistribute themselves between penetrating and peripheral binding states in phosphatidylcholine (PC) dispersion under favorable condition (5Sue S.-C. Rajan P.K. Chen T.-S. Hsieh C.-H. Wu W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9826-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Despite of the apparent perturbing effect of CTX toward phospholipid membranes, it is not clear how CTXs might act specifically toward different cell types. Recently, it was suggested that the sulfated polysaccharides such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are abundant in the extracellular matrix of most animal cells, are potential targets for CTX action (6Patel H.V.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4527-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Heparin not only binds to homologous CTXs, with different specificity, but also promotes its penetration into phospholipid monolayer under physiological ionic conditions (6Patel H.V. Vyas A.A.

Analysis of binding of 10 CTX homologues to heparin reveals a new heparin-binding structural motif by involving several positive residues at theconcave surface of the three-finger toxin (7Vyas A.A.

The positive residues flanking the three-finger loops seem to form a positive cradle for binding to long chain heparin. It is, therefore, interesting to learn how carbohydrate-polypeptide interaction can promote the membrane binding activity of CTXs. The understanding of heparin-induced conformational change of GAG-binding protein is an essential factor to understand the biological function of GAGs. For instance, significant progresses have recently been achieved to understand the role of GAGs in regulating blood clotting and cell proliferation at molecular level. The x-ray structure of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), FGF receptor (FGFR), and heparin ternary complex provides a structural basis for the crucial role of heparan sulfate in FGF signaling (9Schlessinger J.

Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Heparin molecule not only binds to the FGF·FGFR asymmetrically and links two FGF ligands into dimer that bridges between two receptor chains, but also induces conformational changes of receptor within the FGF·FGFR complex by involving possibly the cis-trans isomerization of Pro253 in the linker region (10Pellegrini L. Bruke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The structural information also explains reasonably well why an octasaccharide is the minimal heparin length required to support FGF physiological activity, whereas shorter heparin fragments causes no significant enhanced, or even inhibitory, effect (11Sudhalter J. Folkman J. Svahn C.M. Bergendal K. D'Amore P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Considering CTX as a GAG-binding protein (12Wu W. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we have used fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and NMR spectroscopy to investigate the binding of hexasaccharide fragment of heparin and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) micelles to CTX and to understand how heparin binding to CTX can promote protein-membrane interaction via a novel carbohydrate-induced conformational change. It is demonstrated for the first time that the binding of two chemically different molecules, heparin and phospholipid, at different sites is capable of producing a similar conformational change of CTX. It is also suggested that similar mechanism involving tripartite interactions of heparin, protein, and lipid molecules may be operative near the extracellular matrix of cell membranes. CTX A3 from N. atra(Sigma) were purified by SP-Sephadex C-25 ion exchange column chromatography followed by high performance liquid chromatography on a reverse-phase C-18 (10-mm) column as described previously (3Chien K.-Y. Chiang C.-M. Hseu Y.-C. Vyas A.A. Rule G.S. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14473-14483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin-derived disaccharide (Hep-2) and hexasaccharide (Hep-6) were prepared by depolymerizing porcine intestinal heparin (100 mg, Sigma H-9399) by Flavobacterium heparinase I (40 mIU, Sigma H-2519) in a 1-ml reaction buffer (13Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A P-10 gel filtration column and a Sephadex G-15 gel filtration column were used for further purifying and final desalting, respectively. The LPC, 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, used in this work was obtained commercially (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). High molecular weight heparin (Hep-HMW) from porcine intestinal mucosa (∼15 kDa) and chondroitin sulfate A (CS) from bovine trachea (∼45.5 kDa, consisting of 70% chondroitin 4-sulfate (CS4) and 30% chondroitin 6-sulfate (CS6)) used for fluorescence binding measurements were obtained from Sigma. The NMR samples were prepared by dissolving CTX A3 (∼3.4 mg) in 500 μl of 90% H2O, 10% D2O mixture with 10 mm phosphate buffer to reach final concentration of 1 mm. The desired amount of LPC- or heparin-derived oligosaccharides was added into the sample for the study of heparin- and LPC-induced conformational change. The pH of the sample was adjusted to 6.0 ± 0.1 by titrating with NaOH and HCl. Two-dimensional NOESY experiments (14Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) with 150-ms mixing time were recorded on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance probe. Water suppression was achieved by pulsed field gradient with the 3-9-19 WATERGATE sequence. The NMR experiments for the sample of CTX A3-heparin-derived polysaccharide mixture and CTX A3·LPC mixture were performed at 27 and 45 °C, respectively. Higher temperature was used for CTX A3·LPC mixture because of the broader NMR line width of the sample. All spectra were typically acquired with 2048 complex data points in the t2dimension and 512 points in the t1dimension. The comparisons of protein chemical shifts and NOE effect were based on the data obtained by two-dimensional NOESY experiments and previous chemical shift assignments (15Sue S.-C. Jarrell H.C. Brisson J.-R. Wu W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12782-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Spectral processing was done by applying a sine squared window function in both dimensions followed by zero-filling to 2048 points in the t1 dimension. The chemical shift was referenced to 4,4-dimethyl 4-silapentane sodium carboxylate at 0.015 ppm. Data processing was done on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station using the XWINNMR program. Intrinsic fluorescence intensity of tyrosine of CTX A3 was monitored to determine binding isotherm of the toxin with LPC under various conditions. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 278 and 306 nm, respectively, by using a SLM 4800 fluorescence spectrometer. Known concentration of CTX A3 was titrated as a function of increasing LPC concentration, in the absence and presence of heparin-derived oligosaccharide (300 μmdisaccharide or 10 μm hexasaccharide) and GAG molecules. Phosphate buffer (10 mm) was used, and pH value was adjusted at 7.4 in the presence and absence of 150 mm NaCl depending on the studied samples. Binding data were analyzed according to our previous study (3Chien K.-Y. Chiang C.-M. Hseu Y.-C. Vyas A.A. Rule G.S. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14473-14483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation constant,Kd, was simulated by nonlinear least squares fitting of data according to Equation 1. Kd=([Pt]−[PLa])([Lt]/n−[PLa])[PLa]Equation 1 [Pt] and [Lt] are the total concentrations of CTX A3 and LPC, respectively. [PLn] represents the concentration of lipid-protein complexes, which was estimated by the change of fluorescence intensity. The n value represents the number of lipid molecules to constitute a CTX A3 binding site. Infrared spectra were collected at ambient temperature by using a Bomem DA8.3 FTIR system with an MCT detector as described previously (16Lin Y.-H. Huang W.-N. Lee S.-C. Wu W. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2000; 27: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The desired CTX samples in the presence and absence of the studied ligands were initially lyophilized under buffering condition (10 mm phosphate in H2O, pH 7.4). The same amount of deuterated water (D2O, 99.9%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratory Inc.) was then added to exchange labile protons and kept for 3 h. The procedure repeated two times. The sample was finally placed in a sealed IR cell consisting of two CaF2 windows separated by a 25-μm Teflon spacer. All spectra were recorded at a resolution of 2 cm−1 for 500 scans and Fourier-transformed after an application of triangular apodization function. To determine the contribution of each of the amide I′ and side chain components to the total signal intensity, spectra analysis was performed using the program GRAMS/386 as described (17Surewicz W.K. Stepanik T.M. Szabo A.G. Mantsch H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 786-790Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Deconvoluted spectra were fitted from 1710 cm−1 to 1550 cm−1 with Lorentzian band profiles. Initial band positions were taken directly from the second derivative of spectra, which were calculated analytically with the OMNIC 5.0 software to determine the initial wavenumber of each vibrational mode. None of the spectra was subjected to smoothing before analysis. A nonsloping base line was used for estimating the signal intensity of the desired components. We have demonstrated previously that Hep-HMW accentuates the penetration of CTX into phospholipid membranes, as analyzed by Langmuir monolayer measurement under physiological salt condition (6Patel H.V. Vyas A.A. Vyas K.A. Liu Y.-S. Chiang C.-M. Chi L.-M. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1484-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A similar heparin-enhanced binding of CTX A3 toward LPC micelles can also be monitored by Tyr intrinsic fluorescence intensity change of CTX A3 under 150 mm NaCl and 10 mmphosphate buffer at pH 7.4 (Fig.1A, closed triangles). The deduced binding isotherms indicate clearly the dramatic effect of heparin on the CTX-LPC interaction (compareclosed triangles with closed squares in the inset panel). In contrast, other polyanionic GAGs such as CS produces similar fluorescence intensity enhancement as the control (bottom traces with closed circles andsquares). The result is consistent with a previous observation that GAGs bind to CTX with different specificity (8Vyas K.A. Patel H.V. Vyas A.A. Wu W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4527-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and suggests further that heparin-enhanced CTX binding to LPC micelles is also specific. We should point out that the binding of Hep-HMW to CTX A3 produces significant aggregation, as evidenced by the increase of turbidity of the studied samples (6Patel H.V. Vyas A.A. Vyas K.A. Liu Y.-S. Chiang C.-M. Chi L.-M. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1484-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It prevents the usage of other spectroscopic techniques such as high resolution NMR to understand at the molecular level how carbohydrate-polypeptide interaction can promote the membrane binding activity of CTXs. The aggregation of the studied complex can be reduced if depolymerized heparins such as heparin-derived oligosaccharides are used (20Sue S.-C. Brisson J.-R. Chang S.-C. Huang W.-N. Lee S.-C. Jarrell H.C. Wu W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10436-10446Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Despite of the concurrent reduction of heparin-enhanced CTX binding to LPC micelles, the presence of Hep-6 can still enhance CTX-LPC interaction under physiological salt condition (Fig. 1B). Because we have demonstrated previously that sulfated pentasaccharide may be sufficient to bind to CTX (9Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), the study of CTX-LPC interaction in the presence of Hep-6 can then provide a useful system to understand the tripartite interaction of heparin, phospholipid, and CTX molecules. As we will show below, the weak effect of Hep-6 in promoting the CTX-LPC interaction under physiological salt condition can be enhanced if lower salt concentrations (10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4) are used. The enhancement under low salt condition without the complication of significant sample aggregation allows us to use Hep-6·CTX·LPC sample as mimics of heparin-CTX-membrane interaction under physiological salt condition. Detailed spectroscopic studies involving fluorescence, NMR, and FTIR techniques are therefore carried out under low salt conditions and reported in the following sections. As shown in Fig. 1C, the binding of CTX A3 toward to LPC micelles can be significantly perturbed in the presence of heparin-derived oligosaccharides. The presence of either Hep-6 or Hep-2 changes the intrinsic Tyr fluorescence of CTX A3. The Tyr fluorescence of CTX A3 has also been found to increase in a dose-dependent manner as LPC concentration increases. These observations suggest that both heparin and LPC molecules can bind to CTX A3 equally well and perturb its conformation. Assuming a two-state model, the fitting of fluorescence intensity of the titration experiment allows the determination of their apparentKd and n values. The upper binding isotherm trace (Fig. 1C, closed circles) suggests that Hep-6 can enhance the binding of CTX A3 toward LPC micelles by decreasing both the apparentKd (0.18 μm) and n (∼13) values. The binding of CTX A3 toward LPC micelles as determined by Tyr intrinsic fluorescence intensity change of CTX A3 (Fig. 1C,bottom trace (fluorescence intensity) withclosed squares) suggests a binding stoichiometry (n) of 45 ± 15 lipid molecules per CTX A3 with dissociation constant (Kd) of 4 ± 1 μm (inset panel of Fig.1C, middle trace (binding isotherm)). Similar binding study of other P-type CTX such as CT II from Naja oxiana snake venom toward perdeuterated 12:0 dodecyl phosphocholine (DPC) micelles was performed using 1H NMR spectroscopy previously (18Dubovskii P.V. Dementieva D.V. Bocharov E.V. Utkin Y.N. Arseniev A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Their result indicates that approximately two molecules of toxin are bound to one micelle consisting 66 molecules of DPC at 30 °C and no significant change of the aggregation number of DPC molecules per micelle in the presence and absence of CT II. Because there are about 100 lipid molecules/LPC micelle (19Weltzien H.U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 259-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), it is estimated that approximately 2–3 molecules of CTX A3 are present in 1 LPC micelle. For the bottom (isotherm) trace(closed triangles, Fig. 1C), it is not possible to quantitate the effect of Hep-2 on the apparentKd and n values of CTX A3-LPC interaction, as the fluorescence enhancement has not reached saturation level at the highest studied lipid concentration range. However, the fact that it could not reach saturation state at similar concentration range indicates that Hep-2 may have an inhibitory effect on the binding of CTX A3 to LPC micelles. The inhibitory effect of Hep-2 becomes clear if we arbitrarily normalize the highest observed fluorescence intensity as 90% saturation (curve of closed triangles in the inset panel of Fig. 1). For 50% of CTX A3 to become membrane-bound, the LPC concentration must be raised by approximately 2 times in the presence of Hep-2, but only half of LPC is needed in the presence of Hep-6. After establishing that Hep-6, as in the case of long chain heparin, can also enhance the binding of CTX to LPC micelles, we carried out two-dimensional NMR experiments to monitor the effects of both Hep-2 and Hep-6 on the αH and NH chemical shift of CTX A3 molecule (Fig.2). The overall effects of the two studied heparin molecules on the 1H chemical shift of CTX A3 molecule are similar. The most significant perturbation effects are detected near Cys38 NH, indicating that both molecules share a similar binding site near the region. Structural analysis of Hep-2·CTX A3 complex based on the NOE buildup curve of the bound conformation of Hep-2 and the intermolecular NOEs between protein and carbohydrate clearly shows that Hep-2 bind to the convexside of the CTX molecule near the rigid core region of Cys38 (20Sue S.-C. Brisson J.-R. Chang S.-C. Huang W.-N. Lee S.-C. Jarrell H.C. Wu W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10436-10446Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The determined Hep-2 binding site is placed remotely as well as on the side opposite to the concave side of the three-finger loops, which was proposed previously for long chain heparin binding (7Vyas A.A. Pan J.-J. Patel H.V. Vyas K.A. Chiang C.-M. Sheu Y.-C. Hwang J.-K. Wu W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9661-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The disclosed two distinct heparin binding sites, one revealed by the NMR study of Hep-2 and the other suggested by comparing the binding strength of 10 CTX homologues, are consistent with properties of CTX-heparin interaction reported so far. First, Hep-6 enhances the interaction between CTX and LPC micelles, whereas Hep-2 inhibits the same. Second, a significant amount of aggregation of CTX A3 has been taken place during the binding of Hep-6 with CTX A3 at or above an equimolar concentration of these two, but no such aggregation has been observed for Hep-2 to CTX A3 irrespective of the wide range of molar concentrations used. Third, although the chemical shift perturbation of CTX A3 caused by Hep-2 and Hep-6 are qualitatively similar, there is still a difference quantitatively. This can best be seen in thebottom panels of Fig.3A, showing the calculated differential chemical shift perturbations based on the data obtained from Hep-6·CTX A3 and Hep-2·CTX A3 mixtures. Fig. 3A also shows a pictorial representation of those αH and NH positions (solid spheres) in CTX A3 with significant chemical shift variation greater than 0.03 ppm. The additional chemical shift variations between Hep-6·CTX A3 and Hep-2·CTX A3 mixtures are distributed not only on the three connecting loops but also extend toward the rigid core of its β-strands. The chemical shift perturbation near cationic β-strand cradle provides spectroscopic evidence for the heparin binding site predicted previously, based on the binding strength of 10 CTX homologues with long chain heparin. However, the most dramatic chemical shift perturbations, i.e. down-field shift detected at Leu9 NH and Val34 NH and up-field shift at Met26 NH, are unexpectedly found to be located near the tip of loop I and loop II. Because similar residues have been reported to exhibit most significant chemical shift perturbations by studying the binding of other CTX homologues such as CT II and toxin γ toward perdeuterated DPC micelles (18Dubovskii P.V. Dementieva D.V. Bocharov E.V. Utkin Y.N. Arseniev A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Dauplais M. Neumann J.M. Pinkasfeld S. Menez A. Roumestand C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it led us to perform similar NMR binding experiments on CTX·LPC mixtures. The effect of LPC binding to CTX molecule as monitored by the1H NMR chemical shift variation was studied at protein/lipid ratio of 25:1 at 45 °C (Fig. 3B). Higher temperature was used for this study because of the broader NMR line width and the apparent higher viscosity of the sample. The binding of LPC toward CTX A3 can indeed produce significant variation of the1H NMR chemical shift for both αH and NH located near the tip of all three loops as shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 3B. It should be pointed out that most of the hydrophobic residues near the tips of the loops are located on the convex side of the CTX molecule. The intermolecular NOEs observed between LPC fatty acyl chain and CTX A3 molecule suggest further that the amino acid residues in the convex side of the loop region are involved in lipid-CTX interaction (data not shown). The results reconfirm that all three hydrophobic loops (I, II, and III) of the P-type CTXs are involved in its binding to phospholipid dispersions (18Dubovskii P.V. Dementieva D.V. Bocharov E.V. Utkin Y.N. Arseniev A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Dauplais M. Neumann J.M. Pinkasfeld S. Menez A. Roumestand C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the convex side of CTX A3 molecule with hydrophobic residues is in contact with the membrane surface. To facilitate the comparison between the effect of Hep-6 and LPC micelles on CTX A3, an analysis of the chemical shift perturbation similar to Hep-6 was also performed for CTX A3 and CTX A3·LPC mixtures (Fig. 3B). Dark solid spheres show those proton positions observed to be similarly perturbed by the binding of either Hep-6 carbohydrate molecules or LPC lipid micelles. They are mainly located near the tips of the loops and consist of ∼50% of those protons exhibiting significant chemical shift perturbations as a result of Hep-6 and LPC binding. Those regions perturbed only by Hep-6, but not by LPC micelles, can be seen to be located near the β-strand region rather than in the tips of the loops. The result is consistent with a view that Hep-6 binds to CTX A3 near the β-strand region and induces a conformational change near the tip of the loop. Because the chemical shift perturbations of Leu9 NH, Met26 NH, and Val34 NH as a result of LPC or Hep-6 binding are most significant among all amino acid residues, it provides a reliable parameter for performing NMR titration experiment on CTX A3 against varying LPC concentration. As shown in Fig.4, all the indicated chemical shift variations follow a similar concentration dependent manner and reach their saturation states at similar LPC/CTX molar ratio of 25/1 (Fig.4). Because the reported resonance positions distributed over all three loops, it appears that all the three loops constitute a LPC binding site with the exchange rate faster than the inverse of the reported chemical shift difference, i.e. ≫ ms. Chemical shift is sensitive to steric property of protein and reflects the secondary and tertiary structure in general. The binding of CTXs, including toxin γ, CT II, and A3, to phospholipid all are consistently lead to a dramatic down-field shift detected at Leu9 NH and Val34 NH and up-field shift at Met26 NH. The shifts seem to be a represented character when CTX changes to a membrane binding conformation. Similar shifts, both magnitude and sign, were also found in the case of Hep-6 binding. Hence, it is rational to suggest that binding of Hep-6 has the capability to induce CTX to favor its membrane binding conformation. The suggestion is also consistent with fluorescence binding measurement that Hep-6 can enhance the CTX membrane binding activity. Therefore, it is interesting to see whether similar heparin-enhanced CTX binding can also be monitored by NMR, especially via the chemical shift parameters. To address this question, we used 1H NMR to study the binding of Hep-6 to CTX·LPC micelles. Samples of 1/10 molar ratio of CTX·LPC micelles were prepared, and then 0.1 or 0.2 mmHep-6 was added to examine the effect of Hep-6 binding on the chemical shift of CTX A3. In general, the chemical shift of all NH and αH of CTX A3 changes as and when more CTX molecules interact with LPC (data not shown). For instance, if we assume the chemical shift variation of Leu9 NH, Met26 NH, and Val34 NH in the saturation state (1:50 molar ratio as shown in Fig. 4) as 100% binding, Hep-6 can enhance the binding of CTX to LPC micelle from 40–50% to 90% based on the Hep-6 induced additional chemical shift variation (Fig. 5). The result strongly suggests that Hep-6 can indeed induce conformational change of CTX in favor of its micelle binding activity to allow more CTX molecules bound to phospholipid membranes. By monitoring chemical shift variations at Leu9, Met26, and Val34, we demonstrated that long chain heparin such as Hep-6 can induced conformational change near the three-finger connecting loop region to favor its membrane binding form. It will be interesting if the exact conformational change responsible for the observed chemical shift variation of the two CTX·Hep-6 and CTX·LPC complexes can be determined.

They can sequester a variety of extracellular proteins at cell surfaces. In cartilage, the molecules that make up the extracellular matrix include proteoglycans, hyaluronan, type II collagen, and glycoproteins. Aggrecan is the major structural proteoglycan in cartilage and is responsible for its resilience and load-bearing properties. Loss of aggrecan is a major feature of cartilage degradation associated with arthritis (6Lohmander L.S. Dahlberg L. Ryd L. Heinegard D.

The core protein of aggrecan is composed of three globular domains (G1, G2, and G3) with a large extended region between G2 and G3 for GAG chain attachment, CS (1Wight T.N. Heinegård D.K.

G1 comprises the amino terminus of the core protein. This domain has the same structural motif as link protein (10Deak F. Kiss I. Sparks K.J. Argraves W.S. Hampikian G. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3766-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). G2 is homologous to the tandem repeats of G1 and of link protein. G3, which makes up the carboxyl terminus of the core protein, is composed of folded modules including alternatively spliced epidermal growth factor-like motifs, a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), a complement binding protein (CBP)-like domain, and a short carboxyl-terminal tail (11Sai S. Tanaka T. Kosher R.A. Tanzer M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5081-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The G3 domain seems to be important in aggrecan processing. This was initially observed in chicken nanomelia, in which a point mutation produces a premature stop codon on the amino-terminal side of G3 (12Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the nanomelic mutation, the cartilage matrix lacks aggrecan. The mutation seems to inhibit aggrecan secretion to the matrix, and no modification by GAG chains occurs (13Vertel B.M. Walters L.M. Grier B. Maine N. Goetinck P.F. J.

It has been proposed that G3 may regulate the attachment of GAG chains and affect the secretion of aggrecan, and it was later demonstrated that G3 is important in product secretion (15Vertel B.M.

The present study was designed to dissect the mechanisms governing the effects of the G3 domain in GAG chain attachment and product secretion. We generated a large number of deletion mutants of the G3 domain to investigate whether G3 conformation, through the formation of cysteine-mediated disulfide bonds, was involved. We determined that cysteines present in G3 do indeed play a role in product secretion. We also used mutants to distinguish G3 structural elements that allow product secretion without enhancing GAG chain attachment and vice versa.

COS-7 cells, from American Type Culture Collection, were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. In this study, a total of 32 recombinant constructs were used. Of these, 22 (including the G3 construct) were generated based on an aggrecan G3 construct, which was cloned and expressed in our previous studies (22Yang B.B. Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L.

This construct contains the leading peptide, which is composed of a link protein signal peptide and an epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody 4B6 (24Binette F. Cravens J. Kahoussi B.

The leading peptide and G3 domain are linked by a XhoI restriction endonuclease site, whereas the tail and the vector are linked by an XbaI site. Individual mutants were generated using PCR. All names of the primers are given in Fig. 1, and the oligonucleotide sequences are listed in TableI. The location of primers and the presence or absence of cysteines are also given in Fig. 1. All 5′ primers contained the XhoI restriction site, and 3′ primers contained the XbaI restriction site, allowing insertion of the PCR-derived fragments into XhoI- andXbaI-digested G3 construct. Thus, the G3 domain of the G3 construct was replaced with the PCR-generated fragments.

Lee V. Cao L. Chen L. Wu Y. Zhang Y. Adams M.E. Yang B.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Also known as “mini-aggrecan,” this construct contains the leading peptide (for antibody recognition), the aggrecan G1 domain, a small CS fragment (CSD) containing amino acids 1274–1362 of chicken aggrecan and 8 consensus sequences for GAG chain modification (9Chandrasekaran L. Tanzer M.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the aggrecan G3 domain, and a short carboxyl-terminal tail. To create the mutants, various domains were deleted (Fig. 5) or swapped with CRD and CBP domains containing mutated cysteines (Fig. 6). Because the G3 domain in G1CSDG3 contains a 5′XhoI site and a 3′ XbaI site, the CRDCBP fragment was synthesized with the primers CRDNXhoI (containing theXhoI site) and CBPCXbaI (containing the XbaI site). All other fragments were obtained from some of the 20 constructs described above (also containing XhoI at 5′ andXbaI at 3′). DNA was amplified in PCR using pairs of appropriate primers. The reaction mixture (total volume, 100 μl) contained 200 μm dNTPs, 0.2 μg of each primer, 50 ng of template DNA, 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and the Mg2+-containing buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reactions were carried out at 94 °C for 5 min for 1 cycle, 94 °C (60 s), 55 °C (60 s), and 72 °C (60 s) for 25 cycles, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. DNA products were purified and then doubly digested with two appropriate restriction endonucleases. The DNA was ligated into the appropriate linearized plasmids (e.g. pcDNA3). A ligation mixture typically contained 2 μl of 5× ligation buffer, 1 μl of T4 DNA ligase, 3 μl of plasmid vector (50 ng), and 4 μl of insert fragment (150 ng). The ligation reaction was carried out at 16 °C overnight. Five μl of the ligation mixture was used for heat shock transformation of competent Escherichia coli strain DH5α. Bacteria were then transferred to 500 μl of SOC medium (0.5% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 20 mm MgSO4, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, pH 7.0), agitated at 225 rpm for 1 h at 37 °C, spread onto LB agar plates containing 100 μg ampicillin/ml, and cultured at 37 °C overnight. The identities of all new constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing performed by the Core Molecular Biology Laboratory at York University (Toronto, Ontario). The results were then compared with the published sequences (9Chandrasekaran L. Tanzer M.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M.

To analyze gene expression, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with recombinant constructs using Lipofectin (25Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4365) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, the cultured COS-7 cells were seeded on 12-well tissue culture plates (1.5 × 105cells/well). The cells were allowed to attach and grow overnight in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected once they reached 70% confluence. Lipofectin (0.5 μl) was incubated with plasmid DNA (∼2 μg) for 15 min in 100 μl of DMEM followed by an addition of 900 μl of DMEM. Concurrently, COS-7 cell cultures were washed with 2 ml of DMEM. The Lipofectin-DNA mixture was added to the cultures followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 h in an incubator. The DNA-Lipofectin mixture was replaced with 1 ml of DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were harvested in 400 μl of lysis buffer 3 days later, and samples of cell lysate and culture medium were frozen at −70 °C until analysis. Cell lysate and culture medium samples were prepared in loading dye and subjected to SDS-PAGE in separating gel containing 5 or 7% acrylamide. Two layer gels (12 and 5%) were used if large and small products were analyzed in the same experiment. The buffer system was 1× TG (Tris-glycine buffer according to Amresco) containing 1% SDS. Separated proteins were trans-blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane in 1× Tris-glycine buffer containing 20% methanol at 60 V for 2 h at 4 °C. The membrane was blocked in TBST (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk powder (TBSTM) for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with the monoclonal antibody 4B6 (or biotinylated 4B6) in TBSTM. The membranes were washed with TBST (3 × 10 min washes) and then incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (1:10,000 dilution in TBSTM). After washing as above, the bound antibodies were visualized with chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Trichloroacetic acid was added to culture medium or cell lysate to a final concentration of 10% followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g) at 4 °C for 30 min. The pelleted proteins were resuspended in loading dye and subjected to Western blot analysis as above. Protein G beads (50 μl of gel slurry) were incubated with excess 4B6 antibody at room temperature for 2 h. The unbound antibody was removed, and the gel beads were washed three times with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline. Culture media or cell lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with different constructs or control vector were mixed with 2× phosphate-buffered saline buffer in a 1:1 ratio followed by incubation with the antibody-bound gel beads at 4 °C overnight. The gel beads were extensively washed and resuspended in 200 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Chondroitinase ABC (0.2 units) was added to digest GAG chains at 37 °C for 2 h. The digested product was recovered with protein-loading dye and analyzed on Western blot probed with 4B6 as above. To study the effects of cysteines in the aggrecan G3 domain on product secretion, we tested 20 constructs in which the cysteines were subjected to mutagenesis in different combinations. There are six cysteines in the CRD motif and four in the CBP motif. Three groups of mutation constructs in CRD were generated, resulting in 12 recombinant constructs (Fig. 1). In Group I constructs, the three cysteines in the amino-terminal fragment (C1 to C3) and the three cysteines in the carboxyl-terminal fragment (C4 to C6) of CRD motif were mutated in parallel. The four resulting constructs, CRD, CRDC2C3C4C5, CRDC3C4, and CRDC0, retained, respectively, all cysteines, the middle four cysteines, the middle two cysteines, and no cysteines. In Group II, the three cysteines in the carboxyl-terminal fragment of CRD were deleted, and the three cysteines in the amino-terminal fragment were mutated, resulting in four constructs, CRDC1C2C3, CRDC1C3, CRDC2C3, and CRDC3. In Group III, the three cysteines in the amino-terminal fragment of CRD were deleted, and the three cysteines in the carboxyl-terminal fragment were mutated, producing constructs CRDC4C5C6, CRDC4C6, CRDC4C5, and CRDC4. The amino acid sequences of all constructs listed in Fig. 1 are given in Fig. 2. All amino acid sequences were deduced from the cDNA sequences after the constructs were generated. We isolated at least two clones from each expression construct to guarantee that we would obtain a sequence that was identical to the reported aggrecan sequences (11Sai S. Tanaka T. Kosher R.A. Tanzer M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5081-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Theunderlined amino acids (Gly or Trp) were mutated from the wild-type Cys residue. These two amino acid residues were chosen to replace Cys because of codon similarities. The 12 constructs obtained from the CRD motif were expressed in COS-7 cells. Culture medium and cell lysates were harvested and analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blot as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Probing with the monoclonal antibody 4B6 showed that all expressed constructs were of the expected sizes (Fig.3). In Group I, all constructs were well expressed and secreted except CRDC3C4, which was poorly secreted. The CRDC3C4 product was well detected in 10-fold concentrated culture medium (Fig. 3A, CRDC3C4,p). In Group II, CRDC1C2C3, CRDC1C3, CRDC2C3, and CRDC3 were well expressed, but only CRDC1C2C3 and CRDC1C3 were well secreted. The products of CRDC2C3 and CRDC3 were poorly secreted as compared with the control construct CRD. The secreted products of CRDC2C3 and CRDC3 were visible on Western blot after these samples were concentrated (10-fold) (Fig. 3B). All Group III products were well expressed and secreted to culture medium as compared with the control CRD (Fig. 3C). The G3 complement binding protein-like motif contains four cysteines. To study their effects on product secretion, we generated two more groups of constructs (Group IV and Group V, Fig. 1). In Group IV, two cysteines in the carboxyl-terminal fragment of CBP were mutated, producing CBPC1C2C4 and CBPC1C2. These constructs were well expressed and well secreted (Fig. 4A). Expression of the CBP construct or CBP containing the carboxyl-terminal tail (CBPtail) indicated that the tail is not required for product secretion (Fig. 4A). In Group V, the amino-terminal cysteine of CBP was mutated along with the two cysteines in carboxyl fragment, producing constructs CBPC2C3C4, CBPC2C4, CBPC2C3, and CBPC2. Culture medium and cell lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with these constructs were analyzed on a Western blot probed with 4B6. The product of CBPtail was used as a control. All constructs were weakly detected in cell lysates and culture medium as compared with CBPtail (Fig. 4B). After product precipitation (10-fold concentration), they were readily detected on Western blot (Fig. 4C). In addition to investigating the effects of G3-subdomain conformation on construct secretion, we aimed to dissect the functions of G3 in GAG chain attachment and product secretion. We did not observe accumulation of GAG chain-modified product in cell lysate; GAG-modified products were always secreted to culture medium, indicating the close relationship of these two processes. We have previously shown that the construct G1CSD is not modified by GAG chain and not secreted, whereas G1CSDG3 is modified by GAG chains, and the product is secreted (21Kiani C. Lee V. Cao L. Chen L. Wu Y. Zhang Y. Adams M.E. Yang B.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We thus sought to identify element(s) in G3 that facilitate product secretion but had no effect on GAG chain attachment and elements that are not secreted on their own but enable GAG chain attachment. The current study indicated that the products of G3 subdomain constructs CRD and CBPtail were well secreted. We thus examined these fragments for GAG chain attachment by adding them to the G1CSD construct. All new G1CSD-linked constructs, now named G1CSDCRDCBP, G1CSDCRD, and G1CSDCBPtail, as well as G1CSDG3 and G1CSD controls (Fig. 5A), were well expressed (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the G1CSDCBPtail product was not modified by GAG chains nor secreted to culture medium, although CBPtail, in the absence of G1CSD domains, is secreted on its own. On the other hand, the products of G3 and CRDCBP (Fig. 5C) and the product of CRD (Fig. 3A) were well expressed and secreted, and constructs containing these fragments (i.e. G1CSDG3, G1CSDCRDCBP, and G1CSDCRD) generated products modified by GAG chains and secreted. It was noted that the cell-associated products of the above five constructs containing the CSD fragment showed little diffusion, likely indicating low levels of GAG chain modification. The apparent molecular weights of products in cell lysate (lys) and culture medium (med) were much greater than the calculated molecular mass (cal) of the recombinant constructs (Fig. 5D). Although the apparent molecular mass of the cell lysate products was greater than the calculated molecular mass, a lack of diffusion implied that these products were not subjected to GAG addition. Rather, they may have been modified by glycosylation, as these constructs contain several potential sites for N-glycosylation (located at Asn residues 76, 122, 330, and 2082) according to the published sequence (12Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, all constructs containing the CBP motif have four potential sites for glycosylation, whereas constructs containing the G1 domain have three potential sites for glycosylation. Because glycosylation of these recombinant constructs appeared not to be affected by the presence of different G3 subdomains, no further study was conducted. In contrast to the cell lysate products, the products in the culture medium migrated diffusely on Western blot, resulting in broad ranges of molecular mass. This may have been caused by GAG chain attachment to core protein, as the core proteins of the recombinant constructs contains eight potential sites for GAG chain modification. To confirm the presence of GAG chains, we treated these products with chondroitinase ABC. Treated products migrated as single bands on Western blot, confirming this explanation (Fig. 5E). The addition of GAG chains appeared to be affected by the addition of different G3 subdomains. The role of the cysteines in the CRD and CBP motifs was further studied by adding the G1CSD fragment to mutant constructs CRDC0, CRDC3, CRDC4, CBPC2, and CBPC1C2 used in the experiments described above. These constructs were labeled G1CSDCRDC0, G1CSDCRDC3, G1CSDCRDC4, G1CSDCBPC2, and G1CSDCBPC1C2 (Fig. 6A). Before the addition of G1CSD, the mutant CRDC3 was notably ill-secreted (Fig. 3); with the addition of CRDC3 to G1CSD, the new construct (G1CSDCRDC3) was well expressed, and the products were modified by GAG chains (as indicated by diffusion of the secreted products) and secreted to culture medium (Fig. 6B). The cell-associated products showed little diffusion of bands (little GAG chain modification). Again, the apparent molecular masses of the products in cell lysate (lys) and culture medium (med) were much greater than the calculated molecular mass (cal) of each recombinant construct (Fig. 6C). Chondroitinase ABC treatment further confirmed that the secreted recombinant proteoglycans were subjected to post-translational modification by GAG chains as expected (Fig. 6D). Taken together, we have studied five types of G1CSD-containing constructs differing in GAG chain modification and product secretion (Figs. 5 and 6). All results are summarized in TableII. (i) Without any components from the G3 domain, the product of G1CSD was not modified by GAG chains nor secreted. (ii) The addition of certain elements from the G3 domain to the G1CSD construct, including G3, CRD, CRDCBP, CRDC0, CRDC4, and CBPC1C2, allowed GAG chain modification and product secretion. All of these G3 elements, when linked to the leading peptide, were well expressed and secreted. (iii) The construct CRDC3 was well expressed but poorly secreted, but the addition of the CRDC3 fragment to G1CSD allowed GAG modification and product secretion. (iv) The construct CBPC2 is poorly expressed and poorly secreted, but the addition of CBPC2 to G1CSD allowed GAG modification and"
https://openalex.org/W2071979899,"MKK7 is a recently discovered mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase that is unique in that it specifically activates only the c-JUN NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK) family of enzymes. Very little is known about the biological role of MKK7. We generated inducible cell lines from the human embryonal kidney carcinoma cell line, HEK293, by stable transfection with a constitutively active mutant of MKK7, MKK73E, fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), under the control of an ecdysone-inducible promoter. Treatment of cells with the synthetic ecdysone analog ponasterone A induced expression of GFP-MKK73E and resulted in sustained activation of endogenous JNK, but neither of the other endogenous MAPKs, ERK or p38. Red and green fluorescing cDNA copies of mRNA extracted from cells obtained before and after induction of GFP-MKK73Ewere hybridized to microarrays containing more than 6,000 cDNAs in eight independent experiments. By selection criteria, 23 genes were differentially regulated after 24 h of induction of GFP-MKK73E and 16 after 48 h. The expression of 9 genes was consistently changed after both 24 and 48 h of induction. These changes included down-regulation of three genes, c-myc, angiopoietin-2, and glucose-regulated protein 58, and up-regulation of 6 genes, tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2, GRP78, autotaxin, PPP1R7, the DKFZ cDNA p434D0818, and 1 unknown gene. Consistent with previously described roles of several of the altered genes, MKK73E inhibited cell proliferation. These data implicate active MKK7 in the negative regulation of cell proliferation and provide evidence for a new role for this kinase in the regulation of a distinct, hitherto unrecognized set of genes."
https://openalex.org/W2092679188,"Glycerol is taken up by human muscle in vivo and incorporated into lipids, but little is known about regulation of glycerol metabolism in this tissue. In this study, we have analyzed the role of glycerol kinase (GlK) in the regulation of glycerol metabolism in primary cultured human muscle cells. Isolated human muscle cells exhibited lower GlK activity than fresh muscle explants, but the activity in cultured cells was increased by exposure to insulin. [U-14C]Glycerol was incorporated into cellular phospholipids and triacylglycerides (TAGs), but little or no increase in TAG content or lactate release was observed in response to changes in the medium glycerol concentration. Adenovirus-mediated delivery of the Escherichia coli GlK gene (AdCMV-GlK) into muscle cells caused a 30-fold increase in GlK activity, which was associated with a marked rise in the labeling of phospholipid or TAG from [U-14C]glycerol compared with controls. Moreover, GlK overexpression caused [U-14C]glycerol to be incorporated into glycogen, which was dependent on the activation of glycogen synthase. Co-incubation of AdCMV-GlK-treated muscle cells with glycerol and oleate resulted in a large accumulation of TAG and an increase in lactate production. We conclude that GlK is the limiting step in muscle cell glycerol metabolism. Glycerol 3-phosphate is readily used for TAG synthesis but can also be diverted to form glycolytic intermediates that are in turn converted to glycogen or lactate. Given the high levels of glycerol in muscle interstitial fluid, these finding suggest that changes in GlK activity in muscle can exert important influences on fuel deposition in this tissue.

Importantly, recent studies have shown that intramuscular overstorage of TAG is closely correlated with muscle insulin resistance (3Boesch C. Slotboom J. Hoppeler H. Kreis R. Magn. Reson. Med. 1997; 37: 484-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 4Szczepaniak L.S. Babcock E.E. Schick F. Dobbins R.L. Garg A. Burns D.K. McGarry J.D. Stein D.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E977-E989PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there is little information about the regulation of muscle TAG synthesis, which depends on the provision of exogenous fatty acids (5Montell E. Turini M. Marotta M. Roberts M. Noé V. Ciudad C.J. Macé K. Gómez-Foix A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E229-E237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the availability of glycerol 3-P for esterification.Glycerol 3-P can be derived from direct uptake of glycerol and its phosphorylation by GlK or, alternatively, as a by-product of the glycolytic pathway. Demonstration of significant extraction of glycerol by forearm muscle has been reported, whereas no uptake was detected in adipose tissue (6Coppack S.W. Person M. Judd R.L. Miles J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E233-E240PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, studies of incorporation of glycerol into muscle TAG showed that it was comparable to that of glucose on a carbon-equivalent basis in fed rats and much greater than that of glucose in fasted animals (7Guo Z. Jensen M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23702-23706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GlK activity has been detected in rat (8Newsholme E.A. Taylor K. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and human (9Seltzer W. Angelini C. Dhariwal G. Ringel S.P. McCabe E.R. Muscle Nerve. 1989; 12: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) skeletal muscle. The activity is higher in rat red than in white muscle (8Newsholme E.A. Taylor K. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although activity levels in either muscle fiber type are much lower than in liver. This is consistent with the finding of abundant GlK mRNA in liver, kidney, and testis in human and mouse and much lower transcript levels in muscle (10Sargent C.A. Young C. Marsh S. Ferguson-Smith M.A. Affara N.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that liver and muscle express different GlK genes based on the dissociation between deficiencies in liver and muscle GlK activity in human patients (9Seltzer W. Angelini C. Dhariwal G. Ringel S.P. McCabe E.R. Muscle Nerve. 1989; 12: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).The current study was undertaken to evaluate the role of GlK in control of glycerol metabolism in muscle cells. While low rates of glycerol conversion to cellular products can be demonstrated in cultured human myocytes, these variables are only modestly affected by altering the medium glycerol concentration. However, overexpression of GlK in these cells caused large, glycerol concentration-dependent increases in accumulation of cellular lipids, glycogen, and lactate. Thus, these studies demonstrate that all of the enzymes required for glycerol utilization in several different pathways are abundantly expressed in muscle cells and that glycerol metabolism is controlled by the level of GlK. These findings provide a new perspective on the potential relevance of glycerol to muscle metabolism, particularly under catabolic circumstances where glycerol levels are elevated.DISCUSSIONBlood glycerol has been shown to be taken up by skeletal muscle and used as a precursor for intramuscular TAG synthesis in rats (7Guo Z. Jensen M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23702-23706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), reinforcing the notion that functional GlK is present in this tissue (8Newsholme E.A. Taylor K. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the interpretation of the in vivo data was hampered by the fact that some of the infused glycerol may have been converted to glucose in the liver prior to its use as a substrate by muscle. In the present study, we have assessed the capacity of cultured human muscle cells to metabolize glycerol and have evaluated the potential rate-limiting role of GlK.Human muscle cells in culture exhibited very low GlK activity, the specific activity being 4 times lower than that detected in fresh rat gastrocnemius muscle tissue. Consistently, cultured cells did not accumulate significant amounts of glycerol 3-P in response to incubation with glycerol. Incubation with lactate, a putative glyceroneogenic substrate (20Watford M. Nutr. Rev. 2000; 58: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), did not raise glycerol 3-P, whereas glucose doubled its concentration. Nevertheless, in cells treated with [U-14C]glycerol, incorporation of radioactivity into both PL and TAG fractions was detected even in the presence of glucose, indicating that these cells are able to metabolize glycerol and use it for lipid synthesis at a low rate. Our data agree with a previous report showing incorporation of [3H]glycerol into PL and neutral lipids in BC3H-1 myocytes and enhancement of these pathways by insulin (21Farese R. Cooper D.R. Konda T.S. Nair G. Standaert M.L. Davis J.S. Pollet R.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in this study, only short term effects of insulin were investigated, and no evidence of glycerol 3-P accumulation was found. In the current study, we show that long term incubation with insulin raises GlK activity and glycerol 3-P accumulation, suggesting a regulatory role of GlK.To evaluate the precise role of the glycerol phosphorylation step in control of glycerol uptake and metabolism, muscle cells were engineered to overexpress the GlK gene from Escherichia coli. There is a 50% sequence identity between the GlK proteins of E. coliand humans with regions of 100% identity (10Sargent C.A. Young C. Marsh S. Ferguson-Smith M.A. Affara N.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We show that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GlK in muscle cells unveils a glycerol concentration-dependent increase in glycerol phosphate levels that is not apparent in control cells. This result implies that glycerol transport in muscle cells is very high and that phosphorylation is rate-limiting. This is compatible with the fact that glycerol concentrations are very high in muscle interstitial fluid, suggesting high efflux from TAG hydrolysis and limited reuptake (1Maggs D.G. Jacob R. Rife F. Lange R. Leone P. During M.J. Tamborlane W.V. Sherwin R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The increased capacity for glycerol phosphorylation in AdCMV-GlK-treated cells was reflected in a large increase in the incorporation of glycerol into cellular lipids as long as fatty acids (oleate) were also provided. This result demonstrates that all of the other enzymes required for lipid esterification are present at high levels in muscle cells. This is in contrast to other cell types with low GlK activity such as pancreatic islet β-cells in which the overexpression of GlK led to a minor increase in incorporation of glycerol into lipids (12Noel R.J. Antinozzi P.A. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18621-18627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).An intriguing finding of our study is that muscle cells treated with AdCMV-GlK also exhibit an enhanced capacity to metabolize glycerol to glycogen or lactate. This indicates that glycerol 3-P formed from glycerol is transformed into dihydroxyacetone phosphate through the reaction catalyzed by the cytosolic or mitochondrial forms of glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase, both of which are highly expressed in skeletal muscle (22Koza R.A. Kozack U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate then can enter the glycolytic or gluconeogenic pathway for conversion to lactate or to form glucose moieties that may be incorporated into glycogen, respectively. Importantly, glycerol incorporation into glycogen was doubled in GlK-overexpressing cells in which the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, glycogen synthase, was activated by overexpression of PTG (18Lerı́n C. Montell E. Berman H.K. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39991-39995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of GlK in muscle cells allows glycerol to be utilized in much the same fashion as it is in normal liver cells with the exception that muscle cells do not produce free glucose from gluconeogenesis as liver cells do. It has long been suspected that glycogenesis in muscle is fueled by substrates others than glucose, especially in the postexercise period. Lactate, which accumulates in muscle, is one of the proposed substrates (23Bangsbo J. Gollnick P.D. Graham T.E. Saltin B. J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 423-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Donovan C.M. Pagliassotti M.J. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 2000; 32: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in vivo the glyconeogenic utilization of lactate has been found to be negligible in type I fibers, whereas it is a primary pathway in type II fibers (24Donovan C.M. Pagliassotti M.J. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 2000; 32: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our data in cultured muscle show that lactate is not used as a glyconeogenic substrate; this may be because cultured muscle cells have a metabolic profile more similar to type I fibers due to the high expression of the GLUT1 transporter and low expression of glycogen-metabolizing enzymes (5Montell E. Turini M. Marotta M. Roberts M. Noé V. Ciudad C.J. Macé K. Gómez-Foix A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E229-E237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Baqué S. Montell E. Camps M. Guinovart J.J. Zorzano A. Gómez-Foix A.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although extrapolation to mature human skeletal muscle is inevitably speculative. On the other hand, we show that in muscle cells with high levels of functional GlK, glycerol may be incorporated into glycogen. Given the fact that freshly isolated muscle samples contain 4 times as much endogenous GlK than the cultured myocytes used in this study, glycogen synthesis from glycerol may be a physiologically relevant pathway for muscle glycogen storage in vivo, particularly in the postexercise period. In this situation, two events would converge. First, glycerol concentration will be high due to mobilization of intramuscular TAG (1Maggs D.G. Jacob R. Rife F. Lange R. Leone P. During M.J. Tamborlane W.V. Sherwin R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26Kiens B. Richter E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E332-E337PubMed Google Scholar). Second, glycogen synthase is maximally activated due to glycogen depletion (27Richter E.A. Garetto L.P. Goodman M.N. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E476-E482PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bak J.F. Pedersen O. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E957-E963PubMed Google Scholar). Further work will be necessary to demonstrate the potential use of glycerol for glycogen synthesis in muscle in vivo.In summary, we demonstrate that GlK activity is present in cultured human muscle cells. This enzyme is functional, is inducible by insulin, and enables muscle cells to incorporate glycerol into lipids. Moreover, overexpression of GlK reveals that this enzyme is the limiting step in muscle glycerol metabolism and that elevated glycerol 3-P can be diverted toward the glyconeogenic-glycolytic pathway leading to glycogen formation and lactate synthesis. Glycerol levels in human muscle interstitial fluid are much higher than plasma levels and approach the concentrations found in adipose tissue (1Maggs D.G. Jacob R. Rife F. Lange R. Leone P. During M.J. Tamborlane W.V. Sherwin R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2Samra J. Ravell C.L. Giles S.L. Arner P. Frayn K.N. Clin. Sci. 1996; 90: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This pool of glycerol may be important for synthesis of TAG1 in muscle. Importantly, recent studies have shown that intramuscular overstorage of TAG is closely correlated with muscle insulin resistance (3Boesch C. Slotboom J. Hoppeler H. Kreis R. Magn. Reson.

This is consistent with the finding of abundant GlK mRNA in liver, kidney, and testis in human and mouse and much lower transcript levels in muscle (10Sargent C.A. Young C. Marsh S.

It has been suggested that liver and muscle express different GlK genes based on the dissociation between deficiencies in liver and muscle GlK activity in human patients (9Seltzer W. Angelini C.

The current study was undertaken to evaluate the role of GlK in control of glycerol metabolism in muscle cells. While low rates of glycerol conversion to cellular products can be demonstrated in cultured human myocytes, these variables are only modestly affected by altering the medium glycerol concentration. However, overexpression of GlK in these cells caused large, glycerol concentration-dependent increases in accumulation of cellular lipids, glycogen, and lactate. Thus, these studies demonstrate that all of the enzymes required for glycerol utilization in several different pathways are abundantly expressed in muscle cells and that glycerol metabolism is controlled by the level of GlK. These findings provide a new perspective on the potential relevance of glycerol to muscle metabolism, particularly under catabolic circumstances where glycerol levels are elevated. DISCUSSIONBlood glycerol has been shown to be taken up by skeletal muscle and used as a precursor for intramuscular TAG synthesis in rats (7Guo Z. Jensen M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23702-23706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), reinforcing the notion that functional GlK is present in this tissue (8Newsholme E.A. Taylor K. Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the interpretation of the in vivo data was hampered by the fact that some of the infused glycerol may have been converted to glucose in the liver prior to its use as a substrate by muscle. In the present study, we have assessed the capacity of cultured human muscle cells to metabolize glycerol and have evaluated the potential rate-limiting role of GlK.Human muscle cells in culture exhibited very low GlK activity, the specific activity being 4 times lower than that detected in fresh rat gastrocnemius muscle tissue. Consistently, cultured cells did not accumulate significant amounts of glycerol 3-P in response to incubation with glycerol. Incubation with lactate, a putative glyceroneogenic substrate (20Watford M. Nutr. Rev. 2000; 58: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), did not raise glycerol 3-P, whereas glucose doubled its concentration. Nevertheless, in cells treated with [U-14C]glycerol, incorporation of radioactivity into both PL and TAG fractions was detected even in the presence of glucose, indicating that these cells are able to metabolize glycerol and use it for lipid synthesis at a low rate. Our data agree with a previous report showing incorporation of [3H]glycerol into PL and neutral lipids in BC3H-1 myocytes and enhancement of these pathways by insulin (21Farese R. Cooper D.R. Konda T.S. Nair G. Standaert M.L. Davis J.S. Pollet R.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in this study, only short term effects of insulin were investigated, and no evidence of glycerol 3-P accumulation was found. In the current study, we show that long term incubation with insulin raises GlK activity and glycerol 3-P accumulation, suggesting a regulatory role of GlK.To evaluate the precise role of the glycerol phosphorylation step in control of glycerol uptake and metabolism, muscle cells were engineered to overexpress the GlK gene from Escherichia coli. There is a 50% sequence identity between the GlK proteins of E. coliand humans with regions of 100% identity (10Sargent C.A. Young C. Marsh S. Ferguson-Smith M.A. Affara N.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We show that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GlK in muscle cells unveils a glycerol concentration-dependent increase in glycerol phosphate levels that is not apparent in control cells. This result implies that glycerol transport in muscle cells is very high and that phosphorylation is rate-limiting. This is compatible with the fact that glycerol concentrations are very high in muscle interstitial fluid, suggesting high efflux from TAG hydrolysis and limited reuptake (1Maggs D.G. Jacob R. Rife F. Lange R. Leone P. During M.J. Tamborlane W.V. Sherwin R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The increased capacity for glycerol phosphorylation in AdCMV-GlK-treated cells was reflected in a large increase in the incorporation of glycerol into cellular lipids as long as fatty acids (oleate) were also provided. This result demonstrates that all of the other enzymes required for lipid esterification are present at high levels in muscle cells. This is in contrast to other cell types with low GlK activity such as pancreatic islet β-cells in which the overexpression of GlK led to a minor increase in incorporation of glycerol into lipids (12Noel R.J. Antinozzi P.A. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18621-18627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).An intriguing finding of our study is that muscle cells treated with AdCMV-GlK also exhibit an enhanced capacity to metabolize glycerol to glycogen or lactate. This indicates that glycerol 3-P formed from glycerol is transformed into dihydroxyacetone phosphate through the reaction catalyzed by the cytosolic or mitochondrial forms of glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase, both of which are highly expressed in skeletal muscle (22Koza R.A. Kozack U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Dihydroxyacetone phosphate then can enter the glycolytic or gluconeogenic pathway for conversion to lactate or to form glucose moieties that may be incorporated into glycogen, respectively. Importantly, glycerol incorporation into glycogen was doubled in GlK-overexpressing cells in which the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, glycogen synthase, was activated by overexpression of PTG (18Lerı́n C. Montell E. Berman H.K. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39991-39995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of GlK in muscle cells allows glycerol to be utilized in much the same fashion as it is in normal liver cells with the exception that muscle cells do not produce free glucose from gluconeogenesis as liver cells do. It has long been suspected that glycogenesis in muscle is fueled by substrates others than glucose, especially in the postexercise period. Lactate, which accumulates in muscle, is one of the proposed substrates (23Bangsbo J. Gollnick P.D. Graham T.E. Saltin B. J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 423-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Donovan C.M. Pagliassotti M.J. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 2000; 32: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in vivo the glyconeogenic utilization of lactate has been found to be negligible in type I fibers, whereas it is a primary pathway in type II fibers (24Donovan C.M. Pagliassotti M.J. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 2000; 32: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our data in cultured muscle show that lactate is not used as a glyconeogenic substrate; this may be because cultured muscle cells have a metabolic profile more similar to type I fibers due to the high expression of the GLUT1 transporter and low expression of glycogen-metabolizing enzymes (5Montell E. Turini M. Marotta M. Roberts M. Noé V. Ciudad C.J. Macé K. Gómez-Foix A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E229-E237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Baqué S. Montell E. Camps M. Guinovart J.J. Zorzano A. Gómez-Foix A.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although extrapolation to mature human skeletal muscle is inevitably speculative. On the other hand, we show that in muscle cells with high levels of functional GlK, glycerol may be incorporated into glycogen. Given the fact that freshly isolated muscle samples contain 4 times as much endogenous GlK than the cultured myocytes used in this study, glycogen synthesis from glycerol may be a physiologically relevant pathway for muscle glycogen storage in vivo, particularly in the postexercise period. In this situation, two events would converge. First, glycerol concentration will be high due to mobilization of intramuscular TAG (1Maggs D.G. Jacob R. Rife F. Lange R. Leone P. During M.J. Tamborlane W.V. Sherwin R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26Kiens B. Richter E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E332-E337PubMed Google Scholar). Second, glycogen synthase is maximally activated due to glycogen depletion (27Richter E.A. Garetto L.P. Goodman M.N. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E476-E482PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bak J.F. Pedersen O. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E957-E963PubMed Google Scholar). Further work will be necessary to demonstrate the potential use of glycerol for glycogen synthesis in muscle in vivo.In summary, we demonstrate that GlK activity is present in cultured human muscle cells. This enzyme is functional, is inducible by insulin, and enables muscle cells to incorporate glycerol into lipids. Moreover, overexpression of GlK reveals that this enzyme is the limiting step in muscle glycerol metabolism and that elevated glycerol 3-P can be diverted toward the glyconeogenic-glycolytic pathway leading to glycogen formation and lactate synthesis. Blood glycerol has been shown to be taken up by skeletal muscle and used as a precursor for intramuscular TAG synthesis in rats (7Guo Z. Jensen M.D. J. Biol.

Do such three-dimensional RNA structures form in vivo? We now observe formation of the internal loop/bulge (IL/B structure) in the IRE (iron-responsive element) of ferritin mRNA expressed in HeLa cells, using radical cleavage with Cu-phen (Cu-1,10-phenantholine), and protection of the loop/bulge by the regulatory protein (IRP), expressed by cotransfection. Cu-phen, a metal coordination complex (MC) selected because of binding and cleavage at the IL/B in solution, recognized the same site in mRNA in HeLa cells. Endogenous reductants apparently substituted for the sulfhydryl activation of Cu-phen cleavage in solution. Selective RNA IL/B recognition by Cu-phenin vivo is emphasized by resistance to cleavage of a mutated, IL/B IRE in ferritin mRNA. Development of small MCs even more selective than Cu-phen can exploit three-dimensional mRNA or viral RNA structures in vivo to manipulate RNA function. Formation in vivo of the IL/B in the ferritin IRE, which is associated in vitro with greater repression than single IRE structures in other mRNAs, likely contributes to larger derepression of ferritin synthesis in vivo triggered by signals for the IRE/IRP system.

HeLa cells (8 × 104 cells/well) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum for 16–18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 were incubated with plasmid DNA (1 μg/well), PLUS (Invitrogen) reagent (6 μl PLUS/well, and 4 μl of LipofectAMINETM/well) (Invitrogen) LipofectAMINETM, in six-well plates. To express high levels of IRP1 for “footprinting” on the IRE, HeLa cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding ferritin and IRP1 as described for RNA expression, except the cells (1 × 106 cells/plate) were plated in a 10-cm plate the day before transfection and cotransfected with 1.5 μg of pcDNA3.1-Del-1DV/Myc-His (+) ferritin mRNA and 5.0 μg of pcDNA3.1-Del-IRP1/Myc-His(+) or with pcDNA3.1/Myc-His/LacZ plasmid DNA encoding β-galactosidase in the LacZ sequence, as a control for cotransfection (cotransfection frequency (β-galactosidase) ∼20%). 48 h after transfection and 1 h of culture in prewarmed Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), Cu-phen was added (to 225 μm) for 30 min. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, collected by scraping, and washed one time with phosphate-buffered saline; cell pellets were frozen at −80 °C. Cell survival (trypan blue exclusion), ∼60% with Cu-phen, was likely diminished because of cutting tRNA. (Survivals should increase in the future with identification and use of more specific MCs.) Total RNA, isolated with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and precipitated with ethanol, was the template for 32P-labeled cDNA synthesized with a labeled primer, bound 40 nucleotides downstream from the ferritin IRE.

A. 1991; 88: 4166-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Sites of Cu-phen binding/cleavage were identified by the increase in shorter cDNA fragments (11Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Wang Y.-H. Sczekan S.R. Theil E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and quantitated by a PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics) with ImageQuant software. RNA dissolved in water, and stored at −80 °C until use, was heated at 65 °C for 3 min, quickly cooled to 25 °C, and reacted in 25 mm Hepes·Na, pH 7.2, 40 mm KCl, 18 μm Cu-phen, and 0.05% mercaptopropionic acid (to reduce copper); after 5 min at 25 °C, 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline was added to 7 mm as a “quench,” with the same cDNA analysis used with RNA isolated from HeLa cells. Cu-phen sites in the IRE of ferritin mRNA in HeLa cells are the same as an IRE 30-mer or in poly(A)+ RNA folded in solution. Deletion of a single nucleotide, U6 (see Figs. 1 and 2E), changed the IRE structure in ferritin mRNA in solution and prevented Cu-phen binding (11Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The ferritin IRE (Fer-IRE) structure was selected for the study of mRNA structure in vivo (in cultured HeLa cells), because the IL/B of the Fer-IRE contributes to selectivity of regulatory protein binding in solution (10Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, Cu-phen binds selectively in solution, discriminating between the IL/B and a C-bulge (11Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). High IRE structural specificity in solution is also indicated by the specific MC site that is blocked by magnesium and is conformationally sensitive to protons (9Gdaniec Z. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Wang Y.-H. Sczekan S.R. Theil E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cu-phen has the added advantage of being relatively hydrophobic and should cross cell membranes. HeLa cells were chosen for the study because they display the IRE-mRNA regulation typical of many cell types (17Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). When Cu-phen was added to cultures of HeLa cells in which ferritin mRNA was expressed at high levels from a transfected plasmid in HeLa cells, the IRE was recognized and cleaved by Cu-phen (Figs. 1B and 2, Aand C). Cu-phen cut the RNA at the IL/B, showing that the mRNA folded in vivo with the same specific IL/B structure of the Fer-IRE observed in solution by NMR spectroscopy and by nuclease probing (9Gdaniec Z. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, the results show that the Cu-phen was able to enter cells and recognize specific RNA sites. IRE context in the mRNA was important for IL/B formation in HeLa cells, since the IRE inserted upstream from β-galactosidase sequences did not form the IL/B in vivo. Cleavage of RNA in HeLa cells was the same whether or not exogenous reductants were added, indicating the availability of endogenous reductants (13Carmel-Harel O. Storz G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 439-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In solution, Cu-phen cleavage of RNA requires the addition of a reductant (4Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9097-9105Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Sites of Cu-phen binding (mRNA cleavage) in the IRE were determined by reverse transcriptase run-off using cleaved mRNA recovered from the treated cells as the template, and a primer binding near the IRE (Fig. 2). cDNA fragments were separated in DNA sequencing gels calibrated with cDNAs synthesized from intact mRNA and mixtures of deoxy- and dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (see Refs. 11Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 12Wang Y.-H. Sczekan S.R. Theil E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar as examples). The background reaction, due to reverse transcriptase pausing, is ∼4 times lower than reverse transcriptase run-off from RNA fragments produced by Cu-phen cleavage. Several sites outside the IL/B of the ferritin IRE were Cu-phen binding sites in HeLa cells, but not in the in vitro transcripts of the ferritin mRNA, such as residue −13 (Fig. 2C) at the end of the IRE-flanking region helix. Cu-phen recognizes the −13 site not only in ferritin mRNA transcripts in HeLa cells, but also in natural ferritin mRNA (poly(A)+) that was synthesized in frog reticulocytes of the embryonic (tadpole) lineage, but analyzed in vitro with specific primers (11Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Harrell C.M. McKenzie A.R. Patino M.M. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4166-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Such mRNAs likely differ from in vitrotranscripts in the structure of the cap, which suggests that the cap structure influences the conformation of the ferritin IRE flanking region. Previous structure/function links observed between the mRNA cap and the ferritin IRE are conserved length, conserved sequences, and regulatory effects of altering the distance between the cap or mutating conserved bases flanking the IRE (11Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6235-6242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Dix D.J. Lin P.-N. McKenzie A.R. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Mol.

Selectivity of Cu-phen for the IL/B structure of the Fer-IRE in vivo was illustrated by the resistance of mutant ferritin mRNA, Fer-IRE Δ U6, to Cu-phen cleavage. Deletion of a single IL/B nucleotide (Fer-IRE Δ U6, Fig. 2E), converted the IL/B to a C-bulge found in other mRNAs with isoIREs, such asm-aconitase and the transferrin receptor (1Theil E.C. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40659-40662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Resistance of Fer-IRE Δ U6 mRNA to Cu-phen cleavage in HeLa cells (Fig. 2,B and D) illustrates the specificity of IRE folding in vivo as well as structural selectivity of Cu-phenin vivo. IRP1, an IRE-binding protein expressed from a cotransfected plasmid, protected the IL/B (G26, G27) in ferritin mRNA from Cu-phen cleavage in vivo (HeLa cells) (Fig.3). IRP1, expressed in HeLa cells, was characterized in cell extracts by immunoreactivity and RNA binding of an IRE (Fig. 3B). IRP1 was selected because of greater stability in vivo (19Guo B. Brown F.M. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16529-16535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding both ferritin mRNA and IRP1, Cu-Phen activity at the IL/B decreased to the background level of G7 (Fig. 3C). An earlier study using permeabilized cells, and a large protein nuclease (RNase T1) (21Bertrand E. Fromont-Racine M. Pictet R. Grange T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3496-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was limited to demonstrating IRP protection of a protruding residue, G16, in the hairpin loop at the tip of the IRE terminal loop and could not, in contrast to Cu-phen, report on tertiary structures such as the internal loop/bulge within the middle of the IRE helix. When β-galactosidase protein was expressed, rather than the IRE-binding protein IRP1, no protection of the IL/B occurred, and G26 and G27 were cleaved by Cu-phen added to the cells (Fig.3D). Such results demonstrate the specificity of IRP binding and the IRP “footprint” over the IL/B in vivo. Observation of the mRNA-specific IL/B in ferritin IRE in vivo (Figs. 2 and 3), using the MC reporter Cu-phen, confirms the tertiary structure of the mRNA element observed in solution (9Gdaniec Z. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Ke Y. Sierzputowska-Gracz H. Gdaniec Z. Theil E.C.

Specificity of IRE structure in each mRNA is the basis for the natural combinatorial mRNA regulation displayed by the IRE/IRP system (1Theil E.C. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40659-40662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the future, combinatorial chemical synthesis can improve selectivity and recognition of control structures such as the IRE (1Theil E.C. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40659-40662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), AU-rich elements (22Chen C.U. Shy A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar), and internal ribosome entry sites (23Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) so that RNA structure may be further studied and possibly manipulatedin vivo. (Note that since Cu-phen is an “off-the-shelf” reagent, despite its IRE-IL/B selectivity, Cu-phen also cleaves tRNA (4Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9097-9105Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and a site at the base of the BIV-tar element, inserted into β-galactosidase mRNA in HeLa cells.) 2E. Theil, unpublished observations. Targeting three-dimensional mRNA structure in vivocomplements the manipulations of three-dimensional protein structure in cells, a common strategy for understanding protein function or for developing medical therapies. RNA targeting shares high cell specificity with proteins, but has the added advantage of lower copy number and target size. Understanding RNA function in vivo is only one potential use of MCs targeted to specific RNAs. Inactivation of viral mRNAs or prophylactic ferritin synthesis for protection from iron toxicity are other possible uses of MCs. The selectivity of targeting IRE structure with small molecules is matched by the natural selectivity of IRP/IRE interactions in different mRNAs. For example, the iron induction of proteins encoded in different IRE-mRNAs had quantitatively different responses to iron in the same tissue of whole animals (2Chen O.S. Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Schalinske K.L. Chen O.S. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3740-3746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Induction of ferritin synthesis, for example, was much greater than m-aconitase synthesis. (Effects of iron on m-aconitase regulation were small enough to have gone unnoticed until the IRE sequence was detected, whereas mRNA regulation of ferritin had been known long before the RNA sequence was determined (25Shull G.E.

Chem. 1983; 258: 7921-7923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) The differences between the iron-responses of ferritin and m-aconitase mRNA in vivowere attributed in part to the behavior of the IL/B in the ferritin IRE in solution and cell-free protein synthesis (10Ke Y.

https://openalex.org/W2004433366,"Considerable controversy remains as to the functional and structural properties of the asymmetric alpha1beta1 half-oxygenated intermediate of human hemoglobin, consisting of a deoxygenated and an oxygenated dimer. A recent dimer-tetramer equilibrium study using [Zn(II)/Fe(II)-O(2)] hybrid hemoglobins, in which Zn-protoporphyrin IX mimics a deoxyheme, showed that the key intermediate, [alpha(Fe-O(2))beta(Fe-O(2))][alpha(Zn)beta(Zn)], exhibited an enhanced tetramer stability relative to the other doubly oxygenated species. This is one of the strongest findings in support of distinctly favorable intra-dimer cooperativity within the tetramer. However, we present here a different conclusion drawn from direct O(2) binding experiments for the same asymmetric hybrid, [alpha(Fe)beta(Fe)][alpha(Zn)beta(Zn)], and those for [alpha(Fe)beta(Zn)](2) and [alpha(Zn)beta(Fe)](2). In this study, the O(2) equilibrium curves for [alpha(Fe)beta(Fe)][alpha(Zn)beta(Zn)] were determined by an O(2)-jump stopped-flow technique to circumvent the problem of dimer rearrangement, and those for [alpha(Fe)beta(Zn)]( 2) and [alpha(Zn)beta(Fe)]( 2) were measured by using an Imai apparatus. It was shown that the first and second O(2) equilibrium constants for [alpha(Fe)beta(Fe)][alpha(Zn)beta(Zn)] are 0.0209 mmHg(-1) and 0.0276 mmHg(-1), respectively, that are almost identical to those for [alpha(Fe)beta(Zn)](2) or [alpha(Zn)beta(Fe)](2). Therefore, we did not observe large difference among the asymmetric and symmetric hybrids. The discrepancy between the present and previous studies is mainly due to previously observed negative cooperativity for [alpha(Fe)beta(Zn)](2) and [alpha(Zn)beta(Fe)](2), which is not the case in our direct O(2) binding study."

Previous studies have identified Gly47 and Gly51 as possible hinge points in the structure of the protein, allowing backbone segments around the chromophore to undergo large concerted motions. We have designed, crystallized, and solved the structures of three mutants: G47S, G51S, and G47S/G51S. The protein dynamics of these mutants are significantly affected. Transitions in the photocycle, measured with laser induced transient absorption spectroscopy, show rates up to 6-fold different from the wild type protein and show an additive effect in the double mutant. Compared with the native structure, no significant conformational differences were observed in the structures of the mutant proteins. We conclude that the structural and dynamic integrity of the region around these mutations is of crucial importance to the photocycle and suggest that the hinge-bending properties of Gly51 may also play a role in PAS domain proteins where it is one of the few conserved residues.

At room temperature, in concert with this flipping, the vinyl bond of the chromophore isomerizes from trans to cis, leading to an ∼60 ° rotation of the aromatic ring of the chromophore (4Perman B.

For PYP in solution, formation of the blue-shifted intermediate pB involves a significant conformational transition, which has the characteristics of a (partial) protein unfolding event, as reported by UV/visible and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and 1H-NMR analyses (17van Brederode M.E.

These latter observations hint at the presumed signaling function of PYP, which ultimately should result in a negative phototactic response of the bacterium. This presumably happens via a signal transduction pathway, components of which should detect a conformational change in PYP. Thus, in summary, the pG-pR transition in the photocycle represents the structural changes of the chromophore as a result of photon absorption, whereas the pR-pB transition represents the structural adaptation of the protein to the altered conformation of the chromophore.To study the possible protein motions involved in the photocycle, PYP dynamics have been investigated by computer simulation (20van Aalten D.M.F.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), also pointed to a few glycines that were hinge points, which appeared to allow sub-structures in the protein to fluctuate with respect to each other. Interestingly, two of these glycines, Gly47 and Gly51, fall within the PAS fold (22Lagarias D.M., Wu, S.-H. Lagarias J.C. Plant Mol.

Sci. 1997; 22: 331-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). They have been shown to be involved in sensing of signals as part of signal transduction systems, as well as transcriptional activation (25Zhulin I.B. Taylor B.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 331-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A recent study on the sequence similarities between PYP and PAS domains identified PYP as a possible prototype for the PAS fold (26Pellequer J.-L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Most of the strongest sequence conservation is concentrated between residues 29 and 68 (22, 23, 26). This conservation is dominated by prolines and glycines (together ∼6 residues out of 15 conserved residues). Thus, apart from their proposed role in the PYP photocycle (20van Aalten D.M.F. Hoff W.D. Findlay J.B.C. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the conserved glycines could be important for the structure and/or conformational flexibility of the PAS domain.Here, we investigate the role of the glycines at position 47 and 51 in the PYP photocycle and PAS domain function, using a multi-disciplinary approach. We describe the x-ray crystallographic structures and photocycle kinetics of the PYP mutants G47S, G51S, and G47S/G51S, which were designed to rigidify the mobile 48–53 region. The structures show no significant conformational changes, yet have significantly altered photocycle kinetics.DISCUSSIONPrevious analyses of protein conformational flexibility with computational techniques have indicated a key role for (conserved) glycine residues (40van Aalten D.M.F.

Because of their unrestricted φ,ψ backbone torsion angles, they can act as pivotal points in the structure, allowing backbone segments to move relative to each other. In an earlier study toward the function of a conserved glycine in the cellular retinol-binding protein, it was found that mutation to a serine resulted in significantly altered retinol binding properties and inhibition of backbone motions (41van Aalten D.M.F. Findlay J.B.C. Amadei A. Berendsen H.J.C. Protein. Eng. 1995; 8: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 44van Aalten D.M.F. Jones P.C. de Sousa M. Findlay J.B.C. Prot. Eng. 1997; 10: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a similar study on thermolysin, mutation of conserved glycines involved in a hinge-bending motion resulted in a decrease in catalytic activity (40van Aalten D.M.F. Amadei A. Linssen A.B.M. Eijsink V.G.H. Vriend G. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins. 1995; 22: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 45Veltman O.R. Eijsink V.G.H. Vriend G. de Kreij A. Venema G. van den Burg B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hinge-bending glycines were also identified from a molecular dynamics simulation of PYP (20van Aalten D.M.F. Hoff W.D. Findlay J.B.C. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), supported by subsequent analysis of crystallographic and NMR structures (21van Aalten D.M.F. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. Joshua-Tor L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Computer simulations alone, however, do not necessarily provide an accurate description of the real protein dynamics. They merely provide a model that can be tested experimentally. Here, we test the role of the proposed hinge-bending glycine residues by mutagenesis together with spectroscopic analyses and by direct comparison of the simulated dynamics with the conformational changes seen in the experimental structures.Glycines 47 and 51 are located in a region of the protein that is close to the chromophore and is known to be mobile in the crystal structures (2Borgstahl G.E.O. Williams D.R. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6278-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This region is also mobile in computer simulations (20van Aalten D.M.F. Hoff W.D. Findlay J.B.C. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21van Aalten D.M.F. Crielaard W. Hellingwerf K.J. Joshua-Tor L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with the short helices α3 and α4 showing a hinge-bending motion with respect to each other and the chromophore. The Cα atoms of both glycines are solvent-exposed. A mutation to serine would result in a conformationally restricted backbone, while not significantly altering the local structure. If these mutations indeed rigidify the local backbone and if the flexibility of this area is an important aspect of PYP dynamics, significant effects on the spectroscopically measured photocycle kinetics should be observed with a clear additive component in a mutant with both Gly−Ser substitutions.Some small conformational changes were observed in the structures of PYP47, PYP51, and PYP47+51, compared with WTPYP, which are due to the different crystal packing contacts in the 47–61 region. In the context of these altered crystal contacts, the conformational change for PYP47 is noteworthy, as the backbone immediately surrounding the mutation itself is hardly altered (Figs. 3 and 4), yet a shift is observed around residue 54. The serine substitution at position 51 results in a small change of backbone conformation for this residue (Fig. 4), producing some conformational change of the neighboring backbone (Figs.3 and 4). The double mutation, however, results in a conformation relatively close to WTPYP (and has the same crystal contacts as WTPYP).The spectroscopic data show that the mutations have indeed affected the dynamics of the protein (Table III). Although the pB-pG transition is slowed down with a clear additive effect for the PYP47+51 double mutant, the pR-pB transition appears to occur faster in the mutants than in native PYP (also with an additive effect). If the backbone segment around the mutations is rigidified, one would expect the pR−pB and pB−pG transitions both to be slower. The faster pR−pB transition may be due to strain in the backbone, introduced by the mutations. This can be understood by inspection of the Ramachandran plots, which show that introduction of a serine instead of a glycine at position 51 results in unfavorable backbone torsion angles (Fig. 4). The strain thus introduced in the backbone may be released in the pR-pB transition (when the protein is known to undergo a major conformational change (17van Brederode M.E.

Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), thereby lowering the free energy of this transition in the mutant structures compared with the native structure.One of the glycines studied here, Gly51, is part of the sequence signature of the PAS domains, of which PYP was proposed to be a structural prototype (26Pellequer J.-L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Arg52, next to Gly51 in PYP, is in contact with the chromophore and has been shown to change position in the later stages of the photocycle (4Perman B. Srajer V. Ren Z. Teng T. Pradervand C. Ursby T. Bourgeois D. Schotte F. Wulff M. Kort R. Hellingwerf K. Moffat K. Science. 1998; 279: 1946-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In many other PAS domains, this Arg52 is substituted for a tyrosine, which is proposed to point into a binding pocket (26Pellequer J.-L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In analogy to what we observe here for PYP, we propose that a flexible Gly51 may also play a key role in PAS domain dynamics, which would then suggest that in all these structurally similar signal transduction modules, biological activity is mediated via the conserved intrinsic functional dynamical properties.

Nature. 1998; 392: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Initially, light absorption induces a flipping of the carbonyl group of the chromophore thioester linkage. At room temperature, in concert with this flipping, the vinyl bond of the chromophore isomerizes from trans to cis, leading to an ∼60 ° rotation of the aromatic ring of the chromophore (4Perman B.

Because of their unrestricted φ,ψ backbone torsion angles, they can act as pivotal points in the structure, allowing backbone segments to move relative to each other. In an earlier study toward the function of a conserved glycine in the cellular retinol-binding protein, it was found that mutation to a serine resulted in significantly altered retinol binding properties and inhibition of backbone motions (41van Aalten D.M.F.

In a similar study on thermolysin, mutation of conserved glycines involved in a hinge-bending motion resulted in a decrease in catalytic activity (40van Aalten D.M.F. Amadei A. Linssen A.B.M.

Computer simulations alone, however, do not necessarily provide an accurate description of the real protein dynamics. They merely provide a model that can be tested experimentally. Here, we test the role of the proposed hinge-bending glycine residues by mutagenesis together with spectroscopic analyses and by direct comparison of the simulated dynamics with the conformational changes seen in the experimental structures.Glycines 47 and 51 are located in a region of the protein that is close to the chromophore and is known to be mobile in the crystal structures (2Borgstahl G.E.O. Williams D.R. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6278-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This region is also mobile in computer simulations (20van Aalten D.M.F. Hoff W.D.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with the short helices α3 and α4 showing a hinge-bending motion with respect to each other and the chromophore. The Cα atoms of both glycines are solvent-exposed. A mutation to serine would result in a conformationally restricted backbone, while not significantly altering the local structure. If these mutations indeed rigidify the local backbone and if the flexibility of this area is an important aspect of PYP dynamics, significant effects on the spectroscopically measured photocycle kinetics should be observed with a clear additive component in a mutant with both Gly−Ser substitutions.Some small conformational changes were observed in the structures of PYP47, PYP51, and PYP47+51, compared with WTPYP, which are due to the different crystal packing contacts in the 47–61 region. In the context of these altered crystal contacts, the conformational change for PYP47 is noteworthy, as the backbone immediately surrounding the mutation itself is hardly altered (Figs. 3 and 4), yet a shift is observed around residue 54. The serine substitution at position 51 results in a small change of backbone conformation for this residue (Fig. 4), producing some conformational change of the neighboring backbone (Figs.3 and 4). The double mutation, however, results in a conformation relatively close to WTPYP (and has the same crystal contacts as WTPYP).The spectroscopic data show that the mutations have indeed affected the dynamics of the protein (Table III). Although the pB-pG transition is slowed down with a clear additive effect for the PYP47+51 double mutant, the pR-pB transition appears to occur faster in the mutants than in native PYP (also with an additive effect). If the backbone segment around the mutations is rigidified, one would expect the pR−pB and pB−pG transitions both to be slower. The faster pR−pB transition may be due to strain in the backbone, introduced by the mutations. This can be understood by inspection of the Ramachandran plots, which show that introduction of a serine instead of a glycine at position 51 results in unfavorable backbone torsion angles (Fig. 4). The strain thus introduced in the backbone may be released in the pR-pB transition (when the protein is known to undergo a major conformational change (17van Brederode M.E.

C., Roosild, T., and Choe, S. (2000) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 4, 456–461; Doyle, D. A., Morais Cabral, J., Pfuetzner, R. A., Kuo, A., Gulbis, J. M., Cohen, S. L., Chait, B. T., and MacKinnon, R.

TOK1, a potassium channel identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was the first described member from a growing new family of potassium channels with two pore domains in tandem (2P) (Ketchum, K. A., Joiner, W. J., Sellers, A. J., Kaczmarek, L. K., and Goldstein, S. A. (1995)Nature 376, 690–695). In an attempt to understand the relative contribution of each one of the 2P from TOK1 to the functional properties of this channel, we split and expressed the pore domains separately or in combination. Expression of the two domains separately rescued a potassium transport-deficient yeast mutant, suggesting that each domain forms functional potassium-permeable channels in yeast. InXenopus laevis oocytes expression of each pore domain resulted in the appearance of unique inwardly rectifying cationic channels with novel gating and pharmacological properties. Both pore domains were poorly selective to potassium; however, upon co-expression they partially restored TOK1 channel selectivity. The single channel conductance was different in both pore domains with 7 ± 1 (n = 12) and 15 ± 2 (n = 12) picosiemens for the first and second domain, respectively. In light of the known structure of the Streptomyces lividans KcsA potassium channel pore (see Doyle et al. above), these results suggest a novel non-four-fold-symmetric architecture for 2P potassium-selective channels.

Potassium channels play key roles in the physiology of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In many cells, potassium channels are responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential and for the modulation of firing properties in excitable cells (4Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 115-139Google Scholar). The exceptionally diverse functional properties of potassium channels are matched by a large number of genes identified over the last few years (5Coetzee W.A. Amarillo Y. Chiu J. Chow A. Lau D.

Despite the structural diversity, all these channels have a common feature consisting of a single pore-forming domain, which is essential for ion conduction and selectivity (1Biggin P.C. Roosild T.

Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5684) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that all these potassium channels aggregate as tetramers to form a functional channel, leaving the pore at the axis of a four-fold symmetry (1Biggin P.C. Roosild T. Choe S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 4: 456-461Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar).Recently a new family of potassium channels characterized by the presence of two pore-forming domains in tandem (2P) has been identified (3Ketchum K.A.

Wei A. Butler A. Salkoff L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 286-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These new potassium channels have either four (2P/4TM) or eight (2P/8TM) transmembrane segments and are highly conserved throughout evolution (7Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 3: 175-184Crossref Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 11Garcia E. Scanlon M. Naranjo D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 4: 141-157Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 8: 4266-4273Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recent experimental evidence suggests that this family of potassium channels probably dimerizes to form functional channels (8Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, the sequences of both selectivity filters of 2P channels are different, thus they are expected to make potassium-selective pores without the regular four-fold symmetry, but the functional significance of having two different pore-forming domains remains largely unknown.TOK1 was the first member identified from the 2P family of potassium channels (3Ketchum K.A. Joiner W.J. Sellers A.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Goldstein S.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This is the only member from this family possessing eight TM (2P/8TM). The arrangement of the putative TM and the 2P in TOK1 results in a structure that resembles a six TM Shaker-like channel attached to an inward rectifier-like channel. This potassium channel may be important for the maintenance of membrane voltage in yeast, which is essential for nutrient uptake and turgor regulation (10Bertl A. Bihler H. Reid J.D. Kettner C. Slayman C.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Despite over 60 genes identified so far encoding 2P potassium channels, very little is known about the functional significance of having two pore-forming domains in tandem. In an attempt to determine the role of each one of the two pore-forming domains in this new family of potassium channels, we divided TOK1 at the intracellular linker between the sixth and seventh TM to produce two structures that resemble single pore domain channels, one with 6TM and the other with 2TM, each one with its respective pore-forming domain.The results presented here indicate that each construct can form functional potassium channels in yeast and Xenopus laevisoocytes showing poor ionic selectivity and novel gating and pharmacological properties. Co-expression of both constructs partially restored wild type TOK1 channel properties. Given the proposed pore structure for 1P potassium channels based on the crystal structure of the KcsA potassium channel (2Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5684) Google Scholar), these results suggest a novel non-four-fold-symmetric architecture to attain potassium-selective pores.DISCUSSIONWe have divided a 2P potassium channel with eight TM to produce two constructs that resemble single pore potassium channels, one with two TM resembling a Kir-like inward rectifier potassium channel and the other with six TM resembling an outward rectifier of the Kv family of potassium channels.Expression of the two domains separately overcame the potassium auxotrophy in the potassium transport-deficient yeast double mutant Δtrk1,Δtrk2. Furthermore, experiments measuring potassium uptake with a potassium-selective electrode showed a clear phenotype in the Δtrk1,Δtrk2 double mutant, consisting in a reduced potassium uptake compared with that in wild type yeast. This phenotype was rescued by transforming the double mutant with plasmids containing wild type TOK1, TOK1A, or TOK1B separately.Electrophysiology experiments performed with X. laevisoocytes injected with TOK1A and TOK1B mRNA showed the appearance of inwardly rectifying, hyperpolarization-activated cationic currents not present in oocytes injected with mRNA from the human type II bradykinin receptor or in water-injected oocytes. Similar cationic currents were also observed in CHO and HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the cDNA from TOK1B.Although it is possible that TOK1A and TOK1B (which share limited amino acid homology and are structurally very different) may be activators of cationic channels in yeast, oocytes, rodent, and human cells, we believe this hypothesis is less likely than that in which both constructs (which have the general features found in 1P potassium channels) may indeed produce functional cationic channels.Intersubunit interactions of the 2P from TOK1 may account for the differences in selectivity and single channel conductance observed between the wild type channel and both constructs (TOK1A and TOK1B). In this regard, it is worth mentioning that even when the amount of mRNA injected in the TOK1AB experiments was the same as that injected for TOK1A or TOK1B separately the amplitude of current produced by the co-injection was one-third of that obtained with the individual injection of the constructs.This observation is particularly important for two reasons. 1) If TOK1A and TOK1B are activators of endogenous channels, one would expect equivalent current amplitudes in the co-injection experiments and not less current as we have observed. This observation further supports the hypothesis that TOK1A and TOK1B may produce functional cationic channels; and 2) these observations suggest that some tetrameric combinations might result in nonfunctional or nonconducting channels. Homotetramers of TOK1A or TOK1B and the heterotetramer TOK1AB result in functional channels; however, it is possible that heterotetramerization of three TOK1A plus one TOK1B or vice versa may result in nonfunctional channels. Ongoing experiments with TOK1A and TOK1B constructs cloned in tandem may help to elucidate this point.If TOK1A and TOK1B are indeed producing cationic channels with similar properties, these results are particularly striking given the structural differences in both constructs (2TM versus 6TM), which may suggest that the pore domain (the only conserved sequence between them) might be the structure responsible for these functional properties. Considering that the individual expression of TOK1A and TOK1B results in channels with poor selectivity for potassium ions whereas TOK1AB and wild type TOK1 produced potassium-selective channels, one might speculate that the spatial rearrangement of the two pores from both constructs to form wild type TOK1 may provide a non-four-fold-symmetric potassium-selective architecture. This architecture contrasts with the proposed four-fold-symmetric architecture for 1P potassium-selective channels based on the crystal structure of the Streptomyces lividans KcsA potassium channel (2Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5684) Google Scholar).In this regard, recent experimental evidence obtained with tandem constructs (dimers) of the 1P potassium channel Drk1 suggests that mutations that alter the symmetry of the pore domain result in changes in selectivity, gating, and single channel conductance in the mutant dimers (27Chapman M.L. Krovetz H.S. VanDongen A.M. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).TOK1 is an outwardly rectifying potassium channel. Single channel openings are rarely observed in the hyperpolarized direction (3Ketchum K.A. Joiner W.J. Sellers A.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Goldstein S.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). These properties are the opposite of what we have observed with the expression of TOK1A and TOK1B. The strong inward rectification observed in TOK1A and TOK1B may result from the voltage dependence properties of both channels since single channels open scarcely at voltages approaching the reversal potential and no discernible opening events were observed in the outward direction.In the family of inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels, the unifying hypothesis to explain inward rectification proposes that the blockade by magnesium and/or polyamines produced by the depolarization is sufficient to account for the inward rectification in many members from this family (28Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). One cannot discard at the present time a similar mechanism involved in the strong rectification observed with TOK1A and TOK1B.Alternatively, the voltage dependence and gating differences observed between wild type TOK1 and the constructs (TOK1A and TOK1B) might be the result of a different spatial arrangement of the pore architecture. We do not have a definitive explanation at the present time to account for these differences.The structure of TOK1 resembles a six transmembrane domain Shaker-like channel attached to an inward rectifier-like channel, therefore the finding that separating the two pore-forming domains from TOK1 results in the appearance of potassium-permeable channels with novel selectivity, single channel conductance, and gating properties is very provocative.If indeed TOK1A and TOK1B produce functional channels (as suggested by the evidence in yeast, oocytes, and mammalian cells presented here) then these new channels may provide an excellent experimental tool to explore structural determinants of ionic selectivity, gating, and voltage dependence in 2P potassium channels and may help to understand the functional role of the sequence variations in the 2P found in this growing family of channels. Future experiments splitting the two pores from other 2P potassium channels may provide additional information about the non-four-fold-symmetric architecture of 2P potassium-selective channels. Potassium channels play key roles in the physiology of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In many cells, potassium channels are responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential and for the modulation of firing properties in excitable cells (4Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 115-139Google Scholar). The exceptionally diverse functional properties of potassium channels are matched by a large number of genes identified over the last few years (5Coetzee W.A. Amarillo Y. Chiu J. Chow A. Lau D. McCormack T. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Ozaita A. Pountney D. Saganich M. Vega-Saenz de Miera E. Rudy B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 233-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Genome sequencing and molecular cloning has allowed the identification of a significant number of potassium channels possessing two and six transmembrane domains (TM) 1The abbreviations used are:TMtransmembrane domain(s)2Ptwo pore domains in tandem1Pone pore domainP1first poreP2second poreHOMOPIPEShomopiperazine-N,N′-bis-2-(ethanesulfonic acid)MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidCHOChinese hamster ovaryHEKhuman embryonic kidneypFpicofarads 1The abbreviations used are:TMtransmembrane domain(s)2Ptwo pore domains in tandem1Pone pore domainP1first poreP2second poreHOMOPIPEShomopiperazine-N,N′-bis-2-(ethanesulfonic acid)MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidCHOChinese hamster ovaryHEKhuman embryonic kidneypFpicofarads (5Coetzee W.A.

Despite the structural diversity, all these channels have a common feature consisting of a single pore-forming domain, which is essential for ion conduction and selectivity (1Biggin P.C. Roosild T. Choe S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 4: 456-461Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5684) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that all these potassium channels aggregate as tetramers to form a functional channel, leaving the pore at the axis of a four-fold symmetry (1Biggin P.C. Roosild T. Choe S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 4: 456-461Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6MacKinnon R.

Wei A. Butler A. Salkoff L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 286-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These new potassium channels have either four (2P/4TM) or eight (2P/8TM) transmembrane segments and are highly conserved throughout evolution (7Goldstein S.A. Bockenhauer D. O'Kelly I. Zilberberg N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 3: 175-184Crossref Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 11Garcia E. Scanlon M. Naranjo D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 4: 141-157Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 8: 4266-4273Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recent experimental evidence suggests that this family of potassium channels probably dimerizes to form functional channels (8Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, the sequences of both selectivity filters of 2P channels are different, thus they are expected to make potassium-selective pores without the regular four-fold symmetry, but the functional significance of having two different pore-forming domains remains largely unknown. TOK1 was the first member identified from the 2P family of potassium channels (3Ketchum K.A. Joiner W.J. Sellers A.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Goldstein S.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This is the only member from this family possessing eight TM (2P/8TM). The arrangement of the putative TM and the 2P in TOK1 results in a structure that resembles a six TM Shaker-like channel attached to an inward rectifier-like channel. This potassium channel may be important for the maintenance of membrane voltage in yeast, which is essential for nutrient uptake and turgor regulation (10Bertl A. Bihler H. Reid J.D. Kettner C. Slayman C.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite over 60 genes identified so far encoding 2P potassium channels, very little is known about the functional significance of having two pore-forming domains in tandem. In an attempt to determine the role of each one of the two pore-forming domains in this new family of potassium channels, we divided TOK1 at the intracellular linker between the sixth and seventh TM to produce two structures that resemble single pore domain channels, one with 6TM and the other with 2TM, each one with its respective pore-forming domain. The results presented here indicate that each construct can form functional potassium channels in yeast and Xenopus laevisoocytes showing poor ionic selectivity and novel gating and pharmacological properties. Co-expression of both constructs partially restored wild type TOK1 channel properties. Given the proposed pore structure for 1P potassium channels based on the crystal structure of the KcsA potassium channel (2Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5684) Google Scholar), these results suggest a novel non-four-fold-symmetric architecture to attain potassium-selective pores. DISCUSSIONWe have divided a 2P potassium channel with eight TM to produce two constructs that resemble single pore potassium channels, one with two TM resembling a Kir-like inward rectifier potassium channel and the other with six TM resembling an outward rectifier of the Kv family of potassium channels.Expression of the two domains separately overcame the potassium auxotrophy in the potassium transport-deficient yeast double mutant Δtrk1,Δtrk2. Furthermore, experiments measuring potassium uptake with a potassium-selective electrode showed a clear phenotype in the Δtrk1,Δtrk2 double mutant, consisting in a reduced potassium uptake compared with that in wild type yeast. This phenotype was rescued by transforming the double mutant with plasmids containing wild type TOK1, TOK1A, or TOK1B separately.Electrophysiology experiments performed with X. laevisoocytes injected with TOK1A and TOK1B mRNA showed the appearance of inwardly rectifying, hyperpolarization-activated cationic currents not present in oocytes injected with mRNA from the human type II bradykinin receptor or in water-injected oocytes. Similar cationic currents were also observed in CHO and HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the cDNA from TOK1B.Although it is possible that TOK1A and TOK1B (which share limited amino acid homology and are structurally very different) may be activators of cationic channels in yeast, oocytes, rodent, and human cells, we believe this hypothesis is less likely than that in which both constructs (which have the general features found in 1P potassium channels) may indeed produce functional cationic channels.Intersubunit interactions of the 2P from TOK1 may account for the differences in selectivity and single channel conductance observed between the wild type channel and both constructs (TOK1A and TOK1B). In this regard, it is worth mentioning that even when the amount of mRNA injected in the TOK1AB experiments was the same as that injected for TOK1A or TOK1B separately the amplitude of current produced by the co-injection was one-third of that obtained with the individual injection of the constructs.This observation is particularly important for two reasons. 1) If TOK1A and TOK1B are activators of endogenous channels, one would expect equivalent current amplitudes in the co-injection experiments and not less current as we have observed. This observation further supports the hypothesis that TOK1A and TOK1B may produce functional cationic channels; and 2) these observations suggest that some tetrameric combinations might result in nonfunctional or nonconducting channels. Homotetramers of TOK1A or TOK1B and the heterotetramer TOK1AB result in functional channels; however, it is possible that heterotetramerization of three TOK1A plus one TOK1B or vice versa may result in nonfunctional channels. Ongoing experiments with TOK1A and TOK1B constructs cloned in tandem may help to elucidate this point.If TOK1A and TOK1B are indeed producing cationic channels with similar properties, these results are particularly striking given the structural differences in both constructs (2TM versus 6TM), which may suggest that the pore domain (the only conserved sequence between them) might be the structure responsible for these functional properties.
