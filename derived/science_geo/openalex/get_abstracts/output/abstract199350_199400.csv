Dips in an audiogram are not uncommon; but the difference observed pointed to an uncommonly sharp change of sensitivity. Further tests revealed other equally sharp fluctuations in this observer's audiogram. Eventually a systematic exploration of the right-ear thresholds of this and one other observer was undertaken. Thresholds were measured at 10-cycle intervals over the range 400–3,000 c./s."

https://openalex.org/W2044234138,"EVER since Mirsky1 suggested that the bleaching of rhodopsin by light involves the reversible denaturation of its protein moiety, opsin, analogies have been drawn between bleaching and denaturation of the visual pigments. This notion derives its strongest experimental support from the apparent agreement between the minimum size of quantum required to bleach frog or cattle rhodopsin with light2 (48,500 cal./mole) and the Arrhenius activation energy (E
a) for the thermal bleaching of frog rhodopsin3 (44,000 cal./mole). We find that this analogy breaks down on closer examination, and that light and heat bleach rhodopsin by different mechanisms, yielding different products."

https://openalex.org/W2060353083,"IT has recently been reported that ionizing radiations produce local stimulation of growth of hair in the rabbit1. Subsequent to this observation, the stimulating effect of some nitrogen mustard derivatives was recorded2, and it was suggested that “It should be of interest to determine whether the observed effects can be obtained with other radiomimetic agents or carcinogenic substances”."

https://openalex.org/W2069264162,"THE iron atom in hæm compounds has its six covalences directed toward the six corners of an octahedron; there are four co-planar bonds with the porphyrin nitrogen atoms and one bond on each side of the plane of the porphyrin. The only possible plane of symmetry in such molecules is the plane of the porphyrin; the iron must constitute a centre of asymmetry if one of two requirements is satisfied: (1) different groups are linked to iron on the two sides of the porphyrin plane or (2) groups co-ordinated to iron are also attached to porphyrin side-chains, thus forming chelate rings."
https://openalex.org/W1980595580,"ORGANISMS of the Aerobacter–Klebsiella group have been divided1 into many serologically distinct types each of which produces its own type-specific polysaccharide. Only a few of the structures of these polysaccharides have been elucidated2–4 since in general they are of a highly complex nature. Recently we isolated an acidic polysaccharide (4.45 gm.) from the culture medium (38.4 1.) of Aerobacter aerogenes N.C.T.C. 8172 (Klebsiella type 64). The bacteria were grown both in batches and in continuous culture in an apparatus of the type described by Elsworth, Meakin, Pirt and Capell5. A peptone–glucose medium was used, the culture was aerated, the pH 5.0 and the temperature, 37°. The acidic polysaccharide was freed from neutral polysaccharide by precipitation with ‘Cetavlon’6 and from nucleic acid by the preferential solubility of its cetyl trimethyl ammonium salt in 0.25 M sodium chloride. Isolated as its sodium salt, the acidic polysaccharide had C, 45.31; H, 6.19; N, 0.81; P, 0.11 per cent and its ultra-violet absorption at 260 mµ corresponded to about 1.8 per cent nucleic acid impurity. The polysaccharide contained 28.7 per cent uronic acid (by decarboxylation7) and the infra-red spectra of the polysaccharide as the free acid and as the sodium salt confirmed the presence of carboxylic acid groups8. The polysaccharide showed [α]17 D + 29.4° (conc. 0.272 in M sodium chloride)."

https://openalex.org/W2076913228,"SEVERAL authors have tried to induce sex inversion in Lebistes reticulatus experimentally by the use of sex hormones. Berkowitz1 found that a high percentage of males treated from birth with œstrogenic substances developed ovotestes. The expected result with androgenic hormones would be the production of ovotestes in treated females. Treating young from birth, for a period of two to three months, Eversole2 and Gallien3 arrived separately at the same conclusion: that pregneninolone causes the ovaries to undergo a considerable regression, but that they always keep their female structure. Gallien added that after the cessation of treatment the ovaries returned to normal."

Some physico-chemical and functional properties of these pigments have been described2–4. In this communication we report the amino-acid composition of Thunnus thynnus hæmoglobin, as determined by chromatography on an ion-exchange resin: a slightly modified version5 of the method of Moore and Stein."
https://openalex.org/W1973957788,"IT is well known that the presence of oxygen during the irradiation of biological materials by X- or gamma-rays usually increases the amount of radiation damage. At the cellular level a considerable amount of quantitative data exists on the effect of oxygen, given during irradiation, on the yield of chromosome aberrations1, but little information is available concerning the influence of oxygen on the amount of mitotic inhibition. Early work on the fall in mitotic index values of broad bean root tips2 and the more recent studies on mitotic rates of Chortophaga neuroblasts3 and Tradescantia microspores4 have all indicated that the degree of mitotic inhibition is dependent on the amount of oxygen present during irradiation."

https://openalex.org/W2045885842,"IT has been suggested1 that the T2-phage infection first induces the formation of new protein in bacteria before the appearance of phage deoxyribonucleic acid and phage-antigenic protein. Quite recently, however, we have made the important additional discovery that the phage infection also induces a synthesis of new ribonucleic acid, or at least a specific change in its metabolism, and that the formation of this special ribonucleic acid is independent of the prior formation of new protein. These facts suggest that the T2-infection first induces the synthesis of new protein via the formation of new ribonucleic acid or the metabolism of this acid."

https://openalex.org/W2003295192,"A SUBSTANCE giving a typical blue colour with the phospho-tungstate–phospho-molybdate reagent of Folin and Ciocalteu1 was found to accumulate in cultures of Thiobacillus thioparus and T. thiocyanoxidans growing in a medium containing thiosulphate. The component in question was not associated with the bacterial cells since it remained in the supernatant fluid of cultures centrifuged at high speeds. The possibility suggested itself that the material involved was an oxidation product of thiosulphate, possibly tetrathionate or one of the other polythionates. These compounds have been reported to be intermediate oxidation products of thiosulphate by the Thiobacilli

https://openalex.org/W2054644116,"ALBERT1 has suggested that xanthopterin would be found in higher amounts in neoplastic tissues than in normal. In anticipation of confirming this by direct experiment, we have analysed for their pterin content, normal kidney tissue of the golden hamster and transplantable neoplasms in the golden hamster, derived from stilbœstrol-induced renal tumours2. No xanthopterin could be found. The largest amount of tissue used was 1 gm. of normal tissue and 8 gm. of neoplastic tissue, and the smallest amount of xanthopterin that could be detected by the paper chromatographic technique used was 0.l µgm."

https://openalex.org/W4232200707,"OBSERVATIONS on the action of cobalt compounds on living organisms revealed that this is to some extent similar to that of histamine. Therefore, as mast cells may produce and/or store histamine and histamine-like substances attached to heparin molecules, it was of interest to see if the cells examined were influenced by cobalt compounds. These were given intraperitoneally to white mice in a single dose of 100 mgm. cobalt/kgm. body-weight, in the form of cobalt nitrate, acetate and chloride. Another series of mice received 5 mgm. cobalt/kgm. in the same salts daily for 3 weeks. Specimens of the skin were fixed and stained by a modified Nowak and Zahl stain1."
https://openalex.org/W1985533033,"IT is known that during the winter months some animals adjust themselves to unfavourable living conditions, particularly food shortage, by hibernation. This leads to a considerable lowering of the total metabolism and a drop in body temperature which enable the animals to survive the winter with a minimum consumption of nutrient."

https://openalex.org/W2029119200,THIS communication is concerned with structural or organizational variables which may affect the transmission of information. It deals with a study which was made of variations in the communication patterns of four light engineering factories carrying out the same work. The communication structures in these factories were considered from the point of view of the individuals whose work required them to make decisions or estimates from production information available to them.
https://openalex.org/W2010981606,THE reaction of ethylene diamine with epinephrine (and norepinephrine) leads to the formation of a highly fluorescent material which is used for the estimation of catechol amines in biological fluids according to a procedure first described by Weil-Malherbe and Bone1 and slightly modified by a number of other workers.

https://openalex.org/W2094515641,"ONE of the several functions of platelets is participation in the formation of plasma thromboplastin. Recently, we encountered in the blood of a patient an agent with the unprecedented action of specifically hindering this activity. Thus, the presence of his plasma or serum in the incubation mixture inhibited the generation of plasma thromboplastin1. Compared with a normal control (Table 1) the derangement, as estimated from the clotting time of the substrate, was more apparent on reducing the number of platelets (experiments B and C) and practically abolished on using a concentrated suspension (experiment D). Antihæmophilic globulin and Christmas factor levels2 were determined in the presence of excess platelets; normal results were obtained. The patient's platelets were fully active in the thromboplastin generation test. Pre-incubation of normal platelets with patient's plasma or serum did not cause further deterioration in the production of plasma thromboplastin, indicating that the inhibitor has a retarding but not a destructive action on the platelet thromboplastin component. Further study has shown that this inhibitor counteracts the combination of platelets with antihæmophilic globulin and Christmas factor; the activity of other blood-clotting factors or their intermediate products were uninfluenced."
