https://openalex.org/W1500700435,"A23187 is a carboxylic acid antibiotic which simultaneously uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and inhibits ATPase of rat liver mitochondria incubated in a magnesium-free medium. The antibiotic acts as a freely mobile carrier to transport calcium and magnesium, but not potassium, from an aqueous medium buffered at pH 7.4 into a bulk organic phase. A23187 causes a progressive release of endogenous magnesium and inorganic phosphate from mitochondria incubated with substrate, but little change in calcium or potassium content. If EDTA is added, A23187 severely depletes intramitochondrial calcium and magnesium in Release of State 4 succinate oxidation by A23187 is inhibited by lanthanum chloride, ruthenium red, ((ethylene bis)oxyethylene nitrilo)tetraacetic acid (EGTA), EDTA, MgCl2, and ATP. Inhibition by EGTA (or EDTA) of A23187′s uncoupling is reversed readily by calcium but not magnesium. In the presence of A23187 plus EGTA, mitochondria retain only 2 to 3 nmoles of Mg2+ per mg of protein but remain coupled and phosphorylate ADP at 80 to 85% of control rates with β-hydroxybutyrate or succinate as substrate. Under these conditions, coupled phosphorylation supported by glutamate, and ATP hydrolysis are severely depressed, but increasing concentrations of magnesium in the incubating medium prevent these inhibitions. It is proposed that a cyclic, energy-dissipating flux of mitochondrial calcium accounts for uncoupling by A23187, whereas inhibition of ATPase and glutamate oxidation and increased potassium permeability of mitochondria result from antibiotic-mediated magnesium efflux."
https://openalex.org/W1480115832,"The steady state kinetics of sodium and potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3) suggests an activating action of adenosine triphosphate in addition to its action as a phosphate donor. This action might be an acceleration of dissociation of K+ or its congeners from the enzyme. To test this possibility transient kinetics of the phosphoenzyme was investigated. In membranes from guinea pig kidney the enzyme was phosphorylated in the presence of magnesium ion and sodium ion with adenosine triphosphate which was radioactive in the terminal phosphate group. To this phosphoenzyme were added congeners of potassium ion, namely, rubidium ion or lithium ion at concentrations which produced an equal acceleration of dephosphorylation. At these same concentrations in the steady state, the level of dephosphoenzyme was higher in the presence of rubidium ion than in the presence of lithium ion. Rephosphorylation was relatively inhibited in the presence of rubidium ion. Rubidium ion appeared to combine with the phosphoenzyme, split off the phosphate group, and remain with the dephosphoenzyme in a relatively stable complex. This complex was isolated kinetically by addition of a high concentration of sodium ion with oligomycin. The isolated complex was less stable following an increase in the concentration of adenosine triphosphate. It was concluded that adenosine triphosphate was activating the enzyme in a fashion functionally distinct from its action as a phosphate donor, since adenosine triphosphate does not phosphorylate the enzyme in the presence of rubidium ion without sodium ion and since the concentration of adenosine triphosphate required for activation was much higher than that required for phosphorylation. The relatively stable complex of rubidium ion with the dephosphoenzyme was interpreted as evidence for a closed or occluded conformation of the active site for translocation of potassium ion across the membrane. Toxic agents altered this complex of the dephosphoenzyme; phlorizin increased and tetraphenyl boron decreased its stability. This kinetic mechanism provides an interpretation for a paradoxical feature in the p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity of this enzyme system."

https://openalex.org/W1495195805,"Procedures have been developed for purification of three of the four protein components usually found in skeletal muscle troponin preparations. These three components are the ones required for troponin activity, and an apparent functional property of each has been defined. TN-I with a molecular weight of 24,000 inhibits actomyosin ATPase activity both in the presence and absence of Ca++. TN-T, with a molecular weight of 37,000, interacts with tropomyosin as evidenced by the appearance of a new hypersharp peak when mixtures of the two proteins are examined in the analytical ultracentrifuge. TN-C, with a molecular weight of 20,000, was the only component which possesses high affinity Ca++ binding activity. The sulfhydryl groups of troponin are found only in TN-I and TN-C. TN-I and TN-T require salt for full solubility and both proteins show a strong tendency to aggregate. An attempt has been made to interpret results on troponin fractionation obtained in other laboratories in the light of the properties of our purified components."

https://openalex.org/W1577284422,"Abstract The (Na+ + K+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase from canine renal medulla is composed of lipids and of two polypeptide chains. The larger one has a molecular weight of 135,000, NH2-terminal glycine, and has a high content of non-polar amino acids. The smaller polypeptide chain has NH2-terminal alanine and it is a sialoglycoprotein. The two polypeptides are present in a mass ratio of 1.7:1 for the ratio of large to small chain. This mass ratio probably corresponds to a molar ratio of one large chain to two small chains. The two chains are close to one another in the purified enzyme because they can be covalently crosslinked by dimethyl suberimidate. Finally, the large polypeptide chain, which has all of the properties of a membrane-bound enzyme, is soluble in simple aqueous solvents in the absence of detergents and lipids, although it no longer has enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1650111929,"Abstract 1. Coupling factor 1 from spinach chloroplast dissolved in 7 m urea strongly inhibited the ATPase activity of the coupling factor. The inhibitor was identified with the smallest of the five subunits of the coupling factor. 2. The inhibitor was isolated as a pure protein and was estimated to have a molecular weight of 13,000. The amino acid composition was different from that of the inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPase. Mitochondrial inhibitor inhibited only mitochondrial ATPase; chloroplast inhibitor inhibited only chloroplast ATPase. 3. The chloroplast inhibitor is much more insoluble than the mitochondrial inhibitor and can be kept in solution only in the presence of urea or detergents. Like the mitochondrial inhibitor the chloroplast inhibitor is stable to heat but very sensitive to trypsin. 4. The greater hydrophobicity and affinity of the chloroplast inhibitor to the coupling factor helps to explain some of the physiological differences of energy transduction in mitochondria and chloroplasts and is responsible for the failure of previous attempts to isolate it."
https://openalex.org/W1606744035,"Abstract Vesicles formed from the soluble Ca++-dependent ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum and soybean phospholipids catalyzed a rapid uptake of Ca++. This uptake was very sensitive to ionophores for divalent cations, but resistant to ionophores for monovalent cations or to uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. Ca++ uptake was also inhibited by chlorpromazine. The reconstituted vesicles, as well as the soluble Ca++-ATPase, catalyzed a Ca++-dependent Pi-ATP exchange, which was sensitive to chlorpromazine."
https://openalex.org/W80499655,"Abstract An activated membrane state necessary for the active transport of certain amino acids, carbohydrates, and cations by Escherichia coli can be generated by either oxidative energy or phosphate bond energy. Membrane fragment vesicles from E. coli couple oxidative but not phosphate bond energy to the transport of proline. The vesicles show an O2-dependent transport yet lack measureable capacity for oxidative phosphorylation. Such transport is arsenate-resistant, consistent with the transport being independent of oxidative phosphorylation. Although vesicles possess ATPase activity, added ATP does not stimulate proline transport. With intact E. coli cells, incubation with high arsenate and low phosphate drastically lowers intracellular ATP and P-enolpyruvate levels in the presence or the absence of O2. Aerobic proline transport is uninhibited, but in contrast, anaerobic transport is sharply reduced. These results show that intact cells can use energy either from oxidations or from phosphorylations to drive active proline transport. Similarly, active accumulation of leucine, β-methylthiogalactoside, Rb+ (as a K+ analogue), and α-methylglucoside occurs aerobically in the presence of high arsenate. Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation block the use of energy for transport both from oxidations and from ATP, suggesting that a similar or identical energy-conserving membrane state is formed from either energy source. Transport of α-methyl glucoside by intact E. coli is only partially inhibited by the high arsenate-low phosphate incubation, and further, part of the transported sugar still appears intracellularly in the phosphorylated form. The glucose-6-P level remains high in presence of arsenate and this or other intracellular phosphate compounds may be involved in phosphorylation of the transported sugar by an unknown mechanism. Low concentrations of iodoacetate nearly completely block the α-methylglucoside transport with but little effect on the O2-driven proline transport."
https://openalex.org/W1533436380,"The heterogeneity of human plasma fibrinogen manifested as differences in solubility reflects the presence of early catabolic intermediates, which are more soluble, have a longer thrombin-clotting time, and are of a lower molecular weight than the parent material from which they are formed. In this study the S-sulfo subunits from fibrinogen fractions of low (I-4) and high (I-8 and I-9) solubility were compared. Separation of Aα, Bβ, and γ chains was achieved by gradient elution chromatography on CM-cellulose. The tryptic peptide maps were characteristic for each type of chain. The only observable differences were in the maps of Aα chains; in those of I-8 and I-9 a considerable number of spots were absent or reduced relative to I-4. NH2-terminal analyses of isolated chains before and after thrombin treatment showed the characteristic residues of the Aα, Bβ, and γ chains, respectively. Thus the NH2-terminal portions of all chains of I-4, I-8, and I-9 were intact. Molecular weight estimation of subunit chains was made by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate under conditions in which differences in mobility due to the presence or absence of A or B peptides were distinguishable. Electrophoresis in this medium before and after reptilase or thrombin treatment served for identification of the chains. The γ chains moved as a single band in this system (molecular weight, 50,700) and were indistinguishable from one another; the same was true of Bβ chains (molecular weight, 60,400). However, electrophoresis of Aα chains revealed the presence of 13 more-or-less distinct bands (numbered in order of increasing anodal mobility), of which all but two (Band 3, a Bβ contaminant and Band 5, a γ chain contaminant) were shown to be intact Aα chain or COOH-terminally degraded Aα remnants. The molecular weights ranged from that of intact Aα chain (70,900) to 15,400 (Band 13). The highest proportion of intact Aα chains was in I-4; the lowest was in I-9, which had virtually no detectable intact Aα chain. Conversely, I-9 contained the highest proportion of Aα remnant chains; I-4, the lowest. These data suggested that cleavage at any or all of at least 10 sites along the Aα chain resulted in the formation of early catabolic intermediates. Comparisons with highly clottable derivative fractions I-8D and I-9D produced by plasmin treatment of I-4 in vitro showed that they were quite similar to their respective plasma counterparts (I-8 and I-9) in that the γ and Bβ chains appeared to be intact, but few or no intact Aα chains were present. These observations thus strengthen the notion that it is plasmin which catalyzes the formation of early intermediates in vivo. Examination of Fragment ‘X', another fibrinogen derivative produced by plasmin digestion, revealed considerable depletion of intact Bβ as well as of Aα chains, indicating that Fragment ‘X' was more extensively degraded than I-8D or I-9D."
https://openalex.org/W1560079607,"Abstract 1. The subunits of coupling factor 1 from spinach chloroplasts have been isolated and their amino acid composition determined. 2. Antibodies to each subunit have been prepared and their effects on reactions involving coupling factor 1 have been studied. Antibodies against the 59,000 and 37,000 molecular weight subunits (α and γ components) inhibited cyclic photophosphorylation, phosphorylation coupled to the Hill reaction, and light-triggered Mg++-adenosine triphosphatase. Anti-α also inhibited the stimulation of H+ uptake in chloroplasts by ATP. 3. Antibodies against the two larger subunits (α and β) agglutinated chloroplast particles; the antibodies against the smaller subunits did not. 4. None of the antibodies against the subunits inhibited the ATPase activity of activated chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1) significantly when added singly. However, a combination of anti-α and anti-γ inhibited to the same extent as antibody against native CF1. 5. It is concluded that the α and γ subunits of CF1 are intimately involved in the function of the coupling factor. The e subunit is a regulatory subunit of the enzyme and the question is raised whether δ is also a regulatory subunit or a tightly bound contaminant of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1561660923,"Abstract The isolated subunits of beef heart mitochondrial ATPase were characterized with regard to physical and chemical properties. Three subunits, molecular weight 54,000, 50,000, and 33,000, respectively, constituted 93% of the protein of the oligomer. The remainder of the molecule consisted of two subunits of molecular weight 17,300 and 5,700. The latter peptide (Subunit 5) was identified by physical criteria with the ATPase inhibitor of Pullman and Monroy (Pullman, M. E., and Monroy, G. (1963) J. Biol. Chem. 238, 3762–3769). Subunit 5 was a basic protein (pI = 10.4) which was removed from the ATPase in the form of a mixture of monomer (5,700) and dimer (11,350). Conversion of the dimer to the monomer was dependent on the presence of agents capable of reducing disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1605412913,"Abstract A renal plasma membrane fraction has been prepared by homogenization and differential centrifugation in an isotonic sucrose solution in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate. Sedimentation in a continuous sucrose density gradient yielded a fraction that showed a striking decrease in specific activity of marker enzymes for endoplasmic reticulum and brush border, but a 2.7-fold increase in the specific activity of Na-K-ATPase. The specific activity of the mitochondrial marker, succinic cytochrome c reductase, was similar to that in the crude homogenate. The purified membrane fraction contained adenylate cyclase activity sensitive to parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, vasopressin, and isoproterenol. Only the isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity was inhibited by propranolol (10-5 m). Each of the three peptide-sensitive adenylate cyclase activities could be characterized by a specific anatomic distribution. The adenylate cyclase responses to the three peptide hormones showed partial additivity. The purified plasma membranes bound 125I-calcitonin (salmon), and this binding was blocked by unlabeled salmon calcitonin but not by adrenocorticotropic hormone or growth hormone. The membranes degraded 125I-salmon calcitonin to forms that were not precipitable with trichloroacetic acid and did not bind to fresh membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1615454623,"Abstract Conditions are reported under which purified coupling factor 1 from spinach chloroplasts, suitably activated, exhibited Mg++-dependent ATPase activity at rates of about 15 µmoles of Pi released per mg of protein per min. The presence of a carboxylic acid and proper MgCl2 concentrations were the main factors determining the rate of hydrolysis. At pH 6, with 8 mm MgCl2, sodium maleate accelerated the Mg++ATPase activity of coupling factor 1 up to 30-fold. At pH 8, 2 mm MgCl2 was optimal and bicarbonate was more effective than maleate as an activator. Higher concentrations of MgCl2 inhibited the reaction. A monospecific antibody against coupling factor 1 inhibited both the Mg++- and the Ca++-dependent ATPase activities. The specificity for triphosphonucleotides was similar for the two reactions. The Km of the Mg++ATPase for ATP was 0.1 mm at pH 6 with 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid buffer and 1.1 mm with maleate buffer. It is concluded that carboxylic acids increase the Vmax by removing inhibitory products of the reaction. From the mode of inhibition by ADP, existence of at least two active sites acting cooperatively, is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2067075854,"After systemic administration of several serotonergic antagonists, female rats that had been ovariectomized, adrenalectomized, and estrogen-primed showed lordotic responding. Lordosis could also be elicited after direct placement of serotonergic receptor blockers into hypothalamic sites known to contain serotonergic terminals. None of the treatments activated the soliciting component of the estrous behavior pattern of the female rat. It is postulated that the hypothalamus contains serotonergic terminals which suppress lordotic responding."
https://openalex.org/W1531532159,"Abstract Some properties of a protein precipitable with Ca2+ from solubilized fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum are described. It appears to contain the sites involved in the low affinity binding of Ca2+ to the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The molecular weight of the homogeneous protein determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate is 55,000. In the presence of 0.1 m KCl the protein binds 41 moles of Ca2+ per mole with an association constant 750 m-1. Mg2+ reduces Ca2+ binding. Ca2+ or Mg2+, in the presence of 0.1 m KCl, produces a substantial increase in tryptophan fluorescence, whereas KCl (0.1 m) alone has no effect on fluorescence. In contrast, 0.1 m KCl causes a significant increase in the circular dichroic peak at 222 nm, and addition of Ca2+ or Mg2+ has little further effect. Thus, changes in fluorescence can be produced without a major change in the conformation of the peptide backbone. The relation of this protein to calsequestrin is discussed."

Phosphorylation by nonactivated and activated phosphorylase kinase occurs at equal rates with a ratio of activity at pH 6.8 to 8.2 of 0.7. Measurements suggest that 1 mole of phosphate per mole of TNI is bound after phosphorylation by phosphorylase kinase. Troponin, as isolated, contains endogenous protein-bound phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1581848564,"The mode of polymerization of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase has been investigated at 10° over a protein concentration range of 0.4 to 20 mg per ml in phosphate buffer at pH 6 and pH 8 and at a single concentration of 5 mg per ml in the region of pH 6 to 8. At pH 8 the data suggest that there are several forms of the active enzyme of molecular weight about 360,000 which differ markedly in their mode of polymerization. At least two of these forms have been separated on this basis. One form polymerizes rapidly and reversibly to higher molecular weight forms in what may be an indefinite manner. A second form may polymerize to a dimer of the active enzyme while a third form appears not to undergo any polymerization. At pH 6 and at the lowest protein concentrations studied here the enzyme exists as an inactive form of about 160,000 molecular weight. This species can also polymerize, although in a very different manner than the enzyme at pH 8. At very high enzyme concentrations, the pH 6 material, which presumably represents a protonated species of the enzyme, polymerizes to an active enzyme of which the molecular weight is 360,000 or greater. Between pH 6 and 8 the sedimentation behavior reflects the distribution of enzyme in the protonated (pH 6) and the deprotonated (pH 8) forms."
https://openalex.org/W1525255901,"Abstract The distribution of phosphofructokinase isozymes in rabbit tissues was analyzed by electrophoretic and immunochemical techniques. Antisera to the enzyme purified from skeletal muscle and to enzyme purified from liver were prepared. The antiserum to muscle phosphofructokinase showed a partial reaction with the liver enzyme, whereas little cross-reaction was observed with antiserum to liver phosphofructo-kinase toward the muscle enzyme. Skeletal muscle extracts and heart extracts contain a single identical isozyme species. It is proposed that this isozyme be designated phosphofructokinase A. The major isozyme species of liver and erythrocyte are also identical (phosphofructokinase B). All other tissues examined contain isozymes that include both A and B monomers. Extracts of lung, adipose tissue, and stomach contain a complete set of five A-B hybrids. Other tissues appear to contain isozymes that have A and B monomers, but both electrophoresis and antiserum precipitation data indicate that at least one other isozyme is present. This is most obvious in extracts of brain tissue. Electrophoresis of extracts of brain produces at least four activity bands of mobility intermediate between those observed following electrophoresis of isozymes A and B. One of these bands of activity was not removed by treatment with a combination of both antisera while a similar treatment of A-B hybrids removed all activity. The residual activity is designated phosphofructokinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1569538559,"Abstract Homogeneous mitochondrial ATPase from rat liver binds ADP in a rapidly reversible manner. The enzyme-bound ADP can be recovered quantitatively as ADP. In the absence of Mg2+, the enzyme exhibits 0.88 binding sites for ADP per enzyme molecule with an intrinsic dissociation constant of 0.94 µm. In the presence of Mg2+, the enzyme loses 90% of its ATPase activity but does not lose the ability to bind ADP. Short term binding experiments detect 0.65 binding sites per enzyme molecule with an intrinsic dissociation constant of 2.1 µm. The Km (ADP) for oxidative phosphorylation catalyzed by purified inner membrane vesicles, in which mitochondrial ATPase is located on the outer surface of the membrane directly available to added ADP, was found to be 3.8 µm. Aurovertin, a potent inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, inhibits binding of ADP by mitochondrial ATPase in the absence of Mg2+ in a manner similar to its inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. In the presence of Mg2+, however, binding is enhanced by aurovertin. Taken together, the results show that the binding of ADP by soluble mitochondrial ATPase has important properties in common with the interaction of ADP with the functional oxidative phosphorylation system."
https://openalex.org/W1508051888,"Abstract A lysine-carnitine precursor-product relationship was envisaged. To test this hypothesis a series of isotopic labeling experiments was conducted with Neurospora crassa lysine auxotrophs. Following growth of such mutants on a simple defined medium lacking carnitine but supplemented with variously labeled test carnitine precursors, biosynthesized carnitine was subsequently isolated from the mold mycelium by ion exchange chromatography and examined for radioactivity. Radioactivity from dl-[6-14C]lysine and dl-[4,5-3H]-lysine was incorporated into carnitine without dilution of specific activity, whereas radioactivity from dl-[1-14C]lysine and dl-[2-14C]lysine was not found in biosynthesized carnitine in significant amounts. In an experiment employing [e-15N]lysine, it was demonstrated that the e-N atom of lysine becomes the nitrogen atom of carnitine; there was some exchange of the [e-15N]amino group of lysine with 14N in the medium during carnitine synthesis. e-N-[methyl-3H]Trimethyl-l-lysine was incorporated in high yield (16 and 19%) into carnitine; and, as expected [methyl-3H]methionine also labeled carnitine, but with markedly less efficiency (0.23%) consistent with dilution by endogenous methionine. [1-14C]γ-Butyrobetaine (4-N-trimethylamino [1-14C]butyric acid), but not (4-amino[1-14C]butyric acid), was readily utilized (9.4%) for carnitine formation, in agreement with its established role as a carnitine precursor in animals. From these and other considerations it is postulated that in Neurospora the biogenesis of carnitine derives from the amino acids lysine and methionine in which either free or bound lysine is successively methylated to give e-N-trimethyllysine which is then cleaved in a series of as yet unknown transformations to lose carbon atoms 1 and 2 yielding γ-butyro-betaine. The latter compound is then hydroxylated at the β position to give carnitine as previously shown by other workers in the field."
https://openalex.org/W1524408385,"Abstract Cathepsin D has been purified approximately 900-fold from two types of cartilage: elastic cartilage of young rabbit ears and hyaline cartilage from the legs of 12- to 13-day-old chick embryos. Cathepsin D accounts for most of the hemoglobin-digesting activity of chick cartilage; rabbit ear cartilage also contains a sulfhydryl-dependent acid cathepsin. The identification of the acid proteolytic activity of the cartilages as cathepsin D is based on the specificity of cleavage of the B chain of insulin. The molecular weight of the two enzymes, as estimated by molecular sieving, is about 40,000 to 43,000. The two cartilage enzymes and cathepsin D from bovine uterus all digested the protein-polysaccharide complex of bovine nasal cartilage at pH 5. The digestion could be followed viscosimetrically and it obeyed a second order kinetic expression. The protein-polysaccharide complex was completely degraded to fragments that were larger than single chains of chondroitin sulfate. Digestion at pH 5 was inhibited by e-aminocaproate and arginine (0.1 m), chloroquine and 3-indolepyruvate (0.02 m), and pepstatin (2 x 10-7 m). Activity curves were measured as a function of pH; all three preparations of cathepsin D digested protein-polysaccharide complex optimally at pH 4. On comparing one hemoglobin-digesting unit of each enzyme, it was found that the cathepsin D from bovine uterus digested protein-polysaccharide complex twice as rapidly as the rabbit ear enzyme and 5 times as rapidly as the chick cartilage enzyme. At pH 7.2 digestion of protein-polysaccharide complex was quite variable, the chick preparation was completely inactive, and the other preparations had variable activities that were not in proportion to their hemoglobin-digesting activity. It was finally shown that cathepsin D is completely inactive at pH 7.2 and that protein-polysaccharide complex digestion at this pH is due to the action of a contaminant neutral protease."
https://openalex.org/W1555204842,"Abstract N-(4'-Amino-n-butyl)-3-aminoacetylstrophanthidin is a potent inhibitor of the (Na+ + K+)-adenosine triphosphatase, with a dissociation constant two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the parent compound, strophanthidin. The kinetics of inhibition of this new compound is qualitatively similar to that of strophanthidin. The difference in free energy of binding of the new inhibitor to the form of the enzyme present at saturating concentrations of sodium and MgATP and no potassium and the form present at saturating concentrations of potassium and MgATP and no sodium has been calculated. A kinetic titration of the cardiac glycoside binding sites of several preparations of the enzyme demonstrates that there is one cardiac glycoside binding site for each molecule of the polypeptide chain which is phosphorylated during turnover of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1960643350,"Abstract Estimates of initial binding rates for [3H]ouabain interaction with (Na+ + K+)-ATPase were obtained in the presence of ATP, magnesium, sodium, and potassium by using short assay times at 30°. The reactions were terminated by the rapid addition of excess unlabeled ouabain; this did not appear to displace bound [3H]ouabain during subsequent treatment of the suspensions (prior to assay). Initial binding rates were directly proportional to drug concentrations between 0.2 and 2.0 µm [3H]ouabain (30°). When assays were carried out for longer periods in the presence of at least 0.2 µm [3H]ouabain, the rates adhered to pseudo-first order kinetics. Maximal (i.e. at infinite sodium concentration) second order rate constants were 2.2 x 104 s-1 m-1 at 30° and 4.3 x 104 s-1 m-1 at 37°. Hill analyses (plots) for sodium (constant potassium), potassium (constant sodium) and sodium plus potassium (sodium/potassium = 10) activation of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase suggested that ouabain increased the dissociation constant (K0.5) for potassium but had no effect on K0.5 for sodium. Changes in K0.5 for sodium plus potassium activation were less than for potassium, which suggested that sodium modulates ouabain-potassium antagonism during turnover of the enzyme. In the presence of ATP and magnesium, sodium increased and potassium decreased the rate of [3H]ouabain interaction. Kinetic analyses of [3H]ouabain binding rates suggested that sodium and potassium compete for a common site; dissociation constants for sodium and potassium at 37° were 13.7 mm and 0.213 mm, respectively. This relationship predicted the sensitivity (i.e. in terms of inhibition of enzyme activity) of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase to ouabain in the presence of MgCl2, Tris-ATP, and various sodium and potassium concentrations. The relationship did not apply at sodium concentrations less than 10 mm in the presence of 10 mm potassium, which suggested that the validity of the model requires interaction of other cation-binding sites with sodium. The competitive relationship between sodium and potassium may modulate cardiac glycoside interaction with (Na+ + K+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1598101055,"Abstract The epithelial cells from mammary glands of mature virgin mice synthesize increasing levels of casein and α-lactalbumin when cultured in the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin. When DNA synthesis is blocked in these cultures by the addition of cytosine arabinoside or 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, augmented milk-protein production does not occur. The effects of cytosine arabinoside are prevented by simultaneous addition of deoxycytidine. Neither cytosine arabinoside nor 5-fluorodeoxyuridine have a postmitotic inhibitory effect on casein or α-lactalbumin synthesis. The insulin-induced increase in the combined activities of the intracellular proteins glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and gluconate-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is not affected by either inhibitor. Such a necessary coupling of secretory protein production to DNA synthesis or or both no longer exists in explants from midpregnant mice. Most of the epithelial cells of this tissue have already undergone their critical mitosis in vivo."

Activities of (Na(+),K(+))- and Ca(2+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatases of the sarcolemma are increased, but not the Mg(2+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase. The altered sterol composition of the sarcolemma may cause this type of myotonia by decreasing the chloride conductance of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1596291059,"Abstract In the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, fructose 6-phosphate kinases from porcine liver and kidney and a variety of other sources: (a) precipitate at low ammonium sulfate concentrations (0 to 30 mm); (b) are completely soluble at slightly higher concentrations (g100 mm); and (c) do not precipitate at low (0 to 30 mm) ammonium sulfate concentrations if fructose-6-P is present or if Mg2+ is absent and 1 mm ATP is present. Although substrate effects on enzymes are well known, the precipitation-solubilization effects just described are, in many respects, novel. These properties also form the basis for a new, rapid and highly specific method for complete purification of porcine liver and kidney phosphofructokinases, as well as substantial purification of other phosphofructokinases. Porcine liver phosphofructokinase was purified 16,000-fold to homogeneity (specific activity = 100) with a 25% yield in only 8 hours. No conventional salt fractionation or column chromatography is required. The key step is repeated selective precipitation and dissolution of the enzyme by simply changing the concentration of ammonium sulfate in the solution. In contrast to conventional ammonium sulfate fractionation, the enzyme is precipitated and dissolved at lower and higher ionic strengths, respectively. The enzyme has a low isoelectric point (pI = 5). Metaboliteinduced structural transitions are also detectable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the absence of metabolites, the enzyme does not penetrate 4.2% polyacrylamide gels but in the presence of fructose-6-P or ATP or ADP, it does."
https://openalex.org/W1492245099,"Abstract Energy charge responses of yeast hexokinase, rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, soluble rat brain hexokinase, and rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase were observed. Several additional factors that were shown to influence markedly the sensitivity of these enzyme responses to the adenylate energy charge include pH, total adenylate concentration, levels of non-adenylate reaction products, and non-adenine nucleotides. Computed response curves also indicated that the value of the adenylate kinase mass action ratio can also affect enzyme responses to the energy charge. Other simulations suggest that there is no apparent theoretical basis for energy charge stabilization in the range of 0.75 to 0.90. Finally, it is suggested that in vitro energy charge responses may be quite misleading, depending upon the relative influence of a number of experimentally adjusted factors."
https://openalex.org/W1509079853,"Abstract Two slightly lysine-rich histones (Fractions C-3 and C-4) have been isolated from Neurospora crassa chromatin during exponential growth. Their molecular weights are 14,000 and 8,000, respectively. Fraction C-3 is similar to the histone F2b of calf thymus in molecular weight, amino acid composition, disc gel electrophoretic mobility, and chromatographic behavior on Bio-Gel P-10. Fraction C-4 resembles the other slightly lysine-rich histone F2a2 of calf thymus but the size is much smaller than the histones of higher organisms. N. crassa chromatin contains RNA, histone, and non-histone proteins; the amounts of these components relative to DNA are about 0.14, 0.24, and 0.60 (by weight), respectively. This amount of histone is about one-quarter the amount usually found in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1606277674,"Abstract The molecular weight of the subunit of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase has been investigated by techniques which include sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, sedimentation equilibrium experiments, and the isolation of carboxymethylcysteine-containing tryptic peptides. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments in high concentrations of guanidine, in 0.5 m acetic or propionic acid, yield values of 75,000 to 85,000 for the subunit molecular weight. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis resulted in values usually about 75,000 with the protein migrating as a single band. On the other hand, only eight to nine peptides containing carboxymethylcysteine were isolated from the trypsin digestion mixture, which would indicate a molecular weight of about 42,500 to 47,500. These peptides comprise about 40% of the amino acid residues for this molecular weight. From the data presented here, we have concluded that the subunit molecular weight of phosphofructokinase is 75,000 to 85,000. Not only are these subunits identical, but each subunit seems to consist of 2 similar units. Furthermore, these units appear to be linked in such a way as to be resistant to denaturing conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1489924775,"Abstract NH2-terminal sequences were determined for human plasminogen and the S-carboxymethyl heavy (A) and light (B) chain derivatives of plasmin with a protein sequenator. The NH2-terminal 5 residues of plasminogen and the isolated S-carboxymethyl heavy (A) chain derivative isolated from plasma Fraction III2,3 were determined to be Lys-Val-Tyr-Leu-Leu-. A second identical repeating des-lysyl sequence was found. These sequences were identical for all Fraction III2,3 plasminogen preparations and isolated isoelectric forms, pH values 6.7 and 7.8. Plasma Fraction III contains, in addition to the plasma Fraction III2,3 isoelectric forms, other predominant isoelectric forms; the NH2-terminal 5 residues of Fraction III isolated isoelectric forms, pH values 6.2, 6.4, and 6.6, were determined to be Glu-Pro-Leu-Asp-Asp-. The NH2-terminal 20 residues of the isolated S-carboxymethyl light (B) chain derivative of plasmin isolated from plasma Fraction III2,3 were determined to be Val-Val-Gly-Gly-Gln-Val-Ala-His-Pro-His-Ser-Trp-Pro-Trp-Gln-Val-Val-Leu-Leu-Arg-. This light (B) chain sequence shows extensive homology to the NH2-terminal sequence of other serine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1533830957,"Abstract Utilizing density gradient centrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and equilibrium dialysis, the in vitro binding of [1,2-3H]dihydrotestosterone by cytoplasmic extracts of submandibular glands from normal mice was compared to that of mice carrying the X-linked gene for testicular feminization (Tfm). By these techniques it was shown that supernatant from Tfm animals (Tfm/Y) exhibit greater capacity and higher affinity for androgen binding than does supernatant from normal male mice. Since this high affinity binding was also demonstrable in preparations from heterozygous female (Tfm/X) but not from normal female mice (X/X), the abnormality appeared to be a valid and useful biochemical marker for the Tfm gene. Although the exact genetic mechanism that leads to this phenomenon is not clear, it is possible that the enhanced binding of androgen by submandibular gland cytoplasm may be involved in the pathogenesis of the male pseudohermaphroditism and the androgen resistance in the Tfm mouse."

The reaction required ATP but was independent of either supernatant enzymes or tRNA. A d-aspartic acid-activating enzyme present in the membrane fraction has been solubilized with 2 m LiCl and purified approximately 100-fold. The preparation so obtained catalyzed the formation of equivalent amounts of β-d-aspartylhydroxamate, ADP, and inorganic phosphate in the presence of d-aspartic acid, ATP, and hydroxylamine. The intermediate formed is presumably β-d-aspartylphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1582594334,"Abstract The rutamycin-insensitive ATPase (F1) of yeast mitochondria was found in previous studies to be synthesized on the cytoplasmic ribosomes and to accumulate in the postribosomal supernatant (Tzagoloff, A. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 5027). The enzyme has been purified from the postribosomal fraction of yeast grown in the presence of chloramphenicol and compared with F1 isolated from normal yeast mitochondria. The subunit protein compositions of the two preparations are identical, indicating that all of the component proteins of F1 are products of the cytoribosomal system of protein synthesis. Following removal of chloramphenicol and further incubation of the cells in growth medium (derepression), an increase of the ATPase activity of mitochondria and a loss of F1 activity in the postribosomal supernatant are observed. Evidence is presented indicating that during derepression the postribosomal F1 is incorporated into the larger rutamycin-sensitive ATPase complex of mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1534601411,"Abstract The effect of penicillins and cephalosporins on the various transpeptidation reactions presented in the preceding paper is discussed. Inhibition by cloxacillin and penicillin G of [14C]diaminopimelic acid incorporation during peptidoglycan synthesis appeared to be partially reversible after the antibiotic was destroyed by treatment with penicillinase. Inhibition of the cross-linking reaction by cloxacillin appeared to be fully reversible. These and other results suggested the presence of more than one transpeptidase. In addition, a d-alanine carboxypeptidase activity present in the particulate enzyme preparation was examined and found to be irreversibly inhibited by penicillin G and relatively insensitive to cloxacillin. It is suggested that the transpeptidases(s) and the d-alanine carboxypeptidase are separate enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1571164069,Abstract Adenylate cyclase activity in Neurospora crassa has as substrate the Mn++ATP complex. Plots of enzyme activity against Mn++ATP concentration gave a sigmoid curve. Mn++ activates the cyclase-catalyzed reaction at low but not at high concentrations of Mn++ATP. In the presence of an excess of this cation the response to Mn++ATP is modified to give a michaelian curve. ATP and 5'-AMP are inhibitors of the reaction. The last compound competes with the substrate Mn++ATP.
https://openalex.org/W1569410959,"Abstract When rabbit skeletal myosin, which had incorporated 1.43 moles of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene per 5 x 105 g of protein, was treated with 0.05 m 2-mercaptoethanol at pH 8.5, complete restoration of the K+(EDTA)- and Ca2+-ATPase activities occurred. Concomitantly, 0.73 mole of the dinitrophenyl group was removed. This was established from incorporation data and difference spectra obtained for dinitrophenylated myosin treated with and without 2-mercaptoethanol. The effect of 2-mercaptoethanol was specific for the removal of the dinitrophenyl group. Results from the S-carboxymethylation of dinitrophenylated myosin treated with and without 2-mercaptoethanol showed that only one sulfhydryl group was involved, thus ruling out the possibility of nonspecific disulfide bond formation during the initial fluorodinitrobenzene reaction. From time course studies it appeared that the dinitrophenyl group had been removed from cysteine (and possibly tyrosine) during the restoration of the enzymic activity in myosin. Sephadex cation exchange chromatography of tryptic peptic digests of dinitrophenylated myosin (with or without 2-mercaptoethanol) yielded 10 labeled peptides. Two major peptide fractions (A and B) were isolated from dinitrophenylated myosin labeled with tritium and they were homogeneous by the criterion of radioactivity. These peptide fractions contained only S-dinitrophenylcysteine. Peptide A and its counterpart peptide MA (obtained from dinitrophenylated myosin treated with 2-mercaptoethanol) were heterogeneous as judged by amino acid analysis; however, their arginine content was stoichiometric with their S-dinitrophenylcysteine content. Peptide B and its counterpart peptide MB (obtained from dinitrophenylated myosin treated with 2-mercaptoethanol) were homogeneous according to amino acid analysis and had the composition Ile, Cys, Arg. From these data it appears that dinitrophenylation of myosin has a specificity for the rapidly reacting sulfhydryl group(s) in this protein."
https://openalex.org/W82877519,"An enzyme preparation catalyzing the 2′-hydroxylation of thymidine was prepared from mycelial extracts of Neurospora crassa strain STA 4 (FGSC 262A) by chromatography on hydroxylapatite and DEAE-Sephadex A-50. The enzyme had an isoelectric point of 4.6 and a molecular weight of 47,000 (determined by gel filtration). The reaction product was identical with thymine riboside on ion exchange and thin layer chromatography. Paper chromatography after reduction and hydrolysis showed that the pentose moiety in the product was ribose. Of the pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides tested as substrates, only those with oxygen at carbon atoms 2 and 4 were active, i.e. deoxyuridine, thymidine, 5-hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine, 5-bromodeoxyuridine, and 6-azathymidine. Thymidylate was attacked only slowly. Purine deoxyribonucleosides, deoxyribose, and 1-ethyluracil were not substrates. No evidence for control by nucleotides was obtained. The enzyme had an absolute requirement for ferrous ion and 2-ketoglutarate, and ascorbate and catalase were stimulatory. 2-Ketoglutarate was oxidatively decarboxylated during the reaction. Together with the previously demonstrated oxygen requirement (S haffer , P. M., M c C roskey , R. P., P almatier , R. D., M idgett , R. J., and A bbott , M.T. (1968) Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W1602251012,"Abstract The influence of work-induced hypertrophy on the myosin of skeletal muscle was studied. Unilateral tenotomy of the gastrocnemius muscle (single tenotomy procedure) in normal rats led to rapid compensatory growth of the synergistic plantaris and soleus muscles. Total myosin increased with hypertrophy. The myosin from these hypertrophied muscles, however, was enzymatically and structurally identical to the myosin from the contralateral limb muscles. Tenotomy of the plantaris in addition to the gastrocnemius (double tenotomy procedure) caused more rapid hypertrophy of the soleus than that observed with the single tenotomy procedure. The specific activity of the myosin ATPase from these hypertrophied soleus muscles was 11% lower (p l 0.05) than that of the myosin from the controls. However, the alkali stability of the ATPase activity and the light chain content of the myosin from the control and hypertrophied soleus muscles were identical. Thus, only the specific activity of the myosin ATPase accumulated in the soleus muscle during work-induced growth appears to depend on the rate of muscle hypertrophy. Preliminary studies on adult soleus, plantaris, and newborn rat muscle myosin showed that the decrease in specific activity of the hypertrophied soleus myosin ATPase cannot be explained by the selective accumulation of fast muscle or fetal muscle myosin."
https://openalex.org/W2116489549,"Abstract Maximal activation of a Na+-dependent adenosine diphosphate-adenosine triphosphate exchange reaction mediated by kidney microsomes was achieved at 0.1 mm and 0.4 mm Mg++ in the presence of 1.5 mm and 32 mm Na+, respectively. K+ inhibited the Na+-dependent exchange rate when lower concentrations of Na+ and Mg++ were used and stimulated it in the presence of 0.4 mm Mg++ and 32 mm Na+. The inhibitory effect of K+ could be reversed either by increasing the Na+ concentration or decreasing that of K+. N-Ethyl-maleimide treatment of microsomes abolished the stimulatory effect of K+. Ouabain, alkaline pH, and lower temperatures less effectively decreased stimulation of Na+-dependent exchange by K+. Mg++ and K+ appeared to exhibit competitive antagonism on (Na+ + K+)-sensitive transphosphorylation activity. It is proposed that the stimulation of Na+-dependent adenosine diphosphate-adenosine triphosphate exchange reaction by K+ may be mediated, in part, by slowing the conversion of one form of the phosphoenzyme E1-P into another E2-P."
https://openalex.org/W1499424295,"Abstract The regulation of the synthesis of messenger RNA of T4 phage-specific deoxynucleotide kinase has been studied in vivo by assay of mRNA for its capacity to direct the synthesis of deoxynucleotide kinase in vitro. The deoxynucleotide kinase mRNA first appears at 2 min after infection and increases in amount until 8 min. Thereafter the messenger activity decreases. The appearance of deoxynucleotide kinase mRNA is blocked when chloramphenicol is added before or immediately after infection. When added at 8 min the normal levels of kinase mRNA were observed at times later in the infection period. However, the addition of chloramphenicol at 3 min after infection results in the production of an exaggerated amount of deoxynucleotide kinase mRNA, which keeps increasing until at least 30 min after infection. The high level of mRNA formed in the presence of chloramphenicol could reflect the absence of an agent or agents required for the termination of the synthesis of this mRNA. This conclusion was reached from experiments with the inhibitor of RNA synthesis, rifampicin. When added to cultures at a time late in the infection period, rifampicin caused an immediate drop in the level of kinase mRNA. At this time the level of this mRNA is therefore a balance between synthesis and degradation. When similar experiments were carried out to study the level of mRNA for α-glucosyltransferase, cultures receiving chloramphenicol at 3 min after infection and rifampicin at 11 and 17 min did not show a drop in the level of mRNA for this enzyme. There is thus a difference in the stability of the two types of mRNA in regard to their degradation by bacterial nucleases when the infection was carried out with chloramphenicol added at 3 min. In the absence of chloramphenicol both kinds of mRNA underwent degradation. The overproduction and the delay of shutoff of the synthesis of deoxynucleotide kinase mRNA are also seen when nonpermissive Escherichia coli K-12 is infected with T4 DO mutants or when DNA synthesis is inhibited by fluorodeoxyuridine. The infection with an MD mutant does not result in the same effect as that observed with the DO mutants. We favor the hypothesis that both new T4 protein (or proteins) and continuous T4 DNA replication are necessary for the proper termination of synthesis of delayed-early T4 RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1579875374,"Abstract This paper reports observations made of the events which occur when two apparently enzymatically inactive proteins, streptokinase and plasminogen, interact in the correct ratio to form a complex which is an activator of plasminogen. The unique physical and functional properties of this plasminogen activator complex were demonstrated by: (a) observation of the complex in polyacrylamide gel systems and (b) by its capacity to convert bovine or guinea pig plasminogen to plasmin. When the complex was dissociated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel system, two components having physical properties similar to those of the original inactive components were recovered. However, following dissociation, the component which was similar to plasminogen had plasmin activity, and the component which was similar to streptokinase had bovine plasminogen activator activity. The completeness of the separation of the two components was examined revealing that approximately 1 mole of streptokinase contaminated every 1600 moles of the dissociated plasmin component and 1 mole of plasmin contaminated every 1000 moles of the dissociated streptokinase component. The activator activity of the dissociated streptokinase component decreased less than 10% upon a reduction of the plasmin contaminant by 97%. It was therefore concluded that the dissociated streptokinase component bore the site for bovine plasminogen activator activity. Studies of the dissociated streptokinase component indicated that there was no demonstrable change in molecular weight. From these data and the demonstration that the dissociated streptokinase activated human plasminogen as well as bovine plasminogen, a model describing the mechanism of streptokinase activation of human plasminogen was constructed. In this model streptokinase interacts with the plasmin contaminating human plasminogen to form a modified streptokinase which in turn acts on human plasminogen in a positive feedback."
https://openalex.org/W1580270922,"Abstract The components in trp 1 and trp 2 mutants of Neurospora crassa which interact in vitro to form an active anthranilate synthetase complex have been purified. The isolated components and the complexes formed by their interaction were characterized enzymatically, and their molecular weights were estimated by gel filtration on Sephadex. The trp 2 gene product (Component I) catalyzed the anthranilate synthetase reaction only with ammonia as the amino donor and had an estimated molecular weight of 80,000. The trp 1 gene product (Component II) occurred as an undissociated or a dissociated form. The undissociated form interacted with Component I to produce glutamine-dependent anthranilate synthetase and had an estimated molecular weight of 200,000. It dissociated to a 30,000 molecular weight subunit (Component IIa) which also interacted with the Component I to produce glutamine-linked anthranilate synthetase and a 160,000 molecular weight subunit (Component IIb) which possessed both N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate isomerase and indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthetase activities, but did not interact with Component I. Component I interacted with Component II to form a complex with an estimated molecular weight of 300,000 which possessed glutamine-linked anthranilate synthetase, N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate isomerase, and indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthetase activities. Component I interacted with Component IIa to produce a complex which possessed only anthranilate synthetase activity. In contrast to the Component I-Component II complex, the latter complex completely dissociated on Sephadex G-200, but could be stabilized on sucrose gradients as a 6.4 S component."

The optimum pH of the purified nicotinamide deamidase is 6.5, and the Km value for nicotinamide is 0.2 µm. The molecular weight was estimated by means of gel filtration to be 48,000. The enzyme activity of the crude preparation was increased by 2.5-fold by addition of Mn2+ at a concentration of 10 mm followed by incubation at 37° for 30 min. The purified enzyme preparation was inactivated by dialysis in the absence of Mn2+ and no recovery of enzyme activity was possible even when Mn2+ or Mn2+ plus cysteine was added to the reaction mixture. When the enzyme was dialyzed overnight in the presence of Mn2+, almost all of the enzyme activity was retained. A dialysis of the enzyme against 0.01 m maleate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 5 µm HgCl2 resulted in complete retention of enzyme activity when 50 mm cysteine was added to the reaction mixture. CuSO4 and SnCl2 also showed effects similar to that of HgCl2, but their potency for enzyme stability was small. Mg2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Fe2+ did not show any effect on enzyme activity. All the nicotinamide analogues having a trivalent nitrogen in the pyridine ring showed a competitive inhibition of nicotinamide deamidation, whereas compounds having a tetravalent nitrogen seemed to have no effect.

The fraction precipitating between 38 and 52% ethanol contained 47.5% l-fucose and 3.2% galactose residues, 27% sulfate groups, 1.2% nitrogen, and 6.5% of firmly bound, alkali-stable peptide. Thyonatan 4-sulfate showed [α]d20 - 155° (in water), an intrinsic viscosity of 0.6 dl g-1, and it absorbed strongly at 825 cm-1. It was homogeneous on cellulose acetate electrophoresis and stained metachromatically with toluidine blue. It was polydisperse on gel filtration on P-100 and P-200 resins and its molecular weight was estimated to be between 20,000 and 60,000. Strong acid hydrolysis of thyonatan 4-sulfate gave l-fucose, characterized as the 1-methyl-1-phenylhydrazone. Mild acid hydrolysis gave l-fucose 4-sulfate, isolated after partial acid hydrolysis (0.15 n H2SO4, 100°, 1 hour) by ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and preparative paper chromatography. l-erythro-Butan-1,2,3-triol was obtained in 56% yield from l-fucose 4-sulfate after periodate oxidation and sodium borohydride reduction, establishing the position of the sulfate group at carbon 4. Exhaustive methylation of the polysaccharide with dimethyl sulfate and NaOH yielded 3-O-methyl-l-fucose and 2-O-methyl-l-fucose in the ratio of 3:1. The above data suggest that the predominant structure for this polysaccharide is (1 → 2)-α-l-fucopyranan 4-sulfate."

https://openalex.org/W1510702092,"Abstract Since Phe-tRNA synthetase of Neurospora crassa reacts with tRNAval of Escherichia coli to produce Phe-tRNAval, the parameters that effect the reverse reaction were examined. Similarly, the interaction of Val-tRNA synthetase (E. coli) with Phe-tRNAval and Val-tRNAval (E. coli) was studied. Phe-tRNA synthetase (N. crassa) can catalyze the deacylation of both Phe-tRNAval (E. coli) and Val-tRNAval (E. coli), although the mechanism of deacylation is different in the two cases since the presence of AMP and PPi is required only for the former. In contrast, Val-tRNA synthetase (E. coli) can deacylate Val-tRNAval but not Phe-tRNAval. Val-tRNA synthetase may actually inhibit the nonenzymatic deacylation of Phe-tRNAval. Unfractionated tRNA (N. crassa) markedly inhibits the aminoacylation of tRNAval (E. coli) catalyzed by Phe-tRNA synthetase (N. crassa). The inhibition appears to result from a competition between tRNA (N. crassa) and tRNAval (E. coli) for binding site (or sites) on Phe-tRNA synthetase."
